speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: My name is H. I. McDunnough...
speaker_heading: A WALL
text: With horizontal hatch lines.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Call me Hi.
text: A disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt is
text: launched into frame by someone offscreen.
text: He holds a printed paddle that reads "NO. 1468-6 NOV. 29
dialog: 79."
text: The hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...The first time I met Ed was in
dialog: the county lock-up in Tempe,
dialog: Arizona...
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: As his picture is taken.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: On the paddle: "NOV. 29 79."
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...a day I'll never forget.
text: A bellowing male voice from offscreen:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Don't forget the profile, Ed!
text: ANGLE ON THE STILL CAMERA
text: It is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe
text: police uniform peers out from behind it.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Turn to the right.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: What kind of name is Ed for a pretty
dialog: thing like you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Short for Edwinna. Turn to the right!
text: HI obliges, but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You're a flower, you are. Just a
dialog: little desert flower.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: On his eye-skewed profile.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Lemme know how those come out.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR
text: As Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell.
text: At the far end of the corridor a huge con is sluggishly
text: mopping the floor.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I was in for writing hot checks which,
dialog: when businessmen do it, is called an
dialog: overdraft. I'm not complainin', mind
dialog: you; just sayin' there ain't no
dialog: pancake so thin it ain't got two

dialog: structured - more than most people
dialog: care for...
scene_heading: INTERCUTTING
text: HI'S POV of the MOPPING CON, tracking as he approaches, and
text: the Mopping Con's POV of Hi as Hi approaches.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: ...But there's a spirit of camaraderie
dialog: that exists between the men, like
dialog: you find only in combat maybe...
text: The Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes:
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Grrrr...
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...or on a pro ball club in the heat
text: of a pennant drive.
scene_heading: NEWSREEL FOOTAGE
text: A ballplayer connects - THWOCK - for a home run and the crowd
text: roars.
speaker_heading: PRISON HALL
text: Panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding
text: chairs. The pan starts on Hi.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: In an effort to better ourselves we
dialog: were forced to meet with a counselor
dialog: who tried to help us figure out why
dialog: we were the way we were...
text: At this point the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest,
text: bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his
text: arms folded over its back.
text: He is addressing one of the Cons:
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR
dialog: Why do you use the word "trapped"?
scene_heading: CLOSEUP BLACK CON
text: The huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting
text: his brow in consternation.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR
dialog: Why do you say you feel "trapped" in
dialog: a man's body?
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Oh...
text: He bites his lip, thinking; then, in a resonant bass voice:
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: ...Well, sometimes I get the menstrual
dialog: cramps real hard.
scene_heading: PAROLE MEETING ROOM
text: Three PAROLE OFFICERS - two men and a woman - face Hi across
text: a table.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Have you learned anything, Hi?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Yessir, you bet.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You wouldn't lie to us, would you
dialog: Hi?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: No ma'am, hope to say.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN

scene_heading: EXT. 7-ELEVEN NIGHT
text: A beat-up Chevy pulls into the all-night store's empty parking

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: I tried to stand up and fly straight,

dialog: Reagan in the White House...
text: Hi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding
text: a pump-action shotgun.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I dunno, they say he's a decent
dialog: man, so...
text: He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...maybe his advisers are confused.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: Full-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Turn to the right!
text: Hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is
text: obviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the
text: camera.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: What's the matter, Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: My fai-ants left me.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: She said her fianc√©e had run off
text: with a student cosmetologist who
dialog: knew how to ply her feminine wiles.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: On Hi's profile. He turns back to Ed.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: That sumbitch.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (O.S.)
dialog: Don't forget his phone call, Ed!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You tell him I think he's a damn
dialog: fool, Ed. You tell him I said so -
text: H.I. McDunnough. And if he wants to
dialog: discuss it he knows where to find
dialog: me...
text: As another police officer starts to lead him away:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...in the Maricopa County Maximum
dialog: Security Correctional Facility for
dialog: Men...
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ED
text: Looking up through her tears as Hi is led away.
speaker_heading: HI (O.S.)
dialog: ...State Farm Road Number Thirty-
dialog: one; Tempe, Arizona...
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: Struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly

speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...I'll be waiting!
text: The door slams.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR
text: As Hi is once again escorted toward his cell.
text: The Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked
text: his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I can't say I was happy to be back
text: inside, but the flood of familiar
text: sights, sounds and faces almost made
text: it feel like a homecoming.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MOPPING CON
text: As Hi passes.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Grrrr...
speaker_heading: PRISON HALL
text: Group is meeting again.
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR
dialog: Most men your age, Hi, are getting
text: married and raising up a family.
dialog: They wouldn't accept prison as a
dialog: substitute.
text: Hi looks sheepish.
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR
dialog: ...Would any of you men care to
dialog: comment?
text: Two convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE,
text: appear to be friends.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: But sometimes your career gotta come
dialog: before family.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Work is what's kept us happy.
scene_heading: ANGRY BLACK CON
dialog: Yeah, but Doc Schwartz is sayin' you
dialog: gotta accept responsibilities. I
dialog: mean I'm proud to say I got a
dialog: family... somewheres.
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE CELL
text: Looking down from the ceiling. In the foreground, lying on
text: the top bunk, hands clasped behind his head as he stares off
text: into space is MOSES. Moses is a gnarled, elderly black con
text: with wire-rimmed spectacles. On the lower bunk, also with
text: hands clasped behind his head and staring off at the same
dialog: spot in space, is Hi.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I tried to sort through what the Doc
dialog: had said, but prison ain't the easiest
dialog: place to think.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: An' when they was no meat we ate
dialog: fowl. An' when they was no fowl we
dialog: ate crawdad. An' when they was no
dialog: crawdad to be foun', we ate San'.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You ate what?
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: We ate San'.
speaker_heading: HI

speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
text: These doors goan swing wide.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I didn't want to hurt anyone, Sir.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Hi, we respect that.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: But you're just hurtin' yourself
text: with this rambunctious behavior.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I know that, sir.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Okay then.
speaker_heading: HIGH SHOT
text: Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for
text: Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Now I don't know how you come down
dialog: on the incarceration question...
text: Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...whether it's for rehabilitation
dialog: or revenge.
text: He spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the
text: back door. Locked.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...But I was beginning to think...
text: As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on
text: the heel and toe.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...that revenge is the only argument
dialog: makes any sense.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: On Hi against the mug-shot wall.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Turn to the right!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (O.S.)
dialog: Don't forget his latents, Ed!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HI'S HAND
text: We see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's
text: two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the
text: appropriate space on an exemplar sheet.
speaker_heading: HI (O.S.)
dialog: Hear about the paddy-wagon collided
dialog: with the segment mixer, Ed? Twelve
dialog: hardened criminals escaped.
text: Ed's hand lingers on top of his. Hi's other hand enters to
text: rest on top of hers.
speaker_heading: HI (O.S.)
dialog: Got a new beau?
speaker_heading: ED (O.S.)
dialog: No, Hi, I sure don't.
text: Hi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's.
speaker_heading: HI (O.S.)
dialog: Don't worry, I paid for it.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR
text: The surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the
text: foreground.
text: Hi is being escorted past him to his cell.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: They say that absence makes the heart
dialog: grow fonder, and for once they may
dialog: be right.
text: Halfway up the corridor Hi points casually at the floor.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You missed a spot.
text: The Mopping Con turns to watch him recede.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Grrrr...
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE CELL
text: Same high shot with Moses on the top bunk, Hi on the lower.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: More and more my thoughts turned to
dialog: Ed, and I finally felt the pain of
dialog: imprisonment.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: An' momma would frow the live crawdad
dialog: in a pot of boiln' water. Well one
dialog: day I decided to make my own
dialog: crawdad...
text: We begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...an' I frew it in a pot, forgettin'
dialog: to put in the water, ya see...
text: Moses' voice is mixing down as we lose him from frame.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and it was like I was makin'
dialog: popcorn, ya see... The joint is a
text: lonely place after lock-up and fights
dialog: out...
text: We are now very close on Hi, staring.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...when the last of the cons has
text: been swept away by the sandman.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: The underside of the top bunk.
text: A sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of Ed,
text: smiling behind her camera, softly supered on the underside
text: of the bunk.
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: He wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: But I couldn't help thinking that a
dialog: brighter future lay ahead - a future
dialog: that was only eight to fourteen months
dialog: away.
text: Eyes closed, he is illuminated by a flash.
scene_heading: PAROLE BOARD ROOM
text: Hi and the same three officers.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Got a name for people like you, Hi.
dialog: That name is called recidivism.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Ree-peat O-fender.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: No Sir, it sure ain't. That's one
dialog: bonehead name. But that ain't me
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: You're not just tellin' us what we
dialog: wanna hear?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: No Sir, no way.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: 'Cause we just wanna hear the truth.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well then I guess I am tellin' you
dialog: what you wanna hear.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Boy, didn't we just tell you not to
dialog: do that?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: CHAIRMAN
dialog: Okay then.
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: Over Hi's shoulder as he strides toward a door marked
text: "Processing" and flings it open.
text: It is the familiar booking room. Ed looks up from her camera,
text: having just snapped a picture of another suspect against the
text: hatched wall.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I'm walkin' in here on my knees, Ed -
dialog: a free man proposin'.
text: Hi cocks a finger at the suspect.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Howdy Kurt.
speaker_heading: ED'S ROOM
text: As she nervously frets at her white bridal gown in front of

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: And so it was.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (O.S.)
dialog: Don't forget the boo-kay, Ed!
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT ED
text: Gazing earnestly into the camera. A congregation is seated
text: behind her - the bride's side wearing police blues; the
text: groom's side, Hawaiian shirts.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT HI
text: Also staring into the camera.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You bet I do.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Over their shoulders, the minister.
speaker_heading: MINISTER

scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP
text: Hi is working the drill press, wearing goggles and sweat-
text: stained overalls.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and I got a job drilling holes in
text: sheet metal.
text: Next to him idly stands Bud, a veteran of the shop, with a
text: grimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: So we was doin' paramedical work in
dialog: affiliation with the state highway
dialog: system-not actually practicin',

dialog: patrollin' down Nine Mile -
speaker_heading: HI

speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: (barking)
dialog: No, not that motherscratcher! Bill
dialog: Parker! Anyway, we're approachin'
text: the wreck, and there's a spherical

text: He pauses to blow and pop a bubble with his chewing gum.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: ...And it don't look like a piece a
text: the car.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Mostways the job was a lot like
dialog: prison, except Ed was waitin' at the
dialog: end of every day...
scene_heading: CASHIER'S WINDOW
text: Hi is scowling at his paycheck. Behind the barred window a
text: fat cashier grins.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and a paycheck at the end of every
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Gummint do take a bite, don't she?
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER
text: Hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer. Ed sits on
text: his lap, his arms around her. Both are wearing sunglasses,
text: looking at the setting sun. The scene is suffused with a
text: warm yellow light.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: These were the happy days, the salad
dialog: days as they say...
text: As the sun sets, the light is turning from yellow to amber.
text: Hi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward
dialog: arc.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and Ed felt that having a critter
dialog: was the next logical step. It was
dialog: all she thought about.
text: The amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the
text: sun has set. Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where
dialog: it disappeared.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Her point was that there was too
dialog: much love and beauty for just the
dialog: two of us...
text: The dusk is slipping away into darkness.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and every day we kept a child out
dialog: of the world was a day he might later
dialog: regret having missed.
text: We are by now holding on pitch black. Crickets chirp. From
dialog: the darkness:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That was beautiful.
speaker_heading: A CALENDAR
text: Ed is crossing off the last day on the calendar before a day
text: circled in red.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: So we worked at it on the days we
dialog: calculated most likely to be
dialog: fruitful...
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER
text: Hi is wearily entering after a long day at work, clutching
text: his lunchpail.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and we worked at it most other
dialog: days just to be sure.
text: Ed flies into frame and leaps into his arms, covering him
text: with kisses.
scene_heading: TRAILER BEDROOM
text: In each other's arms, Hi and Ed roll over on the bed.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Seemed like nothing could stand in
dialog: our way now...
text: We pan with them rolling and continue off them to the night
text: table, on which sits a framed pair of photographs of Hi,
text: probably taken by Ed: One shows him full face, the other in
dialog: profile.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER TWILIGHT
text: Ed sits in a lawn chair knitting a booty. Hi stands in Bermuda
text: shorts and an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt, hosing down the
text: minuscule patch of front lawn.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...My lawless years were behind me;
dialog: our child rearin' years lay ahead.
text: DUSTY ROAD LEADING UP TO TRAILER DAY
text: A squad car, its siren wailing, kicks up dust as it roars
text: into the foreground.
scene_heading: ADOPTION OFFICE
text: Hi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agent's
text: desk. Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt. Ed is
text: in her dress blues.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: It's true I've had a checkered past,
dialog: but Ed here is an officer of the law
dialog: twice decorated...
speaker_heading: THE AGENT
text: Looking, with a dead pan, from the file to Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...So we figure it kind of evens
dialog: out.
text: His face still deadly neutral, the agent looks back down at
text: the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it
text: to be a couple feet long.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...But biology and the prejudices of
dialog: others conspired to keep us childless.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR
text: On Ed as she stares vacantly out the passenger window.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Our love for each other was stronger
dialog: than ever...
speaker_heading: ON HI
text: Driving. He looks from Ed out to the road.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...but I preminisced no return of
dialog: the salad days.
scene_heading: TRAILER BATHROOM
text: Over Hi's shoulder as he stares listlessly at himself in the
text: mirror, a razor held forgotten in one hand, his face half
text: lathered and half shaved.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: The pizazz had gone out of our lives.
scene_heading: TRAILER BEDROOM
text: The bedroom is somewhat messy. Ed sits on the edge of the
text: bed, also staring listlessly. Her police uniform is on but
text: not yet buttoned. Her hands lie palm-up in her lap, like two
text: dead fish.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Ed lost all interest in both criminal
text: justice and housekeeping. Soon after,
text: she tendered her badge.
scene_heading: MACHINE SHOP
text: Once again Hi works as his sweaty gum-chewing colleague stands
text: idly by.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Even my job seemed as dry and bitter
text: as a hot prairie wind.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: So here comes Bill a-walkin' down
dialog: Nine Mile - that's Bill Parker,
dialog: y'understand - got his sandwich in

scene_heading: HIS MOVING POV

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...that weren't on the way home.
scene_heading: TRAILER LIVING ROOM
text: Hi and Ed sit listlessly watching TV.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Then one day the biggest news hit
dialog: the state since they built the Hoover
dialog: Dam...
text: Ed perks up, reacting to something on TV. Hi notices her
text: reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...The Arizona quints was born.
speaker_heading: THE TV
text: A newscaster silently reading copy. Behind him news footage
text: of five nurses holding infants mortices in.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: By "Arizona" quints I mean they was
dialog: born to a woman named Florence
dialog: Arizona.
text: BACK TO HI AND ED
text: Watching intently. Eyes still locked on the set, Ed reaches
text: her hand out to Hi. Eyes still locked on the set, Hi takes
text: her hand in his.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: As you probably guessed, Florence
text: Arizona is the wife of Nathan Arizona.
dialog: And Nathan Arizona - well hell, you
dialog: know who he is...
scene_heading: THE TV A LATE-NIGHT LOCAL COMMERCIAL
text: NATHAN ARIZONA, a stocky middle-aged man in a white polyester
text: suit, is gesturing expansively with his white cowboy hat
text: toward a one-story warehouse store with a football stadium

speaker_heading: NATHAN ARIZONA
dialog: (mixing up on the TV)
dialog: So come on down to Unpainted Arizona

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER

scene_heading: LINE OF NEWSPAPER VENDING MACHINES
text: Hi lounges near one of the vending machines as a businessman
text: puts in a quarter.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Yep, Florence had been taking
dialog: fertility pills, and she and Nathan
text: had hit the jackpot.
text: The businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine
text: door as he turns to leave.
text: Hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five-
dialog: finger discount copy.
text: He flips the paper over to look at the headline.
scene_heading: FRONT PAGE OF NEWSPAPER
text: The banner headline of the Tempe Intelligencer is:
text: "ARIZONA QUINTS GO HOME!"
text: The subhead: "More Than We Can Handle,' Laughs Dad." Next to
text: it is a picture of Nathan.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Now y'all who're without sin can
dialog: cast the first stone...
text: A pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together
text: at home. They look from the paper to each other.
text: Hi opens to an inside page and we pan a row of pictures -
text: the five tots with their names underneath: "HARRY, BARRY,
scene_heading: LARRY, GARRY and NATHAN JR."
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...but we thought it was unfair that
dialog: some should have so many while others

speaker_heading: BILLBOARD
text: In the middle of the desert. It reads: "WELCOME TO TEMPE!
scene_heading: POPULATION 13,948... PLUS FIVE!"
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER TWILIGHT
text: We are floating in toward Ed who is seated, waiting, in the
text: driver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters frame and cinches
text: down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car. Pieces of
text: red flag flutter at either end of the ladder where it sticks
text: out beyond the car.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: With the benefit of hindsight maybe
dialog: it wasn't such a hot idea...
text: Hi gets in the car.
text: FROM BEHIND THE CHEVY
text: It starts down the long, winding road leading away from the
text: trailer, kicking up dust.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...but at the time, Ed's little plan
dialog: seemed like the solution to all our
dialog: problems, and the answer to all our
dialog: prayers.
text: The title of the film burns in: "RAISING ARIZONA". A building
text: chord snaps off in a shock cut to:
scene_heading: SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM EVENING
text: Tableau of a couple at home. Nathan Arizona is on the
text: telephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman. Florence sits
text: reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care.
text: The living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Eight hundred leaf tables and no
dialog: chairs?! You can't sell leaf tables
dialog: and no chairs! Chairs, you got a

dialog: I ask my wife she got more sense!...
text: TITLE IS SUPERED:
text: "THE ARIZONA HOUSEHOLD"
text: From somewhere upstairs we hear an infant start to cry.

text: is oblivious.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Miles, all I know is I'm away
dialog: from the office to have me some kids
dialog: and everything goes straight to heck!
dialog: I ain't gonna stand for it!
text: Another title is supered below the first: "SEPTEMBER 17,
text: 1985". The baby stops crying and Florence's attention returns
dialog: to her book.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Yeah, and if a frog had wings he
dialog: wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I'm

text: As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title
text: is supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...8:45 in the p.m. I'm gonna be
dialog: down to the store in exactly twelve
dialog: hours to kick me some butt!
text: He starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an
dialog: afterthought:
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!
text: As he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear.
text: Another baby starts crying. Florence looks up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: That sounds like Larry.
text: Close on the crying baby as Hi bounces it, gently but
text: desperately.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Shhhh! Shh! Nice baby...
text: He starts to lower it back into the crib. The crib is
text: unpainted with the name of each baby burned Bonanza-style
text: into the headboard: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan
text: Jr. Instead of quieting as he is lowered into the crib, the
text: squalling baby only sets off one of his brothers. Hi hurriedly
text: lifts him back out.
text: He looks desperately around the room.
text: The room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters.
text: There are toys strewn around. There is one adult-sized easy
text: chair in the corner.
text: Hi carries the baby over to the chair, stepping on and
text: reacting to the squeal of a squeeze-me toy on the way. He
text: sits the baby deep in - the chair and then returns to the
text: crib to deal with the second crying baby.
text: He lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it.
text: This baby stops crying.
text: Another one in the crib starts bawling.
text: Hi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a
text: rattle to keep it pacified. He reaches for the third baby in
text: the crib. Sweat stands out on Hi 's brow. He is desperately
text: chucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffled
speaker_heading: PTHUMP!
text: He whirls to look across the darkened room.
text: The first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is
text: energetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Nathan and Florence are sitting stock-still, staring at the
text: ceiling. After a moment, another baby starts crying.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: What're they, playing telephone?
text: They stare at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: NURSERY
text: Loose babies are crawling everywhere. Hi is skittering across
text: the room in a half-crouch, a baby tucked under one arm,
text: reaching out with the other as he pursues a crawling baby
text: across the room.
text: He hefts the other baby with his free arm and brings the air
text: back to the crib.
text: He turns to look frantically around the room.
text: The other three babies have disappeared.
text: There is perfect quiet.
text: Hi goes over to the closet door, which is ajar, and swings
text: it open.
text: He reaches under a moving pile of clothes on the floor and
text: pulls out a baby.
text: He returns it to the crib and freezes, listening.
text: The sound of a rattle.
text: He drops to the floor to look under the crib.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE UNDER CRIB
text: A baby holding a rattle leers into the camera in the
text: foreground. Behind him Hi, on his stomach, is reaching in to
text: grab at his leg.
text: Hi is pulling the baby out, away from the camera, when with
text: a plop! a baby drops onto Hi 's back from the crib above.
text: Hi twists one arm back to grope for the baby crawling on top
dialog: of him.
text: He is straightening up, a baby in each arm, when he reacts
text: in horror to something he sees across the room.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: The hindquarters of a diapered baby are just disappearing
text: around the corner of the nursery door into the hallway.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Florence and Nathan are staring at the ceiling. After a beat
text: we hear a muffled plop! on the ceiling. A beat later, the
text: bleat of the squeeze-me toy.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Whyn't you go up and check on
dialog: 'em?
text: They sound restless.
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: The floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward
text: the camera in the foreground. Behind him, in the background,
text: just rounding the open door from the nursery, yet another
text: baby is making a mad dash for freedom.
text: Hi emerges from the nursery and, stepping around the
text: background baby, trots toward the baby in the foreground. By
text: the time he reaches it the low-angle cropping shows us only
text: his feet and calves.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON HI
text: Perspiring as he tiptoes the last two steps to the baby.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: The baby and, beyond it, the stairway down to the main floor.
text: We hear footsteps approaching.
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: He scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the
dialog: nursery.
scene_heading: LOW-ANGLE REVERSE
text: The baby at the nursery door in the foreground; the staircase
text: in the background. As Hi reaches the baby we hear footsteps
text: climbing the stairs.
text: Hi's free arm comes down into frame to scoop the baby up and
text: out of frame just as:
text: Florence's head appears, bobbing up as she climbs the stairs.
text: She approaches the nursery, still clutching the Dr. Spock
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: NURSERY
text: As Florence enters from the hallway door.
text: We track back into the room, on her, as she approaches the
text: crib. Halfway there she freezes, staring, in shock.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: All of the babies have been replaced in the crib but not
text: lying down: They are seated in a row, staring back at her,
text: lined up against the far crib railing, like a small but
dialog: distinguished panel on "Meet the Press."
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE CHEVY
text: ED'S POV of Hi approaching the car. He is shrugging and
text: displaying a pair of manifestly empty hands.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ED
text: Barely able to fight down her anger. Hissing:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What's the matter?!
text: Hi appears at her - the driver's-window.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Sorry honey, it just didn't work
dialog: out.
text: He is reaching to open the door but she slaps his hand away
text: from the handle.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What d'you mean it didn't work out?!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: They started cryin', then they were
dialog: all over me...
text: He is trying to open the door, which Ed is holding shut with
dialog: all her might.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...It was kinda horrifying - Lemme
dialog: in, honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Course they cried! Babies cry!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I know that now! Come on honey, we
dialog: better leave -
text: Ed is rolling up the window and locking the door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You go right back up there and get
dialog: me a toddler! I need a baby, Hi;
dialog: they got more'n they can handle!
text: Muffled, through the closed window, and very forlorn:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Aw honey I -
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't you come back here without a
dialog: baby!
speaker_heading: NURSERY
text: Florence is holding one of the babies cradled against her
text: shoulder. She is facing the hallway door; her back is to the
text: crib and window. The baby, peeping out over her shoulder, is
text: facing the window.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON BABY
dialog: Looking.
speaker_heading: BABY'S POV
text: Of the window, as Hi's head appears in it.
speaker_heading: BABY
dialog: Looking.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Looking back, he holds a finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: BABY
text: Florence starts bouncing it, patting it on the back.
speaker_heading: BABY'S POV
text: Hi and the window bouncing up and down.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Nathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper.
text: We can hear Florence's returning footsteps. Muttering:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Christian Dior my butt...
text: Florence enters.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...They pay money for that?
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Yes dear.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: How're the kids?
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Fine dear.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Fuckin' kids, I love 'em.
text: We hear the bleat of the squeeze-me toy. Florence and Nathan
text: look at the ceiling for a beat, then Nathan clears his throat
text: and returns to the newspaper.
speaker_heading: CHEVY
text: Ed sits anxiously waiting in the driver's seat, peering
text: intently through the windshield. As she catches sight of
text: something she breaks into a broad smile, unlocks the door,
text: and slides over to the passenger seat.
text: Hi is opening the door with one hand, cradling a baby in the
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Which one ya get?
text: As he gets into the driver's seat:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I dunno. Nathan Jr., I think.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Gimme here.
text: He hands her the infant, then hands her the copy of Dr.Spock's
dialog: Baby and Child Care.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Here's the instructions.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, he's beautiful!
text: Hi nods as he pulls away from the curb.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: He's awful damn good. I think I got
dialog: the best one.
text: Ed is gushing and kissing the baby through the rest of the
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I bet they were all beautiful. All
dialog: babies are beautiful!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Yeah. This one's awful damn good
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't you cuss around him.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan
dialog: Jr.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We are doin' the right thing, aren't

speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well now honey we been over this and

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But you don't think his momma'll be
dialog: upset? I mean overly?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well a course she'll be upset, sugar,
dialog: but she'll get over it. She's got
text: four little babies almost as good as
dialog: this one. It's like when I was robbin'
dialog: convenience stores -
text: Ed suddenly bursts out crying.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I love him so much!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I know you do, honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (still sobbing)
dialog: I love him so much!
scene_heading: TRAILER LIVING ROOM
text: As the lights are thrown on. The room is hung with streamers.
text: A string of cut-out letters reads "Welcome Home Son!"
speaker_heading: HI (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, bring him in!
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Ed is entering with Nathan Jr.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: This is it young Nathan Jr. Just
dialog: feast your eyes about, old boy!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't be so loud around him, Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Damn, I'm sorry honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And don't you cuss around him.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Aw, he don't know a cuss word from
dialog: shinola.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well see that he don't.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (jovially)
dialog: He's all right, he is.
text: He reaches for the child.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Come on over here, Nathan Jr.,
dialog: I'll show you around.
text: He takes the baby in both hands and holds him out at arm's
text: length, pointing him at the various places of interest. The
text: baby looks goggle-eyed at each one.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Lookahere, young sportsman. That -
dialog: there's the kitchen area where Ma
dialog: and Pa chow down. Over there's the
dialog: TV, two hours a day maximum, either
dialog: educational or football so's you

dialog: we sat there and said wouldn't it be
dialog: nice to have a youngster here to

dialog: Impatient with the nonsense:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He's tired, Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well we'll just sit you right there,
dialog: boy...
text: He is propping Nathan Jr. up in the corner of the couch. Hi
text: sits at the other corner and Ed sits in a facing chair.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Just put those dogs up'n take a
dialog: load off.
text: Hi beams at Nathan Jr. Ed smiles at Nathan Jr. Nathan Jr.
text: looks from one to the other, deadpan. They seem to be waiting
dialog: for him to contribute to the conversation.
dialog: Silence.
text: Suddenly Hi slaps his knee.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: What are you kiddin'?! We got a family
dialog: here!
text: Ed is getting up.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...He's a scandal, honey! He's a
dialog: little outlaw!
text: As she picks up the baby:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He's a good boy.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: He ain't too good! You can tell by
dialog: that twinkle in his eye!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't you think we should put him to
dialog: bed?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Hang on, honey...
text: He is frantically reaching for a Polaroid camera.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Let's us preserve the moment in
dialog: pictures!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Just one, okay?...
text: She sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr. as Hi starts
text: screwing the camera into a tripod.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I gotta tell ya, I'm a little
dialog: scared.
text: Absently, as he sets up the camera:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: How come is that, honey?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well we got a baby, Hi. It's an awful
dialog: big responsibility.
text: As he peers through the lens:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Honey, could ya slide over a tad and
dialog: raise the nipper up?
dialog: As she complies:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I mean we never done this before and
dialog: I'm kinda nervous.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You're doin' real good, sugar.
text: Hi sits on the couch, holding the camera's cable release. He
text: puts his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera.
text: Ed nestles her head against Hi's shoulder.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I love you, Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: We're set to pop here, honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're gonna help, aren't ya?
text: Through his teeth as he continues to grin at the offscreen
dialog: camera:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: How's that, honey?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Give Nathan Jr. a normal family
text: background, just quiet evenings at
dialog: home together...
text: We begin to hear distant thunder.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You can count on it, honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Everything decent'n normal from
dialog: here on out.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: As he squeezes the cable release - FLASH - the image
text: momentarily freezes on Hi beaming, Nathan Jr. staring, and
text: Ed looking at Hi with a little bit of concern.
scene_heading: DARK FIELD SAME NIGHT
text: The rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut,
text: and the flash of the Polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing
text: a momentarily harsh glare on the field.
text: Rain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking
text: at - by now just a patch of mud.
text: Faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more
text: thunder approaching, then suddenly:
text: THWACK - A head pops up out of the mud. It is Gale, the con
text: we saw in group therapy. He bellows as lightning and thunder
text: flash and crack nearby.
text: His head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is
text: already starting to wash it away.
text: We are beginning to track in an arc around Gale's head, who
text: is now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up
text: out of the mud. The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of
text: lightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire-topped walls
text: of a penitentiary.
text: Still bellowing, as if in some primal rage, Gale has gotten
text: his muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing
text: down to haul up the rest of his body. It comes with much
text: effort, and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the
text: fiercely clinging mud.
text: Finally he is free.
text: With a great cry, the mud-covered man plunges his right arm
text: straight back down into the earth, all the way up to his
text: shoulder. He gropes intently and then, apparently having
text: grabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling.
text: His arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. Clasped in his
text: hand is - a human foot.
text: Bellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the
text: foot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head.
text: As the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head
text: we see that it is his friend Evelle.
text: Both are bellowing.
text: Mud sucks and pops.
text: Thunder crashes.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION MENS ROOM
text: At the cut the ear-splitting thunder drops out to quiet. We
text: hear only the muffled patter of rain and the hum of a bare
dialog: fluorescent.
text: The two bedraggled escaped cons are standing side by side,
text: combing their hair in the mirror. The men seem absorbed in
text: their task, using hair jelly from a jar that sits on the
text: shelf between them to restore their duck's-ass haircuts.
text: Evelle cracks the bathroom door and looks out into the rain.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: ...Okay.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Mercury. Looks nice.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION
text: The two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended
text: at a gas island, a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank.
text: As Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops
text: it to the ground. Gale is already starting to peel out as
text: Evelle gets in.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT TRAILER LIVING ROOM
text: Late at night. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of
text: the room, in a pool of lamp light.
text: We hear faint, distant knocking. As we track in toward Hi
text: the knocking becomes louder and more present.
text: As we approach Hi we see that several Polaroids are spread
text: over his gently rising and falling chest.
text: By the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become
dialog: quite loud.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Open up!
text: Hi starts awake with a grunt.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ...Open up in air!
text: He looks up, alarmed.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: The front door of the trailer. Someone is pounding
text: insistently.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Open up! It's a police!
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: He sits up and tenses. He looks around.
text: Ed stands in her nightgown at the mouth of the hallway,
text: holding Nathan Jr. and squinting at Hi. She hisses:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hi! What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Po-lice, son! Open her up!
text: Hi gets to his feet, hurriedly tosses the Polaroids under a
text: cushion of the couch and takes out a gun.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Get in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They ain't gonna take Nathan?!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well I'd like to see 'em fly.
text: As Ed turns back to the bedroom:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Open up and maybe we'll letcha plea-
dialog: bargain.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: As Ed enters and shuts the door. She listens hard at the
dialog: door:
text: Hi's footsteps cross the living room, the click of the door
text: opening, silence... a burst of raucous male laughter.
speaker_heading: HI'S VOICE
dialog: ...Honey! Come on out here! Want you
dialog: to meet a couple friends of mine!
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: As Ed enters, carrying Nathan Jr. All three men - Hi, Gale,
text: and Evelle - are beaming at her.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Honey, like you to meet Gale and
dialog: Evelle Snopes, fine a pair as ever
text: broke and entered.
text: Gale roars with laughter.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Boys, this - here's my wife.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Ma'am.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
text: Miz McDunnough.
text: Ed smiles politely, then squints at Hi.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Kind of late for visitors, isn't it
dialog: Hi?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well yeah honey, but these boys tell
dialog: me they just got outta the joint.
dialog: Gotta show a little hospitality.

speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: That a him or a her?
speaker_heading: ED
text: It's a little boy.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Got a name, does he?
text: Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably. Hi clears his
text: throat.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well so far we just been using Junior.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We call him Junior.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Say, thairs good - JR., just like on
dialog: the Teevee.
text: Gale is staring at the streamers and decorations. Reading
dialog: aloud:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: "Welcome... Home... Son." Where's he
dialog: been?
text: Hi and Ed respond simultaneously:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Tulsa.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Phoenix.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: He was, uh... he was visiting his
dialog: grandparents.
speaker_heading: ED
text: They're separated.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Was that yer folks ma'am?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, I'm afraid not.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I thought yer folks was dead, H.I.?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (very uncomfortably)
dialog: Well we thought Junior should see
dialog: their final resting place - Whyn't
dialog: you boys have a seat?
text: As the two men move toward the couch Ed hesitantly pipes up:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hi, it's two in the morning...
text: She wrinkles her nose.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...What's that smell?
dialog: Apologetically:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: We don't always smell like this, Miz
dialog: McDunnough. I was just explainin' to
dialog: yer better half here that when we
dialog: were tunneln' out we hit the main
dialog: sewer - dumb luck, that - and just
dialog: followed that to -
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You mean you busted out of jail!!
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Waaaal...
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: We released ourselves on our own
text: recognizance.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What Evelle means to say is, we felt
dialog: the institution no longer had anything
dialog: to offer us.
text: He is looking at the baby.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...My Lord he's cute.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: He's a little outlaw, you can see
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Now listen, you folks can't stay
dialog: here!
text: Gale, Evelle, and Hi look up at Ed, dumbstruck. After a beat:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: ...Ma'am?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You just can't stay! I appreciate
dialog: your bein' friends of Hi and all,
dialog: but this is a decent family now...
text: She looks at Hi.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I mean we got a toddler here!
text: Gale leans in close to Hi, a look of sincere concern on his
text: face, and says under his breath:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Say, who wears the pants round here
dialog: H.I.?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Now honey -
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't you honey me. Now you boys can
text: set a while and catch up, and then
dialog: you'll be on your way.
text: There is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the
text: bedroom door.
text: Gale is carefully studying his thumbnail; Evelle stares
text: fixedly at the ceiling. Still looking at his thumb:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Gotcha on a awful short leash, don't
dialog: she H.I.?
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Sometime later, as Hi tiptoes in. Ed lies in bed facing the
text: wall; we see only the back of her head. Hi sits gingerly on
text: the edge of the bed and, smiling, sticks a finger through
text: the bars of the crib to play with the baby.
text: The sound of the TV set in the living room filters faintly
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They still here?
text: Hi is momentarily startled, then goes on playing with the
dialog: baby.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Yeah, they're just gonna stay a day
text: or two. It's raining out honey, they
dialog: got nowhere to go.
text: Ed finally turns to face him. We hear the two men laugh
text: raucously in the living room.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They're fugitives, Hi...
text: Hi turns to face her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...How're we gonna start a new life
dialog: with them around?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well now honey you gotta have a little
dialog: charity. Ya know, in Arab lands they'd

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Promise just a day or two.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Tonight and tomorrow, tops.
scene_heading: EXTREME HIGH ANGLE

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: That night I had a dream.
speaker_heading: FLASH CUT

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I'd drifted off thinkin' about

speaker_heading: FLASH CUT
text: Wall of flames. Deafening roar.
dialog: BACK TO HI

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: But now I was haunted by a vision of -
scene_heading: WALL OF FLAMES
text: Roaring. At the cut: WHOOOOOSH! a huge low-rider motorcycle
text: bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder
text: than the fire. Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion.
text: The chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: He was horrible...
text: The Biker roars out of frame.
scene_heading: LOW-ANGLE REVERSE

speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...He could turn the day into night...
text: The Biker cracks the whip and, at the crack:
text: The sky behind him turns instantly to black. Bolts of
text: lightning crackle across it as thunder roars.
scene_heading: ANOTHER DESERT SCENE DAY
text: Tracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he
text: roars along a strip of highway. He is reaching for the two
text: sawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and laid to waste everything in
text: his path.
scene_heading: REVERSE TRACK ON BIKER
text: Pulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two
text: shotguns. The tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a
text: running jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: He was especially hard on the little
dialog: things...
text: CRACK - as the first shotgun spurts orange the foreground
text: rabbit keels over. The Biker slues the other gun around.
scene_heading: LOCKED-DOWN WIDE SHOT
text: On a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard suns himself.
text: The Biker is approaching in the distant background.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...the helpless and the gentle
dialog: creatures.
text: CRACK - from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away.
scene_heading: LOCKED-DOWN LOW-ANGLE WIDE SHOT
text: Of the empty desert road stretching away. In the foreground
text: a lone desert flower blooms.
text: The Biker roars into frame.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: He left a scorched earth in his wake,
text: befouling even the sweet desert breeze
text: that whipped across his brow.
text: As the Biker roars away, the foreground flower bends with
text: his draft and then bursts into flame.
scene_heading: TRACKING ON BIKER
text: From in front. He twirls the shotguns in either hand and
text: reaches back to plunge them over his shoulders into their
text: holsters.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I didn't know where he came from or
dialog: why...
text: We are moving in on his chest, where two crisscrossed
text: bandoliers carry two rows of hand grenades, their silver
text: pins glinting in the sun. We follow the line of one of the
text: bandoliers up to his right shoulder which bears the tattoo:
dialog: "Mama Didn't Love Me."
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I didn't know if he was dream or
dialog: vision...
scene_heading: REVERSE TRACK ON BIKER
text: From behind, booming down as we track. We are approaching
text: the crest of a rise.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: But I feared that I myself had
dialog: unleashed him...
speaker_heading: HIGH SHOT
text: Of the Biker approaching, craning down as he draws near.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...for he was The Fury That Would
dialog: Be...
text: With the crane down we momentarily lose him from view over
text: the rise; then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and, wheels
dialog: spinning, is airborne
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: As he crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars
text: away. Only now we are no longer in the desert:
text: We are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is
dialog: the Arizona house.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...as soon as Florence Arizona found
text: her little Nathan gone.
text: The roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the
text: Biker gradually dissolves into thin air.
text: We are left looking at the empty street and the faraway
dialog: Arizona house.
text: The receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing,
text: a woman singing a lullaby. Faintly, behind the singing, there
text: is also a droning high-pitched noise.
text: The camera starts floating forward very close to the ground,
text: moving slowly toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched
text: drone is becoming less faint under the singing.
text: The camera is accelerating. The drone is growing louder - we
text: can now tell that it is a human scream.
text: As we approach the Arizona house we can see that a ladder is
text: propped up to a second-story window.
text: We are moving quite fast now. The scream all but buries the
text: singing.
text: We are rushing toward the house, toward the base of the
text: ladder, the sustained scream drawing us on.
text: We hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no
text: abatement of speed, sucked forward by the deafening scream.
text: We reach the top and hurtle - THWAP! - through the white
text: curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to
text: reveal Florence Arizona, her back to us, screaming over the
dialog: crib.
text: We are rocketing toward her.
text: She is turning to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth
text: stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek and we are rushing
text: into an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly
text: vibrating epiglottis and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF HI'S EYES
text: As they snap open.
text: The screaming snaps off at the cut. The singing that the
text: building scream covered, however, is now audible again.
text: Perspiration beads Hi's forehead. He looks down toward the
text: foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: It is now morning. Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing
text: the baby as she walks. She is singing it a lullaby.
text: Faintly, from the next room, we can hear Gale and Evelle
text: snoring away like buzz saws.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (groggily)
dialog: He all right?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He's all right. He was just havin' a
dialog: nightmare.
text: Hi is getting out of bed.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Yeah, well...
text: He crosses to the bedroom window and cracks the venetian
text: blind. Orange light filters in.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Beyond a clothes line and a septic tank, a huge orange ball
text: of sun is rising. We can almost hear the roar of its burning
text: surface.
dialog: BACK TO HI
dialog: Looking.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Sometimes it's a hard world for
dialog: little things.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The orange sun, rumbling, perceptibly rising.
scene_heading: ARIZONA HOME FRONT FOYER
text: At the cut the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high-
text: pitched ba-WEEEEeeee... of a strobe going off as a flash
text: picture is taken: We are looking over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder
text: as he stands at his open front door, facing a battery of
text: press people who stand out on the porch.
text: An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in at us;
text: various flashbulbs pop.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No, the missus and the rest of the
dialog: kids've left town to I ain't sayin'
dialog: where. They'll be back here when
dialog: we're a nuclear fam'ly again.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Mr. Arizona, which tot was abducted?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Nathan Jr., I think.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Do you have anything to say to the
dialog: kidnappers?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah: Watch yer butt.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Sir, it's been rumored that your son
dialog: was abducted by UFOS. Would you care
dialog: to comment?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Now don't print that, son. If his
dialog: mama reads that she's just gonna
dialog: lose all hope.
text: A POLICEMAN from inside the house is taking Nathan by the
dialog: elbow.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: We really have to ask you some more
dialog: questions, sir...
text: As Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he
text: calls back over his shoulder:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: But remember, it's still business as
dialog: usual at Unpainted Arizona, and if
dialog: you can find lower prices anywhere
dialog: my name still ain't Nathan Arizona!
text: We are following the two, hand-held, as the Police leads
text: Nathan toward the living room.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: The room is filled with policemen milling about in several
text: different uniforms: local police, state troopers, plainclothes
dialog: detectives.
text: The original Policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a
text: white-smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar
dialog: sheets.
text: The dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire and overlapping.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Mr. Byrum here can take your exemplars
dialog: while you talk.
text: MR. BYRUM has taken Nathan's right hand and is rolling its
text: fingers onto the inkpad.
speaker_heading: BYRUM
dialog: Just let your hand relax; I'll do
dialog: the work.
text: Nathan jerks his hand away.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: What is this?! I didn't steal the
dialog: damn kid!
text: Two men in conservative suits are approaching.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Sir, these men are from the FBI-
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Are you boys crazy?! All I know is I
dialog: wake up this morning with my wife
dialog: screaming-
speaker_heading: BYRUM
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: We just need to distinguish your
dialog: prints from the perpetrators', if
dialog: they left any.
text: Giving his hand back:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Course! I know that!
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: Sir, we have an indication you were
dialog: born Nathan Huffhines; is this
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah, I changed m'name; what of it?
dialog: FBI #2
dialog: Could you give us an indication why?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah, would you buy furniture at a
dialog: store called Unpainted Huffhines?
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: All right, I'll get to the point-
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED COP
dialog: Was the child wearing anything when
dialog: he was abducted?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No one sleeps nekkid in this house,
dialog: boy! He was wear-
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: I'm asking the questions here,

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: If we're gonna put out an APB we

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: He was wearin' his-
dialog: FBI #2
dialog: It's just that we're better trained
dialog: to intervene in crisis situations
dialog: (to Nathan)
dialog: What was he wearing?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: A dinner jacket! Wuddya think, he
dialog: was wearing his damn jammies!
dialog: FBI #2
dialog: (to cop)
text: The child was wearing his jammies.
dialog: Are you happy?
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: Do you have any disgruntled employees?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Hell, they're all disgruntled! I
dialog: ain't runnin' a damn daisy farm!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What did the pajamas-
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: My motto is do it my way or watch
dialog: your butt!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What did the pajamas-
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: So you think it might have been an
dialog: employee?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Don't make me laugh. Without my say-
dialog: so they don't piss with their pants
text: on fire.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What did the pajamas look like?
speaker_heading: FBI #1

dialog: Officer-
speaker_heading: NATHAN

scene_heading: BELLOWING VOICE OFFSCREEN
dialog: Would ya mind, I'm trying to set up

text: Nathan bellows back:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Get your feet off m'damn coffee table!
text: Also raising his voice at the offscreen bellower:
speaker_heading: FBI #1
dialog: Ron, you're upsetting the victim.
text: Nathan is getting worked up.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Damnit, are you boys gonna go chase
dialog: down your leads or are you gonna sit
dialog: drinkin' coffee in the one house in
dialog: the state where I know my boy ain't
dialog: at?!
dialog: FBI #2
dialog: Sir, there aren't any "leads" yet,
dialog: aside from this coat-
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Gimme that!
text: He grabs the overcoat being displayed by FBI #2.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: That's a five-hundred-dollar camel's
dialog: hair-
speaker_heading: BYRUM
dialog: Sir, you might want to wash your
text: hands at this point.
text: Nathan realizes that he's gotten ink from his fingerprinting
text: all over the coat.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well goddamnit!
text: He is rising to his feet and hurling the coat to the floor.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...No leads?!
text: He furiously kicks the coat.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Everyone leaves microbes'n whatnot!
text: Throughout the speech Nathan stalks the room, working himself
text: into a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters,
text: generally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping
text: their feet off his furniture.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Hell, that's your forte, trackin'
dialog: down them microbes left by criminals'n
dialog: commies'n shit! That's yer whole
dialog: damn raison d'itre! No leads?! I
dialog: want Nathan Jr. back, or whichever
dialog: the hell one they took! He's out
dialog: there somewhere! Somethin' leads to
dialog: him! And anyone can find him knows
dialog: the difference between a lead and a
dialog: hole in the ground!!
scene_heading: HOLE IN THE GROUND - DAY
text: Specifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth
text: that Gale and Evelle climbed out of. We hear only the squish -
text: suck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen.
text: We are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent
text: leather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly
text: spattered - of several policemen milling about the hole.
text: German shepherds sniff around also.
text: With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. The bike's
text: jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police
text: step back and dogs skitter away to give him room.
text: He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the
text: bike. The burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame;
text: it hisses angrily and dies in the mud. We start to crane up.
text: The whipcracking Biker cue mixes up. The Biker's motorcycle
text: idles with a deep rumble, like the roar of fire on the sun.
text: We are now framed looking over the Biker's shoulder. The
text: policemen's attitude to him seems to be deferential. One cop
text: in front of him is pointing a direction. The Biker is shaking
text: his head; he doesn't think they went that way.
text: Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head
text: snaps to profile. He is staring across the field, stock-still,
text: having heard, smelled or sensed something.
text: The dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to
text: attention, a split second after the BIKER.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: A jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field.
speaker_heading: THE DOGS
text: After a moment, their attention returns to the hole.
speaker_heading: THE BIKER
text: His attention also returns to the matter at hand. He squints,
text: concentrating. His bike rumbles. Gradually his face sets in
dialog: a specific direction.
text: We pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder: "Mama Didn't Love
text: Me." His shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the
text: throttle; then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: TRAILER KITCHEN CLOSE ON GALE AND EVELLE
text: They are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at
text: something offscreen. After a beat:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: ...Awful good cereal flakes, Miz
text: McDunnough.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Ed is sitting in the living room, bottle-feeding Nathan Jr.
text: She is surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by
text: the house guests. She does not respond to the ice-breaker.
text: Gale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has
text: been smoking in the ashtray next to him. There is a bead of
text: milk dribbling down his chin.
text: He takes a contemplative puff, studying Ed.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...Whyncha breast feed him? You 'pear
dialog: to be capable.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mind your own bidnis.
text: Through a mouthful of cornflakes:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Ya don't breast feed him, he'll hate
dialog: you for it later. That's why we wound
text: up in prison.
text: Gale blows out smoke and picks up his spoon to start back in
text: on his cornflakes.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz
dialog: tells us.
text: Hi is walking in, yawning.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Boys.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Morni', H.I.
text: Sharply, as Hi sits and starts to pour cornflakes into a
dialog: bowl:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Hi.
text: Hi holds the cornflakes box arrested in mid-air. He looks at
text: Ed, who is motioning to gale and Evelle with her eyes.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Oh yeah... Say boys, you wouldn't
dialog: mind makin' yourself scarce for a
dialog: couple hours this afternoon?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We're havin' some decent friends
dialog: over.
text: Gale and Evelle are looking dumbly from Ed to Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Heh-heh... What Ed means to say is,
dialog: seein' as you two boys are wanted,
dialog: it wouldn't exactly do to have folks
dialog: seein' you here - I mean for your
dialog: own protection.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Sure H.I.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Anything you say.
text: More relaxed now, to Ed:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Matter of fact honey, maybe I'll
dialog: skip this little get-together myself,
dialog: Glen won't mind, and I'll just duck
text: out with the boys, knock back a couple
dialog: of-uh, Co-Colas-
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Sure H.I.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: We'd love to have ya.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ED
text: Looking pleadingly at Hi.
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: Feeling the look, he goes back to his cornflakes.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Well... maybe that ain't such a
dialog: hot idea either.
text: Gale leans back to blow smoke at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: So many social engagements. So little
dialog: time.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT GAS STATION BATHROOM
text: It is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle
text: combing their hair, now empty.
text: We are looking toward the door. The bathroom is quiet except
text: for the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching
text: motorcycle. It grows louder, then begins to recede as the
text: bike shoots by the station.
text: Suddenly we hear the screech of the bike's brakes.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STATION
text: We are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle
text: screeches to a halt in the foreground. The low wide shot
text: crops the BIKER at his shins. In the background behind him
dialog: is the gas station.
text: The Biker pauses for a moment, thinking or feeling.
scene_heading: BACK TO INT. BATHROOM
text: We hear the rumble of the bike approaching, very loud.
text: CRASH - the bathroom door flies open as the Biker bursts in
text: astride his hog, bright daylight streaming in with him to
text: throw him into imposing silhouette. The shafts of light
text: pouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Fast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf
text: under the mirror.
text: BACK TO BIKER
text: An extreme close shot shows his nostrils dilating as we hear
text: him sniff.
text: He revs the rumbling bike, stealing thunder from a far
dialog: mountain.
scene_heading: FRONT STOOP OF TRAILER
text: Hi, with Ed standing by, is just opening the door to a young
text: couple. Glen is a short stocky blond man in his early
text: thirties, wearing Bermuda shorts. DOT is wearing slacks,
text: heels, and a scarf over her hair.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Glen, Dot-
text: As the door opens, Dot hops up the stoop shrieking.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: Where's at baby? Where's he at?
text: From behind, Glen gives her an energetic THWOK on the ass.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Go find him honey!
text: Dot spins and smacks Glen across the face with her purse.
text: Through clenched teeth:
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: Cut it out, Glen!
text: He reels under the blow.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (quietly)
text: He's asleep right now.
text: Dot shrieks again, but this time muffles it with her own
text: hand. She tiptoes into the trailer, hand to her mouth.
text: Glen, rubbing his cheek, seems angry at himself.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Shit, I hope we didn't wake it!
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo?
text: Glen at the top of the stoop, turns out to the yard.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Come on kids...
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT GLEN AND DOT'S KIDS
text: A scad of children, ranging in age from two to seven, are
text: crawling over Hi's car. One is beating on it with a large
text: stick, another sits on the hood pulling back one of the
dialog: windshield wipers, etc.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Get away from Mr. McDunnough's
dialog: car.
scene_heading: TRAILER BEDROOM
text: As Ed and Dot enter, Ed beaming as they go to the crib.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh... Hi Jr. Till we think of a better
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: Whyncha call him Jason? I love
dialog: Biblical names. If I had another
dialog: little boy I'd name him Jason or
dialog: Caleb or- Oh!
text: She puts her hand to her forehead, reacting to the baby as
text: if she is about to faint.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: ...He's an angel!
text: She hides her face in her hands and looks away as if blinded,
text: then sneaks a look around her hands.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: ...He's an angel straight from heaven!
dialog: Now honey I had all my kids the hard
dialog: way so you gotta tell me where you
dialog: got this angel. Did he fly straight
dialog: down from heaven?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well-
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: You gonna send him to Arizona State?
scene_heading: TRAILER LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN
text: The weaving knee-level tracking shot is following a six-year-
text: old boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he tramps around
text: the trailer, brandishing a big stick. He strikes the walls,
text: furniture, various other objects with his stick, hollering
text: "Bam! Bam-Bam!" with each blow.
text: The track weaves off him and onto Hi, who is bending down to
text: pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator. He raises his
text: voice to make himself heard over the din of all the children
text: boiling around the room:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Need a beer, Glen?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Does the Pope wear a funny hat?
dialog: Hi considers this.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Well yeah, Glen, I guess it is
dialog: kinda funny.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Say, that reminds me! How many
dialog: Pollacks it take to screw up a
dialog: lightbulb?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I don't know Glen, one?
text: Hi looks down.
text: One of Glen's children, in a cowboy hat, is squirting a squirt
text: gun into his crotch area.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Nope, it takes three!
text: He starts laughing, then catches himself.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Wait a minute, I told it wrong.
dialog: Here, I'm startin' over: How come it
text: takes three Pollacks to screw up a
dialog: lightbulb?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I don't know, Glen.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Cause they're so durn stupid!
text: He laughs; Hi doesn't react.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Shit man, loosen up! Don't ya get
dialog: it?
text: Hi looks over at the TV, which the bam-shouting six-year-old
text: is banging with his stick.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: No Glen, I sure don't.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Shit man, think about it! I guess
dialog: it's what they call a Way Homer.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Cause you only get it on the Way
dialog: Home.
speaker_heading: HI

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Say, that reminds me! How'd you get

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Yeah, it's a crazy world.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Someone oughta sell tickets.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Sure, I'd buy one.
text: Hi is looking at another child who is just finishing off the
text: T in FART in crayon on the wall.
text: Glen chuckles, looking at his errant child.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...That Buford's a sly one. Already
dialog: knows his ABCs. But I'm sayin', how'd
dialog: ya get the kid?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well this whole thing is just who
text: knows who and favoritism. Ed has a

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well maybe she can do something for

dialog: with m'semen. Say, that reminds me!

speaker_heading: HI

speaker_heading: GLEN

dialog: Yeah, it's a good one... Course I

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Mind ya don't cutchaseff, Mordecai...
scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC GROUNDS
text: Dot faces Hi and Ed across a picnic table covered with grilled
text: hamburgers, rolls, green jello mold, cooler, etc.
text: One of the younger children sits in the middle of the table,
text: occasionally taking a fistful of jello and flinging it at
text: Hi. The two women don't seem to notice.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: ...and then there's diphtheria-
dialog: tetanus, what they call dip-tet. You
dialog: gotta get him dip-tet boosters yearly
dialog: or else he'll get lockjaw and night
dialog: vision. Then there's the smallpox
dialog: vaccine, chicken pox and measles,
dialog: and if your kid's like ours you gotta

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We ain't exactly fixed on one yet.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...No, I guess we don't have one

speaker_heading: DOT

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, what if the baby gets sick,
dialog: honey?
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: Hi, even if he don't get sick he's

speaker_heading: ED

dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: You started his bank accounts?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Have we done that honey? We gotta do
dialog: that honey. What's that for, Dot?
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: That-there's for his orthodonture
dialog: and his college. You soak his thumb
dialog: in iodine you might get by without
text: the orthodonture, but it won't knock
dialog: any off the college.
text: Hi sits stoically. Dot is looking offscreen:
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: ...Reilly, take that diaper off your
dialog: head and put it back on your
dialog: sister!... Anyway, you probably got
text: the life insurance all squared away.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You done that yet honey?
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: You gotta do that, Hi! Ed here's got
dialog: her hands full with that little angel!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (dully)
dialog: Yes ma'am.
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: What would Ed and the angel do if a
dialog: truck came along and splattered your
dialog: brains all over the interstate? Where
dialog: would you be then?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah honey, what if you get run over?
speaker_heading: DOT
dialog: Or you got carried off by a twister?
scene_heading: LAKESIDE PATH
text: We are tracking on Hi and Glen as they walk side by side.
text: Glen is sopping wet, wearing only swimming suit and wing-
text: tipped shoes. His body is ghostly pale except for a V-area
text: at his neck and his arms below the short-sleeve line, which
text: are a bright angry red.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Hear about the person of the Polish
text: persuasion he walks into a bar holdin'
text: a pile of shit in his hands, says
dialog: "Look what I almost stepped in."

text: Hi shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Dunno-
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: And I told Dottie to lose some weight
dialog: but she don't wanna listen!
text: He roars with laughter and slaps Hi heartily on the back. As
text: he chuckles sympathetically:
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...No man, I know what you mean. You
dialog: got all kinds a responsibilities
dialog: now. You're married, ya got a kid,
dialog: looks like your whole life's set

speaker_heading: HI

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Okay. Now it might not look like it,

speaker_heading: HI
dialog: That right?
speaker_heading: GLEN
scene_heading: T-I-G-E-R.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: But what's that got to do with-
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Don't rush me!
text: He stops walking. Hi stops also, looking at Glen, Still
text: puzzled. Glen lays a companionable hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Now the thing about Dot is, she thinks-
dialog: and she's told me this-
text: He looks around as if to make sure they are not being
text: overheard. His tone is confidential.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...she thinks... you're cute.
text: Hi looks suspiciously at Glen's hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Yeah...?
text: Glen nods energetically:
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'm crappin' you negative! And I
dialog: could say the same about Ed!
text: Through tightly clenched teeth:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: What're you talkin' about, Glen?

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'm talkin' about the Sex Revolution!
dialog: I'm talkin' about-
text: THWAK - Hi's fist swings into frame to connect solidly with
text: Glen's jaw.
text: Glen's feet leave the ground. He flies back and lands in a
dialog: heap.
scene_heading: LOW-ANGLE REVERSE
text: Glen in the foreground, groggily rubbing his jaw; Hi
text: approaching menacingly.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Keep your goddamned hands off my

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Shit man!
text: He is scrambling to his feet.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...I was only tryin' to help!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Keep your goddamned hands off my
dialog: wife!
text: With Hi still advancing, Glen starts to run.
scene_heading: TRACKING ON GLEN
text: With Hi pursuing in the background.
text: Glen is looking back over his shoulder to shout at Hi as he
dialog: runs.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You're crazy! I feel pity for you,
dialog: man! You-
text: CRASH! - Glen runs smack into a tree and drops like a sack
dialog: of cement.
scene_heading: INT. CAR NIGHT
text: Hi is driving, his jaw rigidly set, his temple throbbing.
text: Nathan Jr. sits in a safety seat between him and Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We finally go out with some decent
dialog: people and you break his nose. That
dialog: ain't too funny, Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (stolidly)
dialog: His kids seemed to think it was funny.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well they're just kids, you're a
text: grown man with responsibilities.
dialog: Whatever possessed you?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: He was provokin' me when I popped
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How'd he do that?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Never mind.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But Hi, he's your foreman, he's just
dialog: gonna fire you now.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I expect he will.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And where does that leave me and
dialog: Nathan Jr.?
speaker_heading: HI
text: With a man for a husband.
text: He is pulling into a convenience store parking lot.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That ain't no answer.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Honey, that's the only answer.
text: He puts the car in park but leaves it running.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Nathan needs some Huggies. I'll
dialog: be out directly.
text: As he gets out of the car:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Mind you stay strapped in.
scene_heading: INT. STORE
text: A hand enters to take a package of panty hose from the
text: standing rack.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HUGGIES
text: A hand enters to take a big carton of disposable diapers
text: from the shelf.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP CASHIER
text: A pimply-faced lad with a paper 7-Eleven cap on his head. He
text: is looking up from a dirty magazine, reacting in horror to
text: something approaching.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: Hi is approaching the check-out island with a gun in one
text: hand, the carton of Huggies tucked under the other. The L'Eggs
text: stocking is pulled over his head to distort his features.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I'll be taking these Huggies and
dialog: whatever cash you got.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT CASHIER'S HAND
text: As he presses a silent alarm under the lip of his counter.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR
text: Ed is reading to Nathan Jr. from a large picture book.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-
dialog: chin." Then I'll huff and I'll
dialog: puff...'
text: She pauses for a moment, listening. We can barely hear a
text: distant siren. She resumes absently, but her voice trails
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: "...and I'll blow your house in..."
text: We can definitely hear the WHOO-WHOO of the siren now, and
text: it is definitely approaching. Ed hooks an arm around the
text: seat and looks behind the car, then looks forward.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: Indistinctly visible through the semi-reflective glass are
text: two figures at the check-out island. One is pointing something
text: at the other.
text: BACK TO ED
text: As the siren is growing louder. Under her breath:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That son-of-a-bitch.
text: She unstraps herself and gets out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. STORE
text: Two-shot of Hi and the CASHIER, who is stuffing bills into a
text: grocery bag. Beyond them we can see Ed, outside, circling
text: the front of the car.
text: Her shout is muffled through the glass:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You son-of-a-bitch!
text: With this Hi notices her. He turns to the Cashier.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Better hurry it up. I'm in dutch
text: with the wife.
text: But Ed is already getting into the driver's seat of the car.
text: BACK TO ED
text: As she slams the car door shut. The siren is quite loud now.
speaker_heading: ED
text: That son-of-a-bitch. Hang on, pumpkin.
text: The car squeals out of the lot.
text: WIDE SHOT THE STREET
text: The squad car tops a rise to bounce into view, its siren
text: wailing.
text: BACK TO THE STORE
text: Hi bursts out the door, still wearing the stocking. The carton
text: of Huggies is still tucked under one arm.
text: Bellowing hopefully after his departing car:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Honey!
text: We hear the SMACK-CRACK of a gunshot and glass impact, but
text: the approaching squad car is still too far down the block to
dialog: have been the source.
text: Hi looks around the parking lot, bewildered.
text: The wailing siren is becoming painfully loud.
text: Hi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store,
text: where a bullet pock mars the glass.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Through the glass we see the pimply young Cashier with the
text: paper 7-Eleven cap pop up from behind the counter to sight
text: down his huge .44 Magnum for another shot. The gun is so big
text: he uses both hands to heft it.
text: SMACK-CRACK - the bullet kisses another hole in the glass.
text: Hi is off and running.
text: The squad car is screeching into the lot. An officer tumbles
text: out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped.
text: He rolls on the pavement, then hurriedly rights himself and
text: takes up a half-kneeling shooting stance.
text: At the same time the little Cashier is emerging from the 7-
text: Eleven with his gun.
text: The two bang away at Hi's retreating figure - the Policeman's
text: revolver popping, the Cashier's Magnum booming.
text: We hear the Policeman who is still in the car drawling over
text: its loudspeaker:
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: Halt. It's a police warning, son.
dialog: Put those groceries down and turn
dialog: yourself in.
scene_heading: TRACKING ON HI
text: Legs pumping, panty hose still over his head, its unused leg
text: streaming behind him like an aviator's scarf. The gun is
text: tucked into his belt; the Huggies are tucked securely under
text: his arm.
text: Behind him we can see the OFFICER and the Cashier squeeze
text: off another couple shots, and then the policeman piles back
text: into the squad car.
speaker_heading: ED'S CAR
text: Driving. She hears distant gunshots.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That son of a bitch... Hold on,
dialog: Nathan. We're gonna go pick up Daddy.
text: She hangs a vicious U-turn.
scene_heading: TRACKING ON HI
text: Huffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies.
text: The cop car careens onto the street in the background, its
text: siren wailing.
text: The PASSENGER COP is leaning far out his window, one hand
text: gripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun
text: at Hi, shooting away.
text: Bullets whizz past.
text: Suddenly, with a soft pthunk! the Huggies box pops forward,
text: out from under Hi's arm - hit by a bullet. Still running, Hi
text: reaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it,
text: tips it - loses it. He overruns it a couple steps before he
text: can bring himself up short.
text: He turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING -
text: bullets chew up the road near his hand.
text: Leaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured
dialog: yard.
text: The police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him
text: around the corner, the driver still drawling over his
dialog: loudspeaker:
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: That's private property, son. Come
text: back out to the street and reveal
dialog: yourself to Officer Steensma and
dialog: Officer Scott - that's me.
speaker_heading: YARD
text: Hi vaults a fence to land in the backyard.
text: As he straightens to his feet we hear a horrible snarling
text: and barking.
text: A huge black Doberman is bounding across the lawn. It looks
text: like it means to rip Hi's throat out.
text: LOW TRACKING SHOT TOWARD HI
text: The dog's racing POV as it bounds toward the paralyzed Hi.
text: The dog leaps - camera flying up toward Hi's face - and:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HI'S FROZEN PROFILE
text: The dog's slavering muzzle flies into frame and - stops,
text: bare inches from Hi's nose, and the dog falls back, having
text: reached the end of his chain.
text: Hi resumes running.
speaker_heading: CLOSE
text: On the dog, snarling and straining against the end of his
dialog: chain.
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: Down along the chain toward the spike mooring it to the
text: ground. As the dog strains, the spike starts to stir in the
dialog: ground.
text: Other dogs can be heard barking now, the Doberman having
text: started a sympathetic wave.
speaker_heading: ED'S CAR
text: Her jaw set, she takes a hard turn, looking this way and
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That son of a bitch...
text: The police car approaches and roars by, the Passenger Cop
text: still hanging out his window.
speaker_heading: ED
text: ...Lookie Nathan, a police car...
text: She is looking in her rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Say, that looks like Bill Steensma.
scene_heading: LOW TRACKING SHOT
text: The camera is shooting forward at ground level, following
text: the Doberman as it bounds along. The Doberman is dragging
text: his chain and spike, which stretch into the foreground,
text: bumping and scraping along the road.
text: Far ahead we can see Hi running, then turning down an
text: intersecting street.
text: A second dog peels into the road to bound along with the
dialog: Doberman.
scene_heading: TRACKING BEHIND HI
text: Running up a dark street. There is an oncoming pickup. Hi
text: runs directly at it.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP
text: The DRIVER screams and brakes - not quite in time.
text: Hi rolls onto the hood, and off, and gamely trots over to
text: open the passenger door.
text: The Driver is leaning over to tell him:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Son, you got a panty on your head.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Just drive fast...
text: He is displaying his gun as he starts to climb in.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...and don't stop till I tell ya.
text: Before Hi can get his door shut the Driver is obediently
text: peeling out.
text: Hi is reacting to an oncoming car. He peels the stocking off
text: to look, and leans across the Driver's lap to bellow as Ed's
dialog: car passes:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Honey!
text: Hi turns to look through the back window.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Ed's car is braking and spinning into a U-turn.
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: Leaning out the window.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Mind the baby now!
text: Next to him, the Driver is screaming.
text: As Hi turns forward, the entire windshield explodes in.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: The pimply-faced Cashier from the 7-Eleven is standing in
text: the middle of the road ahead, sighting down his .44 Magnum
dialog: for another shot.
text: We are rushing in.
speaker_heading: THE DRIVER
text: Still screaming.
speaker_heading: THE CASHIER
text: Ready to fire and - THUMP - he is bowled over by the arriving
text: Doberman, still trailing chain and spike, and now accompanied
text: by three other dogs, all braying at the top of their lungs.
text: Still screaming, the Driver puts his body into a hard right
text: turn to avoid the Cashier and hellhounds.
speaker_heading: NEW STREET
text: Roaring up the new street, they are now directly in the path
text: of the oncoming police car, its siren wailing, barreling
text: straight at them.
text: Still screaming, the Driver leans into another hard right.
text: Wind is whistling in through where the windshield used to
dialog: be.
text: Two wheels hop curb as the car skids into the new street,
text: fishtails, and roars away.
speaker_heading: ED'S CAR
text: She hears dogs, siren, squealing brakes on an adjacent street.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hold on Nathan, we'll take a shortcut.
text: She gives the wheel a hard right turn.
text: But there is no cross street. The car hops the curb and roars
text: up someone's nicely tended front yard, heading for the gap
dialog: between this house and the one next door.
speaker_heading: POLICE CAR
text: Recovered and turned around from its near collision with the
text: SCREAMING; Driver, the squad car is now squealing onto the
text: street the Screamer swerved on to - resuming pursuit.
text: As the police car roars down the street, Ed's car appears
text: from between two houses behind it, bounces down the front
text: yard to the street and follows the police.
scene_heading: SCREAMER'S PICKUP
text: Raking two-shot of Hi and the Screamer. Hi is looking back
text: over his shoulder at the pursuing police.
text: Desperately pleading:
speaker_heading: SCREAMER
dialog: Can I stop now?
text: Hi looks forward.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: They are rushing toward an imposing colonial house planted
text: at the end of the dead-end street.
dialog: BACK TO HI
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Maybe you better.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BRAKE PEDAL
text: Stepped on hard. The brakes scream.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR
text: As the car squeals to a halt Hi is catapulted through where
text: the windshield used to be, tumbling over the hood onto the
text: front lawn.
text: He rolls to his feet and, as he runs up the lawn, calls back
text: over his shoulder:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Thank you.
text: INTO THE HOUSE
text: We are tracking behind Hi as he runs up to the house and
text: crashes through the screen door.
text: Still tracking behind him as he runs through the living room.
text: A middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV. They
text: look up as Hi rushes by.
text: Hi plunges down a staircase. As he does so we hear: ka-chick
dialog: ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock.
text: He emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two
text: kids playing ping-pong. He runs out the back door.
text: TRACKING WITH THE POLICEMAN
text: As he runs into the house.
text: As he runs through the living room we catch a glimpse of the
text: middle-aged couple gaping at him.
text: OFFICER STEENSMA plunges down the stairs.
scene_heading: TRACKING ON HI
text: Outdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house
text: and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other
dialog: side.
text: BACK TO THE HOUSE
text: As a pack of dogs thunders in. The lead Doberman with chain
text: and spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs.
text: The dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs.
text: As they hit the rec room the thunder of their feet turns
text: into the clatter of nails on tile.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET
text: As Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad
text: front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each
text: perpendicular lane, searching for something.
text: He turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs
text: a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run.
text: He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but
text: at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer
text: Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end. He fires.
text: Hi keeps running.
text: The Policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace
text: with Hi running along the back aisle. He squeezes off shots
text: at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity.
text: Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the
text: Policeman. He runs down the second lane he comes to toward
text: the front of the store.
text: The pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders
text: up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. The
text: lead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap.
text: Hi reverses again, and emerges into the back aisle.
text: BANG! A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder.
text: The Policeman has been waiting at the end of the back aisle;
text: he aims once again.
text: Hi plunges down the next lane but is brought up short as KA-
text: BOOM! five jars of applesauce explode in front of him.
dialog: Hi looks.
text: Standing in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the
text: store is the Store Manager, a fat man in a white short-sleeved
text: shirt with a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth.
text: The Manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more
text: cartridges - THOONK THOONK - in the smoking chamber.
text: Hi doubles back once again toward the back aisle.
text: He is still several paces from the end of the lane when the
text: Policeman appears there, squaring to face him.
text: The Policeman is in front of him. The MANAGER is blowing out
text: groceries on the shelves behind him.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON POLICEMAN
text: As he coolly levels his police special and takes aim at Hi .
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN'S POV
text: Still on the dead run, Hi is flinging the carton of Huggies.
text: The carton rockets straight at the camera.
scene_heading: BACK TO POLICEMAN
text: Futilely raising his gun to avoid-impact: The Huggies catch
text: him square on the chest. The force makes him stumble one
text: fatal step backwards - into the back aisle - where:
text: CRASH - He is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing
text: shopping cart, propelled by an hysterically screaming SHOPPER.
text: TRACKING ON SHOPPER
text: Racing on down the back aisle, bellowing.
speaker_heading: HER FEET
text: Tracking from in front. Beyond her we can see the pack of
text: furiously barking dogs, nipping at her heels. They boil over
text: the prostrate Officer Steensma, and this is the last we see
dialog: of him in this movie.
scene_heading: EXT. STORE
text: As Hi emerges through the back door. Ed is just skidding
text: around the corner.
text: Hi scrambles in the passenger side.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Raking two-shot with Hi in the foreground. The car peels out
dialog: of the lot.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Thank you honey, you really didn't
dialog: have to do this-
text: THWAK - Ed gives him a good hard slap and Hi's head rolls
text: toward the camera.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You son-of-a-bitch! You're actin'
dialog: like a mad dog!
text: Rubbing his jaw:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Turn left, honey.
text: Still at top speed, she leans into a hard left, tires
text: squealing.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What if me'n the baby'd been picked
dialog: up? Nathan Jr. would a been accessory
dialog: to armed robbery!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Nawww honey, it ain't armed robbery
dialog: if the gun ain't loaded-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What kind of home life is this for a
dialog: toddler?! You're supposed to be an
dialog: example!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Now honey, I never postured myself
dialog: as the three-piece suit type - Turn
dialog: left, dear.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We got a child now, everything's
dialog: changed!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well Nathan Jr. accepts me for what
dialog: I am and I think you better had,

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know, but honey -
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: See I come from a long line of

dialog: types.
text: Hi's eyes are fixed on something in the road ahead.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm not gonna live this way, Hi. It
dialog: just ain't family life!
text: Hi's attention is still on the road. He is opening his door,
text: even though the car is still racing along. He absently
dialog: concedes:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well... It ain't Ozzie and Harriet.
text: LOW ANGLE THE STREET
text: In the extreme foreground sits the first carton of Huggies

speaker_heading: REVERSE

scene_heading: TRAILER LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: ED

scene_heading: ON GALE AND EVELLE
text: They look up, dumbstruck and mortified, from the sofa where
dialog: the have been watching TV.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Tomorrow morning. Now I got nothing
dialog: against you personally...
text: Gale and Evelle look appealingly toward Hi, who shifts
text: uncomfortably behind Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...but you're wanted by the
dialog: authorities and you're a bad influence
dialog: in this household, in my opinion.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Well ma'am... we sure didn't mean to
dialog: influence anyone.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: And if we did, we apologize.
text: Ed is unmoved.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm goin' in to town tomorrow to see
dialog: about some shots for the baby. When
dialog: I come back you better be gone or
dialog: I'll kick you out myself.
text: She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.
text: There is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and
text: Evelle stares at the ceiling. Finally Evelle turns to Hi.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: ...What's he need, his dip-tet?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I'm awful sorry boys, but when Ed
dialog: gets mad, you know, when she gets an

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Well there ain't a thing to apologize
dialog: for, H.I...
text: He looks at Evelle.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...It seems pretty clear what the

speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Yeah, I guess the Missus wants us to

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Now H.I., you'll pardon me for sayin'
dialog: so, but I get the feelin' that this-
dialog: here...
text: His gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire
dialog: domestic situation.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...ain't exactly workin' out.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well now Ed's generally a real
dialog: sweetheart, I-
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And as per usual, I wouldn't be
dialog: surprised if the source of the marital
dialog: friction was financial.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well, matter of fact, I did lose my
dialog: job today-
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Come on Hi. you're young, you got
dialog: your health - what do you want with
dialog: a job?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: But look, I'd rather light a candle
dialog: than curse your darkness. As you
dialog: know, Evelle'n I never go anywhere
dialog: without a reason... and here we are
dialog: in your little domicile. We come to
dialog: invite you in on a score.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: A bank, Hi.
text: Hi is shaking his head.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Aw boys, I don't-
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I know you're partial to convenience
dialog: stores but, H.I., the sun don't rise
text: and set on the corner grocery.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: It's like Doc Schwartz says: You
dialog: gotta have a little ambition. Why we
dialog: just heard on the news how somebody
text: snatched off one of the Arizona
dialog: babies. Now there's someone thinkin'
dialog: big.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And here you are sittin' around on
dialog: your butt playin' house with a -
dialog: don't get me wrong, H.I., with a
dialog: fine woman - but a woman who needs
text: the button-down type.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well now that ain't really any of
dialog: your-
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Just lookahere...
text: He is handing Hi a folded-up picture.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Picture of El Dorado, Hi.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Though the locals call it the Farmers
dialog: and Mechanics Bank of LaGrange. Looks
dialog: like a hayseed bank and, tell you
text: the truth, it is a hayseed bank.
dialog: Except the last Friday of every
dialog: financial quarter there's more cash
text: in that bank than flies at a barbecue.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: And guess what day it is tomorrow?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Ya see, H.I., it's when the hayseeds
dialog: come in to cash their farm subsidy
dialog: checks.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: A-One information.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Got it in the joint from a guy named
dialog: Lawrence Spivey, one of Dick Nixon's
dialog: undersecretaries of agriculture.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: He's in for solicitin' sex from a
dialog: state trooper.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Ordinarily we don't associate with
dialog: that class of person, but...
text: Gale chuckles.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...he was tryin' to make brownie
text: points with some of the boys.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Boys, I can't -
speaker_heading: EVIELLE
dialog: We need someone handy with a scatter-
dialog: gun to cover the hayseeds while we
dialog: get the cash.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Y'understand, H.I., if this works
dialog: out it's just the beginning of a
text: spree across the entire Southwest
dialog: proper. We keep goin' 'till we can
dialog: retire - or we get caught.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Either way we're fixed for life.
text: Hi is still shaking his head.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Boys, it's a kind offer, but you're
dialog: suggesting I just up'n leave Ed. Now
dialog: that'd be pretty damn cowardly,
dialog: wouldn't it.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Would it? Think about it, H.I. Seems
dialog: to me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin'
dialog: her any good. And y'ain't bein' true
dialog: to your own nature.
text: The camera has floated in to a close shot of Hi, staring
text: glumly at GALE.
scene_heading: TRACKING ON MOTORCYCLE NIGHT
text: Following it, very close, we see only its rear wheel and
text: fender and twin exhaust pipes, one on either side. Flame is
text: boiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars.
scene_heading: HIGHER TRACKING SHOT
text: From behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night.
text: With the sharp whipcrack effect he suddenly looks left,
text: searching. With a second whipcrack effect he suddenly looks
text: right, still searching.
text: He banks into a turn.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER
text: Creeping in. Late at night. We are tracking in toward the
text: one window that is illuminated, with a feeble yellow light.
text: In voice-over, Hi is composing a letter.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: My dearest Edwinna. Tonight as you
text: and Nathan slumber, my heart is filled
text: with anguish.
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER
text: Creeping in on Hi 's hunched back, as he sits over the kitchen
text: table writing the letter. The yellow lamp sitting on the
text: table is the only light on in the trailer.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I hope that you will both
dialog: understand, and forgive me for what
dialog: I have decided I must do. By the
dialog: time you read this, I will be gone.
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Creeping in on GALE and EVELLE, sprawled on the sofa and
text: easy chair respectively, sawing boards.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I will never be the man that you
dialog: want me to be, the husband and father
dialog: that you and Nathan deserve...
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: Still creeping in.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Maybe it's my upbringing; maybe it's
dialog: just that my genes got screwed up -
dialog: I don't know...
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
scene_heading: INT. 7-ELEVEN
text: Creeping in on the pimply-faced Cashier, sitting asleep behind
text: the counter, a dirty magazine lying face-down, open on his
text: chest.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: But the events of the last day have
dialog: showed, amply, that I don't have the
dialog: strength of character to raise up a
dialog: family...
text: We are slowly panning over to the newspaper rack, revealing
text: tomorrow's headline: "WHERE IS NATHAN JR.?"
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...in the manner befitting a
dialog: responsible adult, and not like the
dialog: wild man from Borneo.
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
speaker_heading: ARIZONA HOME
text: Creeping in on Nathan Jr. in the living room, asleep in his
text: ottoman armchair, lit only by the snow from the TV set he is
text: facing, a half-full glass of milk on the coffee table next
text: to him.
text: His robe is disheveled; his eyeglasses have slid down his
text: nose.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I say all this to my shame.
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
scene_heading: TRAILER BEDROOM
text: Creeping in on Ed and Nathan Jr., asleep together in the
text: double bed. Ed's arm is draped protectively over the sleeping
dialog: infant.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I will love you always, truly and
dialog: deeply. But I fear that if I stay I
dialog: would only bring bad trouble...
text: We start to hear the rumble of the motorcycle mix up again.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...on the heads of you and Nathan
dialog: Jr.
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Night sky. The motorcycle tire enters frame as the bike comes
text: to a halt. The Biker plants a jackbooted foot in the
text: foreground.
text: The engine rumbles.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: I feel the thunder gathering even
dialog: now; if I leave, hopefully, it will
dialog: leave with me.
text: We are craning up over the Biker's back to reveal what he is
text: looking at: We are on a bluff overlooking the trailer park.
text: In the window of one trailer below, a yellow light glows.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I cannot tarry...
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: Still creeping in.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Better I should go, send you money,
dialog: and let you curse my name. Your
dialog: loving... Herbert.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FIRE
text: Roaring at the cut. Through it we can see the Biker sitting
text: on the ground, legs stretched out in front of him, back
text: resting against his parked motorcycle, arms folded across
text: his chest.
text: Perfectly motionless, he stares at the campfire.
text: We are floating in toward him.
text: As we come closer, eventually drawing in to a close shot of
text: his face, we gradually realize something peculiar about his
text: eyes: He seems to have none. Although his eyes are
text: unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs, but only fire -
text: either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring -
text: burning-inside.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT DOOR MAT
text: It reads: "Come On In! To Unpainted Arizona."
text: The smoking butt of a cheroot is dropped onto the mat. A
text: jackbooted foot grinds it out.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BAR ON GLASS DOOR
text: Leading into the showroom. The Biker's mail-and-chained fist
text: pushes the door open.
text: LOW WIDE TRACKING SHOT
text: Behind the jackboots as they stroll through a showroom of
text: unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures.
text: TRACKING ON THE MAILED HAND
text: Swinging as he walks, the Biker's hand produces a fresh
text: cheroot from no apparent source-either sleight-of-hand or
dialog: magic.
scene_heading: THE OTHER HAND
text: Similarly producing a long wooden match.
scene_heading: DISCOLORED TEETH
text: Biting down on the cigar.
speaker_heading: HAND
text: Dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface
text: of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar.
text: The match erupts into roaring flame.
speaker_heading: CIGAR
text: Crackling as it is lit.
speaker_heading: DOOR
text: Reading "Executive Offices." The mailed fist pushes it open.
scene_heading: PEBBLED GLASS DOOR
text: From the inside of the office. The name on the pebbled glass
dialog: is a backwards Nathan Arizona.
text: There is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled
text: voices.
scene_heading: SECRETARY'S VOICE
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Arizona, he just barged
dialog: in...
text: The door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle-
text: aged secretary hanging at his elbow.
scene_heading: SECRETARY'S VOICE
dialog: ...Should I call Dewayne?
text: Nathan is staring toward his desk.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Hell no, why wake the security guard.
dialog: I'll take care a this.
text: The secretary leaves.
speaker_heading: NATHAN'S POV
text: The Biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily
text: on the desk.
text: His head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement
text: in the air in front of him.
text: BACK TO NATHAN
text: Eyes on the Biker he slams the door shut behind him, looking
dialog: for some reaction.
speaker_heading: BIKER
text: No reaction. His head continues to bob and duck.
text: BACK TO NATHAN
text: Circling the Biker as he crosses to sit behind his desk.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Arcing around to reveal the Biker's face. He still does not
text: react to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance.
text: His eyes continue to follow some phantom movement.
text: When the Biker speaks it is still without looking at Nathan,
text: and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner:
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: You got flies.
text: He finally looks at Nathan, and smiles faintly.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I doubt it. This place's climate-
text: controlled, all the windows are
dialog: sealed. Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Name of Leonard Smalls. My friends
dialog: call me Lenny...
text: He takes a drag on his cigar.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: ...Only I ain't got no friends.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Stop, you'll make me bust out crying.
dialog: Listen Leonard, you want some
text: furniture or a shitbox, they're out
text: on the sales floor.
text: SMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head.
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: Nooo, I ain't a customer, I'm a
dialog: manhunter. Ordinarily. Though I do
dialog: hunt babies, on occasion. Hear you
dialog: got one you can't put your hand to.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: What do you know about it?
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: Wal, that's my business. I'm a tracker-
dialog: part Hopi Indian, some say part hound
text: dog. When some dink skips bail,
dialog: crashes outta the joint, I'm the man
dialog: they call.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Mister, I got the cops, the state
dialog: troopers and the Federal-B-I already
dialog: lookin' for my boy. Now if you got
dialog: information I strongly advise-
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: Cop won't find your boy. Cop couldn't
dialog: find his own butt if it had a bell
dialog: on it. Wanna find an outlaw, call an
dialog: outlaw. Wanna find a Dunkin Donuts,
dialog: call a cop.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Smalls, first off, take your damn
text: feet off m'furniture. Second off,
dialog: it's widely known I posted a twenty
dialog: grand reward for my boy. If you can
dialog: find him, claim it. Short of that
dialog: what do we got to talk about?
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: Price. Fair price. And that ain't
dialog: whatever you say it is; fair price
dialog: is what the market'll bear. Now there
dialog: are people, mind you, there are people
dialog: in this land, who'll pay a lot more'n
dialog: twenty grand for a healthy baby.
text: Nathan is looking at him stonily.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: What're you after?
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: Give you an idea, when I was a lad I
dialog: m'self fetched twenty-five thousand
dialog: on the black market. And them's 1954
dialog: dollars. I'm sayin, fair price. For
dialog: fifty grand I'll track him, find him-
text: Quick as a flash the heretofore languid Smalls bolts forward,
text: his fist stopped an inch short of Nathan's nose.
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE SHOT SMALLS' FINGERS
text: His index finger and thumb are pinched together-holding the
text: leg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: ...and the people that took him...
text: He flicks the fly away.
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: ...I'll kick their butts.
text: He sits back down.
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: ...No extra charge.
text: Nathan stares grimly at Smalls.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: And if I don't pay?
speaker_heading: SMALLS
dialog: Oh I'll get your boy regardless.
dialog: Cause if you don't pay, the market
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You wanna know what I think? I think
dialog: you're an evil man. I think this is
dialog: nothin' but a goddamn screw job. I
dialog: think it's a shakedown. I think you're
dialog: the one took Nathan Jr. and my fine
dialog: friend, I think you're the one gonna
dialog: get his butt kicked...
text: Nathan swivels to punch numbers on a telephone.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I think I'm on the phone to the cops
dialog: right now, and I-
text: He swivels back, looking up, and his speech stops short.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The office is empty. A whipcrack effect builds to the cut
dialog: and:
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON HI
text: His eyes snap open as the whipcrack echoes away.
text: He has been slumped over the kitchen table, asleep.
speaker_heading: GALE (O.S.)
dialog: Up and attem, H.I. Today is the first
dialog: day of the rest of your life...
speaker_heading: EVELLE (O.S.)
dialog: ...and already you're fuckin' it up.
text: Hi looks up.
text: Gale and Evelle are smiling down at him.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Come on, the missus'll be back from
text: town soon.
text: Hi takes the envelope that he was slumped over, to Ed written
text: on its face. As he sticks it to the refrigerator door with a
dialog: broccoli magnet:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Where's the baby?
speaker_heading: EVELLE
text: Bedroom, in his crib.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: He's sawin' toothpicks, he'll be
dialog: fine.
text: There is a harsh knock at the door. All three tense.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...You expectin' anybody?
text: Hi is staring. The knock comes again.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: No. You two stay outta sight.
text: He goes to the door, pulls back its shade and peeks out.
text: Under his breath:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Shit.
text: He opens the door.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER
text: It is Glen. He backs nervously down to the foot of the stoop
text: as Hi stands in the half open doorway. Glen comes to rest a
text: few feet away from the stoop.
text: He is wearing a neckbrace. The bridge of his eyeglasses is
text: taped together. Cotton wadding is stuffed up his nose, which
text: is darkly discolored. He holds a rolled up newspaper.
text: His station wagon is parked behind him, idling.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Morning Glen.
text: Glen speaks in a very nasal voice:
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I ain't comin' in if ya don't mind.
dialog: I'll just keep my distance.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I didn't invite you in, Glen.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well don't even bother. First off,
dialog: you're fired - and that's official.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I kinda figured that, Glen.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well that ain't why I'm here neither.
dialog: No sir. You're in a whole shitload
dialog: of trouble, my friend.
text: Hi is looking at him evenly.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Why don't you just calm down, Glen.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Why don't you make me?! Know that
dialog: little baby you got in there? Remember
dialog: him? I know what his real name is!
text: Hi is suddenly nervous and urgent:
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Wanna keep your voice down, Glen?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'll pitch my voice wherever I please!
dialog: His name ain't Hi Jr.! His name ain't
dialog: Ed Jr.! But it's junior an right!
dialog: Yes sir, it's Nathan Jr.!
text: Hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand.
text: Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by
text: resting a hand on the door of his station wagon.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Stay away from me, McDunnough!
text: Hi stops short. Glen smiles.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Sure, you're an awful big man
dialog: when you got somethin' around to
dialog: clobber a guy with!
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I ain't a big man.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: That's right! And now you're at my
dialog: mercy!
text: He spits on the dirt in front of him.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...I'm your worst nightmare! I wanted
dialog: to just turn you in for the re-ward.
dialog: But Dot, she wants something to
dialog: cuddle. So it looks like that baby's
dialog: gonna be Glen Jr. From now on!
text: Hi's face is set in rigid dismay.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...I'll give you a day to break the
dialog: news to Ed...
text: Glen is getting into his car.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...Dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him
dialog: up.
text: He slams the door.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: ...It's either that or jail. Oh and
dialog: say, that reminds me! You'll find a
dialog: doctor bill in the mail in a few
dialog: days. I recommend you pay it!
text: And the car squeals off.
text: Hi looks back at the trailer.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: A slat in the window blind drops back into place.
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: He opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER
text: Evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in
text: his arms.
text: Hi moves toward Evelle. His teeth are set; he means business.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: What's goin' on here.
text: Gale steps in front of Hi.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: You know what's goin' on, H.I. It's
dialog: just business. Now this can go either
dialog: hard or easy-
text: Hi gives Gale a hard push to get past him. Gale staggers
text: back but recovers and grabs Hi in a bear hug.
text: Hi flips Gale. Gale lands on a coffee table which flips up
text: and crashes back down.
text: Evelle is dancing back out of Hi's reach. As Hi lunges for
text: him the prostrate Gale grabs his legs.
text: Hi goes down hard.
text: Gale leaps to his feet and - CRASH - bangs his head up against
text: an overhanging lamp. Both of his hands fly up to massage the
text: top of his head.
text: THOOMP - Hi's fist flies into frame to connect with Gale's
text: unguarded stomach. Gale doubles over, clutching at his gut.
text: Hi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands.
text: With Gale's bowed head a target in front of him, Hi swings
text: his hands up over his head.
text: Hi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the
text: too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles.
text: Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid-
text: body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall.
text: Gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch.
text: The reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but
text: doesn't stop the punch.
text: It connects with Hi's jaw.
text: Gale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it.
text: Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes
text: through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there.
text: Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with
text: both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with
text: pain, twist around and present his back to him.
text: Hi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face.
text: Gale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He
text: grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of
text: the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two
text: feet.
text: Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too-
text: small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet
text: flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall
text: fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him
text: loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in
text: pain and fury.
text: Close shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and
text: grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and
text: clutching at it.
text: Evelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing
text: furniture and flailing body parts.
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE SHOT THE TRAILER
text: At the cut Gale's roaring drops out. We hear the chirping of
text: birds and the laughter of children playing in the
dialog: neighborhood.
text: It is a sunny day.
scene_heading: BACK TO INT. TRAILER
text: Gale still roars. With a last mighty effort, he finally swings
text: Hi off his body.
text: Hi crashes against a wall and through it to land in the:
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Amid a shower of plaster dust and lath. Hi has landed,
text: groggily, against the toilet.
text: Evelle enters now with his hands free, apparently having set
text: the baby down somewhere.
text: He yanks the cord off the bathroom blinds.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Hi is seated in a straight-back chair, still violently
text: struggling but Gale's arms are wrapped around him from behind.
text: Evelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the
dialog: chair.
text: No one talks; there is nothing left to say.
text: Finished, Gale goes to the door and Evelle goes to the
text: bedroom. He emerges with the baby and precedes Gale out the
text: door, Gale slamming it behind him.
text: Hi starts bucking and struggling, weeping tears of rage and
text: frustration. He succeeds only in tipping forward, face down
text: into the carpet, the strapped-on chair pressing down on top
dialog: of him.
text: His profile is pressed into the carpet.
text: Offscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: At carpet level. Gale's shoes enter his field of vision.
text: They stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the
text: living room.
speaker_heading: OBJECTIVE SHOT
text: As Gale paws through the wreckage to expose the copy of Dr.
text: Spock's Baby and Child Care. He grabs the book.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: The feet walk away and leave his field of vision.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON HI
text: As we hear the door slam shut with horrible finality.
text: Hi's mouth stretches wide. He ROARS with grief and
dialog: frustration.
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: Moving down the road toward an oncoming car. As the oncoming
text: car gets closer we can see Gale and Evelle in its front seat.
text: As the car passes we pan with it, to reveal that we have
text: been shooting from the inside of another car, and we hold on
text: the profile of its driver: Ed. She has just watched the other
text: car shoot past.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Good.
scene_heading: QUICK FADE OUT
scene_heading: INT. DEVASTATED TRAILER
text: As Ed sits heavily into frame, apparently in shock, her frozen
text: profile to the camera as she stares straight ahead into space.
text: Her foreground hand absently holds a length of cord.
text: Beyond her in the middle background Hi is rummaging in the
text: debris. He stands up, cropped from the chest down and starts
text: loading bullets into the chamber of Ed's .38 police special.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: I know you're worried honey but
dialog: believe me, there ain't a thing to
dialog: worry about. We're gonna get him
dialog: back, there just ain't no question
dialog: about that...
text: He snaps the chamber shut and leaves frame, still talking.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...We'll get him back, that's just
dialog: all there is to it. And you wanna
dialog: know another thing?
text: He is walking back into frame holding another handgun now in
text: addition to the .38, this one an automatic.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...I'm gonna be a better person from
dialog: here on out. And that's final, I
dialog: mean that's absolutely the way it's
dialog: gonna be, that's official. You were
dialog: right and I was wrong...
text: He snaps a clip into the automatic.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...A blind man could tell you that.
dialog: Now they ain't gonna hurt him, they're
dialog: just in it for the score...
text: Hi is leaving frame again, continuing to talk as we hear him
text: rummaging offscreen.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...But I ain't like that no more,
dialog: I'm a changed man. You were right
dialog: and I was wrong. We got a family
dialog: here and I'm gonna start acting
dialog: responsibly...
text: Hi enters frame with the two handguns stuck in his belt,
text: holding his pump-action shotgun.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...So let's go honey...
text: He primes the shotgun: WHOOSH-CLACK.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Let's go get Nathan Jr.
scene_heading: TRACKING SHOT

text: Jr., occasionally bouncing him.
dialog: Contemplatively:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I luuuuv to drive.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: You said somethin' there, partner.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...Yessir, I figure with the ransom
dialog: and this bank, you'n I'll be sittin'
text: in the fabled catbird seat.
text: Evelle is looking down at the baby, shifting him in his lap.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Uh, Gale... Junior had a, uh,
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What's that, pardner?
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: He had a little accident.
text: Gale looks over.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Wuddya mean, he looks okay.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: No, ya see... Movin' though we are,
dialog: he just had hisself a rest stop.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Well it's perfectly natural.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: (very excited)
dialog: Hey Gale!
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What now?
text: Evelle, beaming, looks up from the baby to Gale.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: ...He smiled at me!
speaker_heading: THE SUN
text: A huge rumbling rippling red ball that fills the frame.
text: As we hear his footfalls on concrete steps, Smalls rises
text: into frame, apparently climbing a stoop. The sun behind him
text: throws him into silhouette; the extreme telephoto flattens
text: him against the sun. Heat waves ripple between us and him,
text: making his figure slightly waver.
text: The rumble builds, louder and louder, until it is snapped
dialog: off by a-
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER
text: CLICK. The front door handle clicks open and Smalls stands
text: in the doorway. The abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet.
text: The room is a complete shambles from the fight. Sunlight
text: filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke
text: from Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light.
text: After only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene,
text: Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and
text: nudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of
dialog: paper.
text: He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes, with a
text: soft grunt of surprise.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: At knee-height on the wall in front of him, "FART" is scrawled
text: in crayon.
text: BACK TO SMALLS
text: As he stands up with the piece of paper.
speaker_heading: THE PAPER
text: It is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE
text: Close on a carton of diapers being set down on the check-out
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: EVELLE (O.S.)
dialog: Know how you put these thangs on?
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Evelle and the Cashier, a late-middle-aged man (perhaps the
text: proprietor of this small mom-and-pop store) face each other
text: across the check-out counter. Evelle has various baby
text: purchases - the diapers, baby food, etc. - piled on the
text: counter. The Cashier is ringing them up.
text: Through the open door beyond them we can see a strip of the
text: parking lot.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
text: Welp. Around the butt, then up over
dialog: the groin area-
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: I know where they go, old timer. I
dialog: mean do I need pins or fasteners?
text: We see Gale trotting past through the visible part of the
text: parking lot, cooing "Weeeeee!" as he holds Nathan Jr. Up
text: over his head.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Well no, they got those tape-ettes
text: already on there, it's self-contained
text: and fairly explanatory.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Uh-huh...
text: He takes a plastic-covered squirt gun off a display rack and
text: drops it on the counter. He is looking around at the other
text: impulse purchases displayed by the register; he unhooks a
text: bag of balloons.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
text: ...These blow up into funny shapes
dialog: at all?
text: Gale is trotting by in the opposite direction: "Weeeeee!"
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Well no. Unless round is funny.
text: Evelle is pulling a gun out of his belt.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: All right, I'll take these too. Now
dialog: you lie down back there-
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Yessir!
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: And don't you move till you've counted
dialog: up to eight hundred and twenty-five
text: and then backwards down to zero.
dialog: I'll be back to check - see y'ain't
dialog: cheatin'.
text: The Cashier is already down on the floor, out of frame.
speaker_heading: CASHIER (O.S.)
dialog: You the diaper burglar?
text: As he heads for the door with the groceries:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Looks like I'm one of 'em.
scene_heading: EXT. STORE
text: As Evelle hurriedly emerges with the two bags. Faintly we
text: can hear the Cashier bellowing: "One one thousand, two one
dialog: thousand..."
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Get the door, will ya?
text: Gale is slipping the baby back into his car seat, which sits
text: on the roof of the car. He starts doing up the straps.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: He's a real cheerful little critter
dialog: once he warms up to ya.
text: Hands free now, Gale reaches for the back door.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Hurry up Gale...
text: Gale has the door open. Evelle starts throwing in the
dialog: groceries.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: I don't know how high this one can
dialog: count.
scene_heading: GALE AND EVELLE'S CAR
text: Gale drives as Evelle sorts through his purchases.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: I got him some baby grub... baby
dialog: wipes... diapers, disposable... packet
dialog: of balloons-
speaker_heading: GALE
text: They blow up into funny shapes at
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: No, just-
text: Gale is looking around, puzzled.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Say, where's Junior?
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Wuddya mean, didn't you put him in?!
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: No, I thought-
text: The two men look at each other.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: The two men's heads whip around to look in the back seat.
text: BACK TO FRONT ANGLE
text: They look at each other in horror.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Where'd we leave him?!
text: The two men's eyes widen as they remember at the same time:
text: both look up at the roof of the car.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON GALE'S FOOT
text: Coming off the accelerator.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON EVELLE
text: Screaming as he watches the foot:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
text: NOOOOOO!!
dialog: But too late.
speaker_heading: GALE'S FOOT
text: Already plunging down on the brake. SQUEEEEEEEAL...
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
text: Evelle is screaming at the top of his lungs as the car rocks
text: to a stop. He peers through the windshield, still screaming,
text: but nothing has shot off the roof of the car.
text: He cranes his neck to look up the slant of the windshield
text: toward the roof. This of course gives him no view; still
text: screaming, he thrusts his body out his open window to look
text: up at the roof. His scream is muted as his head disappears
text: from view, then comes back full force as he ducks back in,
text: frantically shaking his head.
text: With this Gale's last hope disappears and he starts bellowing
dialog: also.
speaker_heading: GALE'S FOOT
text: Rising from the brake to plunge down on the accelerator.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAR
text: As it hangs a squealing U-turn and races off at top speed.
scene_heading: LOW WIDE SHOT
text: In the foreground Nathan Jr. sits upright in his car seat,
text: in the middle of the road that fronts the convenience store.
text: He is placidly looking at the scenery.
text: Faintly, we hear the Cashier bellowing:
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: ...Seven hunnert ninety-seven one
dialog: thousand, seven hunnert ninety-six
dialog: one thousand...
scene_heading: GALE AND EVELLE
text: In their speeding car, both staring out at the road ahead,
text: mouths gaping, emitting ear-splitting screams.
scene_heading: INT. STORE
text: Shot faces the front of the store with some of the street
text: visible outside. The Cashier on the floor is out of frame,
text: but we can hear him loud and clear:
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: ...Seven hunnert ninety-one one
dialog: thousand, seven hunnert - ah...
dialog: bullshit.
text: He rises into frame, back to the camera, just as: We see
text: Gale and Evelle's car, through the front window, roaring up
text: the street. Quick as a shot, the Cashier has dropped back
text: out of frame and resumes bellowing:
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Seven hunnert ninety - ought one
dialog: thousand! Seven hundred eighty -
text: The car is starting to squeal to a screaming halt.
text: BACK TO LOW WIDE SHOT
text: With Nathan Jr. in the foreground. Gale and Evelle's car
text: comes to a rocking halt behind - and inches shy of - the
dialog: baby.
text: Evelle's door is already open. He bolts from it and runs
text: over to the baby, blubbering. He picks up the car seat and
dialog: Nathan Jr.
text: Gale is also getting out of the car.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Promise we ain't never gonna give
dialog: him up, Gale! We ain't never gonna
dialog: let him go!
text: Gale, choked up, speaks in a low unsteady voice:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: We'll never give him up, Evelle.
dialog: He's our little Gale Jr. now.
speaker_heading: HI AND ED'S CAR
text: Hi driving. Both are staring wordlessly ahead at the road.
text: Hi looks over at Ed, glum but trying to be kind.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Ed, I realize I can't be much of
dialog: a comfort to you. But lemme just say
dialog: this...
text: He is nodding to himself.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: You'll feel a whole lot better when-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't wanna feel better.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Honey-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't care about myself anymore. I
dialog: don't care about us anymore. I just
dialog: want Nathan Junior back safe.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I know that-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: If we don't get him back safe, I
dialog: don't wanna go on livin'. And even
dialog: if we do, I don't wanna go on livin'
dialog: with you.
dialog: This shuts Hi up.
text: After a moment:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I guess I still love you Hi; I
dialog: know I do. I ain't even blaming you.
dialog: The whole thing was crazy and the
dialog: whole thing was my idea.
text: Hi clears his throat.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well, factually, I myself bear a
dialog: very large-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Lemme finish. Since those jailbirds
dialog: took little Nathan I been doin' some
dialog: thinking, and I ain't too proud of
dialog: myself. Even if Mrs. Arizona had
dialog: more'n she could handle, I was a
dialog: police officer sworn to uphold the
dialog: Constitution of the United States -
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Now waitaminute honey, you resigned
dialog: before we-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That ain't the point, Hi. We don't
dialog: deserve Nathan Jr. Any more'n those
dialog: jailbirds do. And if I'm as selfish
dialog: and irresponsible as you-
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Y'ain't that bad, honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: If I'm as bad as you, what good're
dialog: we to each other. You'n me's just a
dialog: fool's paradise.
scene_heading: FARMERS AND MECHANICS BANK

scene_heading: GALE AND EVELLE
text: Sitting in the front seat of their idling car, looking at
dialog: the bank.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
text: There she is.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Yep. Welp...
text: They look at each other. Gale reaches for his door.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...Let's do her.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Waitaminute. What do we do with Gale
dialog: Jr.?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Wuddya mean, he waits here.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Are you crazy?! He can't wait here
dialog: by hisself. Supposin' we get killed
dialog: in there - it could be hours before
text: he's discovered.
scene_heading: INT. FARMERS AND MECHANICS BANK
text: As Gale and Evelle bang in through the door. Evelle holds a
text: shotgun; Gale holds a shotgun in one hand and Nathan Jr. in
text: his car seat in the other.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: All right you hayseeds, it's a stick-
dialog: up! Everbody freeze! Everbody down
dialog: on the ground!
text: Everyone freezes, staring at Gale and Evelle. An Old Hayseed
text: with his hands in the air speaks up:
speaker_heading: HAYSEED
dialog: Well which is it young fella? You
dialog: want I should freeze or get down on
dialog: the ground? Mean to say, iffen I
dialog: freeze, I can't rightly drop. And
dialog: iffen I drop, I'm a gonna be in
dialog: motion. Ya see -
speaker_heading: GALE
speaker_heading: SHUTUP!
dialog: Promptly:
speaker_heading: HAYSEED
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Everone down on the ground!
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Y'all can just forget that part about
dialog: freezin'.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: That is until they get down there.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Y'all hear that?
text: There is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on
dialog: the ground.
text: Gale is tossing Evelle a sack.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Wanna fill that sack, pardner? We
dialog: got - shit!
text: He is looking in shock at the tellers' counter.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...Where'd all the tellers go?
text: There is no one behind the counter.
text: A muffled voice from offscreen:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We're down here, sir.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: They're down on the ground like you
dialog: commanded, Gale.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I told you not to use m'damn name!
dialog: Can't you even try to keep from
dialog: forget'n that?!
text: Evelle is momentarily abashed, but then brightens:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Not even yer code name?
text: Gale registers understanding.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Oh yeah... m'code name.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: Y'all hear that?
text: There is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: All right now everone, we're just
dialog: about ready to begin the robbery
dialog: proper...
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE CAR
text: The camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad
text: car, looking past its flashing gumballs.
text: The car is approaching the townlet, its siren wailing.
text: BACK TO THE BANK
text: A teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags.
text: Close on her hands, we see her putting in a cash packet that
text: is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding
text: a small plastic device.
text: The teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking;
text: she shoves it into the sack.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: All right now everyone, you know how
dialog: this works: Y'all stay flattened for
dialog: ten full minutes...
text: He is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to Gale, who
text: also picks up the baby. As the two are backing toward the
dialog: door:
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: ...We might come back in five to
dialog: check. That's for us to know and y'a
text: to find out.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Anyone found bipedal in five wears
text: his ass for a hat.
text: They bolt out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICECAR
text: Siren jumps in loud at the cut. It is the same locked-down
text: shot over the gumballs.
scene_heading: EXT. GALE AND EVELLE'S CAR
text: Peeling out from in front of the bank.
scene_heading: INT. GALE AND EVELLE'S CAR
text: Gale is driving; Evelle starts pawing through one of the
dialog: sacks.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: That old timer threw off my
dialog: concentration. Otherwise it would a
dialog: gone smoother.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: We done okay. Yessir. This ought to
dialog: split nicely three ways.
text: A thought registers with Gale and Evelle at the same moment.
text: They look at each other. They both twist frantically to look
text: in the back seat.
dialog: Bellowing:
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Goddamnit! Ya never leave a man
dialog: behind!
text: KA-POP! With a loud flat crack something detonates in the
text: front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with
text: bright blue paint.
text: Gale and Evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage,
text: fear and incomprehension. Blue dollar bills snap and flutter
text: around the inside of the car.
text: The car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind, the inside
text: of the windshield covered with blue paint. He reaches forward
text: to wipe clear a patch of windshield.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: As the blue paint is smeared away we see Hi and Ed's car
text: parked broadside in the middle of the road. Hi and Ed are in
text: front of it, Hi aiming his scatter gun, Ed a revolver.
text: The guns spit orange flame.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: Down the barrel of his shotgun. The car with the blue interior
text: is swerving crazily at us, one front tire blown out.
text: Hi lets go with the other barrel.
text: The shot chews up the front grill, shatters one headlight
text: and blows out the other front tire. The hood of the car flies
dialog: open.
text: The car is squealing to a halt and Gale and Evelle pile out,
text: still bellowing.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Goddamnit H.I., ain't we got enough
dialog: to contend with?
text: Ed is running over to Gale and Evelle's car, throwing open
text: the back door to look for the baby but coming out only with
dialog: Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care.
text: Evelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief
text: at his own blue body.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Where's the baby?
text: Evelle points this way and that, in a state of confusion.
speaker_heading: EVELLE
dialog: I think we left him on the roof of
dialog: the... he must be back at the...
text: Hi and Ed are climbing into their car.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Let us come with you!
text: Hi and Ed are already peeling out.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ...He's our baby too!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON NATHAN JR.
text: Sitting placidly in his car seat that sits in the middle of
text: the road in front of the bank.
text: We can hear the wail of the police siren still approaching.
text: As we hold on Nathan Jr. we hear the distant booming of a
dialog: shotgun.
text: As we boom up to show the empty street beyond the baby, we
text: hear the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes.
text: The screech culminates in a loud explosion that snaps off
text: the siren wail. The police car is apparently history.
text: From beyond the crest of the road ahead a ball of flame has
text: leapt up with the explosion. As the explosion echoes and
text: fades we hear the deep rumble of an approaching engine.
text: Lenny Smalls' motorcycle appears over the rise. Framed against
text: fire and smoke, he is coming directly toward us, and the
dialog: baby.
scene_heading: FROM BEHIND HI AND ED
text: As they top a rise coming from the other direction. We see
text: the baby sitting in the middle of the street, and Lenny fast
text: approaching from the background.
text: LOCKED DOWN TO MOTORCYCLE
text: The extremely low wide shot, locked down to the speeding
text: bike, shows us rushing toward the rear of Nathan Jr's car
dialog: seat.
text: With a clank of chains Lenny's hand drops down into frame,
text: palm forward, tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are
text: almost upon.
text: A tattoo on Lenny's wrist reads "No Prisoners."
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Low shot with Nathan Jr. in the foreground.
text: He is scooped up and out of frame as Lenny roars by.
speaker_heading: ON LENNY
text: Roaring along. He hooks the car seat over his handlebars.
scene_heading: OVER HI AND ED'S SHOULDERS
text: Lenny is approaching. Under her breath:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What is he?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...D'you see him too?
text: Lenny is sawing a shotgun out of his back holster and leveling
text: it at the oncoming car.
text: Lenny is sighting down the gun, swinging it around as he
text: approaches the car.
scene_heading: HI AND ED DUCK JUST AS:
text: The shotgun spits orange flame and the windshield explodes
dialog: in.
text: Lenny roars by.
speaker_heading: LENNY'S POV
text: The baby on the handlebars in the foreground; the road rushing
text: by beyond him.
text: The bike banks into a hard turn.
scene_heading: FACING HI AND ED
text: Shooting through where the windshield used to be, cutting in
text: at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt.
text: Hi and Ed are raising their heads. Facing forward, they do
text: not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window.
text: He is sawing out his second shotgun.
text: Hi looks around, reaches and pulls Ed down beneath him just
dialog: as:
text: KA-BOOM! - The second shotgun roars and the back window spits
dialog: in.
text: As Lenny roars past the back window he casually flips
dialog: something in.
text: LOOKING DOWN AT HI AND ED
text: Folded over in the front seat. Below them something bounces
text: into and around the leg well - Lenny's grenade.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR
text: As the two front doors fly open and Hi and Ed spill out - Hi
text: from the driver's side, heading for the far side of the road,
text: and Ed from the passenger side.
speaker_heading: ON ED
text: As she dives for cover behind a parked car. Beyond her -
text: KABOOM! - their car explodes and bounces, pouring black smoke.
speaker_heading: ON HI
text: The explosion flings him to the ground in the middle of the
dialog: street.
text: THROUGH FIRE AND SMOKE
text: Looking up the street to where Lenny is wheeling his bike in
text: a U-turn. He is not finished yet.
text: Hi flat on his back, woozily shaking his head.
text: He weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: Looking down the length of his own body. His legs stretch
text: away in a V.
text: Crashing down from a wheelie, Lenny's roaring bike is almost
text: upon him - aiming up the middle of the V.
speaker_heading: HI
text: He rolls. As the bike is roaring by:
speaker_heading: HI'S HAND
text: Reaches and snags a chain on Lenny's passing boot.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off, leaving
text: him on his stomach in the middle of the road.
text: Hi looks up the road.
speaker_heading: HI'S POV
text: Lenny is again sluing the bike around.
scene_heading: REAR WHEEL OF BIKE

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I want that baby!
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: He reaches back to pull up his shirt, revealing a gun tucked
text: in his pants in the small of his back. He grabs the gun.
scene_heading: OVER LENNY'S SHOULDER
text: As Ed closes in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Gimme that baby, you warthog from
dialog: hell!
text: Lenny's arms rise into frame. With a roll of his wrists two
text: knives appear in his hands.
dialog: BACK TO HI
text: On his stomach, sighting down the gun toward Lenny.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Ed stepping into his line of fire, blocking Lenny.
scene_heading: FROM BEHIND LENNY
text: Raising an arm to stab.
text: Ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat, revealing:
text: Hi, behind her. He fires.
scene_heading: LENNYS HAND
text: Drilled by Hi's bullet, drops its knife.
text: The exit wound spurts, not flesh and blood, but a brief jet
text: of fire.
speaker_heading: LENNY
text: Quick as a flash hurling the other knife at Hi.
speaker_heading: HI
text: As the knife stings the gun out of his hand.
text: KNIFE ON THE GROUND AT LENNY'S FEET

speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Just lie down on the floor, missie.

scene_heading: TRACKING BEHIND LENNY

scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF BANK

speaker_heading: ALLEYWAY

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: THE BIKE

speaker_heading: HI AND ED
text: Lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods

speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Run along now, honey.
text: Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife.
text: Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as -

text: Behind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and
text: grabbing an ankle.
text: The shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona
text: nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib.
text: Lenny pulls. Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from
text: under the car.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Struggling to stand up.
text: Lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous
text: bear hug.
speaker_heading: HI'S ARMS
text: Crushed against Lenny. His hands paw futilely at Lenny's
text: chest.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: Lenny finally flings Hi away.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Landing in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him.
speaker_heading: LENNY
text: Tired of the fight: He saws out both shotguns
speaker_heading: THE HAMMERS
text: On the guns as Lenny's thumbs draw them back. He raises the
text: guns to fire.
speaker_heading: HI
text: The end of the road.
text: He wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front
text: of him - then stops, staring at:
speaker_heading: HI'S HAND
text: A hand grenade pin hangs, glinting, from one of his fingers.
text: Pawing at Lenny's chest he must have hooked his finger through
text: its ring.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Reacting.
speaker_heading: LENNY
text: Reacting to Hi reacting. He looks down.
scene_heading: LENNY'S CHEST
text: On the bandoliers across his chest, silver pins glint in all
text: the grenades - except one. Its squeeze-lever juts at a right
text: angle from the grenade.
scene_heading: LENNY'S FACE
text: Hi's jaw drops.
scene_heading: LENNY'S FEET
text: The lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Scrambling to his feet.
speaker_heading: LENNY
text: Trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands. In his panic
text: his fingers tangle in the trigger guards.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Starting to run.
speaker_heading: LENNY
text: Finally freeing his hands.
speaker_heading: HI
text: Diving behind the parked car.
scene_heading: LENNY'S CHEST
text: His hands fly in to wrap around the grenade - too late -
text: bright light:
speaker_heading: LENNY
text: Blows sky-high. There is a roar as if the earth were cracking
text: open and flame as if hell were slipping out.
text: We pan the fire to the sky.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
text: A white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness, clanking
text: softly. The top of the ladder arcs toward the camera.
speaker_heading: JUMP BACK
text: To the interior of the Arizona second-story nursery as the
text: ladder comes to rest against the window frame.
text: It is late at night; the nursery is dark and empty.
scene_heading: THE HEADBOARD
text: Of the unpainted crib with the burned-in names: Harry, Barry,
text: Larry, Garry, and Nathan Jr.
text: As we pull back from the headboard Ed's arms are gently
text: depositing the sleeping Nathan Jr. into the crib. Hi puts
text: the singed copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care next to
dialog: the baby.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Hi and Ed looking sadly down at the baby.
text: The silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze-me toy as
text: the lights are snapped on. Hi and Ed turn, startled.
scene_heading: NURSERY DOORWAY
text: Nathan stands in his jammies, hair disheveled, holding a gun
text: and squinting against the light.
text: Keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed, he slowly raises a
text: pair of eyeglasses to his nose.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: The hell is goin' on?
text: He advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Get away from there.
text: Hi and Ed back away from the crib.
text: Nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment.
text: He lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds
text: him to his chest. A tear forms at the corner of his eye.
text: Hi and Ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Waitaminute...
dialog: Hi and Ed Stop.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...I ain't through with you. What're
dialog: you doin' creepin' around here in
dialog: the dark? You in with Smalls?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Scuse me?
text: As he bounces the baby, studying Hi and Ed:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
text: Leonard Smalls, big fella rides a
dialog: Harley, dresses like a rock star?
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: No sir, that's who we saved him from.
dialog: It's a long story.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Suppose you tell it.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well, sir, in a re-ward situation,
dialog: they usually say no questions asked.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Do they.
text: Hi shrugs.
text: Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...All right, boy, I guess you got a
dialog: re-ward coming. Twenty thousand
dialog: dollars...
text: He turns around with a thought:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Or, if you need home furnishings,
dialog: I can give you a fine of credit at
dialog: any of my stores. Fact, that's the
dialog: way I'd rather handle it, for tax
dialog: reasons...
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Well-
text: Nathan throws his hands up in the air.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: But it's up to you.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Tell you the truth, I think we'd
dialog: prefer the ca-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We don't want no reward.
text: Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...We didn't bring him back for money.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, we could work it that way too.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Could I just look at him a little
dialog: bit more?
text: She stands looking into the crib. Hi steps up next to her
text: and puts an arm around her shoulder.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Be my guest, young lady... but would
dialog: you mind tellin' me exactly how you-
text: Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. Hi murmurs
text: something to comfort her.
text: Nathan is studying the two of them.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...You took him, didn't you? Wasn't
dialog: that biker a'tal.
text: Hi turns to face him. He speaks in a rush.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: I took him, sir, my wife had nothin'
dialog: to do with it. I crept in yon window
dialog: and-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (still crying)
dialog: We both did it. We didn't wanna hurt
dialog: him any; I just wanted to be a mama.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: It wasn't for money or nothin'. We
dialog: just figured you had more'n you could
dialog: handle, babywise. But I'm the one
dialog: committed the actual crime sir, if
dialog: you need to call the authorities-
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Shutup boy, no one's callin' the
dialog: authorities if there's no harm done.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Thank you sir.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Thank you sir.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Aw bullshit. Just tell me - just
dialog: tell me why you did it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We can't have our own.
text: Nathan looks at her. Finally he nods and sighs.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...Well lookit. If you can't have
dialog: kids you gotta just keep tryin' and
dialog: hope medical science catches up with
dialog: you. Like Florence'n me - it caught
text: up with a vengeance. And hell, even
dialog: if it never does, you still got each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: Sir, those're kind words. But I think
dialog: the wife and me are splittin' up...
text: He indicates Ed with a nod of the head.
speaker_heading: HI
dialog: ...Her point of view is we're both
dialog: kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we
dialog: ain't too good for each other.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well ma'am, I don't know much but I
dialog: do know human bein's. You brought
dialog: back my boy so you must have your
dialog: good points too. I'd sure hate to
dialog: think of Florence leavin' me - I do
dialog: love her so...
text: He clears his throat and turns to the door. His tone is harder
dialog: again:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...You can go out the way you came
dialog: in...
text: He snaps off the lights.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...And before you go off and do
dialog: another foolish thing, like busting
dialog: up, I suggest you sleep on it...
text: He has disappeared into the hall. We hear his voice receding:
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...at least one night.
speaker_heading: HIGH SHOT
text: Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom.
text: We start to crane down.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: That night I had a dream...
scene_heading: EXTREME WIDE SHOT
text: A beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field,
text: abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of.
text: In the middle background of the extreme long shot two men
text: are walking across the field.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I dreamt I was as light as the
text: ether, a floating spirit visiting
dialog: things to come...
text: BACK TO HIGH SHOT BEDROOM
text: Craning down toward Hi.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: The shades and shadows of the people
dialog: in my life wrastled their way into
dialog: my slumber.
text: BACK TO FIELD
text: Still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking
text: men. We see that they are Gale and Evelle. Both are still
text: dyed blue.
text: They are approaching the hole in the ground.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I dreamt that Gale and Evelle had
dialog: decided to return to prison...
text: Evelle is starting to climb into the hole.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Probably that's just as well. I
dialog: don't mean to sound superior, and
dialog: they're a swell couple guys, but...
text: Evelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...maybe they weren't ready yet to
dialog: come out into the world.
text: FLOATING UP THE WALK OF THE ARIZONA HONE
text: The front door has a holly wreath on it.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: And then I dreamed on, into the
dialog: future, to a Christmas morn in the
dialog: Arizona home...
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
scene_heading: ARIZONA LIVING ROOM
text: Five three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents
text: around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...where Nathan Jr. was opening a
text: present from a kindly couple who
dialog: preferred to remain unknown.
text: We have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the
text: wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr. Inside is a
text: shiny red plastic football.
text: FLOATING IN TOWARD A STATION WAGON
text: Pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert,
text: a police motorcycle parked behind it. Glen is leaning out
text: the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper
text: who stands facing him.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: I saw Glen, a few years later, still
dialog: havin' no luck gettin' the cops to
dialog: listen to his wild tales about me'n
dialog: Ed...
text: Glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front
dialog: of him, as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost
text: stepped in the pile of shit.
text: The trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening
text: tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and
text: slaps his knee.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Maybe he threw in one Pollack
dialog: joke too many...
text: The trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching
text: his citation book from his breast pocket. The name tag on
text: the pocket says "SGT. KOWALSKI."
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...I don't know.
text: FLOATING IN TOWARD A FOOTBALL
text: It sits on a tee in the middle of a football field.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: And still I dreamed on...
text: A cleated foot boots the football out of frame.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...further into the future than I'd
dialog: ever dreamed before.
scene_heading: HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYER
text: Looking up, arms out at his sides, waiting to receive the
text: kicked ball.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: ...Watching Nathan Jr.'s progress
dialog: from afar...
text: He catches the ball and starts running.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Taking pride in his accomplishments
dialog: as if he were our own...
text: He is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...Wondering if he ever thought of
dialog: us.
text: He reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football.
text: He whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the
text: rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...and hoping that maybe we'd
text: broadened his horizons a little,
dialog: even if he couldn't remember just
dialog: how they'd got broadened.
text: BACK TO BEDROOM
text: Still craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: But still I hadn't dreamt nothin'
dialog: about me'n Ed. Until the end...
text: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
speaker_heading: A COUPLE
text: The man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground
text: with their backs to the camera. They are in the living room
text: of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden
text: light.
text: As they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the
text: couple is the backs of their heads. They both have white
text: hair, the woman's pulled into a bun. The old man wears a
text: cardigan, the woman a shawl.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...And this was cloudier 'cause it
dialog: was years, years away.
text: The front door bursts open. Two young couples are entering
text: as their kids - about a dozen of them - stream in around
dialog: them.
text: The old couple on the couch raise their arms to embrace their
text: visitors. The children boil onto the couch.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...But I saw an old couple bein'
text: visited by their children - and all
dialog: their grandchildren too. And the old
dialog: couple wasn't screwed up, and neither
dialog: were their kids or their grandkids.
dialog: And I don't know, you tell me. This
dialog: whole dream, was it wishful thinking?
dialog: Was I just fleein' reality, like I
dialog: know I'm liable to do?
text: FLOATING IN TOWARD A LONG DINING TABLE
text: In the trailer. The table is all laid out with a Thanksgiving
text: dinner, a huge turkey sitting at the far end.
text: Cut-out letters at the other end of the room say: "WELCOME
dialog: HOME KIDS!"
text: The grandchildren are running into frame and taking their
text: seats at the table, accompanied by their parents.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: ...But me'n Ed, we can be good too...
text: The elderly couple enter from either side of the camera and
text: stand in the foreground, backs to us, facing the table.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
text: ...And it seemed real. It seemed
dialog: like us. And it seemed like well...
dialog: our home... If not Arizona, then a
text: land, not too far away, where all
dialog: parents are strong and wise and
dialog: capable, and all children are happy
dialog: and beloved... I dunno, maybe it was
dialog: Utah.
text: The elderly man drapes an arm around his wife's shoulder and
text: draws her close. She rests her head against his shoulder,
dialog: and we:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
