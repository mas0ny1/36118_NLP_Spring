dialog: In the late seventies banking was

dialog: insurance or accounting. And if
dialog: banking was boring then the bond
dialog: department at a bank was downright

dialog: give em to your nephew when he

dialog: makes a hundred dollars. Yawn.
dialog: Bonds were for losers. That is,
dialog: until Lewis Ranieri came on the

dialog: Instead of creating mortgage bonds
dialog: that were guaranteed by the US
dialog: government, they started creating
dialog: their own private mortgage bonds.
dialog: No government, no pesky standards
dialog: like good credit or minimum income.
dialog: And then the big banks were able to

dialog: The Collateralized debt obligation.
dialog: It’s important to understand

scene_heading: ANTHONY BOURDAIN
dialog: Okay, I’m a chef on a Sunday
text: afternoon setting the night’s menu
dialog: at a big restaurant. I ordered my
dialog: fish on Friday which is the
dialog: mortgage bond that Michael Burry
dialog: shorted. But some of the fresh fish
dialog: doesn’t sell. I don’t know why,
dialog: maybe it just came out halibut has
dialog: the intelligence of a dolphin. So
dialog: what am I going to do, throw all
dialog: this unsold old fish, which is the
dialog: BBB level of the bond, in the
dialog: garbage and take the loss?
text: Bourdain chops up the old fish and pushes it into the big pot
text: of “SEAFOOD STEW.”
speaker_heading: ANTHONY BOURDAIN (CONT’D)
dialog: No way. Being the crafty and
dialog: morally onerous chef that I am,
dialog: whatever crappy levels of the bond
dialog: I don’t sell I throw into a “sea
dialog: food stew.” See, it’s not old fish.
dialog: It’s a whole new thing! And no one

speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Institutions treat these CDOs like

dialog: What if he's right?
speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: You want him to be right!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, I do. When a bank offers a

speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Banks have spent decades training

dialog: with credit cards that keep you in
dialog: debt for years? Student loan rates
dialog: that you never get free of?
dialog: Financing, for many Americans, is
dialog: just a fancy term for getting
dialog: raped. Then this guy walks in my
dialog: office... tells me those same banks
dialog: got greedy... lost track of the

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Things can't be as bad as he says

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Let's find out. That's our job.
speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: Why don't you hate this guy? He's

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I can't hate him. He's so

dialog: kind of respect him. Would I buy a
dialog: car from him? No way.
dialog: Is he right about the mortgage

dialog: (the others moan)
dialog: Look, it's two very simple
