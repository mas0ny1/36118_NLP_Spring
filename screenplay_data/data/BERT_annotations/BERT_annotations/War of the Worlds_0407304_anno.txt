speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: No one would have believed in the early
dialog: years of the21st century, that our world
dialog: was being watched by intelligences greater
dialog: than our own. That as men busied themselves
dialog: about their various concerns, they observed
dialog: and studied. Like the way a man with
text: a microscope might scrutinize the creatures
text: that swarm and multiply in a drop of
dialog: water. With infinite complacency men
dialog: went to and fro about the globe, confident
dialog: of our empire over this world. Yet,
text: across the gulf of space, intellects,
text: vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded
text: our plant with envious eyes. And slowly
dialog: and surely, drew their plans against
dialog: us.

scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - CARGO BAY - DAWN
text: Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears
text: his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't
text: slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground
text: loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating
text: the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down
dialog: the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!
text: Ray turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is
dialog: going to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00
dialog: I got half of Korea coming in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour
dialog: blow! Call Tadesko.
dialog: 
text: Camera follows them walking down the street.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Tadesko can't move 40 containers in
dialog: an hour. I need somebody who can do
dialog: double picks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I wish I could help you Sal. God damn
dialog: union regulations.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: (getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position
dialog: here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Come on, you remember the union regulations,
dialog: Sal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: (angrily) You know what your problem
dialog: is?
dialog: 
text: Sal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (joking) I can think of a couple of
dialog: women who'd be happy to tell you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RAY'S CAR - DRIVEWAY - DAWN
text: Ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as
text: Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair,
text: extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife
text: Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair
text: hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie
text: (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes
text: (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.)
text: and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing,
text: long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Is it 8:30? We say that?
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: We said 8:00.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (changing subject) Hey, this is one
dialog: safe looking vehicle you got yourself
dialog: here Tim. Congratulations.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Thank You.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: 8 o'clock huh?
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
dialog: depending on the traffic.
dialog: 
text: Robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the
text: electrical pole. He is listening to his MP3 player at a loud
text: enough volume for the camera (10' away to hear).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: There he is! You got a hug?
text: Robbie ignores him as if he was not there and heads up to the
text: front door of the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (continues) Confusing handshake? (joking)
text: Kick in the teeth? The door's locked.
dialog: (to Mary Ann): Still working on those
dialog: manners?
dialog: 
text: Mary Ann nods "yes" as Rachel gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hello dad.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hello, Rachel!
text: Rachel gives him a hug and goes back to the car to retrieve her
text: bag. She struggles and Mary Ann, Tim, and Ray try to help which
text: results in a small bicker argument. (Ray, Tim, and Mary Ann add
dialog: lib.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (during bickering, at the front door)
text: The door's locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: (suit case in hand) I'll just get it
text: in the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's got rollers, just roll it.
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: Well we can't roll it up the stairs
dialog: now can we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Really, I got it from here, okay?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RAY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN
text: Mary Ann, Rachel, Ray, and Tim walk into the kitchen as Robbie
text: heads straight upstairs to his room. Mary Ann sees a car engine
text: next to the kitchen table and looks at Ray in disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be
dialog: out of here next week.
dialog: 
text: Mary Ann walks over to the refrigerator to check for the basic
text: food supplies. Ray gets frustrated that she is going through
dialog: HIS stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (trying to get her to leave) You better
dialog: get going if you want to beat the traffic,
dialog: don't you think?
dialog: 
text: Mary Ann ignores his comment as she opens the refrigerator which
text: is almost empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: You're out of milk. (smells it) And
dialog: everything else.
dialog: 
text: Shot of Rachel, intensely listening from the stairs.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (mad) Would you close the door please?
dialog: Now that that's my refrigerator.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel)
dialog: I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see
dialog: you in a few days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Bye Tim.
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: I'd better get this upstairs.
text: Ray tries to further rid of her but she continues.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)
dialog: Mom, Mom!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mary Ann, let me get this.
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: I can get it.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: (rushes to close his bedroom door, as
dialog: if hiding something) Excuse me.
dialog: 
text: Ray gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's
dialog: room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RACHEL AND ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAWN
text: Mary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his
text: bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: A little old to still be sharing aren't
dialog: they?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't hear any complaints.
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: No, I do.
text: Mary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player.
text: She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down
text: on a desk chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
text: Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie
dialog: to make sure he's listening) ...on the
dialog: French occupation of Algeria due Monday
dialog: which he's yet to begin. It would be
dialog: nice if he were done by the time we
dialog: got back so we don't have to keep him
text: up all night on Sunday.
dialog: 
text: Mary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says...
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I just got to type it up. (makes typing
dialog: motion)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: No, you just got to start writing it
dialog: first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (interrupts her) I love you mom!
text: Mary Ann kisses him.
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: I love you. (begins walking over to
dialog: Rachel) Listen to your father.
dialog: 
text: Mary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices...
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: Oh, no shoes on the bed.
text: INT Ray's House - Walking Down Stairs - Dawn
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: We'll be at my parent's house in Boston
dialog: but don't call the house line, because
dialog: you know. Well the point is I've got
dialog: my cell phone. So if anything comes
dialog: up, or if you have any questions just
dialog: call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Believe it or not, I can handle it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: I'll leave the phone on.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Mary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops
dialog: to say...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: Take care of our kids.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.
dialog: Listen, you tell your mother that Ray
text: sends his love and kisses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY ANN
dialog: (laughs) She'll love that.
text: Mary Ann leaves.
text: INT Ray's House - Rachel and Robbie's Room - Dawn
text: Robbie is watching the TV stories about lighting storms in other
text: parts of the world. Channel changes ever few seconds. Ray turns
text: off the TV and throws Robbie's baseball mitt at him. He catches
dialog: it and says...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Baseball season's over.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Five minutes. It's not going to kill
dialog: you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN
speaker_heading: RAY
text: There he is. (Robbie puts on his new
dialog: cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how
dialog: it is? (no response from Robbie) That's
dialog: how it's gonna be?
dialog: 
text: Robbie throws ball at Ray unexpectedly who catches it just barely
dialog: and comments...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Careful with that throw.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Whatever Ray!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Your mom says you've got a report due
dialog: on Monday, so you are going to work
dialog: on that when you're done here.
dialog: 
text: During next lines (until noted) they throw the ball back and
dialog: fourth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got
dialog: to type it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, bullshit!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yeah, and what do you know Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Everything. Haven't you heard? Between
dialog: me and my brother, we know everything.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What's the capital of Australia?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's one my brother knows.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Is it okay with you if I just laugh
dialog: the first 500 times you tell that one.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just do your report. We don't send you
dialog: to school so you can flunk out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You don't pay for it, Tim does.
text: Ray throws the ball at Robbie hard enough to knock dust off his
text: mitt. Robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth
dialog: in pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's half of what I've got.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That why you act like such a dick?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a
text: window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up
text: the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares
dialog: back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's not how you're going to get through
dialog: to him. You want him to listen to you...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (interrupts her) What are you? Your
dialog: mother or mine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: To sleep. I work for a living.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What are we supposed to eat?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You know, order.
scene_heading: INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - DAWN
text: Ray takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and
text: takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: INT Ray's House - Living room - Day
text: Rachel is flipping TV channels as Ray walks down the hall after
text: his nap. He sits down and sees Rachel picking at a splinter.
text: Rachel has his hard hat on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I got a splinter.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where'd you get it. Come here.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: On your porch railing.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What, you want me to... (beat) You want
dialog: me to take that out for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Absolutely not!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Well, come here let me see it.
text: Rachel shows him but doesn't let him touch it for fear he may
text: pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and
text: he looks at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's gonna get infected.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No it wont.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yes, it's gonna get infected.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, it won't. When it's ready, my body
dialog: will just push it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Push it out?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I read that. (as she sits back down)
dialog: You should get TiVo. Tim got it for
dialog: my room. It's awesome. I can watch all
dialog: my shows after homework.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum
dialog: card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray takes a bite of the food sitting on the coffee table in front
text: of him, having no idea what it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (with the disgusting food in his mouth)
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hummus.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hummus?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: From the health food place. I kept one
dialog: of their menus last time we were here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray gives Rachel a "this is gross" look and she gawks at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Uh, you said order!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (laughs) I meant order food! Where is
dialog: Robbie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: He went out.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Out where?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't know. He just took your car
dialog: and left.
dialog: 
dialog: EXT Ray's House - Front Driveway - Day
text: He glances at his open garage door with the car that should have
text: been in it. He runs across the street to search for his car.
text: As he sees everyone else looking at the sky, he looks himself
text: to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of
text: it. The cloud is swirling as if it was being artificially turned.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 1
dialog: You ever see something like that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (scratching his chin) In the springtime
dialog: maybe. Not this time of year. Come on,
text: we can see better from the back yard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: (continuous) EXT Ray's House - Back Yard - Day
text: Ray runs by the fence to his back yard. As he runs, the wind
text: starts to pick up. 30-40 mph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That is so weird.
speaker_heading: FRIEND 2
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: The wind is blowing toward the storm.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 2
dialog: That is weird.
text: Winds pick up faster. 40-50 mph.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel, wanna see something cool?
dialog: 
text: Rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear.
text: Pan up to view the 'storm' that appears to be lighting up with
text: multiple colored lights. Wide angle shot of clothes blowing in
text: the wind. Suddenly the wind dies down to nothing. Lightning hits
text: the pavement about 300 feet away.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I want to go inside.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I want to go inside.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, you go ahead.
text: The friend's baby starts to cry...
speaker_heading: FRIEND 2
dialog: That's enough weather for me. (begins
dialog: walking inside)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't want to go by myself.
text: BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and
text: louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house.
text: BAM! The lighting continues. BAM!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Kind of fun, ain't it?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of
dialog: July.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No it's not.
text: Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder
text: and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house.
text: BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!!
text: Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING
dialog: continues.
dialog: 
dialog: INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day
text: Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs
text: into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes
text: Rachel scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's okay. You're fine.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: It hit right behind our house.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there
dialog: again because lighting doesn't strike
text: twice in the same place.
dialog: 
text: BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh, SHIT!
text: They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues.
text: They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes
text: on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor
text: under the table as the lighting goes on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where's Robbie?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you
dialog: okay?
dialog: 
text: BAM! The lighting continues.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where's the thunder?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why won't it stop?
text: Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all
text: is silent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (with hesitation) Is it over?
text: Ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the
text: lightening came from. Ray climbs out from under the table to
dialog: get an idea of what just happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just checking things out. Just wait,
dialog: wait there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Are we going to be okay?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You don't know.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. I meant... Rachel, please, just
dialog: stop asking so many questions. Just
dialog: wait here.
dialog: 
text: Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything
text: is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then
text: walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power.
text: He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone
text: which also appears to not work at all. He sees his watch which
dialog: has also stopped working.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD AREA - EVENING
text: Pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - FRONT STREET - EVENING
text: Ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and
text: for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working.
text: By now we get the picture (EMP). He walks out onto the sidewalk
text: where he is joined by his friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 2
dialog: You believe this Ray? Every single car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray walks past her onto the street where he sees ROBBIE walking
text: up the street towards him. Ray begins running towards him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: The car just stopped and...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (interrupts him) You're okay? Are you
dialog: okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: ... and the lighting started hitting
text: about a block away over and over again.
dialog: And me and this other guy we...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (getting angry) Where the hell'd you
dialog: go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ...
dialog: by the church.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Did you see it? Did you... Were you
dialog: near it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and
text: over the lighting started hitting. It
dialog: opened up this hole or something...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: 26 times?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, well, you're okay?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Good, because your sister is in the
dialog: house, I want you to go in that house
dialog: and I want you to stay with her. Okay?
text: (break, as he starts running down the
dialog: street) And the next time you take my
dialog: car with no driver's license and no
dialog: permission, I call the cops. You better
dialog: be there when I get back.
dialog: 
text: Robbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Robbie. (snaps his hands together)
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it,
dialog: dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: All of them, everything, look at this...
text: (taps the starter motor) starter's fried.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Lightning hit it?
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Not even close. I thought if I changed
dialog: it... you got any idea what's going
dialog: on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm on my way to find out. Try umm...
dialog: try changing the solenoids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right
dialog: see, I told you that, the solenoids.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Everyone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what
text: went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the
text: lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk
dialog: by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Let us through. Let us through here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: Hey, what up, Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (joking) I should of known you two were
dialog: behind this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor
dialog: hood
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Can you blame him?
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: You see it?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yep, you got power where you are?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: Nope, nothing.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's the cars though. That's the thing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: Solar Flare, that's what this guy told
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: A solar flare?
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
text: Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,
text: they turn into solar flare flashes.
dialog: It's the only thing that can kill all
dialog: of the electronic stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: Can I say something?
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: What bro?
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: The sun does not cause lightning, okay?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: Bro, I'm just telling you what that
dialog: guy said he heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: I know but it just sounds dumb saying
dialog: that...
dialog: 
text: Ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where
text: everyone else is gathered around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: I never seen anything like this before.
dialog: That many strikes of lighting in one
dialog: spot.
dialog: 
text: The cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Is this the only place?
text: Ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt
text: crumbs. He switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold
text: to hold in one hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: Is it hot?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. It's freezing.
text: The police officers and the other people gathered around feel
text: a vibration under their feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You feel that?
speaker_heading: FRIEND 3
dialog: Yeah, I feel that.
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: What is it the subway?
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: There's no subway here.
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: PATH Train maybe?
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: That can't be the water main.
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: There's nothing else down there.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: The water main doesn't run through here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: Well, there's something down there and
text: it's moving.
dialog: 
text: The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start
text: running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows
text: start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even
text: more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone
text: on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering
text: windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and
text: moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement
text: lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something
text: throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the
text: air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The
text: police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the
text: ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes
text: out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide
text: behind a building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Ray begins walking out from behind the building.
speaker_heading: FRIEND 4
dialog: Ray, no, stay man.
text: The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to
text: other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire.
text: People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the
text: beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding
text: into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous
text: beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again
text: Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches.
text: He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator
text: beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides
text: behind a building as the machine walks by.

scene_heading: EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH - EVENING
text: Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking
text: eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking
text: at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the
text: kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With
text: anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What happened?
text: Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the
text: kitchen, not responding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What's going on?
text: Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on
text: the stool at the island.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What's all that stuff all over you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie.
text: Rachel reaches through a leg of the
text: island to pull at Ray's hood on his
text: shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his
text: head toward Rachel fast enough to make
text: some of the white powder poof off as
text: if jerked back into reality. Robbie
text: jumps as well in fright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What's all the stuff?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Hello? Ray?
text: Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He
text: gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive
text: to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to
text: see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly
text: does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing
text: it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.
dialog: 
text: Walking back into the kitchen...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He
text: shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over
dialog: at the force Ray used.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (questioning) What? Wait. I have no
dialog: idea what's going on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (while Robbie asks) ... all the food
text: from the refrigerator and the cupboard,
dialog: put it in here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I think we are having a bit of a shock
dialog: here...what's going on, just tell me...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just do it.
text: Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try
dialog: to get it to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel, sweetheart...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad, you're really scaring me.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I need you to get your suitcase...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad. (break) Dad!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: The one that you brought, bring it to
dialog: me, okay?
dialog: 
text: Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the
text: refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he
text: realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Can you do that for me, darling?
scene_heading: INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs.
text: He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains
text: a hand gun. He tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds
text: his shirts over it.
dialog: 
dialog: Street Sidewalk - Evening
text: Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down
text: the sidewalk with about 20 other people around them. Rachel is
text: clutching Ray's hand and Robbie is carrying the box of food.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We...
dialog: We've only got about another minute.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray sees the car that Manny was working on just as Manny's Apprentice
text: closes the hood. Ray mutters...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Please, Please, Please.
text: People are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction.
text: Ray, Robbie and Rachel approach the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just keep it down.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Ray, I'm standing right beside you.
dialog: Can you please answer me?
dialog: 
text: Ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just get in the front seat Robbie.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray loads Rachel in the middle row of seats as Robbie gets in
text: the passenger seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Who's car is this?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just get in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Who's car is this?
text: Ray throws Rachel's bag in the row of seats behind her, slams
text: the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car. He
text: is caught by Manny walking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right.
dialog: I had to change the sole... Ray?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Manny sees Ray has loaded his whole family into the car.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Hey Ray? Ray? What?
text: Manny walks over to the passenger side as Ray and Robbie watch
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Ray. Open up.
text: Ray, who did no such thing sits there. Robbie looks at ray wondering
dialog: what he's going to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR
dialog: RAY!
dialog: 
text: Ray reaches over Robbie and opens the door.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: What are you...
speaker_heading: RAY
text: (interrupts him) Get in.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: That's funny, you gotta get out of the
dialog: car. You can't take it.
dialog: 
text: Ray tries to get Manny to calm down from the panic he is in...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: It's not my car. It's not your car.
dialog: Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy
dialog: kids. Guy's gonna come back...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (interrupts him) I don't have time to
dialog: expl....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: (interrupts him) You're busting my chops.
dialog: I got a shop to run. You know how many
dialog: people...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (interrupts him) Get in!
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rachel begins crying as she says...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What do you mean?
text: A dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in
text: fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: All right, get out of the truck! I'm
text: not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR
dialog: RAY!
dialog: 
text: Rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame
text: at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the
text: flaming tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: I'm not fooling around, I got a busy
dialog: day ahead of me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANNY
text: RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT
speaker_heading: MY CAR!
dialog: 
text: Manny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator
text: beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding
text: to smithereens.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DUSK
text: Trying to outrun the beams...
speaker_heading: RAY
text: GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is this the terrorists?!?!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!
text: Ray grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward
dialog: the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: GET DOWN!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: HOLY SHIT!
text: High shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away.
text: The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses
text: below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker
text: falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris
text: flies all over behind the van.
dialog: 
text: The van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars
text: are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by
text: them honking the horn every few cars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Where are we going?!?!?!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We gotta go! We got to be the only working
dialog: car around here. I'm not stopping until
dialog: we are clear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: CLEAR OF WHAT?!?!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We gotta go.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!
text: Rachel begins frantically crying. After a few seconds, she begins
text: hyperventilating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep
dialog: it down Rachel!
dialog: 
text: After honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten
dialog: worse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: (with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING
dialog: HER OUT!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm Rachel. He
text: thinks of an old technique he was taught.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: Okay, (slapping his arms together on
dialog: top of each other, demonstrating) Put
dialog: em' up Rache.
dialog: 
text: Rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows
text: so she holds the position. He begins
dialog: to calm her down) This space right here,
dialog: this is yours.
dialog: 
text: Robbie stares directly into her eyes. She takes deep breaths
text: to regain control. She is able to open her eyes and stare back
text: into his eyes to maintain contact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: ... This belongs to you, right?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: (panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (reassuring her) You're safe in your
dialog: space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my
dialog: space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (reassuring her) You're safe in your
dialog: space. Nothing is going to happen to
dialog: you in your space.
dialog: 
text: Ray looks back into the back seat in amazement at Robbie able
dialog: to do what he's doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm really scared.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk
dialog: to dad...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No....
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (reassuring her) I will be two feet
dialog: away. Okay.
dialog: 
text: Rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing
text: while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Will you hold my hand?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Are you gonna be okay?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (relatively calm) Yes.
text: Robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (taking a breath to calm himself) I
dialog: want to know everything you know.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward
text: on the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This thing, this machine, it crawled
text: out of the ground and started torching
dialog: everything, just killing everybody.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, this came from some place else.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You mean like Europe?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!
text: Ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the
text: driver's side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: That machine, it was already buried.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray looks into the sky. What for is unknown.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Maybe it came down in the lightning
dialog: storm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Wait a minute... you just said it was
dialog: buried.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, the machine I'm talking about was
dialog: buried. But, what came down in the lighting
dialog: storm, what operates it. That's the...
dialog: that's the.... You know. The....
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots
text: forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Why aren't there any helicopters or
dialog: airplanes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey Rache. How you doing there girl?
dialog: (to Robbie) How she doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: How you doing?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (to Ray) She's good.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Good. Hey, what was that thing you
dialog: did with her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic.

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I want mom.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I know. You feel better?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I want mom.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, tell me about it, you know?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Take me to Mom's!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen, I just need you to hold it together
dialog: for me, okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I WANT MOM!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: When you start screaming like that,
dialog: you know, I can't really...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: TAKE ME TO MOM!!!
text: Robbie gets back into the back seat to repeat the "arms" process
text: with her to calm her again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!
speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: for Rachel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks
dialog: on it)
dialog: 
text: Robbie grabs the keys off his belt loop as Rachel begins running

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

scene_heading: INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: They're gone.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is she dead??
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: She's not dead. All right? She's just
dialog: no here. Okay? They're never here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Because they are on their way to Boston....
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie.
text: Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next
text: to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ... and so they just kept on going,
dialog: they're probably up to your grandma's
dialog: house by now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How come the lights are on here and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Umm.... Because nothing bad happened

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: So, were safe here. All Right?

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay,
dialog: you are safe in your area...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad. That's not how it goes.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get

dialog: something to eat. (digs into the box)
dialog: What do we have here??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: .. Busy signals, one of the fast ones....
dialog: You think all the circuits are down?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco,
dialog: Barbeque Sauce. This is really good
dialog: Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food.
dialog: What... What the hell is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: That's all that was in your kitchen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box
text: for food. He finds peanut butter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the
dialog: bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm....
dialog: We'll just get some sandwiches.
dialog: 
text: Ray takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole
text: loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm
dialog: Rachel and Robbie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal?
dialog: Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie,
dialog: two for me, (he has one extra in his
dialog: hand) ...one for the house. (laughs)
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the
text: cooking utensil holder on the counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Maybe after we get done eating, I will
dialog: take you down, teach you how to play
dialog: some poker. A little five card stud...
dialog: a little blackjack...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm allergic to peanut butter.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (laughs) Since when?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (with a snotty look) Birth!
text: Robbie shakes his head yes to her statement.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two
dialog: pieces of bread) You can eat the bread.
dialog: Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to
dialog: be eating peanut butter sandwiches.
dialog: (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I'm not hungry either.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're not hungry either? Well, that's
dialog: fine.
dialog: 
text: Ray picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window.
text: One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides
dialog: off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Everybody just relax, okay? Because
dialog: we are here now and we're safe, and
dialog: we're gonna stay. And in the morning

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: If everything's fine, why do we have
dialog: to sleep in the basement. We've got
dialog: perfectly good beds.

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: (walks over to the weight room corner

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I want to sleep in my bed. I've got

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay. You know on the Weather Channel
dialog: when there's a tornado, and they tell
dialog: you to go to the basement for safety?
dialog: It's like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: There's gonna be tornadoes?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel, no more talking.
text: Robbie puts his hat on Rachel's head and ushers her over to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder
text: and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy
text: of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets
text: Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash
text: is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to
text: Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening
text: starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting
text: lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought
dialog: the stairs.
dialog: 
text: A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his
text: breathing becomes more erratic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is the lighting back?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, this is something else...
text: Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine
text: begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls.
text: Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up
text: to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves
dialog: everywhere.
dialog: 
text: A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even
dialog: louder.

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

dialog: 
text: Ray realizes he has forgotten his gun.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!!
text: Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through

text: door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages,
text: after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of
dialog: the furnace room.
dialog: 
text: The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark,
text: you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around
dialog: them.

speaker_heading: RACHEL

scene_heading: INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - FURNACE ROOM - DAWN
text: Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding
text: on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges
dialog: it to be safe to go outside the furnace room.
dialog: 
text: He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping
text: against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in
text: pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds
text: most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top
text: floor because the second floor was completely torn off.
dialog: 
text: The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane
text: engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the
text: remains of different sections of an airplane.

scene_heading: EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - YARD - DAWN
text: Ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue
text: cart through the aisle.

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Down here!
text: The man continues hauling the cart.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?

speaker_heading: MAX (NEWS CAMERA OPERATOR)
dialog: Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open

dialog: 
text: The news reporter comes rushing out from the side of the news
text: van in the background.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Are you a passenger?
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: He's deaf. The shell went off right
text: beside him. The camera on his shoulder
dialog: saved his life. (to Max) You hear that
dialog: Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid
dialog: life.
dialog: 
text: They succeed in jimmying open the cart and begin bagging all
dialog: the water and food they can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: Out there in the pine barrens. We were
text: attached to a National Guard unit, the
text: 83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of
dialog: those things around midnight. They've
dialog: got some kind of shield around them.
dialog: We can't see it, but everything we fire
dialog: at them detonates too early before we
dialog: can get close enough to cause any damage.
dialog: When they flash that thing, everything
text: lights up like Hiroshima.
dialog: 
text: She begins eating one of the meal packages.
speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: to try and get them to catch the feed,
dialog: but nobody answered.
dialog: 
text: The reporter looks at tapes to find the one she's looking for.
text: When she does so, she jams it into the VCR which promptly begins
dialog: playing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods
text: start to move, no more news comes out
dialog: of that area.
dialog: 
text: She shows him a tape of about 30 tripods destroying a city.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You ain't seen nothing yet.

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I saw that storm. I was right in the
text: middle of one of those.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: No, you didn't see it like this. Those
text: machines come up from under the ground,
dialog: right? That means they must have been
dialog: buried there a long time ago. So who's
dialog: driving the god damn things? (pointing
dialog: to the monitor) Watch the lightning.
dialog: Watch it..... Watch the lighting.....
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She slows the footage down so he can get a good look. She advances
text: it slowly. She points out an alien capsule like object running
text: down the lighting bolt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
text: That is them. They come down in capsules,
text: riding the lighting into the ground
dialog: into the machines right?
dialog:

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Oh, that's too bad, it would have been

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why are you yelling?

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Because I don't want everybody to see
dialog: we've got a working car. (going over
dialog: the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson
dialog: until we find an open bridge or ferry,
dialog: then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then

dialog: all the way to Boston.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: If we had any balls, we'd go back there

dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, well, why don't you just let me
dialog: make the big decisions, okay?

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I have to go to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Really?

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which

speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: who might want our car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: There's nobody around!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Robbie breaks free of Ray's grasp on his sleeve. Robbie and Rachel

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's

speaker_heading: RACHEL

text: Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen. Every time you don't listen
dialog: to me, I'm telling your mother, okay?
dialog: I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm
dialog: making a list!
dialog: 
text: Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking
text: for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it
text: in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES
text: start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down
text: the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes
text: up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I told you to stay where I could see
dialog: you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm sorry!

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only

text: to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly.

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!!
dialog: GIVE ME A HAND!!!

speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: 
text: Robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline
text: keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air
text: from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as
text: an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?!
dialog: WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!
dialog: 
text: Rachel begins to cry as Robbie looks at her in sorrow.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU
dialog: GO!!!
dialog: 
text: Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks
text: her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to

dialog: brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the
dialog: divorce of their parents.

scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But we do right?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, we do.
text: They continue driving through the crowd as they become more and

dialog: the glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why'd he do that?
text: The man continues hitting the windshield.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why is he doing that?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He wants a ride. Everybody just wants
dialog: a ride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Can we give him one?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just sit back and put on your seatbelt.
dialog: Robbie, put on your seatbelt.
dialog:

dialog: for a ride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Put on your seatbelt Rachel.

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away

speaker_heading: POLICE MAN 3
dialog: Stop the car!!
scene_heading: RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

scene_heading: RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER
dialog: GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side

text: screams in panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (screams) AHHHH!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh hold on!!

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Look out! Look out!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches
text: about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins
text: to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side
text: to side shouting at about a riot level.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DUSK
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted
text: open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows
text: are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass.
text: A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the
text: hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the
text: van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to "push
text: it". He does so and the glass falls through.
dialog: 
text: The passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by
text: the rioting crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: (screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!!
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: STOP!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hit's the driver's
text: side door. Ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him
text: back into the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: DADDY!!!
text: Ray wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets
text: tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is
text: hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The
dialog: blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to
dialog: Ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (grasping his head in pain) AHHH!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Another man grabs Ray to try to fight him. Women in the crowd
text: yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling
text: Ray yells to "get in the car". Robbie fought off the men who
text: pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins
text: choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head
text: against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and
text: Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (through a choking grip) Rachel, get

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: frame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: DADDY!!!
text: Rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling
text: into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people
text: in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray manages to pull out his gun. He fires off two rounds into
text: the air. The crowd instantly moves away from him. One man yells
dialog: "take it easy!" No sign of Robbie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: (pointing the gun at the people on the
dialog: roof of the car) GET OFF THE CAR!! GET
dialog: OFF!!!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (still determined to find Robbie) ROBBIE!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray is able to pull Robbie out from the crowd. Robbie has a running
text: bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. He is fighting to catch
text: his breath because he had it knocked out of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: DAD!!!
text: The camera moves from Robbie to Ray, then pivots on his face
text: to reveal a man holding another gun at Ray's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RIOT MAN 3
dialog: Okay, man, now listen. Put down the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: All I want is my daughter....
speaker_heading: RIOT MAN 3
dialog: PUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!!
text: Ray is scared into dropping his gun on the street. Ray then puts
text: his hands near his head to avoid being shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Please, all I want is my daughter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RIOT MAN 3
text: (surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I just want my daughter. Please just
dialog: let me take my daughter, can I.... All
dialog: I want is my daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RIOT MAN 3
dialog: Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Robbie!!
text: Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks
text: over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to
text: the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the
text: camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street.
text: The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DUSK
text: The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with
text: Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound.
text: He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie
text: lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his
text: chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They
text: are all soaked from the rain.
dialog: 
text: They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and
text: off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots
text: are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his
text: hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain
text: as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around
text: to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One
text: more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite
text: his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort.
text: The van drives away.
dialog: 
text: Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what
text: to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has
dialog: none.
dialog: 
dialog: Walking Down the Street - Dusk
text: They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their
dialog: stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...."
text: while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some
dialog: people "don't give a shit who it is....."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Looks like the power's still on here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, power's still on because nothing

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and
text: lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just
text: like cars. They wait.
dialog: 
text: A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter
text: with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train,
text: as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars
text: go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue
dialog: walking.

scene_heading: EXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK
text: Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people
text: are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank
text: woman says over a megaphone...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative,
dialog: thank you but we already have more blood
dialog: than we can use. Again... (repeats message)
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Shots of the herded people boarding the ferry.
text: Solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving
dialog: folks".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARBOR MASTER
dialog: Please move forward calmly, the boat

speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Ray! RAY?!?!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Sheryl?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Yeah.
text: Ray and Sheryl hug as they are re-united.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Oh, my gosh, are these your kids?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yes, this is Rachel.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter,
dialog: Nora.
dialog: 
text: Ray, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hi, I've heard about you, Nora.
text: Rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from
text: the boat. Robbie meets Sheryl with Ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This is my son, Robbie.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Hi Sheryl.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: He's just like dad.
text: Rachel continues watching the gulls.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: How you doing? You look like shit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rachel is now fully into watching the gulls. Ray, Sheryl, and
text: Robbie are engaged into small talk. Rachel sees the gulls flying
text: around something over the horizon behind the city.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (to herself) The trees are funny.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARBOR MASTER
dialog: We're gonna move some cars out of the
dialog: way to make more space. Give us a few
dialog: minutes.
dialog: 
text: Rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something
text: gets brighter on the horizon. Rachel grabs Ray's finger and he
text: realizes that she wants him. Ray turns around to see what Rachel
text: wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. Robbie sees Ray
text: looking that way, so he too looks that way. A robot puts it's
text: last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people.
text: It makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody.
text: The crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the
text: ship for safety. The captain sees the overflow and prepares the
text: ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: CAST OFF!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!
speaker_heading: HARBOR MASTER
text: CAST OFF NOW!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!
dialog: (to soldiers) No more people! No more
dialog: people! We're taking the ramp up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for
text: quite a while. As the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start
text: to bulge forward from people pushing them. Three robots now switch
text: on their lights to look over the crowd of people. A moving crowd
text: of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so
dialog: far are withstanding.
dialog: 
text: Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to
text: let him and his family through. They say there is no more room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to Sheryl) You just stay with me! Grab
dialog: my jacket!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I got you Ferrier. (trips) oh, Jesus!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You okay? Come on!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Jesus. Oh my god!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Come on.
text: The harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to
text: begin folding up the ramp. Soldiers shove empty cars off the
dialog: ramp.
dialog: 
text: Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's
dialog: jacket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Oh, Ray!! RAY!!!
text: They run faster and Sheryl falls farther behind. Robbie makes
text: a grab for her hand but a soldier stops Sheryl just short.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERYL
text: NO, I CAN GO WITH HIM!!! RAY!!!! NO!!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and
text: latch on to it. Ray looks back for Sheryl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: SHERYL?!?!? SHERYL!!!!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: RAY!!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: There's room on the boat!!!
speaker_heading: SHERYL

speaker_heading: RAY
text: THERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S

text: Robbie is soon to follow...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ROBBIE?!?!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ROBBIE!!!
text: Robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there
text: are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He
text: starts running to the stern of the ship.
dialog: 
text: The captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers
text: start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the
text: dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins
text: pulling away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (seeing Robbie running to the stern)
dialog: Robbie? Robbie!?!?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Robbie!!!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ROBBIE!!!
text: Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded
text: up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are
text: hanging on the back side of the ramp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Here, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got
dialog: you! HOLD ON!!!
dialog: 
text: Camera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people
text: in admiration and proud ness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: TAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!!
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
text: The captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into
text: a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being
dialog: sucked in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Oh, my god!
text: Passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges
text: from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are
text: tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow
text: as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one
text: side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running
text: towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water.
text: Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for
text: them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly
text: pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding
text: on to Robbie's back, also going down.
dialog: 
text: The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed
text: into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs
text: in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie
text: out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind
text: and Robbie grabs her and helps her up. At the surface, they
text: meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away
text: from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and
text: pulling them into the robot's holds.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DARK
text: Ray is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind.
text: They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for
text: so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Help me. Help me with her.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (gagging) Okay.
text: Robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Pulling each other up the hill....
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Don't stop. Don't stop.
text: Alert sirens can be heard coming from the city.
text: Ray pulls the two of them.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: (yells in pain) AHHH.
text: They all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance
text: they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the
text: water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people
text: off the streets. Many people scream.
dialog: 
text: With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside
text: on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look
text: there with her.
dialog: 
text: THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people
text: with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel,
text: in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her,
text: and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat
text: down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill
dialog: to join the three.
dialog: 
text: Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as
text: we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing
text: falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods
text: where clothes fall like snow.
dialog: 
dialog: Pasture Fence Line - Dark
text: Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line
text: of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500
text: yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins
text: walking faster toward the gunfire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Robbie, slow down.
text: Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Robbie, slow down!!!
text: Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling
text: down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into
text: a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Robbie.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Robbie. We got to stay together Robbie.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Robbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!!
text: Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their
text: heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: GET BACK HERE!!!
text: Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have
text: now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can
dialog: to try to stay with Robbie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel
text: are now searching for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: ROBBIE!!! (sets Rachel down next to
dialog: a tree) NOW DON'T MOVE! FOR GOD'S SAKE,
text: STAY RIGHT HERE! I'M COMING RIGHT BACK!
dialog: (calling out for him) ROBBIE!!!
dialog: 
text: Ray sees Robbie about 20' ahead of him.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: ROBBIE!!! ROBBIE!!!
text: Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back
text: by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie
text: fights to get back up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???
text: Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over
dialog: the hill. Radio people are telling their officers "no effect
dialog: on target".
dialog: 
text: Robbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get
text: his attention on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: LISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU
dialog: TO LISTEN TO ME!
dialog: 
text: Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over
dialog: the hill.
dialog: 
text: Ray gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips
text: him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he
text: did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of
text: him, pining him down to the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: LISTEN TO ME!
text: Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over
dialog: the hill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: DON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: LET ME GO!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: YOU DON'T!!!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: PLEASE LET ME GO!!!
text: Rachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they
text: try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN
dialog: HATE ME.....
dialog: 
text: Robbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just listen to me!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I need to be here! I want to see this!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Wait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for
dialog: your sister.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Please let me go! You need to let me
dialog: go.
dialog: 
text: Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever.
text: Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple.
text: Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough
text: trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at
text: each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill.
text: Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: GET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER
dialog: FATHER!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: We thought she was alone... we....
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill
text: where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls
text: over the hill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Robbie?!?!
text: Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!!
text: A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion
text: blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ROBBIE!!!
text: By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site.
text: A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the
text: hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three
text: robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being
text: fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - NIGHT
text: Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away
text: from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle
text: as a signal for anybody who can see him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Over here! OVER HERE!!!
text: Ray and Rachel run towards him.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Hurry!!
text: The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run
text: into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar
text: doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people.
text: Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK - CONTINUOUS
text: Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks
text: at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the
text: clothes he wears.
dialog: 
text: Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and
text: Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (to Rachel) You all right?
text: Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (to Ray) And what about you?
text: Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard
text: muttering "Robbie" very quietly.
dialog: 
text: Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about
text: on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill
text: that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (while Harland moves the wheel barrel)
dialog: (to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable?
dialog: I need you to close your eyes now, okay?
dialog: You need some sleep.
dialog: 
text: Rachel's face is pure white with some red around her eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad?
text: Ray already knows what she is going to ask.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna
dialog: meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (about ready to cry) What do you think
dialog: mom's doing right this minute?
dialog: 
text: Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation.
text: He begins sharpening a shovel with a file.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I
dialog: know she's not sleeping 'cause she is
dialog: so worried about you. (trying to comfort
dialog: her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen,
dialog: and she's making that awful tea that
dialog: she makes. And they're all just... ...
dialog: ...there all just counting the minutes
dialog: until they see you again.
dialog: 
text: Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom. Ray sees
text: the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to
dialog: investigate what it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (picking up the ribbon) What is this?
dialog: What... What is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I won.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You won?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She begins to feel dreary...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: (shakes his head in displeasure because
dialog: he can't think of it) I don't remember
dialog: that one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one
dialog: either.
dialog: 
text: Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that
text: it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a
text: moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby.
dialog: So don't put me down. Because I've got
text: the fastest set of wheels in the town.
dialog: Something comes up to me that don't
dialog: even try....
dialog: 
text: Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (continues singing) ... If I had a set
dialog: of wings, man, I know she could fly.
dialog: She's my little deuce coupe. You don't
dialog: know what I've got... just my little
dialog: deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't
dialog: know what I've got....
dialog: 
text: Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland
text: taps two glasses together and says...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
text: Peach schnapps.
text: Ray gets up and begins walking towards him.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole
dialog: case of this shit.
dialog: 
text: Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Thank you.
text: Silence falls over for a period.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: I'm sorry about your son.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We got separated... he's gonna meet
dialog: us in umm... in Boston.
dialog: 
text: Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did
dialog: you loose anybody?

speaker_heading: HARLAND

speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks.
dialog: You're welcome to stay, both of yous.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray gets up from the conversation.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause)
dialog: Those machines, those tripods they got...
dialog: They buried them... right under our
dialog: feet. Since before there were even people
dialog: here. They've been planning this for
dialog: a million years. We're beat to shit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may
dialog: hear what he may say next.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Please, my daughter.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Think about it. ... They defeated
dialog: the greatest power in the world in a
dialog: couple days. Walked right over us.
dialog: .... And these are only the first,
dialog: they'll keep coming. This is not a war
dialog: any more than there's a war between
text: men and maggots. This is an extermination.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray walks over to where Rachel is sleeping.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (feeling he's not grasping the reality)
dialog: Are you afraid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Of course I am.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (going on) I been around death plenty.
dialog: Drive an ambulance in the city. Well,
dialog: drove and ambulance in the city. That's
dialog: all over now, huh? .... You know
dialog: the people who make it Ray? The ones
dialog: that don't flatline before the hospital?
dialog: It's the ones who keep their eyes open,
dialog: keep looking at you, keep thinking.
dialog: .... There the ones who survive...
dialog: .... We can' t loose our heads
dialog: Ray. .... Running, that's what'll
dialog: kill you. ...... I'm dead set
dialog: on livin'.
dialog: 
text: He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
text: Hah. Dead set on Living.
text: Harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first
dialog: started.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Thank you for taking us in.
text: Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes...
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: We're not going to be exterminated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside.
text: Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of
text: the basement collapses from all the vibration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come
dialog: on, I wanna show you something!
dialog: 
text: They both are waling towards a window.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta
dialog: have a weakness. Come on, take a look.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out
text: of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Somehow they killed a few of these things
dialog: in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling
dialog: me the Japanese can figure it out but
dialog: we can't?
dialog: 
text: Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere
dialog: else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: We can do it. We can get 'em. We can
dialog: figure it out.
dialog: 
text: Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stay right there!
text: Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground
text: almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands
dialog: that robots do this on a regular basis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I have a daughter! Why did you bring
dialog: us here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: To fight 'em together, Ray. ....
dialog: Now we'll be the ones coming up from
dialog: underground. When the time is right,
dialog: we'll take 'em by supries, the way they
dialog: took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying
text: with an insane man.

speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: We're right under their feet, Ray. Right

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK
text: Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly.
text: He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines
text: it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming
text: in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall
dialog: and studies that one.
dialog: 
text: Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over
text: the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board
text: hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.

dialog: You miss your mommy? I had a little

dialog: Rachel!
text: Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They
text: both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (distinctly angry, but not yelling)
dialog: You don't have anything to say to her,
dialog: do you understand? If you want to talk
dialog: to somebody, or ask somebody a question,
dialog: you ask me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (also angry at Ray) What exactly is
dialog: your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna
dialog: do. How about you? You gonna sit here,
dialog: wait for them to come get you? Is that
dialog: your plan?
dialog: 
text: Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing
dialog: miscellaneous things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Maybe you want to get caught. Couple
dialog: of days hiding in a basement too much
dialog: for you, I bet. You'll probably turn
dialog: yourself right in!
dialog: 
text: The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen. It stopped.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (paying no attention) Maybe you'll be
dialog: okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll
dialog: train you as their pet. You know, train
dialog: you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating
text: down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye
text: opens and lights turn on for it.
dialog: 
text: Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch.
text: Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It
text: sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and
text: Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs
text: an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head
text: no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince
dialog: him not to.
dialog: 
text: Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost
text: makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers
text: which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward
text: the noise. They run to a different spot.
dialog: 
text: Robot gets closer...
text: Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot
text: into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and
text: sees nothing.
dialog: 
text: It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise.
text: The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind
text: the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and
text: Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief
text: comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.
dialog: 
text: Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the
text: lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement.
text: They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout
text: the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts
text: of the basement.
dialog: 
text: Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens
text: but the gun is pulled back by Ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (dead silent) Give me that!
text: Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both
text: have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun.
text: Still silently. Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces
text: him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just
text: as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens
text: scurry out through the open hole.
dialog: 
text: Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: You and I... I don't think we are on
dialog: the same page.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY
text: The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along
text: the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red
text: mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the
text: mist that is entering the window. After a moment.... Ray retracts
text: his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
text: RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
text: KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of
dialog: blood.
dialog: 
text: They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man
text: being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes
text: down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray
text: has a horrified look on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My
dialog: Blood!!!
dialog: 
text: Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling.
text: Then... the robots stop because they hear him. Ray runs to Harland
text: who is digging some sort of hole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it!
dialog: You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (with an insane expression and tone)
dialog: They drink us!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Please, they'll hear you!
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You gotta be quiet!
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Drink US and....
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They're gonna come back down here!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harland has mentally lost it now.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Then they spit us out all over their
dialog: goddamn red weeds!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (no longer whispering) Do you understand
dialog: what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let
dialog: my daughter die because of you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harland pays no attention to him.
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: This tunnel will get us to the city.
dialog: We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready
dialog: Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: You can hide a whole army down there!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stop it!!
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: ... We'll go underground!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: STOP IT!!!
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: Sneak attacks at night!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: YOU STOP IT!!!
text: Ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead
text: with a shovel. Ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile
text: next to Harland.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: We're the resistance Ray! They can't
dialog: occupy this country! Occupations always
dialog: fail! History's taught us that a thousand
dialog: times. This is our land.
dialog: 
text: Ray runs up the stairs of the room to Rachel standing calmly
text: in the middle of the basement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLAND
dialog: (continues) ... We eat it, we breathe
dialog: it, only we can live on it! They can't
dialog: survive here Ray. They weren't built
dialog: for it.
dialog: 
text: Ray hugs Rachel because he knows what he has to do.
text: Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared
dialog: for what he has to do.
dialog: 
text: Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing
dialog: go erratic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Whatever you hear... don't take this
dialog: off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad??
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rach?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What was that song... that lullaby I
dialog: didn't know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hushabye Mountains
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: (begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Don't stop.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... On Hushabye Mountain...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's my girl.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... For far away my baby goes...
text: Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then
text: walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting "not
dialog: my blood"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... it fills the sails ...
text: Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... of boats that are waiting ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray closes the door behind him as he steps in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... Waiting to sail your worries away
dialog: ...
dialog: 
text: Rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye
dialog: Mountain ...
dialog: 
text: Rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ... Wave goodbye to the cares of the
dialog: day and watch your boat, from Hushabye
text: Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby
dialog: Bay.
dialog: 
text: All is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out.
text: Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is
text: sitting on the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both
text: sit there in silence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK
text: Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch. As we view down from
text: Ray's face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some reason.
text: She sits up and....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (screams) AHHHH!!!
text: A robot camera is 1' away from her face. Rachel runs to the wall,
text: still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. The camera
text: hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris.
dialog: 
text: Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment
text: line. Rachel screams as he hit's the line. Over and over and
text: over. Rachel runs up the basement stairs. Ray continues hitting
text: it and it finally pulls away. The camera, still attached by a
text: hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel???
text: No response for a few seconds, then Rachel lets off a gut wrenching
dialog: scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: RACHEL!!! (to himself) Oh, my god,
dialog: no!
dialog: 
text: He runs up the stairs to search for her in the house.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs)
dialog: Rachel??
dialog: 
text: Ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in
text: the doorway. He quickly brushes them down stepping out the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (searching) Rachel, make some noise
dialog: baby. Rachel??
dialog: 
text: He begins walking down a path to look for her farther out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come
dialog: on!
dialog: 
text: He gets no response from Rachel. All is dead silent accept for
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!
text: Ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the
dialog: hill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
text: RACHEL!!!! RACHEL!!!
text: A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough
text: to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes
text: after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass,
text: grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (screams) AHH!
text: Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He
text: looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill.
dialog: 
text: The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw.
text: Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (screams) AHHHHH!!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: NO NO NO!!!
text: The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the
text: foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades.
text: He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: HEY!!!
text: It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around.
text: It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (screams in pain) AHHH!
text: He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as
text: well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera
text: shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion.
text: Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: RACHEL!!
text: He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound
text: and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls
text: down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the
text: ship. The same happens in the other cage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response)
dialog: Rachel.
dialog: 
text: She seems to be frozen.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dad?
text: Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all
text: the people around and the door opens to take another person up.
text: Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing
text: claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go
text: with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's
text: hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this
text: and latches onto Ray's arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: Pull me! Pull me!!!
text: People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving
text: him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the
text: cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is
text: seen by the soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
text: EVERYBODY DOWN!!!
text: Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes.
text: We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors
text: and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages
text: and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a
dialog: way that meant how did you do that.
dialog: 
dialog: Boston City Limits - Freeway - Day
text: Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering
text: them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant
text: which appears to be dying rapidly. Ray picks up a piece, of
dialog: dead plant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What happened to it?
text: Ray crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's dying.
text: Watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half
text: struck into a building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 3
dialog: I don't know, something's happening
dialog: to them. Please keep moving.
dialog: 
text: Ray goes up to another soldier for information.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Something's happening to them?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 4
dialog: Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir.
text: Ray asks another soldier down the road for information.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Excuse me, excuse me, what happened
dialog: here? You guys take it down?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 5
dialog: No sir, it was behaving erratically,
dialog: walking in circles then it went down
dialog: on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)
dialog: Now let's keep moving, don't stop do
dialog: not stop! Keep moving!
dialog: 
text: Rachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How is it dead all by it's self?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Rachel, I'm not sure.
text: Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water
text: tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense
dialog: if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be
dialog: heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel".
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot.
text: The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the
text: robot makes the viberating sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to a soldier, during the robot noise)
dialog: LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 6
dialog: I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 6
dialog: I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!
speaker_heading: RAY
text: (louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The soldier looks at them and doesn't get what Ray's getting
text: at. He looks back at Ray. The noise continues erratically as
text: if the robot is fighting to stay alive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: NO SHIELDS!!!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 6
dialog: (motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: (now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE
text: JAVELIN'S THE KEY! LOAD THE GUSTAV,

dialog: 
text: Ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to the people in the tunnel and Rachel)
dialog: It's safer in here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 6
text: LETS GO!!! BRIGN OUT THE JAVELIN!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles
text: at the robot. The first missile hit's the grabbing claws and
text: knocks them off. A few more shots and the robot collapses into
text: a nearby factory. The factory explodes and the robot grinds to
text: a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls
text: out of the door. It quickly dies on site.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 6
speaker_heading: IT'S CLEAR!
text: We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.
