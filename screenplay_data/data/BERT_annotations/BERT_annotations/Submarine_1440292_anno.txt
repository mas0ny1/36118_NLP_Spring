speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I’m so sorry. It’s a lovely

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

dialog: right...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 15.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Jill and I would spend hours up

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Right. So are you going to sell

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I’m gonna let things take their

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That’s great. To have the time to
dialog: do that.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I work to live, not live to work.
dialog: So - I was saying to Jill we
dialog: should all meet up -
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yes. Absolutely. That’d be
dialog: lovely. We’ll consult and be in
dialog: touch. Can’t wait. When did you
dialog: see Jill?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Just in town. I think compatible

speaker_heading: KIM-LIN

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.)
dialog: Zoe Preece hasn’t been in school
dialog: the past few days so I’ve written
text: a pamphlet giving her a few
dialog: pointers on how to break out of
dialog: the victim cycle.
text: We see close INSERTS of the following snippets: “Weirdly, A

dialog: facade of complete indifference.” “Transform any facet of
dialog: your personality to fit in.” “You are who you pretend to
dialog: be.” “If you must study, do so in private.” “Don’t cry to

text: underlined, some are in capitals.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I've also given her two examples
dialog: to inspire her.
text: We cut to RHYDIAN BIRD. He is in the playground and has B

text: clapping pupils chanting ‘Rhydian! Rhydian! including
dialog: OLIVER, CHIPS and KEIRON. As many of our featured kids as
dialog: possible.’
scene_heading: SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 19.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Firstly, Rhydian Bird. He once
text: pulled his trousers down in the
dialog: playground to fart and followed
text: through, coiling a unhealthy turd
text: onto the tarmac. But, instead of
text: looking embarrassed, he screamed
text: with laughter and pointed. Nobody
dialog: can tease him about it because he
dialog: is so proud. I remember watching
text: him with renewed respect.
text: We see OLIVER'S AWED REACTION. WE cut to CHIPS.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT’D) c
dialog: Secondly, Chips. He wasn’t even
dialog: considered that hard until Keiron
dialog: King famously stabbed him in the
dialog: back with my compass.
dialog: We see this.
dialog: He said nothing, showed no
text: discomfort as his shirt blossomed
text: with blood poppies. His stoicism
dialog: reminded me of the brave men who
dialog: died in the first world war.
dialog: Every year on that day I hold a
text: minute’s silence in his honour.
text: OLIVER gathers up several A4 pages, signs ‘Good luck! Best
text: wishes for a persecution-free future, Oliver Tate’ at the
text: bottom, and puts them in a brown manila envelope. He then
text: searches in his drawer for something. It’s a ‘50p off’
text: voucher for a Burger Chain. He pops it in.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not quite sure that I’ve

dialog: film.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.)
dialog: The most secure route to Zoe is
dialog: Big Gene who, over the last few
dialog: months, had become her only
dialog: friend and confidant.
text: We see a brief shot of ZOE crying next to GENE, who's A
text: comforting her.
dialog: Gene told me that Zoe was very
dialog: unhappy here and moved schools. I
dialog: persuaded her to give Zoe the
dialog: pamphlet by saying it was a love
dialog: letter.

speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Why? it’s just a fucking frog.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s still a thing though. It had

speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: I wonder where they get the frogs?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t know. Probably a lake or
dialog: river nearby. They probably have a
dialog: guy who does it. I could find out.
dialog: My dad’s in this area.
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: I don’t actually want to know.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Neither do I. I’m just saying I can

speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: I wonder where Fat is.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Zoe?
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: She hasn’t been in school for a

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Hasn't she? I hadn’t noticed.
text: There’s an awkward pause.
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: I would’ve thought you would. She
dialog: leaves quite a big gap.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: She’s not really on my radar...
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Do you think it’s because we
dialog: pushed her into the pond?
scene_heading: SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 21A.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I didn’t push her.
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Do you think she’s at home just
dialog: weeping herself to death?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I didn’t push her.
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Maybe you should write to her.
dialog: Maybe you should maybe write her

dialog: you think?

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.)
dialog: She looked good except for a

dialog: Most likely caused by her dog. I
dialog: chose not to mention it.
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Have you got the camera and

text: OLIVER gets his camera from his bag and shows a brand new

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Do you have the pamphlet?
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Give me the camera.
text: Tentatively, OLIVER approaches. He hands her the camera.
speaker_heading: JORDANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Now, kneel down.
text: OLIVER does so. JORDANA leans down into a kissing
text: position. OLIVER, TENTATIVELY, KISSES her. He closes his
text: eyes. We hear a camera flash and the whirr of the motor.
text: Startled, Oliver looks to the camera. Polaroids spit out
text: onto the floor. OLIVER looks at a patch of ECZEMA on
scene_heading: JORDANA’S NECK.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.)
dialog: We kissed until our lips felt
text: swollen. Her mouth tasted of milk
dialog: and polo mints.
speaker_heading: JORDANA
dialog: Okay- take out the diary. Turn to
dialog: today’s date and write a few
dialog: paragraphs on how excited you were

speaker_heading: JORDANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you ever kissed anyone

speaker_heading: OLIVER (V.O.)
dialog: I had in fact only kissed one
dialog: person before: Zoe Preece. It was
dialog: after the Cowboys and Indian
dialog: school disco. I told her if we
dialog: were going to do it we had to
text: hide behind the refectory. Her

text: squash. It smoldered in the cold.
text: We see this as a cut-away scene. They are dressed as a Cowbdy

speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
