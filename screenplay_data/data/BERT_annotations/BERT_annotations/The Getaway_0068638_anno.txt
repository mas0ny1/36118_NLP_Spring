text: RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears
text: along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He
text: is a pro. His watch cap is now removed.
text: ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile
text: and bounces across the pavement.
text: DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming
text: building, then hits the brakes as ...
text: A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite
text: direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying
text: to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street .
text: DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the
text: smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four
text: wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the
text: sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars,
text: through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign,
text: then bores back onto the road.
text: RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in

text: DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the

text: wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon
text: City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears
dialog: from sight.
text: THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and

text: a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn.
text: RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn
text: and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden-
text: panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within...
text: THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road.
text: WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her
text: sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls
text: a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance.
text: RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station
text: Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun,
text: then moves towards the large doors of the barn.
text: CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as
text: Doc drives up the lane...
text: RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches.
text: DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe
text: his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer...
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He
text: passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway
dialog: station wagon.
text: DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is
text: cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side.
text: Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors.
text: He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks
text: around him.
text: Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy.
text: He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase,
text: not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained
dialog: a great weight.
speaker_heading: DOC

dialog: He didn't make it, Doc... you didn't
dialog: either.
text: Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. He starts to
text: turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun
text: in her purse.
text: Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc
text: swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face
text: Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the
text: chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward.
text: Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He
text: drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting
text: Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of
text: Rudy's raincoat.
text: Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the
text: precipice and into a grassy meadow below. Doc stands at the
text: crest of the hill. He looks down as Rudy's body stops
text: turning. Doc shifts the .45 to his right hand.
text: Rudy's body lies still.
text: DOC TURNS QUICKLY AWAY PROM THE HILLTOP, not giving Rudy's
text: body a second glance. Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the
text: barn, transfixed.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: How did you know?
text: Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway

scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY
text: RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and
text: onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly
text: grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs,
text: along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on
text: his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is
text: obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY
text: RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water
text: gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the
text: yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the
text: padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall
text: to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone.
text: RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his
text: hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash
text: the purling water across his face and then he laughs.

speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)

text: Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend

text: CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase
text: flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in

text: quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than
text: tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps
text: to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then
text: studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face
text: of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens

text: locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the
text: door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her
text: predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter
text: out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered
text: directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.
text: THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher

text: Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests
dialog: it to show that it
text: has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and

text: HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the

text: The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been
text: attached to his left arm and shoulder.
text: FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite Rudy. Five

text: bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her face

speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: (scared, but trying to be
dialog: friendly)
dialog: Just... tell us what you want.

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What kind of car do you have, Harold?
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: A Ford... We have a Ford.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: That's good. That's very good. Now
dialog: Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford,
dialog: check the oil and tires, we don't want
dialog: any problems on the road. One more

text: He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.
speaker_heading: RUDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRAN

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: After you come back I'll listen while you

speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THE SOLDIER
text: pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to

dialog: years old, not good-looking (his best

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (not too patronizing)

speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

text: one of them.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That certainly makes you kind of
dialog: special...
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: Yeah... I guess it does.

speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: (c ont inuing)
dialog: You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (smiles across to him)
dialog: No, I'm afraid not.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER

speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

text: CAROL STOPS NEAR DOC.
text: They look at each other...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Where's the suitcase?

dialog: lobby.
text: BACK WITHIN THE PROMENADE
speaker_heading: SERIES OF ANGLES
text: CAROL EMERGES FROM THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE followed by Doc.
text: They cross to the lockers.
text: She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the
text: proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then
text: forcing the key, shakes the lock violently.
text: Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the
text: locker number and then the number on the key. Her features
text: are now totally ashen.
text: She walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another
text: locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty.
text: Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear...
text: Doc at her shoulder.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: A man helped me open it...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (deceptive calm)
dialog: And switched keys.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He must have.
speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: (continuing - with quick

dialog: He'd figure you for longer, enough time
dialog: to try another hit. He's probably still

speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: (continuing - lashing out)
dialog: There better be a guy with the
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (lashing back)
dialog: You bastard...
text: Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc
text: forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They
text: reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the
text: promenade... eyes straining.
text: CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her
text: eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of
text: lockers, the black suitcase at his feet.
text: THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same
text: moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He
text: takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement
text: that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag
text: and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.
text: DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves
text: immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to
text: keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of
text: lockers.
text: CAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now
text: disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the
text: metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER VOICE

speaker_heading: FRAN

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (he speaks very politely)

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Come over here a minute...

text: moving with apprehension.
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: Look, I'm not going to be any trouble to

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (still polite)
dialog: Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like
dialog: it, and when I tell you to come over here
dialog: you move fast. You and I are going to get
dialog: along because I've known a lot of people
dialog: like you, so don't tell me about it
dialog: because I got your ticket going in. Now

dialog: fingers... okay?
text: Rudy smiles.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY
text: DOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of
text: lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes
dialog: in.
text: After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked
text: locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the
text: slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.
text: Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station
text: is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move
dialog: carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make
text: themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.
text: THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between
text: the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long
dialog: corridor.
text: DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed
dialog: off departure/arrival gates.
text: THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open
text: stairway winding downward.
text: DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area
text: where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the
text: loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't
text: surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps
text: behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or
text: two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and
text: starts back up the platform towards the concourse.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief
text: spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers
text: scurrying toward the awaiting train...
text: THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the
text: boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the
text: pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach
dialog: passengers.
scene_heading: CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of
text: about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight,
text: visible on the next level below.
scene_heading: THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the
text: coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he
text: speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a
text: baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and
text: into the rail car passageway.
text: DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the
text: conductor and into the train.
text: THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the
text: forward compartments.
text: DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and
text: disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car
text: vestibule.
text: ON THE CONCOURSE
text: CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard
text: the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look
text: at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc.
text: She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will
dialog: take her down to trackside...
text: Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd
text: having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring
text: down at the shining train.
scene_heading: INT. FLYER - DAY COACH
text: THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over
text: their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks,
text: clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to
text: move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried
dialog: but controlled pace.
dialog: 61.
text: AT THE END OF A PULLMAN
text: DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is
text: one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact
text: that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he
text: passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle.
text: She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an
text: overhead carriage.
text: Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her.
text: 30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30?
text: empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a
dialog: run.
text: DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR.
text: The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the
text: front of the train.
text: THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER.
text: This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace,
text: swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of
text: the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move
text: into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by
text: the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds
text: only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.
text: The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,
text: hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are
text: tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.
text: DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still
text: unknowingly two cars behind the Thief.
text: THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE
text: SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries
text: the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks
text: the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind
text: him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the
text: smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door
text: swings open.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S LOUNGE
text: The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him,
text: crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window.
text: He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly
dialog: jammed...
text: DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen
text: travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the
dialog: smoker.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a
text: PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes
text: through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,
text: like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage
text: blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and
text: begins going back in the opposite direction.
text: DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for
text: a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.
speaker_heading: PORTER
text: (appearing suddenly at Doc's
dialog: shoulder)
text: Be open five minutes out of the station.
text: Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps
text: toward his point of entrance onto the train.
text: THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing
text: the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid
text: pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The
text: Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves
text: the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.
text: DOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S LOUNGE
text: THE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks
text: about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the
text: window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls
text: the shade lower.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK
text: METAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS,
text: then begins to move forward.
text: THE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the

text: outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of
text: moving passenger cars and several parked tinders.
speaker_heading: THIEF'S POV
scene_heading: DOC GLANCING BETWEEN PARKED PASSENGER
text: CARS, walking cautiously ahead. As the

text: back out into the vestibule.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a
text: window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair
text: opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well
text: behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered
text: about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of
text: the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch
dialog: tickets.
text: As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an
text: abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.
text: He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the
text: paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief
text: rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,
text: Doc sits down next to the Thief.
text: DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (softly almost gently)
dialog: When you pop a lock don't mark it.

scene_heading: THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of

text: THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO THE ALLEY IS BLOCKED BY a large

text: DOC AND CAROL SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF FILTH, and stumbling

text: THE DRIVER GETS OUT OF THE CAB, checks to see that the

speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: DOC
