scene_heading: THE FORCE AWAKENS
text: Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
text: the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
dialog: ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
text: Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
text: With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
text: Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
text: desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
dialog: his help in restoring peace and justice to
dialog: the galaxy.
text: Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
text: mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
dialog: discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....
text: PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
text: FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
text: HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
text: moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
text: hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
scene_heading: planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
text: SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
text: instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
text: STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.
text: The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We
speaker_heading: ARE IN:
scene_heading: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT
text: TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
text: the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
text: FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
text: rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING
speaker_heading: QUIET:
scene_heading: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
text: native animals. A single wind chime.
text: Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
dialog: orange and white, this is BB-8.
text: Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
text: CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
text: CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND
scene_heading: ROLLS OFF FAST --
scene_heading: INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
text: The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
text: In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
text: kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
text: a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:
speaker_heading: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: This will begin to make things right.
dialog: I've traveled too far, and seen too
dialog: much, to ignore the despair in the
dialog: galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
dialog: be no balance in the Force.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: Well, because of you now we have a
dialog: chance. The General's been after
dialog: this for a long time.
speaker_heading: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: "The General." To me, she's royalty.
dialog: Well, she certainly is that.
speaker_heading: POE
text: BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
dialog: Tekka.
speaker_heading: POE (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got company.
scene_heading: EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
text: The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
text: POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
text: POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A
text: GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: You have to hide.
speaker_heading: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: You have to leave. Go!
text: Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
text: BB-8 follows.
scene_heading: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
text: various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.
scene_heading: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
text: come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
dialog: are HIT!
scene_heading: EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
text: village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
text: Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
text: moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
text: CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES
text: IN THE DISTANCE.
text: Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
text: The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
dialog: But just then:
text: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
text: look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!
speaker_heading: POE (CONT'D)
dialog: I see 'em!
text: BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
text: THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
text: The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
text: Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
text: Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
text: back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
dialog: They're in trouble.
scene_heading: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
text: wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
text: Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.
scene_heading: EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
text: the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
text: BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: You take this. It's safer with you
dialog: than it is with me. You get as far
dialog: away from here as you can. Do you
dialog: hear me?
dialog: (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
dialog: I'll come back for you! It will be
dialog: alright.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
text: and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
text: AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
dialog: from cover.
scene_heading: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
text: HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
text: The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
text: HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
text: just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
dialog: the battle.
scene_heading: AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --
text: LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
text: The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
text: KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
text: through the chaos toward San Tekka.
text: A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders
speaker_heading: HIM:
speaker_heading: SENIOR TROOPER
dialog: Stay here.
text: Our Trooper nods.
text: Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
text: him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
text: DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Look how old you've become.
speaker_heading: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: Something far worse has happened to
dialog: you.
text: Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
text: stormtroopers.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: You know what I've come for.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: I know where you come from. Before
dialog: you called yourself Kylo Ren.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: The map to Skywalker. We know you've
dialog: found it, and now you're going to
dialog: give it to the First Order.
text: Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
dialog: Tekka exchange continue.
speaker_heading: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: The First Order rose from the dark
dialog: side... you did not.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I'll show you the dark side.
speaker_heading: LOR SAN TEKKA
dialog: You may try, but you cannot deny the
dialog: truth that is your family.
text: Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --
scene_heading: PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --
scene_heading: YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: You're so right.
text: And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
text: Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
text: AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
scene_heading: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT
text: OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
text: Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
text: He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
text: VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
text: A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
text: closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
text: legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
text: Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: So who talks first? You talk first?
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: The old man gave it to you.
speaker_heading: POE
speaker_heading: (INDICATES KYLO'S
speaker_heading: MASK)
dialog: It's just very hard to understand
dialog: you with all the...

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
speaker_heading: (TO TROOPERS)
dialog: Search him.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: ... Apparatus.
text: The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
text: brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
text: Poe just glares as the pat down ends.
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER #1
dialog: Nothing, sir.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Put him on board.
text: Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
text: Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-
scene_heading: CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PHASMA
dialog: Sir, the villagers.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Kill them all.
text: Phasma nods, steps forward:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PHASMA
dialog: On my command!
text: The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Fire!
text: Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
text: All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
text: ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
text: STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
dialog: ours.
text: Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
text: Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
text: LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
dialog: he's doomed.
text: Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
text: after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
dialog: scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,
speaker_heading: BACKS AWAY:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER #2
dialog: Nothing here. Go ahead!
text: Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
text: destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
text: BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
text: desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
text: from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
dialog: going.
text: In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
dialog: frightened.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
text: With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
text: and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT
text: Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
text: hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: All right. All right!
text: Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:
scene_heading: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT
text: Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
text: helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
text: THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
text: in this moment, terrified, desperate.
text: After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
dialog: knows he's in trouble.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PHASMA
dialog: FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
dialog: inspection.
speaker_heading: FN-2187
dialog: Yes, Captain.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PHASMA
dialog: And who gave you permission to remove
dialog: that helmet?
speaker_heading: FN-2187
dialog: I'm sorry, Captain.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PHASMA
dialog: Report to my division at once.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
text: of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
text: GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
text: to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
text: in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
text: valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
text: Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
text: between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:
scene_heading: INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER
text: Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
text: descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
text: HARD onto rusty metal.
scene_heading: INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY
text: The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
text: piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
text: the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY
text: The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
text: and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
dialog: WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
text: She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
text: her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
dialog: whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
text: Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC
scene_heading: ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
text: of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
text: sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
text: She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
text: TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
text: SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
dialog: tiny from here.
text: Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
text: engine and DRIVES OFF.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY
text: Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED
speaker_heading: SPACESHIPS.
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
text: Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
text: Refueling, small trade, scavengers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
text: sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
text: her speeder toward the town.
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY
text: TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
text: Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
text: some salvage.
text: Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
text: passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
text: language. She returns to work.
scene_heading: INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY
text: Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
text: a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
text: unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:
speaker_heading: UNKAR
dialog: What you've brought me today is
dialog: worth... Hmmm... One quarter
dialog: portion.
text: Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
text: Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
text: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
text: She takes it.
text: She swallows her resentment and heads off.
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
text: The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
text: SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.
scene_heading: INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY
text: She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
text: another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
text: A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
text: PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
text: like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
text: Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
text: She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
text: POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
text: SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
text: it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
text: plate. Grabs the loaf.
scene_heading: EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK
text: Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
text: Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
text: silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
text: wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: CONTINUED: just 'cause.
dialog: Puts it on,
text: WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
text: an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
text: Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
text: helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
text: SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
text: Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
text: a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
text: brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
text: YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
text: Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Tal'ama parqual!
text: The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: Parqual zatana!
text: A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
text: BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
text: a tennis match.
text: Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
text: Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
text: out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
dialog: says, fiercely:
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: NOMA.
text: The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
text: HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
text: start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shhhh.
text: BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
text: Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's just Teedo. Wants you for
dialog: parts. He has no respect for anyone.
dialog: Your antenna's bent.
dialog: (considers BB-8 for
dialog: the first time,
scene_heading: STRAIGHTENS THE
speaker_heading: ANTENNA)
dialog: Where do you come from?
speaker_heading: (BB-8 BEEPS)
dialog: Classified. Really? Me too. Big
dialog: secret.
dialog: (points to horizon)
dialog: Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
dialog: Kelvin Ridge.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
dialog: the north, you'll drown in the sand.
dialog: (stands, heads off)
dialog: 
text: BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't follow me. Town is that way.
dialog: (he BEEPS again)
dialog: No!
text: She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
text: SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
text: This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
text: him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
text: on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: In the morning, you go.
speaker_heading: (HE BEEPS)
dialog: You're welcome.
text: The two disappear behind a dune.
scene_heading: EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY
text: Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I had no idea we had the best pilot
text: in the Resistance on board.
dialog: Comfortable?
text: Through battered lips:
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I'm impressed. No one has been able
dialog: to get out of you what you did with
dialog: the map.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: Might wanna rethink your technique.
text: Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
text: the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
text: him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Where is it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: The Resistance will not be intimidated
dialog: by you.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Where... is it?
text: Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY
text: WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
text: confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
text: It's in a droid. A BB unit.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
dialog: soon have it.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I leave that to you.
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
text: BB-8 is dropped to the sand.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Don't give up. He still might show
dialog: up. Whoever it is you're waiting
dialog: for. Classified. I know all about
dialog: waiting.
text: BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: For my family. They'll be back.
dialog: One day. Come on.
text: She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
text: off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.
scene_heading: INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY
text: Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
text: He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.
speaker_heading: UNKAR
dialog: These five pieces are worth... Let
dialog: me see here... One half portion.
speaker_heading: REY
speaker_heading: (OBJECTS)
dialog: Last week they were a half portion
dialog: each.
text: She hates him. He leans forward.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: UNKAR
dialog: What about the droid?
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: UNKAR
dialog: I'll pay for him.
text: BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.
speaker_heading: UNKAR (CONT'D)
text: Sixty portions.
text: CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
text: food, her stomach practically rumbles.
text: BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
dialog: conversation at all.
text: She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
text: Finally, she hears herself say:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Actually... the droid's not for sale.
speaker_heading: (TO BB-8)
dialog: Come on.
text: Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
text: watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:
speaker_heading: UNKAR
dialog: Follow the girl and get that droid.
text: He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. Poe

speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER
dialog: Ren wants the prisoner.
text: TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER

speaker_heading: (THAT'S CRAZY)

speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX

scene_heading: EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY
text: TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
text: to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
text: WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
text: A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
text: Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
text: gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Poe! Poe!
text: Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
text: SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
text: sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
text: He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
text: to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: Poe!!! POE!
text: Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
text: INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: POE!!! POE!!!
dialog: It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
text: get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
text: as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
dialog: few moments and IT'S GONE.
text: Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
text: ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
text: Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
dialog: And all alone.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
text: Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
dialog: nothingness.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a

text: ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
text: General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX

speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: How capable are your soldiers,
dialog: General?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
speaker_heading: (WITH VITRIOL)
dialog: I won't have you question my methods.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: They're obviously skilled at

dialog: clone army.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
scene_heading: (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
dialog: My men are exceptionally trained --
dialog: programmed from birth--
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Then they should have no problem
text: retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: Careful, Ren. That your "personal
dialog: interests" not interfere with orders
dialog: from Leader Snoke.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I want that map. For your sake, I
dialog: suggest you get it.
text: Ren heads off. Hux hates him.
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
text: Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
text: into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
text: old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Water... water... water..
text: He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
text: creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
text: hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
text: swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: -- Awgh, GAH!
text: But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
text: ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically
scene_heading: BEEPING BB-8.
text: Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
text: clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
text: nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
text: while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
scene_heading: OVER METAL URNS for sale --
text: Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
text: falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
text: CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
text: He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
text: but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
text: feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
text: she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
text: Finn just watches, stunned.
text: Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
text: Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
text: Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
text: SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
text: insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: (To BB-8) Who? Him?
text: Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
text: Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
text: HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
text: Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
text: her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
text: turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
text: ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
text: Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
text: holds the staff on him threateningly:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: What's your hurry, thief?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: What--?! Thief?
text: BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES
text: FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: OW! HEY! What?!
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: The jacket! This droid says you
dialog: stole it!
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I've had a pretty messed up day,
dialog: alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
dialog: stop accusing me -- OW!!!
text: (BB-8 has ZAPPED him
speaker_heading: AGAIN)
dialog: STOP IT!
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Where'd you get it? It belongs to
dialog: his master.
text: Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
text: racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
text: heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
dialog: decision: to tell the truth.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
dialog: was his name, right?
text: Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: He was captured... by the First Order!
dialog: I helped him escape but our ship
dialog: crashed.
speaker_heading: (RELIVING IT)
dialog: Poe didn't make it.
dialog: (sees BB-8 is sad,
speaker_heading: ROLLS OFF)
dialog: Look, I tried to help him. I'm
dialog: sorry...
text: BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
text: then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: So you're with the Resistance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
dialog: the Resistance, yeah.
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: I'm with the Resistance.
text: Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: I've never met a Resistance fighter
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Well, this is what we look like.
dialog: Some of us. Others look different.
speaker_heading: REY
text: BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
dialog: he has to get back to your base.
speaker_heading: FINN
text: Apparently he's carrying a map that
text: leads to Luke Skywalker, and
dialog: everyone's after it.
text: She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
dialog: myth.
text: Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
text: Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
text: to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
dialog: THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
text: Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: her hand)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Come on!
text: Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
text: SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Let go of me!
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: No, we gotta move!
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: (pulls her hand back)
dialog: I know how to run without you holding
dialog: my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
dialog: way!
text: Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
text: them! They disappear through a tent.
text: TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
text: come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER
dialog: Call in the air strike!
text: REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:
scene_heading: INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY
text: Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
dialog: Quiet, urgent:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: They're shooting at both of us!
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
dialog: marked!
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Well, thanks for that!
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I'm not the one who chased you down
dialog: with a stick! Does anyone have
dialog: blasters around here?!
speaker_heading: REY
speaker_heading: (TO BB-8)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
text: PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
scene_heading: he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop taking my hand!
scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY
text: Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
text: As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW
text: FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT
text: FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --
scene_heading: BB-8 ROLLING!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
text: EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
text: Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
text: afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
text: Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
text: ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Hey!
text: As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: -- Are you okay?
dialog: And that very question touches her -- having never in her
dialog: life been asked it.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (extends her hand)
dialog: Follow me.

scene_heading: EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: We can't outrun them!
text: Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: REY

speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: The weapon. It is ready. I believe

dialog: Without their friends to protect
dialog: them, the Resistance will be
dialog: vulnerable, and we will stop them

text: Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: Go. Oversee preparations.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: Yes, Supreme Leader.
text: General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him

speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: There's been an awakening. Have you
dialog: felt it?
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: There's something more. The droid

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Nah, don't say that, you did great.

speaker_heading: FINN

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: This map's not complete. It's just
dialog: a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
dialog: people have been looking for him.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Why'd he leave?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: He was training a new generation of
text: Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Do you know what happened to him?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: There're a lot of rumors. Stories.

speaker_heading: REY
dialog: The Jedi were real?
speaker_heading: HAN

text: back to normal, and turns to Han.
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: Who's the girl?
speaker_heading: ON FINN
text: Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I was told you could get me to the
dialog: Outer Rim.
text: Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Finn gets up to talk to her.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: (to Big Head)
dialog: Don't leave without me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Embarrassed, Finn moves her away.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: You can't just go. I won't let you.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I'm not who you think I am.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Finn, what are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
dialog: I'm a Stormtrooper.
speaker_heading: (STOPS HER)
dialog: Like all of them, I was taken from a
dialog: family I'll never know. And raised
dialog: to do one thing...
speaker_heading: (EMOTIONAL)
dialog: But my first battle, I made a choice.
dialog: I wasn't going to kill for them. So
dialog: I ran.
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: Right into you. And you looked at
dialog: me like no one ever had. I was
dialog: ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
dialog: with the First Order. I'm never
dialog: going back. Rey, come with me.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Don't go.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Take care of yourself. Please.
text: Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
text: watches Finn return to the aliens...
text: And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
dialog: through it.
text: Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
text: young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
text: the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
text: back at her one last time.
scene_heading: INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
text: her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
text: she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
text: girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
text: where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
text: draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE
speaker_heading: DOOR OPENS.
text: Hesitant, Rey enters.
scene_heading: INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY
text: Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
text: treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
text: specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
text: She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
text: the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
text: Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
text: heavy with tension.
text: Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
text: lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
text: she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
text: is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
text: her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
text: The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
text: something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
text: CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: NO!
text: She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
text: hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
text: We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
text: TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
text: WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
text: She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
dialog: NIGHT. We PAN to:
text: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
text: whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
text: out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
text: We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
dialog: and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
text: To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
text: FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
text: FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
text: battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
text: sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
text: other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
text: Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
text: SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
dialog: and see...
text: A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
text: Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
text: watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: No, come back!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: UNKAR PLUTT
dialog: Quiet, girl!
text: The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
text: eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
dialog: her to see she is..
text: In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
text: confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
text: seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
text: LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
text: Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
text: A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:
scene_heading: INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
text: She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
text: hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
text: She HEARS something and turns to look.
text: Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
dialog: just happened.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: What was that? I shouldn't have
dialog: gone in there.
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
dialog: father's before him and now, it calls
dialog: to you!
text: Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: I have to get back to Jakku.
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: Han told me.
dialog: (reaches out, hold
speaker_heading: REY'S HAND)
dialog: Dear child. I see your eyes. You
dialog: already know the truth. Whomever
dialog: you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
dialog: never coming back. But... there's
dialog: someone who still could.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Luke.
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: The belonging you seek is not behind
dialog: you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
dialog: but I know the Force. It moves
dialog: through and surrounds every living
dialog: thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAZ (CONT'D)
dialog: The light. It's always been there.
dialog: It will guide you. The saber. Take
dialog: it.
text: Rey suddenly stands.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: I'm never touching that again. I
dialog: don't want any part of this.
text: And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
text: Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
text: heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
text: her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
text: Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
text: Heads toward the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
text: HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
dialog: come.
scene_heading: EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
text: A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
scene_heading: OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
text: SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
text: RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: Today is the end of the Republic!
text: The end of a regime that acquiesces
dialog: to disorder! At this very moment,
dialog: in a system far from here the New
text: Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
dialog: secretly supporting the treachery of
dialog: the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
dialog: machine which you have built, upon
dialog: which we stand, will bring an end to
dialog: the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
dialog: All remaining systems will bow to
dialog: the First Order! And will remember
dialog: this... as the last day of the
dialog: Republic!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
text: ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
text: nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?
scene_heading: EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
speaker_heading: FIRE!
text: And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
text: ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
text: to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!
scene_heading: EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
text: A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily
scene_heading: SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC
text: BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
text: THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
text: The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
dialog: FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
text: For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
text: Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
text: CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
text: Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
dialog: eyes, CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY
text: TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY
text: Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
text: makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
text: runs cold, his heart sinks.
scene_heading: EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT
text: At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL
scene_heading: SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST
text: FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!
scene_heading: EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT
text: The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
text: structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
text: horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
text: FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN
scene_heading: APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
text: NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING
text: ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!
scene_heading: EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
text: A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
text: FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
text: horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: FINN (O.S.)
dialog: It was the Republic.
text: Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
text: the crowd. With dread:
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: The First Order, they've done it.
dialog: Where's Rey?
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
text: overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
text: she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
text: A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: (HE BEEPS)
dialog: You have to go back.
dialog: (he BEEPS again)
speaker_heading: REY (CONT'D)
dialog: BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
dialog: go back, you're too important.
dialog: They'll help you.
text: Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
text: front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
text: ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER
text: FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!
scene_heading: INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: I've had this for ages...
scene_heading: MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
text: Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:
speaker_heading: MAZ
text: Kept it locked away.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Where'd you get that?
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: A good question for another time.
speaker_heading: (TO FINN)
dialog: Take it! Find your friend!
text: Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.
speaker_heading: MAZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Those beasts! They're here!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
dialog: SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
text: DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
text: OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
text: and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
text: Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
text: STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER
dialog: FN-417, hold position!
text: Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
text: She panics, then realizes:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Safety!
text: SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
dialog: and retreats, calls to BB-8:
text: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
dialog: chasing Troopers!
scene_heading: EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY
text: Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER #4
dialog: Sir, the droid was spotted heading
text: west, with a girl.
text: Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: You have to keep going, stay out of
dialog: sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
dialog: (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
dialog: through her fear)
dialog: I hope so, too.
text: BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
text: a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY
text: Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
dialog: debris.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: Maz turns to Finn:
speaker_heading: MAZ

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I need a weapon.
text: Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.
speaker_heading: MAZ
dialog: You have one!
text: He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
dialog: lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
text: HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
dialog: Stormtroopers, taking some out!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Hey, can I try that?
text: Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
text: and sends them flying.
speaker_heading: HAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CHEWBACCA)
dialog: I like this thing.
text: FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
dialog: another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
dialog: Stormtrooper has a MACE --
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER
dialog: Traitor!
text: FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
text: KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,

text: Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
text: Han helps him up.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: You okay, Big deal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Thanks!
text: But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.
speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER
dialog: Don't move! TK-338, we have targets

dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER

text: Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
text: Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward

scene_heading: INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY

speaker_heading: SNAP (V.O.)

speaker_heading: HAN

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster

text: COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
text: Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
text: Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
text: again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO
scene_heading: DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
text: She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
text: rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: The girl I've heard so much about.
text: He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KYLO REN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is it?
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY

text: She is relieved but still afraid.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: The map. You've seen it.
text: Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
text: stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
text: She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
text: Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE

speaker_heading: STORMTROOPER #5
dialog: Sir, Resistance fighters! We need

text: Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
dialog: Han is ROCKED.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: NO!! REY!!!
text: Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS

scene_heading: CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no, no... REY!!

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

speaker_heading: HAN
speaker_heading: (WALKS PAST)

scene_heading: EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

text: ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
text: Finally, the transport door opens.
text: And standing there is LEIA.
text: She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
text: wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
text: embers, no one says a word.
text: Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:
speaker_heading: C-3PO
dialog: Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
dialog: Threepio!
dialog: (sees Han, stops)
dialog: You probably don't recognize me
dialog: because of the red arm.

dialog: Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
dialog: Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.
speaker_heading: (BB-8 BEEPS)
dialog: Yes, I must get my proper arm

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: You changed your hair.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Same jacket.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No, new jacket.
text: Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS

text: It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:
speaker_heading: HAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.

text: Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
text: Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
text: THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.
dialog: IT IS POE!
text: Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
text: WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Poe. Poe Dameron.

speaker_heading: FINN

speaker_heading: C-3PO
dialog: General, I regret to inform you, but
dialog: this map recovered from BB-8 is only
dialog: partially complete. And even worse,
dialog: it matches no charted system on

speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I can't believe I was so foolish to

speaker_heading: HAN

speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Don't do that.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Do what?
text: She heads off.
speaker_heading: LEIA

scene_heading: INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
text: LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and

scene_heading: RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
dialog: R2. Nothing. Then:
speaker_heading: C-3PO (O.S.)
dialog: BB-8. You're wasting your time.
text: BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.
speaker_heading: C-3PO (CONT'D)
dialog: It is very doubtful that R2 would
dialog: have the rest of the map in his backup
dialog: data.
speaker_heading: (BB-8 BEEPS)
dialog: I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
dialog: low power mode ever since Master

scene_heading: INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

speaker_heading: HAN

speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: You think I want to forget him? I

text: Han looks at her with sympathy.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: There was nothing we could've done.
dialog: (hard for him to say)
dialog: There was too much Vader in him.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: That's why I wanted him to train

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HAN

speaker_heading: LEIA

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: We lost our son, forever.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: (LONG BEAT)

speaker_heading: LEIA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HAN

scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
speaker_heading: (LONG BEAT)
dialog: You're my guest.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Where are the others?
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: You mean the murderers, traitors and

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN (CONT'D)
dialog: You still want to kill me.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: That happens when you're being hunted
text: by a creature in a mask.
text: Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
text: and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
text: before she regains her own mask of defiance.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Tell me about the droid.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: (a nervous beat)
text: He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
dialog: and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
text: He's carrying a section of a
dialog: navigational chart. We have the
dialog: rest, recovered from archives of the
dialog: Empire. We need the last piece.
dialog: And somehow, you convinced the droid
dialog: to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
dialog: Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?
speaker_heading: KYLO REN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I can take whatever I want.
text: Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
text: his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
text: go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
text: THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
text: between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
text: And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
text: quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... You're so lonely... so afraid to
dialog: leave...
dialog: (then, slight smile)
dialog: At night, desperate to sleep... you
dialog: imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
dialog: the island...
text: Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
text: break free, but can't budge.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN (CONT'D)
dialog: And Han Solo. You feel like he's
dialog: the father you never had. He would've
dialog: disappointed you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: -- Get out of my head --
text: But this just makes Kylo lean closer.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I know you've seen the map. It's in
dialog: there... and now you'll give it to
dialog: me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
dialog: too.
text: Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: I'm not giving you anything.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: We'll see.
text: He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --
text: DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
text: On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
text: slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
text: certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
text: FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass
text: AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED
dialog: AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: ... You... you're afraid... that you
dialog: will never be as strong as... Darth
dialog: Vader!
text: KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
text: FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
text: is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
text: Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
dialog: And we PRELAP:
speaker_heading: SNOKE (V.O.)
dialog: This scavenger, resisted you?
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
text: She's strong with the Force, untrained
text: but, stronger than she knows.
text: And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: And the droid?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
dialog: Ren believed it was no longer valuable
dialog: to us.
text: Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
text: platform beside Ren.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
dialog: That the girl was all we needed. As
dialog: a result, the droid has most likely
dialog: been returned to the hands of the
dialog: enemy. They may have the map already.
text: Snoke is visibly furious.
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: Then the Resistance must be destroyed
text: before they get to Skywalker.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: We have their location. We tracked
dialog: their reconnaissance ship to the
dialog: Ileenium system.
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: Good. Then we will crush them once
dialog: and for all. Prepare the weapon.
text: Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
dialog: at all --
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Supreme Leader. I can get the map
dialog: from the girl. I just need your
dialog: guidance.
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: If what you say about this girl is
dialog: true, bring her to me.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
text: happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
dialog: emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
dialog: moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
text: She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
dialog: intense beat. Then says:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: You will remove these restraints.
dialog: And leave this cell, with the door
dialog: open.
text: The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TROOPER GUARD #2
dialog: What did you say?

speaker_heading: REY
dialog: You will remove these restraints.
dialog: And leave this cell, with the door
dialog: open.
text: The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
text: Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
dialog: laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:
speaker_heading: TROOPER GUARD #2
dialog: I'll tighten those restraints,
dialog: scavenger scum!
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

dialog: And leave this cell, with the door
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: TROOPER GUARD #2
dialog: I will remove these restraints. And
dialog: leave this cell, with the door open.
text: He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
text: AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
text: IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: And you will drop your weapon.
speaker_heading: TROOPER GUARD #2
dialog: And I'll drop my weapon.
text: The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
text: Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has
text: LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.
text: REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in

speaker_heading: HAPPENED.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KYLO REN

text: WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR
text: the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces

text: Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
text: TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

text: PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in
dialog: comparison.
speaker_heading: POE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Starkiller Base.

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: So it's big.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ACKBAR
dialog: How is it possible to power a weapon
dialog: of this size?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: It uses the power of the sun. As

speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (eyes on datacard)
dialog: The First Order: they're charging

dialog: Our system is the next target.
speaker_heading: C-3PO

text: Han is surprised.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL STATURA
dialog: (at first hesitant)
dialog: In order for that amount of power to

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: There is one.

scene_heading: HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE.
speaker_heading: FINN (CONT'D)
dialog: Precinct 47. Here.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL STATURA
speaker_heading: (HYPOTHESIZING)

speaker_heading: MAJOR EMATT
dialog: ... Maybe the planet.
text: Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG
text: HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: We'll go in there and we'll hit that

speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ACKBAR

scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY
text: TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
text: Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
text: the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
text: From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
text: WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
text: side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
text: pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
text: At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
text: HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
text: TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
text: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
text: STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
text: As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
text: BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
text: and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
text: Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
text: the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
text: over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
text: WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
text: not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
text: But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
text: strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
text: She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
text: behind her.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY
text: A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
text: Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
text: infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
text: between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
text: makes her way ACROSS.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off

scene_heading: INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS

scene_heading: INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
text: Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when

dialog: demeanor changes --
text: HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
text: down into the filter.
text: Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
text: WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
text: toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
text: OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
text: was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
text: From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,
text: HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
text: Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
text: watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
text: THAT BISECTS the open space.
text: Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
text: the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
text: CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
text: This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
text: through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
text: edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Ben!
text: The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
text: catwalk. He turns.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Han Solo. I've been waiting for
dialog: this day for a long time.
text: Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
text: that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like

speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: Your son is gone. He was weak and

dialog: It's too late.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No it's not. Leave here with me.
dialog: Come home. We miss you.
text: For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears

speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I'm being torn apart. I want to be
dialog: free of this pain.
scene_heading: INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS
text: Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: I know what I have to do, but I don't
dialog: know if I have the strength to do
dialog: it. Will you help me?
text: Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yes. Anything.
text: Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
text: Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
text: it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
text: LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch
speaker_heading: VANISHES.
text: Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
text: but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH
text: DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS
text: OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

scene_heading: LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --

dialog: All teams - I'm going in! Pull up
dialog: and cover me!
speaker_heading: NIV LEK
dialog: Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck,
dialog: Poe!
text: The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
text: into the fiery breach.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS
text: Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH
scene_heading: THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:
scene_heading: STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
dialog: Weapon at full capacity in thirty
dialog: seconds.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
dialog: Prepare to fire.
scene_heading: EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT
text: Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
text: fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
text: interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
text: volley of torpedoes.
scene_heading: EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT
text: The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --
text: and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground
speaker_heading: EXPLOSIONS!
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
scene_heading: Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
scene_heading: BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
text: as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
text: She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
text: dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
text: MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
text: Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
text: DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A
scene_heading: MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!
speaker_heading: KYLO REN
dialog: You need a teacher! I can show you
dialog: the ways of the Force!
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: The Force.
text: Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
text: she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
text: SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
text: FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
text: BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
text: Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
text: GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES
text: AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND
scene_heading: CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
text: SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
text: And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
text: But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
text: even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
text: SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
text: giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
text: watches this out the control room window in horror. He
text: hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:
speaker_heading: COLONEL DATOO
dialog: Lieutenant, get back to your station!
speaker_heading: YOUNG TECHNICIAN
dialog: (stops, fleetingly)
dialog: Just look. We won't survive -- even
dialog: Hux has gone!
text: As he hurries off, WE HEAR:
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
dialog: Supreme Leader.
scene_heading: INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
text: Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
text: distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
text: but is horrified, heartsick:
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUX
text: The fuel cells have ruptured. The
text: collapse of the planet has begun.
text: Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.
speaker_heading: SNOKE
dialog: Leave the base at once and come to
dialog: me with Kylo Ren.
speaker_heading: (GRIM)
text: It is time to complete his training.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
text: Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
text: FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
text: FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
text: sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: Finn! Finn...
text: Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
text: body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
text: holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
text: They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
text: planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
text: is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:
text: LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
text: KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights
text: ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
text: CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!
scene_heading: EXT. FALCON - NIGHT
text: Chewie exits the ship.
text: MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
dialog: with them back into the ship --
scene_heading: INT. FALCON - NIGHT
text: Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
text: And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
text: see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
text: US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.
scene_heading: INT. X-WING - NIGHT
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: All teams! I got eyes on them!
speaker_heading: SNAP
dialog: Yes!
text: The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
text: IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
dialog: get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
text: Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
dialog: corner of the galaxy.
text: The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
dialog: headed home.
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: Our job's done here. Let's go home!
scene_heading: EXT. D'QAR - DAY
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.
scene_heading: EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
text: The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
text: Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
text: carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
text: meet them, usher them inside.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
dialog: heartbeat.
text: Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
text: C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
dialog: Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
text: The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
text: face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
text: She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
text: Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.
scene_heading: INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
text: Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
dialog: their losses.
text: As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
text: stirs. The droids beep at each other.
speaker_heading: C-3PO
dialog: R2-D2! You've come back! You found
dialog: what? How dare you call me that!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: C-3PO (CONT'D)
text: (he swats R2-D2, who
scene_heading: CONTINUES BEEPING)
dialog: Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
dialog: must go tell the others at once!
scene_heading: INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
text: Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.
speaker_heading: C-3PO (O.S.)
dialog: General? Excuse me, General?
text: Leia turns to see droids.
speaker_heading: C-3PO (CONT'D)
dialog: R2-D2 may contain some much needed
dialog: good news.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Tell me.
text: Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
text: Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A
text: LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
text: BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --
speaker_heading: POE
dialog: Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
text: Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
text: San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
text: back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
text: SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --
text: TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN
scene_heading: R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
dialog: Everyone REACTS -- amazed --
speaker_heading: C-3PO
dialog: Oh! The map! It is complete!
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (hand on her heart)
dialog: -- Luke --
text: Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
text: C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:
speaker_heading: C-3PO
dialog: (to R2-D2)
dialog: Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY
text: A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
text: uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
text: leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
dialog: despite her fear:
speaker_heading: REY
dialog: We'll see each other again. I believe
dialog: that. Thank you, my friend.
scene_heading: EXT. D'QAR - DAY
text: Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
text: with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
text: Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Rey.
text: Rey turns around.
speaker_heading: LEIA (CONT'D)
dialog: May the Force be with you.
text: This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
dialog: the Falcon.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
text: Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
text: at him compassionately.
scene_heading: Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --
scene_heading: EXT. D'QAR - DAY
text: The Millennium Falcon RISES.
text: Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
text: replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
dialog: journey.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - DAY
text: The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.
scene_heading: EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
text: A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
text: random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
text: with countless GREEN TREES.
text: The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
text: the ISLANDS.
scene_heading: EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
text: Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
text: considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
text: who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
text: and Rey continues her journey.
scene_heading: EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY
text: Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
text: seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
text: climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.
scene_heading: EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY
text: Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
text: structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
dialog: senses no one.
text: And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
text: Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
text: in a CLOAK AND ROBE.
text: Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
text: for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
text: to her. Pulls back his hood.
text: IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.
text: Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
text: in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
dialog: need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
dialog: look says it all.
text: In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.
scene_heading: LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
text: And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
dialog: only hope.
text: HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
text: conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
dialog: of an adventure, just beginning...
