scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 3

scene_heading: THE ELECTRIC DREAMS ARCADE. A BIG GRAND OPENING SIGN hangs

scene_heading: INT. ARCADE - DAY 4
dialog: Its like going into another world. All the classic games are
scene_heading: lined up: PAC MAN, DONKEY KONG, CENTIPEDE, SPACE INVADERS,
scene_heading: GALAGA, Q-BERT, PAPERBOY, ASTEROIDS, BREAKOUT. And they’re
text: all BRAND NEW. The guys enter. Cooper opens the mason jar,
text: both guys grab a handful of quarters and they fan out.
text: Brenner waits in line for the holy grail: PAC MAN, watching
text: OTHERS playing and losing. He studies their moves, the game’s
text: controls, taking in every success, every failure.
text: Cooper plays GALAGA. On screen we see him GETTING KILLED BY
text: THE ALIEN/BUG INVADERS THREE TIMES REAL QUICK. He’s terrible.
text: It’s Brenner’s turn on Pac Man. He steps up, puts in his
text: quarter and starts to play. Cooper steps up, watching over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COOPER
dialog: Which one’s the alien, Sam, the
dialog: cheese wedge guy or the rainbow
dialog: blobs?
dialog: *
scene_heading: Numbered Script (04/17/2014) 2.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BRENNER
dialog: Neither. Those blobs are ghosts,

dialog: He’s a... I don’t know what he is,
dialog: but he seems like a good guy.
text: Cooper shakes his head, looks at the game Brenner's playing:
text: cU of an 80’s 8 Bit video screen as PACMAN RACES ACROSS IT.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COOPER
dialog: Wow. How are you so good at this
dialog: game? You’ve never even played it
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BRENNER
dialog: I don’t know. There’s a pattern to how
dialog: they are moving. Watch...
text: He does. ON SCREEN the game seems to slow down. We see
text: numbers and arrows superimposed over the action in Brenner's

dialog: bonus cherries are going to appear, etc.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COOPER
dialog: I don’t see it. But you sure do.
scene_heading: CHEAP TRICK’S SONG continues as CREDITS PLAY OVER:

text: 80s kids, janitors, etc. watching slack-jawed), high score
text: after high score, crowds growing, “SAM” taking over the
dialog: entire top ten scores.
text: - As a huge crowd has gathered around Brenner, Cooper plays
text: “the Crane Game” by himself in a lonely corner. He deftly
text: maneuvers the claw over an array of stuffed animals and
text: rubber masks. Cooper lowers the claw over a Chewbacca mask.
text: the claw grabs it, but it gets stuck. Will Cooper get it?
text: CUT TO Brenner playing ASTEROIDS, surrounded by a respectful
text: crowd. He steps away from the machine.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BRENNER
dialog: Sorry, folks, I gotta eat.
text: His guy “dies”. The crowd applauds and pats him on the back
text: as he walks over to Cooper - standing there in the Chewbacca
text: mask. He hands Brenner a “Reggie” bar.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COOPER
dialog: You can’t stop playing, can you?

speaker_heading: YOUNG COOPER
dialog: Finish him, Sam!

speaker_heading: BRENNER
dialog: Yeah, where do I know that from?...

speaker_heading: PRESS SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. President, we told the press that it

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT COOPER

speaker_heading: ADMIRAL PORTER *
dialog: Nonsense! I suspect a North Korean

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT COOPER
dialog: I have a theory. I think, based on

speaker_heading: CIA CHIEF

speaker_heading: JUNIOR AIDE
