scene_heading: EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - DUSK
text: BIRDS ARE FLUSHED FROM HIDING. A soldier carrying an automatic
text: weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around. A mortar
text: shell explodes nearby. There are no sound effects. He seems
text: unperturbed.
text: Several more explosions in the field. The soldier motions
dialog: with his arm and:
text: FIFTY MORE SOLDIERS RISE UP OUT OF THE GRASS More small
dialog: explosions.
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME
text: With a click-click of a camera -- still no fx.
text: THE SOLDIERS RUN THROUGH THE GRASS FOLLOWING THEIR LEADER As
text: they do, the platoon leader waves his arms again.
text: FIVE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT OF THE SHRUBBERY Through a field
text: of small mortar explosions.
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME
text: With the click-click of a camera.
text: THE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS Each carries an
text: enormous load of supplies, and each is ridden by a soldier
text: with a rifle.
text: A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP DIVES OUT OF THE SKY firing rockets at
text: the soldiers and elephants. A tribal mask is painted on the
text: nose of the chopper.
text: THE ELEPHANTS REAR UP IN TERROR
text: The soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the

scene_heading: INT./EXT. LOBBY OF THE 'NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL' - DAWN
text: A door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears
text: at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi-
text: pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat
text: up canvas bag over his shoulder.
text: A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk.
text: Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good
text: morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines --
text: one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and
text: a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the
dialog: lobby.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOTEL - DAWN
text: JIMMY, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against
text: the wall. Several street vendors have their wares laid out
text: on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by
text: makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives;
text: there is familiar ritual in their greeting.
text: They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi,
text: a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the
text: door, "New People's Taxi Company" and Jimmy's name in script
text: above it. Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: 'Morning, Jimmy, think you could
dialog: squeeze me in?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Where is you would care to go at
dialog: once, Mr. Price?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Bang-bang.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Twenty dollar.
text: Price hands him a wad of bills.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You're a thief, Jimmy.
text: Jimmy smiles broadly, nodding, then points to the sky.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't do skies.
text: The two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an
text: open marketplace just starting to come alive; the cab drives
dialog: off.
scene_heading: EXT. A REMOTE AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY
text: The taxi arrives, and Price gets out.
text: Price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against
text: an old building. A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra --
text: with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a
text: joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit.
text: The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness.
text: Price hurries to the corner.
scene_heading: P.O.V. A JEEP LEADING AN ARMY CONVOY
text: Price pulls a handful of colored rags from his pocket and
text: picks out a yellow kerchief, tying it to his arm. Price then
text: steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching
text: convoy. He exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep, and
text: with a motion is given permission to join.
text: PRICE CLIMBS INTO THE LAST OF THREE TROOP TRUCKS
text: Each truck is filled with perhaps 25 African soldiers in
text: khaki, each holding an automatic rifle. Another jeep follows,
text: towing a World War II cannon.

scene_heading: INSIDE THE TROOP TRUCK - DAY
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (cheerily)
dialog: Hi, guys.
text: The soldiers look over disinterestedly. Two dozen cases of
text: Coca-Cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns.
text: As Price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras
text: from his bag. Quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he
text: switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras. He
dialog: has done this a thousand times.
text: A SINGLE WHITE SOLDIER -- OATES, rises from among the blacks,
text: and shakily makes his way toward Price. A mercenary dressed
text: in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine
text: guns and a .45. He smiles broadly, recognizing Price. HODGE
text: slaps Price's hands as if they were teammates.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: G'damn, Price, you tuna sucking piece
dialog: of raw meat -- whatchyou goin' to
dialog: Zambeze for?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Thought I'd get some great shots of

speaker_heading: OATES

speaker_heading: PRICE

speaker_heading: OATES

dialog: Trade ya some greenies for a joint.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I gotta have a joint.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I'm on the wagon, man, sorry.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Ahh. Dope-wise, this place sucks.
dialog: (looks around, leans
dialog: in confidentially)
dialog: Lotta fuckin' coons around here, eh?
text: They nod. He laughs obscenely and deeply.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I thought you were fighting for the
dialog: Government?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: I am. This is the Government.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: These are the Rebels.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Fuck they are. This is a Government
text: convoy to Calunda.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: This is the Abou-Deian Revolutionary
dialog: Front.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: You're shitting me.
text: Pause. Finally Oates starts laughing uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: These guys be pissed if they knew,
dialog: eh?
dialog: (Price nods in
dialog: agreement; Oates
dialog: suddenly gets serious)
dialog: This is the dumbest motherfucker I
dialog: ever signed up for. Don't pay shit
dialog: either.
dialog: (Price nods in
dialog: agreement)
dialog: Nicaragua. That's the spot. Cheap

scene_heading: EXT. THE REBEL'S AIRFIELD - DAY
text: The convoy rumbles past a check-point into a small airfield
text: containing a motley collection of DC-3's and old planes. TWO
text: RUSSIAN ADVISORS and THREE CUBAN ADVISORS watch.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Well hell... I wonder where the
dialog: fuckin' Guvmint is?
text: As he speaks, the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar
text: shell and explodes. Soldiers scramble to safety. Some grab
text: the guns being transported.
text: TWO SOLDIERS GRAB THE STRETCHER OF COKE and start running
text: for safety. Smoke and explosions are everywhere -- they
dialog: abandon their cargo and run for cover.
text: OATES SCRAMBLES TO SAFE GROUND quickly and instinctively,
text: looking around wildly to "read" the situation. Price dives
text: next to him.
text: A SOLDIER IS HIT AND GOES DOWN NEARBY, staggering towards
dialog: Price and Oates.
text: A DC-3 GOES UP IN FLAMES IN THE BACKGROUND
text: THE WOUNDED SOLDIER REACHES FOR OATES who darts out quickly
text: and drags the injured Rebel to safety.
text: PRICE HAS HIS CAMERAS OUT AT ONCE and is firing away.
text: TWO REBEL SOLDIERS POINT TO THE STRETCHER OF COCA-COLA and
text: start moving toward it through the smoke. They want to rescue
dialog: the soft drinks.
text: PRICE LEAPS FROM HIS BUNKER AND RACES TOWARD THEM dangerously,
text: waving and shouting as he does.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Hold it! Hold it!
text: They don't speak English but stop at his craziness.
text: PRICE STOPS AND AIMS HIS CAMERA, and as he does he motions
dialog: for the soldiers to continue.
scene_heading: P.O.V. THE FRAMED IMAGE -- SOLDIERS, SMOKE AND COKE IN B.G.
text: As the soldiers move toward the Coke, Price snaps picture
dialog: after picture.
text: A MORTAR EXPLOSION BLOWS THE COCA-COLA TO A MILLION BITS The
text: two soldiers stop short -- several more steps and they would
text: have been killed. Price's intrusion has accidentally saved
text: them. The two soldiers run toward safety, bewildered and
dialog: scared.
text: ON THE AIRFIELD - THE SMOKE CLEARS AND ALL IS CALM
text: Gradually the airfield comes back to life. Several teams of
text: medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering
text: bodies. Rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter
text: and move across the field.
text: Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst
text: the rubble. They look around at the devastation.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Well, I guess we know where the
dialog: Guvmint is.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (cynically)
dialog: You can walk to work from here.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Convenient, ain't it?
text: Oates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly,
text: as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: My brother just got married.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't know your brother.
text: Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the
text: field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren
text: goes off.
text: A JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE
scene_heading: SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER
text: JET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it
dialog: drops something else:
text: THE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet
text: pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million
text: papers flutter in the sky above the airfield.
text: Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots
text: at the paper.
text: Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is:
text: A PICTURE OF A SWIMMING POOL IN FRONT OF A CALIFORNIA HOUSE
text: HE STARES AT THE IMAGE and turns it over. There is writing
text: on the backside in Spanish and Russian. He looks around.
text: OATES WANDERS OVER with a handful of the leaflets.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Great shit, eh?
text: Price tries to read the writing on the back as Oates looks
text: at a leaflet familiarly.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: U.S. Gummint offers this house to
dialog: any Cuban pilot flying Migs for the
dialog: Rebels who chooses to defect to
dialog: America with a Russian jet. We know
dialog: they ain't gonna run off with no
dialog: planes -- but the Rebs don't --
text: They're scared. They start thinking
dialog: about that swimming pool. Damn near
dialog: smell that chlorine. Starts workin'
dialog: on 'em, and pretty soon they don't
dialog: let the Cubies near a Mig. Use their
dialog: own spook pilots and destroy their
dialog: own air force in a week. Guaran-fuckin-
dialog: teed.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: C.I.A.?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: Smartest guys in the world.
dialog: (afterthought)
dialog: Hey, you gotta scoop here, eh? You'll
dialog: be famous.
text: OATES shakes hands with Price who looks at the picture.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (dispassionately)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: I gotta run... have a good one.
text: Oates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing

text: CLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she
text: times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's
text: high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser.
text: ALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a
text: dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are
text: littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of
dialog: their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes,
dialog: pictures.
text: Their love affairs of three years is ending.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: "...and so this strange war that
dialog: features two provincial governments,
dialog: three rival liberation fronts, and
dialog: at least twenty-five tribal

dialog: year..."
text: Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and
text: tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story.
text: Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the
dialog: call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: "...The Battle for the Airfield at
dialog: Abou Deia is just another chapter in
dialog: this endless story. From Ndjamena,
dialog: Chad, this is Claire Stryder."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No -- you didn't hear any music --
dialog: must be the connection. Okay? So
dialog: long.
text: She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Alex, don't play that God damn thing
dialog: when I'm filing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We're late.
text: Quickly expressed, her anger passes.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's my party -- we'll be late. You
dialog: called it a "strange war" and an
dialog: "endless story." If you filed that
dialog: story for me, I'd say you were
dialog: editorialishing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I like to editorialize. You drunk?
dialog: Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his
text: ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Drunk? Only with the memories of
dialog: making love with you on the plains
dialog: of Fianga as the first Army of
dialog: Liberation marched in and opened
dialog: fire.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And freed the Proletariat.
text: Alex raises a drink.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE

scene_heading: INT. THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Christ, I don't want to go to this
dialog: stupid party. I'm bad at false
dialog: modesty.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're great at it.
text: She straightens his half-tied tie in an act of familiar
text: affection rather than motherliness. Nervousness. She speaks
dialog: calmly -- this is ground they have already covered.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Alex, you're going to make a great
dialog: anchorman in New York and undoubtedly
dialog: I could be a Pulitzer Prize winning
dialog: hostess -- but I'm not going with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You can work out of the East Coast.
dialog: We'll get a place on Long Island and

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I still like suitcases.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Every Saturday night we'll have a
dialog: party... invite all our friends, sit

dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I've done all that.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I haven't.
dialog: (beat; changes tack)
dialog: Well, God dammit, I'm getting tired

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mamoon Abdul Gayoom.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul

text: They both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop.
text: The door doesn't open, and the light flickers.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And I'm tired of Third World

text: He bangs the door with his fist. It opens, and they enter a

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Don't leave me.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I already have.
text: As they approach the door to the party, he speaks with new
dialog: toughness.
speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater
dialog: war.
text: Though both upset, they act as if everything is normal.
text: PRICE STANDS ON A CHAIR AT THE CENTER summoning Alex who
text: moves through the group with ease, instantly at home. Price

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Alex, get up here!

speaker_heading: VOICES FROM CROWD

text: of Chad. The crowd begins singing "Caravan" in a half-drunken
dialog: tribute to a man they like and respect.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: That's pretty clean.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But he's decided to go to Nicaragua

speaker_heading: PRICE

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
text: He kisses her on the neck.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: For godsakes, Russell, listen.
text: The sounds of the party can be heard. He ignores them and

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't want to wait for you again.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're a genius of bad timing.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: This is a great shot.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I've heard the light in Nicaragua's

text: A FIRE TRUCK LEADS A PROCESSION through the streets -- a
text: group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that
dialog: reads "Our Revolution is in Christ" (in Spanish), followed
text: by three Catholic PRIESTS in bright robes, followed by a
text: sound truck with P.A. system, followed by hundreds of
text: townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs. All
text: are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm.
text: Small red and black flags are scattered throughout.
text: A CAB DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS runs into the parade and
text: stops. Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied
text: precariously to the roof. The trunk of the cab has been
text: smashed in beyond repair. Price hops out of the cab with his

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Wait here.
text: He runs to join the procession.

scene_heading: TOWNSPEOPLE HANG FROM DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS, ICE CREAM CARTS
text: AMONG RELIGIOUS ICONS, SOLDIERS WITH GUNS STAND IN SMALL
text: GROUPS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE.
text: PRICE IS QUICKLY TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING, changing

text: actions are instinctive and automatic. Suddenly:
text: TEN YOUNG TEENAGERS BURST INTO THE PARADE They wear red and
text: black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks. They
dialog: are chanting:
speaker_heading: TEENAGE BOYS
dialog: Rafael, Rafael, Rafael... libre o
dialog: muerte... Rafael...
text: A LARGE PAINTING OF THE FACE OF RAFAEL is carried aloft on a

text: PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS the boys and the painting.
text: NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS SHOVE INTO THE PARADE Up and down
text: the street they spring into action, running for position
text: with their guns.
text: An ice cream vendor is knocked down, a mother clutches her
text: "angel" daughter, another child is whisked inside a door as
text: the Soldiers break into the procession.
text: THE "MUCHACHOS" WITH RAFAEL TURN TO RUN but realize that the
text: soldiers have cut off their escape.
text: THREE SOLDIERS BREAK into the parade and are separated from
text: the boys only by a group of Priests. Trapped, the boys panic,
text: but as the SOLDIERS push towards them:
text: THE PRIESTS BLOCK THE SOLDIERS and intentionally scuffle
text: with them, allowing the boys just enough time to dart into a
text: house. One of the boys drops the picture of Rafael as he
text: heads in the door.
text: THE CROWD PUSHES FORWARD, the route to the door is blocked

text: IN THE BACKGROUND CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL-BAR AREA She
text: carries her handbag and some papers -- she stops short seeing
text: Price sitting with Alex. She hesitates, starts toward them,
text: stops, and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the
dialog: pool.
text: Price sees her, and she sees Price. They pretend they don't.
text: Price turns to Isela and launches into a stream of broken,
text: chauvinistic Spanish with his usual elegance.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Looks like you guys have a lot of
dialog: bang-bang down here, eh? Little
dialog: misunderstanding between the poets
dialog: and the government?
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: "Misunderstanding?!" "Down here"
dialog: it's called a war. It started in
dialog: nineteen thirty. Before you were
dialog: born.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: My Spanish is a little out of shape --
dialog: what'd he say?
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: He said he considers it an honor to
dialog: be able to photograph our war.
text: Price looks at each of them and decides not to push.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Russell's got a way with words.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: I can tell.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You're a helluva translator.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: I know. I'm much in demand around
dialog: here. Will you excuse me? If you
dialog: have any questions, just ask.
text: Alex stands to help Isela from her chair. Price presses on,
text: instinctively and effortlessly.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Who is Rafael?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It depends who you ask.
text: Alex turns to Isela, who stops as she rises.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: Rafael? Comandante Rafael. He is
dialog: either a Marxist dupe of Russia and
dialog: Cuba...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...or the most popular leader of a
dialog: most popular democratic revolution.
dialog: (to Price cynically)
dialog: Take your pick.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't really give a damn... but
dialog: the guy's got a great face.
text: A beat, then Price asks his question almost sexually, as if
dialog: he thinks he could seduce Isela, Rafael, the whole war.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: How would he like to be photographed?
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: You'd never find him.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Wanta lay odds?
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: You would lose.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You must excuse me.
text: She starts to leave again, and again he stops her.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Just one more thing -- is Rafael
dialog: owned by the C.I.A. or the K.G.B.?
dialog: I'll figure out the rest.
text: Isela seems to welcome the question. Her tone is less flip,
text: and she focuses hard on Price.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: Mr. Price... the world is not divided
dialog: into East and West anymore. It is
dialog: divided into North and South. By the
dialog: time you people figure that out --
dialog: it will be too late.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Congratulations on your cover.
text: She touches his Time magazine, kisses Alex on the cheek, and
text: floats magically through the pool area.
text: Price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot.
text: P.O.V. OF ISELA THROUGH PRICE'S FINGERS Isela kisses another
text: journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at
dialog: another table.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: So far this war's got it all over
dialog: Africa.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're gonna have a ball.
text: ALEX PLACES HIS HAND OVER PRICE'S "FRAME" blocking out his
text: view of the sexy Isela. Though Alex's tone is gentle, the
text: threat is obvious.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hands off. I need an interpreter
dialog: more than you do right now.
text: Price takes the hint.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You still hanging in there with
dialog: Claire?
text: Alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm hanging in there like an interim
dialog: post-war government waiting for the
dialog: palace to be overrun... by younger
dialog: men.
text: Silence and an uneasiness that Alex intended. Price manages
text: a smile.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Younger men.
text: Alex smiles disarmingly.
text: CLAIRE RISES AT THE OPPOSITE BAR, picks up her papers, and
text: heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step.
text: BOTH MEN ARE A BIT SURPRISED AT HER ENTRANCE and she hands a
text: stack of mail to Alex.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hi, Alex... Russell! When did you
dialog: get in?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Just now.
text: She shakes Price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out
text: awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain
dialog: both men.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're not going to believe this --
dialog: I just beat you guys and everybody
dialog: else here to a story...
dialog: (she teases them)
dialog: ...exclusive... eat your heart out.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What'd ya get?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I've just been promised a private
dialog: interview with Tacho.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Congratulations. The bastard won't
dialog: talk to me.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Who's Tacho?
text: They turn to Price as if everyone knows who Tacho is.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's President Somoza's nickname.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't know who the players are
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Want me to order you a hot dog and a
dialog: program?
text: A bit of tension and awkwardness -- Claire quickly takes
text: control and changes the tone.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Fellas! No fighting after six at
dialog: night, all right? Curfew.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: C'mon, we've all got something to
dialog: celebrate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE VIKING CLUB OF MANAGUA - NIGHT
text: Corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange
text: combination of decorative and architectural devices. DAISY
text: WILLIAMS, a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings "I Left
text: My Heart in San Francisco" with a mediocre jazz group.
text: HUB KITTLE is present, and other journalists drop by the
dialog: table to say hello.
text: A BOY PHOTOGRAPHER, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid
text: at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price. They
text: are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with
text: the camera. They hold up the TIME COVER and a couple of beers
text: in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no
dialog: flash.
text: The boy puts the camera down disappointedly.
scene_heading: BOY PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: (in broken English)
dialog: Sometimes it doesn't work.
text: The three journalists relax their pose.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Let me look.
text: ON THE BANDSTAND Daisy has just finished "San Francisco" and
text: spots Alex, motioning to him.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex
dialog: ov' here...
text: Daisy applauds lightly for Alex to join them. Alex is equally
text: pleased and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: There's not many piano bars left
dialog: where I'm still welcome.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: If she can't sing in the key of C
dialog: I'm in trouble.
text: Alex excuses himself and joins Daisy on the bandstand. Price
text: and Claire are left alone in the booth as Price hands the
text: repaired camera back to the boy.
text: ALEX AT THE PIANO begins a slow, easy cocktail version of
dialog: "Stardust," the song of his generation perhaps, and he seems
text: happy, seduced by his own chords.
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE RESUME THEIR POSE, and this time the camera
text: FLASHES. Price pays for the picture from the boy.
text: At first there is a moment of awkwardness between them.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: "Well"... you finished your assignment
dialog: in Chad?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched
dialog: to my editor.
text: She smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical Price remark.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're going to love this war,
dialog: Russell... there's good guys, bad
dialog: guys, cheap shrimp...
dialog: (an afterthought)
text: And Alex is still singing in the
dialog: background.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I missed you.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: We gotta get alone somewhere to talk.
text: ALEX BEGINS SINGING as he plays. He sings like a trumpet
text: player -- no voice but great phrasing. He half smiles as he
text: sings, enjoying the song and enjoying making them
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ALEX AT THE PIANO
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Sometimes I wonder why I spend these
dialog: lonely nights, Dreaming of a song...
text: BACK AT THE BOOTH
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jesus... he's doing it on purpose.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Alex is one of the world's leading
dialog: experts on military strategy.
text: They don't really want to talk about Alex though his presence
text: is unavoidable. Price changes gears, gets slightly goofy,
text: and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Well, hell, I just got off the boat...
dialog: gimme the scoop on Nicaragua...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well... about sixty years ago the
dialog: U.S. Marines invaded to protect
dialog: American business interests and put
text: down a peasant revolt led by a little
dialog: man who wore a giant cowboy hat --
dialog: his name was Augusto Sandino... In
dialog: nineteen thirty-four he was murdered
text: at a peace conference, and the Somoza
dialog: family has ruled ever since...
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: No, no, no... I don't mean the stuff
dialog: about the peasants -- I mean the
dialog: real stuff.
dialog: She knows what he means, but she wants to tease him a bit
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: The "real" stuff?... you mean a
dialog: history of class struggle in agrarian
dialog: societies?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: No, c'mon!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh. Okay... well...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just a couple things.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: One -- there's only two kinds of
dialog: beer available -- Tona and Victoria.
dialog: Victoria's better.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And two -- if you see Miss Panama
text: hanging around the hotel bar -- hot,
dialog: hot, hot -- but don't touch. She
dialog: belongs to Tacho, and if anybody
text: gets caught with her then El
dialog: Presidente has promised to personally
dialog: cut off the guy's...
dialog: (unsure which word to
dialog: use)
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Pecker?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yeah... and throw it into Lake
dialog: Managua.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And the lake's already polluted.
text: Price is impressed, and yet another new face drops by the
text: booth -- they both recognize and see him coming, a
text: contemporary of Price, REGIS FLYNN, a scraggly British
text: journalist who heads over to their table holding three beers.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (mutters to Claire)
dialog: Is there anybody here we don't know?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
text: Regis slides into their booth, happy to see them.
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: G'damn, Price... kudos on the African
dialog: snaps.
dialog: (shakes hands, a
text: perfunctory kiss on
dialog: her cheek)
dialog: Jeez, Claire, I haven't seen you
dialog: since...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Three Mile Island.
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: Yeah... shit...
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: Holiday Inn, right?
text: He nods; they all sip beers and watch Alex sing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE NIGHT CLUB KITCHEN
text: A teenage DISHWASHER looks around nervously, then pulls a
text: paper sack from off the shelf, removing a strange mask from
text: it. He pulls the mask over his head. Then from the bag he
text: removes a hand-made zip gun, puts a bullet in it, and darts
text: into the shadows of a nook, waiting.
text: BACK TO THE BOOTH where Regis softly croons a few bars of
text: "Stardust" into Claire's mike. The three of them are having
text: a good time, mildly drunk at best, and uninhibited.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CLUB
text: As we hear Alex's gentle rendition of the standard, a NECKING
text: COUPLE moves back into the shadows of the club. Each pulls
dialog: on a mask, as in the b.g.:
text: ISELA AND AN ELEGANT MAN ARRIVE AT THE CLUB
text: The man, somehow out of place, dresses with casual continental
text: style, not overdone but expensive and tasteful -- clearly
text: from another world. He wears a neat hat and moves gracefully.
text: Isela looks stunning, dressed for the evening. The DOORMAN
text: greets them familiarly.
text: Isela casually checks her watch as they enter the club.
text: The masked couple in the shadows check their watches.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE VIKING CLUB
text: As Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without
text: trying. Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex
text: gently before sitting in the booth with the man.
text: IN PRICE'S BOOTH the new arrivals have caught their attention --
text: Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and
dialog: I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers.
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: Before you fall in love -- that's
dialog: Marcel Jazy... friend of wine, women,
dialog: and Somoza. They say he's a
dialog: businessman...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: He's a businessman in search of a
dialog: business... he doesn't try very hard
dialog: to cover up his connections to the
dialog: C.I.A...
scene_heading: P.O.V. OF JAZY LIGHTING ISELA'S CIGARETTE
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But look at his moves -- can the
dialog: C.I.A. light cigarettes like that?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What's wrong with the Everly Brothers?
text: THE WAITER ARRIVES AT PRICE'S BOOTH and sets down three shrimp
dialog: cocktails and more champagne, as:
scene_heading: INT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE CLUB
text: It opens quickly, and three more MEN IN MASKS enter quickly.
text: BACK TO THE BOOTH as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Please stay at your table, and you
dialog: won't be hurt.
text: A FACE IN A MASK MOVES QUICKLY PAST PRICE'S TABLE
text: ANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher
text: waves a gun.
scene_heading: TWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT
text: DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the
dialog: entrance.
text: THREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air,
text: moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down
dialog: slowly. (Six Guerrillas total)
text: A GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few
text: deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears.
text: The name "RAFAEL" is written under the face, then other names
text: and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place:
text: A WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN
text: BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with
text: his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub
text: freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly
dialog: and smoothly.
text: ONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table
text: and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas
text: around the room are serious but nervous.
speaker_heading: GUERRILLA LEADER
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: We do not want to waste any ammunition
dialog: on a head as empty as yours -- but
dialog: we will.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: What is this?!
speaker_heading: GUERRILLA LEADER
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Shut up! Get up!
text: The BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand
text: grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation,
text: then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches
text: away from the Businessman's face.
text: The Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the
text: back door of the club.
speaker_heading: GUERRILLA LEADER
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: You are coming with us -- you will
dialog: not be hurt -- we will trade you for
dialog: the release of some Nicaraguans who
dialog: care about Nicaragua.
text: The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing
text: him to move toward the kitchen door.
text: PRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits
text: into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly --
dialog: Price is coolest in any crisis.
text: CLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and
text: a tiny red light comes on.
text: THE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid
text: to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his
text: face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper.
text: MASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY
scene_heading: THE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE
text: BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging
text: clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes:
text: THE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES
text: Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see
text: what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF
text: THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and:
text: THE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything
dialog: freezes, and:
text: THE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer,
text: runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a
text: crowded section of the club.
text: A Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it
text: up, and as he does:
text: THE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal
text: explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical
dialog: instruments explode, and:
text: THE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various
text: doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who
text: picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The
text: Businessman is soiled but unhurt.
text: ONE HALF OF THE CLUB BREAKS OUT IN FLAME As a broken gas
text: pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire, the club's patrons
text: panic -- screaming and shoving towards the door as the ROOM
dialog: LIGHTS UP, and:
text: PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS OUT AT ONCE followed quickly by a
text: 35mm camera, quickly clicking off picture after picture of
text: the club amid the flames and panic. The new light makes his
dialog: job easier.
text: PRICE TAKES A LIGHT READING near the body of the boy
text: photographer. He sees the boy's camera lying nearby. Price
text: puts away his light meter and feels the boy's pulse, then
text: puts his ear to the boy's heart -- making sure he is not
text: still alive.
scene_heading: LA GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND FIREMEN FILL THE ROOM
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE PRESS ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER
text: The chaos of a busy, cramped Telex room. A switchboard --

text: CLAIRE TEARS A STORY OFF THE TELEX while Price stands to the
text: side of the action eating a sandwich and watching.
text: ALEX STANDS AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL Established as the senior
text: figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists
dialog: come for information.
text: A YOUNG JOURNALIST, a Time stringer, is slightly distraught
text: on the phone, and interrupts Alex's dealing with others,
text: cupping the phone, to announce:
speaker_heading: TIME STRINGER
dialog: ...it's Charlie, from New York --
dialog: says that a terrorist bombing of a
dialog: Central American restaurant isn't
dialog: big enough to hold for the world
dialog: section...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Tell him we have pictures.
scene_heading: YOUNG JOURNALIST
dialog: He knows.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Tell him there were pieces of body
dialog: in the piano, and somebody was
dialog: singing, "I Left My Heart in San
dialog: Francisco."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's he got better than that?
speaker_heading: TIME STRINGER
dialog: He's got the Pope visiting Egypt.
text: Alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Forget the Pope, Charlie. Every week
dialog: you got the Pope somewhere. This is
dialog: a very big story down here because
text: it's the first sign of fighting in
dialog: Managua.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah, well get a map and look up
dialog: Nicaragua -- ya drive to New Orleans
dialog: and turn left.
text: While Charlie argues on the other end of the phone, Alex
text: initials papers and performs several jobs at once.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Like hell I'm editorializing, the
dialog: whole thing happened in a roomful of
dialog: C.I.A. and press. What do you want?!
dialog: (beats)
dialog: How do I know they were C.I.A.? They
dialog: wore name tags, what do you think?
dialog: We're backing a Fascist again -- I
dialog: know that ain't news, but see if you
dialog: can find an angle!
text: HUB KITTLE has been floating through the room and, upon
text: hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches
dialog: Alex.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Hey! There's fascists and then there's
dialog: fascists, right? Be careful how you
dialog: throw words like that around.
text: Alex ignores Hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and
text: continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We don't have any pictures of Rafael
dialog: because nobody knows where the son
dialog: of a bitch is, and anybody crazy
dialog: enough to go after him...
text: Alex spots Price who is standing nearby, still eating a
text: sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room.
text: Alex directs his next line so that Price cannot fail to get
text: the message. Alex plays the moment coolly.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: ...is liable to get his nuts shot
dialog: off.
text: Hub nods seriously, in agreement. Price turns. Alex smiles.
text: Price smiles. Alex hangs up, grumbling, then turns his

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah, well g'bye...
dialog: (to Hub)
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (extending a hand)
dialog: Hub Kittle. I'm with Lewitsky and
dialog: Knupp -- New York. We have a client
dialog: down here.
text: Alex is irritated but fascinated.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: President Somoza.
text: Alex is incredulous that Somoza employs a New York P.R. firm.
dialog: Hub is professionally used to this reaction -- no panic.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I know, I know...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But there's an untold story here. I
dialog: mean, the man has a point of view
dialog: too, right?
text: Alex turns to leave; Hub corners him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We got a national anthem contest
dialog: going on right now, and you guys are
dialog: ignoring it. Lotta human interest.
text: Alex turns to other business though Hub persists.
text: ELSEWHERE IN THE ROOM a young NICARAGUAN WOMAN, 18, is talking
text: to Claire. She seems to be part of the local press.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I want you to get me copies of the

speaker_heading: OPERATOR

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hi, baby! How are you?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Has Grandmother spoiled you silly by

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Veinte.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN

dialog: heard them enter over the sounds of music and our
text: preoccupation with the pictures.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What is this? I'm a journalist!
text: No answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials
text: from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Journalista, journalista!
text: The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it
text: briefly and takes the passport. He nods.
text: A rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he
text: doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MILITARY HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

dialog: I don't take sides. I take pictures.
speaker_heading: PRISONER PRIEST
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: No sides?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: No.
text: The Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain.
speaker_heading: PRISONER PRIEST
dialog: Periodista Puta, todos periodistas
dialog: son putas.
dialog: (All journalists are
dialog: whores)
text: The Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is
text: surprised to be treated so despicably.
speaker_heading: PRISONER PRIEST
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Go home.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM
text: Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans.
text: The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers
text: his eyes.
text: FIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and
text: down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the
text: line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price
text: speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh?
dialog: Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time
dialog: magazine.
text: The soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion
text: to Price's tone, shouting:
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Shut up!
text: Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not
text: stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue
text: from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting
text: out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak.
text: The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is
dialog: frightened.
text: Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian
text: in a hat. The civilian points to a door.
text: THE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately
text: as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too
text: is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives
dialog: at price.
text: THE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE
text: PRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a
text: discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion
text: affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where
text: he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different
text: door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display
text: rack into a room.
text: THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues
text: with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around
text: quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly
text: shown into a bare office.
scene_heading: INT. THE BARE ROOM
text: Pictures on the wall of Somoza and the FLAG RAISING AT IWO
text: JIMA. Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk.
scene_heading: P.O.V. THE CIVILIAN THROUGH A DOOR -- IT IS MARCEL JAZY His
text: rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings.
text: The door closes.
text: A SENIOR OFFICER ENTERS THE BARE ROOM, and Price addresses
text: him at once.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Soy un periodista.
scene_heading: SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
dialog: (in excellent English)
dialog: Mr. Price... you must accept our
dialog: deepest apologies for the
dialog: misunderstanding. Somebody saw you
dialog: taking photographs of terrorists
text: hooligans in the parade and at the
dialog: nightclub -- our young officers get
dialog: carried away... they're always looking
dialog: for traitors.
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: That film is half way to New York by
dialog: now.
scene_heading: SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
dialog: I know, I know... It was all a
dialog: misunderstanding... una mala
dialog: interpretacion. Your cameras.
text: The Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it
text: to him, but as he does:
text: THE CAMERA DROPS TO THE GROUND AND BREAKS -- SILENCE The
dialog: Officer would love for Price to get angry.
scene_heading: SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Price smiles barely, and refuses to pop off.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Forget it.
text: Price puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from
text: the room he notices a copy of the TIME MAGAZINE WITH ELEPHANT
text: sitting on the desk.
scene_heading: SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
dialog: This way.
text: Price is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led
text: outside into the night.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MILITARY PRISON - DAWN
text: Claire stands at the main doorway surrounded by GUARDS, an
text: OFFICER, and an unidentified CIVILIAN -- she is arguing with
text: them in rapid Spanish, not allowing them to get in a word.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: You throw a journalist in jail -- it
dialog: gets in the papers. You walk all
dialog: over the same press credentials you
dialog: pass out. I demand to speak to someone
dialog: in authority or I'll go to Tacho
dialog: myself... I don't understand you --
dialog: you're big and strong and handsome
dialog: but you're not so smart!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You should be trying to seduce us!
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Senora...
text: PRICE IS SHOWN OUT A DOOR IN THE BACKGROUND and sees her.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Claire!
text: They hurry toward each other and embrace briefly. The Guards
text: watch it all curiously.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're okay?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I'm fine -- what're you doing here?
dialog: These guys are goons.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: They love being beaten up by a woman
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been looking for you all night --
dialog: why'd they lock you up?
text: They walk away together.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't know. Taking pictures. The
dialog: usual. Jazy got me released.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jazy?! You think there's a story
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Ahh... C.I.A. stories are all alike.
dialog: I wanta find Rafael.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You need help?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: No. You?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When should we start.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I figure you probably want to do a
dialog: little research on the history of
dialog: Marcel Jazy's business connections
dialog: in the third world countries with
dialog: C.I.A. influence...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh. I assumed you'd just look him in
dialog: the eye and say "Gimme a break, for
dialog: crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or
dialog: aren't you?"
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN COURTYARD OF MARCEL JAZY - DAY LATER
text: Marcel Jazy stands, drink in hand, looking slightly rumpled
text: in the daylight, slightly older, but more charming and self-
text: effacing than his first impression indicated. His two story
text: Mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair; the gardens
text: are scraggly and overgrown. The pool is empty. Jazy addresses
dialog: Price and Claire.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: ...are you a spy or aren't you, eh?
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price...
dialog: nobody is a... 'spy'... anymore.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Russell prefers pictures to words...
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: You don't have to apologize... you're
dialog: journalists.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And you're a businessman?
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: A businessman? That sounds good.
dialog: Okay, I'm a businessman.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Why was I arrested, and why did you
dialog: get me released, and who are you?
text: As he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a
text: SPECTACULAR LOOKING WOMAN emerges from the shadows of the
text: house into the light of the courtyard. She is tall, Latin,
text: and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion
text: swimsuit, cut high on the legs.
text: Price, Claire, and Jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to
text: look into the empty pool.
speaker_heading: WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT
dialog: No agua.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: No agua.
speaker_heading: WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Oh, Marcel! You told me there would
dialog: be water in the pool this week!
text: Jazy leans in very coolly to Price and Claire as he pours an
text: extra glass of wine and speaks softly in English again.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: If she dove in, I assure you she
dialog: wouldn't notice.
text: He carries the glass of wine to the woman, smiling warmly.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: (to Miss Panama in
dialog: Spanish)
dialog: Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked
text: out the pumping station on the road
dialog: to Masaya, and we must ration water
dialog: for the time being. Next week maybe
dialog: things will be better.
speaker_heading: WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Maybe I should go back to Panama.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Maybe you should.
text: Jazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass
text: of wine. The woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in
text: the sun. Very sexy. She reaches for and kisses Jazy's hand
text: affectionately -- he kisses her forehead. She feels better
dialog: now.
text: Jazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside.
scene_heading: INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is
text: rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of
text: its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall,
text: nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: You were arrested because the Guardia
dialog: are clowns who specialize in excess.
dialog: You were released because I told
dialog: them to release you.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: These are not the normal duties of a
dialog: businessman.
text: He looks at them directly.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: But they are the normal duties of
dialog: a... spy, eh? You win, I'm a spy.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: There, are you happy? I feel better.
text: He refills their glasses.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Now we can relax. You can turn off
dialog: your little thing.
text: The red light of her recorder is on. She smiles slightly,
text: undisturbed, and turns it off.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Oh, I trust you won't say anything
dialog: to hurt me. In some ways I'm a
dialog: terrible spy. I used to be much better
dialog: at it, but now it seems everyone
dialog: knows who I am. I have too many
dialog: girlfriends. I like to be
dialog: photographed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I talk too much.
text: Price and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to
dialog: interrupt this strange performance.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: I always talk too much... but my
dialog: girlfriends like that... No matter.
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: swimsuited woman)
dialog: You know who she is?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE AND PRICE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: That's Miss Panama. Do you know who
dialog: that is?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE AND PRICE
dialog: Oh, yeah, yes, etc.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: She's in love with me. I've got to
dialog: get some water in the pool.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And once a week I have lunch with
dialog: President Somoza to discuss security
dialog: measures against the Sandinista
dialog: insurgents, but all he wants to talk
dialog: about is Miss Panama... he's worried
dialog: about her.
text: Claire interrupts with a smile.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Because he thinks she's seeing another
dialog: man?
text: Jazy smiles slightly before confirming.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: ...and he assigned me to find out
dialog: who the man is.
text: They all smile at this complication. Price is impressed.
text: Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: We all know the Revolutionaries are
dialog: going to win, don't we?
text: Silence. They don't know how to respond.
text: THEIR P.O.V. AS MISS PANAMA STRETCHES LIKE AN ENORMOUS CAT
text: They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief.
text: Unsure what to say next, Price notices a picture on the wall:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - A BLOWN-UP FRAMED PHOTO OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITH
speaker_heading: POOL
dialog: The same picture we saw on the leaflets in Africa.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: There's a rumor about this picture.
dialog: Some people say you're a genius --
dialog: that you invented this scheme.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: It was lots of people's idea... Have
dialog: you been to Leon?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We're going to Masaya... they say
text: the Rebels have hit the cuartel.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It's supposed to be nasty there... a
dialog: lotta people think Rafael's in the
dialog: South. I want to find out.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: No, no, it's not "nasty" yet. Another
dialog: week maybe.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You would love Leon. A nice cathedral
dialog: and beautiful light... et un peu de
dialog: bang-bang.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We're not doing a travelogue, you
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Of course, of course... only I have
dialog: heard that Comandante Rafael has
dialog: recently had his unit in the area.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Rafael is near Leon?
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Well... it's a rumor, what do I know?
text: The voice of Miss Panama.
speaker_heading: MISS PANAMA
dialog: Estoy desemperado!
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: She's lonely!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don't let us stand in the way.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: It's my job.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You think I talk too much?
text: He doesn't wait for an answer, but excuses himself and goes
text: out to tend to Miss Panama.
text: P.O.V. OF JAZY AND MISS PANAMA BY THE EMPTY POOL as Jazy
text: touches her, whispers, and she waves to Claire and Price.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
text: Early morning. Price lathers up with shaving cream for the
text: first time, cleaning up. As he applies the lather he stops,
text: and slowly draws a face on the mirror with shaving cream
text: until he is staring at:
text: THE IMAGE OF RAFAEL IN SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NICARAGUAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
text: A RENTED CAR WITH WHITE FLAGS turns onto the road to Leon.
text: Price drives, eats, and reads a map. Claire takes the map
text: from him and reads it herself. They seem to enjoy their first
text: moment alone without Alex looking over their shoulder. A
text: small band-aid is on Price's clean shaven cheek.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did you dream about Miss Panama last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I dreamed about you.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Have a good time?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yeah... so'd you.
text: She reaches out and touches his band-aid.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And old war injury flaring up?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Is the tape on?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I was on the deck of the U.S.S. Pueblo
dialog: catching some rays when the North
dialog: Koreans attacked... took a bullet
dialog: right in the chest, but by luck I
dialog: had an extra roll of high speed
dialog: ektachrome in this pocket right
dialog: here... over the heart...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: And the bullet ricocheted off the
dialog: film, grazed your cheek, and saved
dialog: your life.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You heard about it?! I was lucky.
text: PASSING SHOT OF A CLUSTER OF ROADSIDE CROSSES marking a series
text: of graves. Immediately the tone in Claire's voice changes,
text: sobered by the reminder of war.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did anyone ever die next to you in
dialog: combat?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: F.8 at a sixtieth.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's an old joke. My question was
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: So was I.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You ever dream about me?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Once.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: How was I?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Fast.
text: Again their glibness is interrupted by what they came to
text: see. Even as they joke, they watch the landscape with concern.
text: REFUGEES ARE STREAMING OUT OF LEON, mostly women and children,
text: some old men, carrying their possessions. Soldiers stand
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm basically a coward, Russell, I
dialog: hope you understand that. I hope we
dialog: don't get shot.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A GUARDIA ROADBLOCK ON A HILL OVERLOOKING THE CITY
text: The press car pulls up to a stop. Price and Claire get out
text: quickly, hand their credentials to a soldier, and open the
text: trunk and the hood. As the car is searched they look down at
dialog: the city.
text: P.O.V. LEON AS A PLANE CIRCLES FIRING ROCKETS AND SMOKE RISES
text: from several places in the town. The sound of gunfire.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to soldier in Spanish)
dialog: I thought it was quiet here.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Quiet? Are you sure you want to go
dialog: down there? Not me.
text: The soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the
dialog: credentials.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: You must leave the car here.
text: Price speaks in English knowing he can't be understood.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (to soldier)
dialog: You thinking of scoring a Toyota?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: No problem -- we leave the car.
text: Price and Claire remove their things from the car, and Price
text: takes the distributor cap as well as the keys. They walk
text: over and look down the road leading into the city under seige.
text: MORE REFUGEES EVACUATE THE TOWN -- it is a most uninviting
text: sight. The plane passes over the town in the distance firing
dialog: rockets.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Now what?
text: Price responds by flashing his light meter in the air, taking
text: a quick, nervous reading.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: C'mon. Be careful.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Be careful?! Where the fuck we going?
dialog: Better light?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET INTO LEON - DAY
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE WALK SLOWLY INTO LEON
text: Looking around warily as they go, they are the only people
text: entering the town. Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder
text: as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...June tenth... the evacuation of
dialog: Leon... a woman carries a pig...
text: signs for the F.S.L.N. are
dialog: everywhere... a body...
text: THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN lies ignored on the sidewalk. They
dialog: continue walking and soon come to:
text: AN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA
text: Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by
text: the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around
text: the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for.
text: A YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away,
text: holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running
text: toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The
text: Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns
text: the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops:
text: THE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him
dialog: instantly.
text: CLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch.
text: PRICE RECORDS THE EVENT WITH HIS CAMERA
text: THE GUARDIA FOLLOW THE TANQUETTA SLOWLY down the street toward
text: the Rebel youth's house. Suddenly the intersection is empty.
scene_heading: PRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as:
text: SEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with
text: sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The
text: Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price.
text: THE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price
text: to record them. They pose instantly in "tough-guy" posture.
text: PRICE TAKES THEIR PICTURE and just as quickly they dart away
text: through a bombed out building.
text: THREE SANDINISTAS LEAP OFF A ROOFTOP and race toward Claire
dialog: and Price who freeze:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Russell?!
text: For a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in
text: trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists,
text: pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment
text: Price and Claire are alone on the street.
text: THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN SLOWLY and a middle-aged WOMAN appears,
text: motioning for them to come inside.
scene_heading: INT. PEDRO'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled
text: disco, are pleading with a young man, PEDRO, 15.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: You must come and help us... one
dialog: more time.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: No, please...
text: One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled baseball
text: jersey from another room.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #2
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: For Leon... for Nicaragua!
text: Pedro sees Price and Claire and is more interested in them.
text: He speaks in broken but understandable English.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Americans? Journalists?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE AND PRICE
dialog: Yes.
text: Pedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a
text: baseball he is signing.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Ah! I put my autograph on this ball.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Pedro! There is no time to waste.
text: Pedro is more interested in the two Americans.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: When you get back to the United
dialog: States, I want you to give this ball
dialog: to Tippy Martinez for me. He is from
dialog: Nicaragua.
text: Pedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas plead
text: with Pedro for his help. He is more interested in getting
text: the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez. Claire accepts the
text: ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with Price, and
text: puts it in her shoulder bag.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Enrique is dead! Roberto has
dialog: disappeared! The Guardia has the
dialog: church, and we need you!
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: (to Claire and Price)
dialog: You come, eh?
dialog: (to the Sandinistas)
dialog: Can they come with us?
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #2
dialog: Come! Everybody come!
text: They go to the door and open it a crack to look out.
text: P.O.V. THE TANQUETTA PASSES as Soldiers kick open doors across
dialog: the street.
text: The Sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book
text: shelf out of the way. A large hole has been broken in the
text: wall. They climb through the hole into the living room of
text: the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the
text: hole with great effort.
scene_heading: INT. THE NEXT HOUSE - DAY
text: A family huddles in the corner as the MAN OF THE HOUSE pulls
text: back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole
text: knocked in the wall. The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price
text: scramble through.
text: P.O.V. THROUGH A SERIES OF DOOR-SIZED HOLES IN THE WALLS of
text: all the houses on the block, connecting the homes with a
text: secret passageway. The six of them race through the houses,
text: each hole opening and then closing magically.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN OF A TINY SIDEWALK RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge. A
text: WOMAN, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. The SIX crawl so
text: as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to
dialog: survey the plaza.
scene_heading: P.O.V. THE CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEON DOMINATED BY A HUGE CATHEDRAL
text: Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. Otherwise,
text: it is empty.
scene_heading: P.O.V. SIX GUARDIA SNIPERS IN THE CHURCH TOWER control the
text: plaza. As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in
text: different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza.
text: THE WOMAN PULLS A TRAY OF "CONTACT BOMBS" from the oven,
text: home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. Pedro
text: grabs one and pretends to bite into it. The Sandinistas start
text: to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns. Claire and
text: Price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond;
text: mostly they are on edge. The contact bombs are put in a sack.
text: The woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of
text: them climb down a ladder into a tunnel.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - DAY
text: Pedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under
text: the street. Overhead we hear gunfire. Rats scurry, and water
text: runs through an open sewer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE CATHEDRAL - DAY
text: A tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears. He
text: climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. A PRIEST
text: leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. European
text: interior of ornate altars and burning candles. The small
text: party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long,
text: rickety ladder leads up to the roof.
text: THE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways. Pedro
text: follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up
text: as the Priest holds the ladder. The American is much larger
text: than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and
text: when he is nearly at the top:
text: THE LADDER CRACKS as Price reaches the top and is helped to
text: safety. The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and
text: clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: No, please... it's not safe. You
dialog: must come with me.
text: Claire looks at Price -- she wants to go on the roof but the
text: sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma. Claire hurries
text: off to safety with the Priest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LEON - LATE IN DAY
text: THREE SANDINISTAS, PEDRO, AND PRICE EMERGE FROM A TUNNEL
text: onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body
text: lies. They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons
text: fire opens up on them -- the Sandinistas flatten against a
text: wall, quickly becoming separated from Price and Pedro.
text: TWO SANDINISTAS RACE FOR COVER BEHIND A CUPOLA in a move
text: that is equally daring and foolish. The diversion draws fire
text: from the two soldiers.
text: PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS INSTANTLY OUT TAKING READINGS as Pedro
text: huddles with him, curious at this strange act.
text: TWO GUARDIA MOVE INTO POSITION TO FLUSH OUT THE SANDINISTAS
text: as they hide behind the cupolas. The hidden Third Guerrilla
text: opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier
text: races for the belltower. As he does:
text: THE SANDINISTAS SEIZE THE MOMENT TO RUSH CLOSER, waving to
text: Pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs.
text: PRICE STARTS TO FOLLOW BUT IS PINNED DOWN BY FIRE and chooses
text: to take refuge halfway in an alcove. As fire from both sides
text: ricochets all over the rooftop, Price switches camera lenses
text: seemingly oblivious to the action.
text: PEDRO MEETS ONE OF THE SANDINISTAS in a protected niche and
text: quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the "muffin bombs"
text: out on the rooftop.
text: THE OTHER TWO SANDINISTAS OPEN HEAVY FIRE and briefly draw
text: heavier fire from the belltower, as:
text: PEDRO PICKS UP A MUFFIN weighing it briefly in his hand,
text: like a pitcher. He studies the surroundings -- runners on
text: first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching
text: hand) and rubs it in casually.
text: Pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching
text: motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower
text: window, exposing himself as he does.
text: AN EXPLOSION IN THE TOWER
text: PEDRO THROWS ANOTHER INTO THE TOWER -- another explosion.
text: A GUARDIA SOLDIER STAGGERS INTO THE WINDOW and a Sandinista
text: drops him with a shot.
text: All is quiet.
text: THE THREE SANDINISTAS CAREFULLY RUSH THE TOWER, looking in
text: and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they
dialog: do:
text: ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT -- they whirl around -- Pedro and
text: Price drop again. A lone Guardia soldier fires at them from
text: the other tower.
text: A THIRD SANDINISTA DROPS HIM WITH A VOLLEY OF FIRE Again all
text: is quiet.
text: PRICE FOLLOWS THE SANDINISTAS TO THE FIRST BELLTOWER and
text: looks in.
text: FIVE BODIES LIE SCATTERED AND BLOODIED One of the Guerrillas
text: kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. In the
text: corner, one body lies on top of another. Satisfied, the
text: Sandinistas head for the other tower.
text: PRICE STAYS BEHIND TO TAKE A FEW PICTURES and the ever-present
text: light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the
text: bodies. Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows.
text: He looks out over the city.
text: P.O.V. OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting
text: is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from
text: scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble.
text: The town is littered with bodies.
text: P.O.V. THE RED CROSS WAGON MOVING THROUGH THE STREET
text: A man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically:
speaker_heading: RED CROSS MAN
dialog: Hay heridas o muertes aqui? Hay
dialog: heridas o muertes aqui?
dialog: (Are there wounded or
dialog: dead here?)
text: We see a woman drag a body out into the street. The Red Cross
text: man makes small stacks of bodies. He douses the bodies with
text: gasoline and sets the pile aflame. Then continues.
speaker_heading: RED CROSS MAN
dialog: Hay heridas o muertes aqui?
text: Price watches. He thinks he hears something, then dismisses
text: it. Something else. A voice, almost a whisper.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Price. You motherfucker, Price, I'm
dialog: talking to you.
text: He turns. One of the bodies speaks.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Where are those bastards... are they
dialog: away?
text: Price looks out -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of
dialog: the roof. This war gets stranger.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: They're away.
text: A body rolls out from under another body. Blood-splattered,
text: smiling, wiping the blood from his face. It is Oates, the
text: mercenary from Africa. He peeks out the window -- the
text: Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. He whispers.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: What the fuck are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What the fuck are you doing here?
text: For a moment they understand that they are there for the
text: same reason -- they make their livings off war. Oates peeks
text: out the window nervously and repeatedly.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Awright, awright -- you're lookin'
dialog: good... how ya like Nicaragua?
text: OATES readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed --
text: routine. Price doesn't know how to answer.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: Oates laughs quickly and softly -- he is tuned into the
text: strangeness of Price's answer.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Shitload o' greasers though, eh?
scene_heading: P.O.V. THE SANDINISTAS HEADING BACK TOWARD US
text: OATES AND PRICE SEE THEM, and Oates crawls back under the
text: pile of bodies.
text: THE SANDINISTAS LOOK INTO THE BELLTOWER, all looks quiet,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK
text: The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the
text: shadows of the main church entrance. The Sandinistas are
text: carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza.
text: It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out.
text: For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in
text: the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas. They see
text: each other and embrace briefly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're okay?
text: The Sandinistas seem to relax. The Sandinistas take pride in
text: Pedro and pat his left arm for Price and Claire.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: San-dee Koufax, no?
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #2
dialog: Si, Koufax.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #3
dialog: Es mejor que Koufax, eh?!
dialog: They seem to want approval from the Americans.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Much better than Koufax.
text: The Sandinistas slap hands, familiar with the American
text: gesture. The Six start walking across the plaza away from
text: the church. In the b.g. we see piles of bodies burning; the
text: Red Cross tends to the wounded locals. Spirits are high as
text: they walk. The tiny red light glows on Claire's recorder.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Koufax is okay... but Tippy Martinez,
dialog: he is the best... he pitches for the
dialog: Baltimore Orioles, and some day I
dialog: will be the second man from Nicaragua
dialog: to play in the major leagues...
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: (to Price and Claire)
dialog: Tippy Martinez had a good fastball,
text: but Pedro has a curveball and a
dialog: screwball that are better.
text: All five of them agree that Pedro is the best; they slap his
text: valued arm and relax for the first time all day.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: You will give my autographed baseball
dialog: to Tippy and tell him in five years
dialog: I will be pitching with him, okay?
dialog: He better watch out for me, eh?

speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: No, no... you are not combatants.
dialog: (would rather talk

dialog: The Baltimore team is my team...
text: A SHOT RINGS OUT, AND PEDRO'S CHEST EXPLODES in front of us.
text: Sudden panic, rage, confusion -- the Sandinistas whirl and
dialog: scan the building.
text: P.O.V. OATES RACING ACROSS THE CATHEDRAL ROOFTOP into the
dialog: night.
text: PRICE GRABS PEDRO'S GUN AND WHIRLS to face the church; his
text: action is instinctive, angry, and electric with energy.
text: CLAIRE GRABS PEDRO'S ARM AND DRAGS THE BODY to safety, though
text: there is no safety and the body is lifeless. Her actions are
dialog: protective and automatic.
text: THE SANDINISTAS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION and move
text: quickly. Two of them fan out to cover the escape. Price
text: screams in the direction of Oates,
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You bastard!
text: Claire drags the body near a bench under a tree.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What about him?!
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: (dispassionately)
text: He's dead.
text: The Sandinistas survey the cathedral and streets carefully,
text: warily, upset at their nonchalance. They know the sniper is
text: disappearing into the night, but they continue to look.
speaker_heading: SANDINISTA #1
dialog: I will talk to Pedro's mother. You
dialog: must go to the house of the hammocks
dialog: if you want to be safe.
text: The Three Sandinistas fan out toward the church as it gets
dialog: dark.
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND NEXT TO PEDRO, feeling helpless and
text: ineffective. They both look at the body. Price realizes he's
text: holding Pedro's gun and places it down next to the body.
text: Price notices the tiny red light is still glowing on her
text: tape recorder. He points it out to Claire. She turns it off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE OF HAMMOCKS - NIGHT
text: IN A NEARLY DARK ROOM full of hanging hammocks, Claire sits
text: on the floor lit by a low wattage bulb hanging from a cord.
text: In another room through a door Price can be seen with a family
text: in the hammock workshop. Claire talks softly into her
dialog: recorder.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello sweetheart, this is your mother.
dialog: I'm in Leon and I miss you. Don't
dialog: worry about me -- it's not dangerous
dialog: at all. I guess you can't believe
dialog: what you hear on the news. I'll put
dialog: this this tape in the mail when I
dialog: get back to Managua, but knowing
dialog: what the mail service is like, I may
dialog: be home before it arrives. I think
dialog: about you all the time and hope I
dialog: can make it back before you graduate
dialog: from Jr. High.
text: As she speaks Price bids the family farewell and comes into
text: the room with Claire where he lies down in a hammock.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I love you and I'll finish this letter
dialog: when I get back to the hotel.
text: Claire lies down on a mat, exhausted, after turning out the
text: light. Several moments pass before Price speaks.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I know who shot Pedro. I knew somebody
dialog: was in the tower.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why didn't you tell the guerrillas?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't know... then they would've
dialog: killed him I guess. I didn't want to
dialog: interfere.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It wasn't an easy choice.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I think I made the wrong one.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You didn't take any pictures when it
dialog: was over.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I didn't?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I picked up a gun. Jesus.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is something happening to us?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes.
text: Silence. They lie for a long time in the dark. A light in
text: the house is turned off. Finally:
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Are you asleep?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
text: Price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her.
text: They don't speak. They kiss. She unbuttons his shirt. He
text: unbuttons her blouse. They undress just enough to begin making
text: love softly, quietly.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAWN
text: The first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso.
text: PRICE'S LIGHT METER APPEARS AT HER BACK Price takes a reading,
text: then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. He moves
text: it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light,
text: partially covered with a blanket.
text: He scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera.
text: Price begins photographing her.
text: He moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the
text: rest of her body. His actions are quiet and easy. He stops
text: frequently to admire her.
text: Claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. Price moves
text: around the room -- picture, picture, picture.
text: CLAIRE WAKES UP SLOWLY and pulls the blanket back over her.
text: She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several
text: feet away with his camera.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: G'morning.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You look beautiful.
text: She realizes what he's been doing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How long have you been doing this?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: 'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see
dialog: the pictures -- you look great.
text: Her sense of violation is balanced by this notion. For a
dialog: moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or
text: some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. She
dialog: chooses the latter.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'll bet I look great -- give me the
dialog: film.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: After they're printed.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'll develop them myself -- give it
dialog: to me or I'll start taping what you
dialog: say in your sleep.
text: Price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket
dialog: with her.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I talk in my sleep?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible.
text: They curl up together, holding onto each other. A small child
text: crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. A rooster crows.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Call the office. I don't want to go
dialog: to work today.
text: The peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close
dialog: by.
text: A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP PASSES OVER THE COURTYARD They look up,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEON - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM
text: Alex enters. Nobody there. As he turns to leave he sees some

text: CLOSE UP: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It's all over

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Is he a good fuck?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Alex...

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: But it's great P.R. So what's the

speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Simple. And it could happen. Somoza

speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Russell, excuse me... but I've just
dialog: been put in a rather embarrassing
dialog: position.
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Mrs. Somoza would like her picture
dialog: taken with Miss Panama. In color?
text: Price throws his camera bag over his shoulder, pulls out a
text: camera, and follows Jazy. They walk toward the head table.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: How the hell could Tacho find Rafael.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Russell, please... I have my hands
dialog: full...
text: Mrs. Somoza and Miss Panama are waiting as Price and Jazy
text: arrive. Price is automatically switching camera lenses, but
text: he continues to grill Jazy.
speaker_heading: MRS. SOMOZA
dialog: Tacho, Tacho... venga, por favor!
text: Price and Jazy exchange glances as Somoza reluctantly joins
dialog: the portrait.
text: SOMOZA POSES WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS MISTRESS ON EACH ARM as
text: Price flashes a light meter under their noses, then backs
text: off to take the picture.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Is Tacho lying again? They did kill
dialog: him, didn't they?
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Everybody smile.
text: Price takes a picture, Somoza wants to leave and Jazy would
dialog: just as soon have this awkward moment over with, but:
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: One more, please! Una mas, por favor?
text: Reluctantly they pose again, and Price grills Jazy who is
dialog: trapped.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: We help each other, right? Could you
dialog: move your girlfriend into the sun...
text: Jazy moves Miss Panama slightly, returning to Price.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: What do you need?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Is Rafael alive or dead?
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (to the posers)
dialog: Just one more -- thank you.
dialog: (to Jazy)
dialog: I thought you knew everything?
text: As Somoza holds an interminable pose, Jazy launches into a
text: speech, keeping his voice low enough so Tacho cannot hear.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a
dialog: victory very badly... he needs to
dialog: prove to Jimmy Carter that he is
text: still winning. He thinks Rafael's
dialog: death is the proof he needs.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Carter don't need proof. He just
dialog: sent twenty-five million in new arms
dialog: to Tacho.
dialog: (to posers)
dialog: I'm sorry... almost got it here.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: No, no... the arms shipment has been

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: The State Department's gonna pull

speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: ...I work for everybody. If there is

dialog: Either way, I facilitate.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Great job.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: I send messages to Jimmy and I tell

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Rough ain't it. Thank you everybody,

text: OUT The windshield is totally destroyed now, and:
text: THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR CROUCH LOW as the car races. Price

text: THE CAR SCREECHES INTO REVERSE as Regis tries to see out the

dialog: sees:
text: AN OPEN BLOCK AHEAD -- no Guardia are visible, so the car

text: PRICE PUSHES THROUGH A DOOR TO SAFETY and looks back:
text: CLAIRE IS TRAPPED OUTSIDE pounding on a door that doesn't

text: THE SHERMAN TANK TRIES TO DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE BUS but
text: cannot, and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill.
text: PRICE RUNS OUT TO CLAIRE and huddles with her. She is shaken
text: but unhurt.
text: SANDINISTAS ARE EVERYWHERE, moving into Matagalpa as Price
text: and Claire move past several bodies to higher ground.
text: SANDINISTA BARRICADES ARE ON EVERY CORNER where women serve

dialog: Venga, companeros.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What is it?
text: Price looks around, speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: Rafael is dead.

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I can smell it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: (slightly exasperated)
dialog: Venga por favor! Alli!

text: PRICE AND CLAIRE SIT DOWN TO EAT and Price continues scanning
text: the camp as they talk.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: He's dead. I know it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Then why did they bring us all the

dialog: He doesn't know.
scene_heading: P.O.V. FOUR FIGURES/CONFERRING IN FRONT OF A TENT Isela

speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: This is Commandante Cinco.

text: Isela begins at once.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is

dialog: week we could be in Managua but it
dialog: is still possible to lose.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In the last days of our final

speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: We need a photograph.

dialog: Come with us.
text: THEY ALL RISE AND HEAD TOWARDS RAFAEL'S TENT
scene_heading: INT. RAFAEL'S TENT
text: The tent is filled with Sandinista officers and soldiers
text: standing and sitting around.
text: RAFAEL'S BODY LIES ON A TABLE The shirtless upper torso
text: propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure
text: of Rafael is distinctly non-heroic. He is slightly overweight,
text: slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his
text: men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive.
text: Price and Claire look at each other.
speaker_heading: COMMANDANTE CINCO
dialog: Usted es un fotografo magnifico.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Queremos que vive.
dialog: (You are a great
dialog: photographer. Make
dialog: him alive.)
text: Price laughs -- the request is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: ISELA
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Why is he laughing?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You're crazy.
text: Cinco steps forward -- his presence commands attention. His
text: delivery is forceful but not emotional. As he begins to speak,
text: Price stops laughing.
speaker_heading: CINCO
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: We have momentum, but many more lives
dialog: will be lost. Even Washington is
dialog: starting to admit that the butcher
dialog: Somoza is not loved by his people.
dialog: They have detained twenty-five million
dialog: dollars in new arms shipments for
text: Somoza at an airfield in Florida
dialog: until they find out if Rafael is
dialog: alive or dead. We know about these
dialog: things.
text: He pauses briefly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: If Washington thinks Rafael is dead,
dialog: they will ship the arms to Somoza.
dialog: Do you understand.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (without enthusiasm)
dialog: Commandante... Soy un periodista.
text: CINCO attacks that defense with new vigor.
speaker_heading: CINCO
dialog: This has nothing to do with journalism --
dialog: there is more to the world than
dialog: journalism. We are going to end this
dialog: war with you or without you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: People don't really believe in Rafael --
dialog: they believe in the idea of Rafael,
dialog: no? Because for now the idea of Rafael
dialog: is enough for the people of Nicaragua.
dialog: When the war is over -- none of this
dialog: matters.
text: PRICE hesitates, his manner devoid of its usual cockiness.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don't do things... like this.
speaker_heading: CINCO
dialog: Enough lives have been lost already.
dialog: (beat of empathy)
dialog: It's difficult, I know -- but you

dialog: better light!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Price lies on his back on a table. Claire sits in a chair, a

text: Rafael's. He plays with a camera without looking at it,
text: turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens. He's never
dialog: been this calm, this unmoving.
text: Claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal --
text: like Price normally is. She smokes. She's nervous and wired.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I spend my whole life separating how
dialog: I feel from how I think and what I
dialog: see from what I say -- that's called
dialog: journalism, isn't it?
text: He nods slightly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's disciplined. It civilized. It
dialog: involves distinctions. I'm great at
dialog: distinctions. I wish I wasn't so
dialog: good at them. Sometimes I envy you --
dialog: you don't make any -- it's very
dialog: convenient.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The only time I don't worry about
dialog: all those things is when I'm with my
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Or when you're in bed.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (beat -- changes
dialog: direction)
dialog: My job is to find a story, then tell
dialog: a story -- whatever it is -- because
dialog: I believe that if enough people hear
dialog: enough stories then somehow, through
dialog: information alone, we all have a
dialog: better chance to survive.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I believe in information.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's a very romantic streak I have
dialog: running through me -- maybe it's a
dialog: weakness. Information is good --
dialog: lack of information is bad. Simple,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Not so simple.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're God damn right it's not.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You take that picture you'll take it
dialog: for all the right reasons -- I
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I'm not gonna take it.
text: He fiddles with the cameras.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's fine for you. But do I go
dialog: back and say I interviewed Rafael?
dialog: Do I go back and say I missed the
dialog: biggest story of the war? Or do I
dialog: say Rafael was stone cold dead --
dialog: that's the information, isn't it? Or
dialog: do I say he entertained us all in
dialog: his inimitably charismatic manner
dialog: around the ol' revolutionary campfire?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can we throw up our arms and say we
dialog: fell in love with the querillas
dialog: because their cause was...
dialog: sympathetic?
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PRICE

text: She accepts a drink from Hub and speaks into her tape deck.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Under a steel gray July sky... start
text: again... under a gray steel Managuan
dialog: sky... scratch it... In an
dialog: extraordinary development in Managua,
dialog: President Anastazio Somoza has ordered
dialog: the Air Force to begin bombing his
dialog: own capitol, under a sky... fuck
dialog: it...
text: She fires down the drink and puts down the mike. She picks
text: up the binoculars again and, glancing below, is shocked:
scene_heading: P.O.V. BELOW -- ALEX GETS OUT OF A CAB WITH HIS SUITCASES
text: He starts into the hotel, glances up, and they see each other.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh my God...
text: Price sees Alex at the same time. Alex waves to both of as
text: he heads into the hotel. Price and Claire look at each other.
text: Claire sits down at a table, stunned to see Alex. Price
text: commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of
dialog: drinks.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: A Scotch, please...
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Double.
text: Price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at
text: the railing. He is equally upset and confused.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What's he doing here?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I have no idea.
text: ALEX COMES THROUGH THE DOOR with a couple journalists, sees
text: Price and Claire and comes over to join them. A polite kiss
text: on Claire's cheek, a handshake for Price. A moment of
dialog: awkwardness.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: On what?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: On what?! The Washington Post, the
dialog: Times, networks, wire services --
dialog: everybody's picked up the picture.
dialog: It's fabulous.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Well, yes... it's fabulous.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Fabulous.
text: Unsure silence.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why are you back?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I came back because of Russell.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Because of me?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah... the whole fucking East Coast
dialog: is falling in love with Rafael --
dialog: they were sure he was dead this time.
dialog: Somebody wants to do a musical about
text: him and his mug's on every T-shirt
dialog: in Central Park.
text: Alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular
dialog: culture.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I think he's bigger than Farrah
dialog: Fawcett.
text: Claire and Price struggle to enjoy this supremely
dialog: uncomfortable moment. It's not easy to enter the game. Claire
text: attempts to change the subject.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You look good. Things're okay?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm happier in New York, sure, things
dialog: are great. You guys?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Terrific... now... I'm a little slow
dialog: here, Alex... what exactly did you
dialog: come back for?
text: No more games. Alex addresses Price with conviction.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's a great story.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want to talk to Rafael... and you're
dialog: the only man in the world that can
dialog: take me to him.
text: Price's and Claire's hearts sink. They look at each other.
text: Alex, despite his reluctance to return to Nicaragua, seems
text: genuinely enthused about the possible story. Before Price or
text: Claire respond, Hub Kittle notices Alex and comes over with
text: a tray of drinks, extending genuine greetings to the Senior
dialog: Correspondent.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Alex! Couldn't stay away, eh?
text: The fresh round of drinks are put on the table. The sound of
text: bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire and Price now have adjoining rooms. She is staring
text: out the window as he comes in. The mood is strained.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We've got to tell Alex what happened.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'll tell him. He deserves to know.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: We don't owe him anything!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We owe him that!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He got you started in this business...
dialog: he covered for your missed deadlines
dialog: and made excuses for your
dialog: unprofessional attitude before the
dialog: world fell in love with your
dialog: pictures...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Before kids fresh out of journalism
dialog: school were rushing off to any war
dialog: they could to interview bullets and
dialog: take pictures of bodies -- like Price!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He took care of you before you were
dialog: hot!
text: Silence. She's hitting home but he doesn't want to acknowledge
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: He wouldn't understand.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Before Nicaragua you wouldn't
dialog: understand. I'm not sure I exactly
dialog: understand.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: There is something calculating in Price's tone, this is not
text: the fearless, boyish innocent anymore.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I'll take Alex to find Rafael --
dialog: we'll go to Sebaco on the road to
dialog: Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily
dialog: control the area and they're scared
dialog: right now -- they'll never let us
dialog: through. We won't be able to get
dialog: near Rafael. Alex will understand --
dialog: and we'll turn around and drive back
dialog: without a story.
text: Claire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's a lie!
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Tell me about lies!
text: Silence. They are co-conspirators and they know it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't want to tell him either.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO MATAGALPA - NEXT DAY
text: Price's white flagged newly rented press car streaks along,
text: overtaking an ox cart. A guardia convoy is going the opposite
text: direction, back toward Managua. Alex looks out of the car
dialog: with interest--he hasn't been to the front line for several
dialog: wars.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: We may not be able to find him,
dialog: y'know...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I've got supreme confidence in you.
text: A car is on fire by the side of the road. Price flies past;
text: Alex watches curiously. Several people stand around the car.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Claire looks good, eh?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Everybody looks good in the tropics.
text: Alex isn't sure how to respond to this curious reply.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Since I haven't been able to find
dialog: Isela since coming back, you're going
dialog: to have to translate for me -- what
dialog: the hell does that mean?
text: Price is nervous, wired, on edge.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Alex... I love her.
text: Alex takes this calmly -- it's not exactly new information.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And she 'thinks' she loves you.
speaker_heading: PRICE
text: It's past the thinking stage.
text: Alex looks at the passing scenery -- he's in no hurry.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'd like to know something -- it
dialog: probably doesn't matter in the great
dialog: final scheme of things... but I'm
dialog: interested...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you ever lay a hand on her before
dialog: she left me?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's the truth?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Alex -- we're friends!
text: There is something desperate in his voice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EXT. A ROADBLOCK ON THE EDGE OF SEBACO - DAY
text: Price and Alex are ordered out of their car by a very
text: unfriendly Guardia soldier. He is ordered to put down his
text: camera bag. The hood and trunk are opened.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Venga.
text: They are led to a shed by the roadside, A TIRE REPAIR SHOP,
text: where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. They watch the
dialog: soldiers:
text: P.O.V. THE SOLDIERS TEARING UP THE RENTAL CAR, pulling off
text: door panels, looking for weapons.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I bet you go through a few rental
dialog: cars.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Don't worry. I put this in your name.
text: PRICE AND ALEX JERK TO LIFE at the sound of screaming in the
text: distance. A volley of gunfire follows. Price moves quickly
text: into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall:
text: P.O.V. AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN A FIELD as several bodies are
text: being hauled away. Two soldiers reload their guns. PAN to a
text: figure moving behind a wall -- OATES.
text: PRICE HURRIES THROUGH THE SHACKS TOWARD THE EXECUTION WALL
text: as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single-
text: minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley
text: of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see:
text: TWO TRUCKS BEING LOADED WITH BODIES AS OATES SUPERVISES.
text: PRICE STEPS INTO THE CLEARING -- FACE-TO-FACE WITH OATES.
text: They look at each other for several beats before anyone
text: speaks. Oates is slightly embarrassed.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: No pictures, eh? Might look bad.
text: Oates smiles half-way; Price looks around at the bodies.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You get paid by the body or by the
dialog: hour?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: I get paid the same way you do. What
dialog: the fuck you doin' in Sebaco -- this
dialog: place's about to blow... ain't it?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You didn't have to nail Pedro.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Who's Pedro?
text: Alex arrives and tries to pull Price back -- at the same
text: time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh my God...
text: A body is carried through and loaded on a truck. Oates's
dialog: tone is one of explanation rather than defense, very matter-
dialog: of-fact.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: There's a motherfucking war goin'
dialog: on, pal... lotta sad stories.
text: Price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away,
text: and as he sees it he stops short, speechless. He points:
text: THE BODIES OF THE PRIEST FROM LEON AND THE BUSINESSMAN,
text: figures we saw at Rafael's camp, sit in the back of the truck.
text: They are splattered with blood and lifeless. Price is shaken.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Why them? Why them?!
text: Oates has to look to see who he's talking about, and Price
text: loses his cool.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: You're a cocksucker!
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: I don't suck no dick, man...
text: PRICE GRABS OATES AND PUSHES HIM BACKWARDS but Oates responds
text: like an animal. The two men go down in a heap and lash out
text: at each other in the dust. Their fighting is largely
text: ineffective, though very physical, until Oates asserts himself
text: and knocks Price against a wall, breaking free to pick up
text: his automatic rifle that he handles with one hand and shoves
text: it into Price's face.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: I'd prefer not splattering your brains
dialog: in a dump like this -- I got
dialog: priorities.
dialog: (to Alex)
dialog: Guy wants to be a hero, pops, get
dialog: him outta here before he's a number.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Be a shitty little town to buy it
dialog: in.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Russell, let's get outta here.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (to Oates)
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Guy's got a sense of humor, old man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Got any dope? Tough place to find
dialog: decent dope?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Why them?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Them? C'mere. You too.
text: He leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers
text: sit. A small table, some weapons, two shallow boxes, food,
text: beer. Oates rummages around to find what he wants, and pulls
dialog: out:
text: A HANDFUL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, mostly snapshots, odd sizes, with
text: names written on them. He sifts through them quickly and we
text: see an assortment of photographs of Nicaraguans. He finds
text: what he's looking for and holds up:
text: PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRIEST AND THE BUSINESSMAN, the
text: picture taken in Rafael's camp, blown up, cropped, and
text: identified. The faces are circled.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: If your mug shows up in this box...
dialog: and ya try to make it through
dialog: Sebaco... I owe yer ass.
text: This information hits Price in the gut, and he is seized
dialog: with fear.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who gives you the pictures?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: What's this, an interview? I ain't
dialog: that dumb.
text: Price turns, he doesn't want to face it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: Off the record.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Off the record... some pachuco gives
dialog: 'em to me. Ain't none of my business,
dialog: but I heard he gets 'em from a Frog.
text: Oates pulls another picture from a different box and holds
dialog: it up:
scene_heading: PHOTOGRAPH OF ISELA
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Nice, eh?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: She dead?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Not yet.

speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Whatya' expect? We're the ones gettin'
dialog: our butts kicked.

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I developed it in my room.

text: Silence. The car races.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Slow down.
dialog: (compassionately)
dialog: It wasn't your fault if somebody
dialog: stole your stuff...
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It was.
text: Alex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it
dialog: entirely.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What about Rafael?

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRICE'S ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER
text: A MAID IS CLEANING HIS ROOM which is the usual disaster.

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Algo no esta aqui. Fotografias.
dialog: (Something is not

speaker_heading: MAID

text: CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE ROOM She too looks shaken. He looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Commandante Cinco's body was just

dialog: sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco...'
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY
text: A cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. La
text: Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more

text: out and knock on Jazy's door.
text: GUARDIA SOLDIERS WATCH THEM FROM A DISTANCE, a development
text: that Price and Claire are aware of.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't think it's Jazy.
text: Still no answer.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Oates said it was a Frog. How many
dialog: Frenchmen you know around here? Jazy
dialog: ain't 'facilitating' shit.
text: Price is impatient. He looks around nervously -- the Guards
text: are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch,
text: jimmying the lock. The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes
dialog: off.
text: Price and Claire duck inside quickly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Christ!
text: Price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds
text: quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb.
text: LA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward
dialog: Jazy's.
text: INSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries
text: open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops.
text: Immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards.
text: She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are we looking for negs or prints?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Anything.
text: They find nothing downstairs. The look up at the sound of

text: Suddenly: Loud banging at the front door -- La Guardia.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND A THIRD ARRIVING - DAY
text: They look around warily, hungrily -- they know something is
dialog: wrong.
text: BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE we hear the shouting soldiers, banging.
text: Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag.
text: Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself.
text: Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs. Claire

dialog: Jazy.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER #2
dialog: El hombre tiene muchas novias, eh?
dialog: (The man has many
dialog: girlfriends, no?)
text: The soldiers laugh and peer into the room. Claire forces the

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, no, no...
text: Afraid to make a mistake with one of Jazy's sweethearts,
text: they don't press the issue. The door closes shut.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE

dialog: glass -- a pleasant mess.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Russell?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Russell?
text: A door off the bedroom is open -- light spills out. Claire
text: stops cold at what she sees:
text: PRICE STANDS IN A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS Hundreds of
text: pictures of all sizes, photographic equipment, an enlarger,
text: cameras and lenses, etc. Pictures of Sandino, newspaper
text: photos, snapshots.
text: P.O.V. OF RUSSELL'S PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RAFAEL'S CAMP cropped
dialog: and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the
text: Businessman, Isela. Photographs of other slain rebel leaders.
text: The pictures include faces that have been circled with names
text: written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed.
text: They are both stunned.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Let's get out of here.
text: THEY HURRY DOWNSTAIRS and as they get to the front door --

scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: This is what I want to show you.
speaker_heading: ALEX
text: We drove through three roadblocks a
dialog: half hour before curfew so you could
dialog: show me a statue of Tacho.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It's not Tacho. It's Mussolini. Tacho
dialog: went to Italy to commission a statue
dialog: of himself, he found a warehouse
dialog: full of Il Duces on horseback, got a
dialog: great deal on one of 'em -- brought
text: it back and switched heads.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ya can't tell, can ya?
dialog: Silence. Alex knows Price too well -- it's a great story but
dialog: that's not why they're here.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I think what he's trying to say --
dialog: what we're trying to say -- is that
dialog: things aren't exactly what they seem
dialog: to be.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, they don't "seem" to be that
dialog: great so I can't wait for this one...
dialog: (mocks silliness)

dialog: bullets flying!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Alex... I think I finally saw one
dialog: too many bodies.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Somoza is a killer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I thought the war would end sooner.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How many reasons do you want?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You saw too many bodies? That's a
dialog: lot of bodies.
dialog: (beat; to Price)
dialog: You stupid son of a bitch.
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Did he talk you into it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! I wanted Rafael to be alive.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: In some way I understand him doing
dialog: it, I don't like it but I
dialog: understand... but you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'd do it again.
text: Alex lets it all sink in. These two people about whom he has
dialog: such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You two have, of course, just served
dialog: me up your balls -- if that's what
text: they're called -- on a platter.
dialog: (several beats)
dialog: I can bury you both. You're handing
dialog: me your careers.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, Jesus Christ... this is a
dialog: motherfucking story, Russell...
dialog: (long silence)
dialog: What am I supposed to do with it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Anything you want.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: They're holding the lead in the World

speaker_heading: PRICE

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh yeah...
dialog: (distraught)
dialog: I don't know what to do.

dialog: I've gotta take some kind of a story
dialog: back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh Jesus.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: It's a little dangerous looking for
text: Jazy at the moment.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (mock heroic)
dialog: Ah, danger -- I love it. You could
dialog: ask the pointy-shoed little bastard
dialog: about your pictures... and I could
dialog: ask him whatever happened to Isela.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She's an officer in the Rafael army --
dialog: we saw her in Matagalpa.
text: Alex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Damn air conditioning.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - NEXT MORNING

text: The flag draped press car of Price and Alex drives slowly.
text: P.O.V. OUT OF THE CAR AS THEY LOOK CAREFULLY Things feel

text: at the barricades seem on edge. When Jazy's house is visible
text: in the distance, barricades force them another direction.
text: GUARDIA SOLDIERS RACE DOWN A STREET TOWARD GUNFIRE and the

text: We can't hear, but she points down the block.
text: INSIDE THE CAR Price cranks film into place, his actions are
text: automatic and nervous. When he looks up:
scene_heading: P.O.V. ALEX FIFTY YARDS AWAY
text: Walking in the direction she pointed, he motions to Price as
dialog: if to say, "Just checking this out."
text: PRICE LOOKS AROUND NERVOUSLY FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION And as
text: he does, looks through the camera.
text: THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF THE DEAD PIG followed by quick
text: blurred pans to other images -- TANK, HOUSE, WOMAN, SOLDIER --
text: until it settles on ALEX IN THE INTERSECTION. Two Guardia
text: soldiers come up to him and he holds out his hands as if to
dialog: say, "I'm lost."
text: ALEX TALKS TO THE SOLDIERS -- FREEZE FRAME click, click --
text: and the whirring sound of a motor drive, another FREEZE FRAME
text: click, click, more whirring -- Price is on automatic pilot.
text: Another soldier orders Alex up against a wall.
text: Nobody sees Price taking pictures -- it happens too quickly.
text: THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. ALEX IS SHOT IN THE CHEST FROM POINT
text: BLANK RANGE -- FREEZE FRAMES click, click, whirring as the

text: PRICE STARES WITHOUT THE CAMERA
text: P.O.V. ALEX LIES DEAD AS THE SOLDIERS LOOK AROUND The act

text: PRICE RUNS DOWN AN ALLEY and nearly runs right into the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: PRICE

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

dialog: gun.
scene_heading: PRICE AND THE SOLDIER ARE FACE-TO-FACE The soldier is a

text: Price's brief moment of peace is shattered by the screaming
text: of Guardia troops and the explosions of rocket fire from the

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What're you doing here?!

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: The Guardia did it -- I got pictures.
text: P.O.V. A TANQUETTA PASSES ON THE NEXT STREET, visible through

speaker_heading: MUCHACHO #1

speaker_heading: MUCHACHO #1
dialog: (in Spanish)

speaker_heading: MUCHACHO #3
dialog: Pig! Hijo de puta!
speaker_heading: JAZY

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Good. I have a speech to make.

dialog: all three.
speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: I like you people, but you are
dialog: sentimental shits. You fall in love

dialog: tyrants.
speaker_heading: MUCHACHO #1

speaker_heading: MUCHACHO #1
dialog: Periodistas! Take this picture! I'm

speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course.
dialog: A butcher.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But finally that is not the point,

speaker_heading: MUCHACHO #1

speaker_heading: JAZY
dialog: Maybe it's a good thing that I talk
dialog: too much...
text: A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.
text: Price grimaces. Claire shuts her eyes. They turn to look at

text: and Claire stand, frozen, until the rumbling sound of a
text: helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside.
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE GO TO THE DOORWAY and look out as a jeep

scene_heading: P.O.V. SEVERAL GUERRILLAS RETREATING FROM AN ADVANCING

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You okay?

dialog: Russell... what did Alex do?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Nothing. He asked for directions.

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: We gotta get outta sight -- half the

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: They're not looking for me.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Let me have the film...

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Aw, Christ...
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I've wrecked everything else, at
dialog: least let me take care of you here.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Russell... it's more dangerous being
dialog: with you than being alone.
dialog: He knows she's right. He loves her, and he's made enough
text: disastrous decisions lately. He hesitates, then pops open

text: the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt.
scene_heading: PRICE AND CLAIRE EMBRACE AND KISS BRIEFLY
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Don't get hurt.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (affectionately)
dialog: That's great advice.

text: OVER JAZY'S BODY, stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already.
text: The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds

text: DISTURBED AT THE IMAGES that she turns away, sickened, hurt,
text: guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. She closes her

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Journalist?

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

scene_heading: EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - DAWN
text: CLAIRE SLEEPS AGAINST THE WALL as a dog sniffs and licks her
text: face. She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away.
text: Claire rises and looks around.
text: A LOCAL WOMAN PUSHES A CART carrying the wrapped body of her
text: husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua.
text: CLAIRE MOVES THROUGH THE CAMP just coming to life, and looks
text: around trying to interpret the eerie silence. A WOMAN tends
text: to her TWO SMALL CHILDREN.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Have you seen La Guardia?
scene_heading: WOMAN WITH CHILDREN
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: No. Is the war over?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: I don't know.
text: A DISTANT, DRONING NOISE GETS STEADILY LOUDER. Claire looks
text: around nervously.
text: A CHILD RUNS DOWN THE STREET SHOUTING
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: Tanquettas! Tanquettas!
scene_heading: P.O.V. -- SEVERAL TANQUETTAS AND EARTH MOVERS coming over
text: the hill in the distance. The Refugees look up fearfully and
text: some hide. As the war machinery gets closer, we see that:
text: SANDINISTAS ARE DRIVING THE MACHINES draped with red and
text: black (F.S.L.N.), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow
text: and white (the Vatican) flags. Graffiti of victory covers
dialog: the tanquettas.
text: PEOPLE COME INTO THE STREET CHEERING, embracing, only
text: gradually realizing what has happened.
scene_heading: WOMAN WITH CHILDREN
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Is the war over?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: WOMAN WITH CHILDREN
dialog: Es bueno.
dialog: (It is good.)
text: The woman continues with her children, her comment
text: unemotional, and Claire smiles slightly and walks away,
text: through a city awakening slowly to its victory.
text: CLAIRE STOPS A RED CROSS TRUCK and shows the driver her
text: picture of Price. The picture means nothing to the driver.
text: Claire continues through the city, looking for Price.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - MORNING
text: CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL AREA where chairs and tables float
text: in the pool, the bar is overturned, and the once sumptuous
text: press oasis is a disaster.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - MORNING
text: CLAIRE ENTERS A DESERTED LOBBY, also a mess, and hesitates
text: before climbing the circular stairs.
text: CLAIRE LOOKS INTO PRICE'S ROOM, and finds it empty, and
dialog: typically messy.
text: CLAIRE WALKS INTO HER OWN ROOM -- PRICE STANDS AT THE BALCONY
text: looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises.
text: CLAIRE AND PRICE EMBRACE DEEPLY, holding onto each other
text: without the slightest intention of letting go.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL LOBBY - LATER - DAY
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE COME DOWNSTAIRS to the lobby. They are
dialog: cleaned up in fresh clothes; they have survived and the war
text: is over.
text: THE LOBBY IS COMING TO LIFE AGAIN with Regis' camera crew,
text: who look like they've had a long night, a BUS BOY, A MAID,
scene_heading: AN OLD COUPLE, and A WHITE WOMAN, 38, with TWO SMALL DAUGHTERS --
dialog: all either sit or mill in the b.g.
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE STOP SHORT at what they see.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Alex.
text: P.O.V. -- A HANDMADE CASKET SITTING IN THE LOBBY with the
text: name, "A. Grazier" scrawled in felt pen.
text: Price and Claire stand next to the box silently -- there is
text: nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a familiar
text: voice that is polite, unforced, and sincere.
scene_heading: VOICE OF HUB KITTLE
dialog: It was the best I would do under the
dialog: circumstances. The casket, I mean.
text: Awkward silence until they realize that he's sincere.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Can you help us ship it home?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I've already taken care of it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I always liked the guy. I can't even
dialog: get tickets for my own family, but I
dialog: could get you two on the plane if
dialog: you want.
text: We see the woman and little girls as Hub's family.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yes, please...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tacho's in Miami.
text: A shared silence at the lunacy of the moment, interrupted by
text: the tired voice of one of Hub's daughters.
speaker_heading: HUB'S DAUGHTER
dialog: Daddy!
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to Price and Claire)
dialog: I am sorry. I had a job to do --
dialog: that's all -- it put me in some
dialog: unhappy situations.
text: Hub goes over to take care of his family.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA OF MANAGUA'S LARGEST CATHEDRAL - LATER - DAY
text: Thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and
text: joyous singing, led by a group on the highest cathedral steps,
text: surrounded by Revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds. A
text: SINGING GROUP sings a song to Nicaragua, and a song to Rafael.
text: RAFAEL'S BODY IN A FANCY CASKET is carried in through the
text: crowd to wild cheering and singing. High over the pallbearers'
text: heads it moves through the crowds.
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND TO THE SIDE watching it all. The
dialog: celebration is joyously infectious, and for the moment we
dialog: can forget the bloodshed, forget the problems that lay ahead,
dialog: forget even the death of Alex.
text: PRICE PULLS OUT A CAMERA and begins taking pictures of the
dialog: celebration.
text: ISELA IS AT THE MICROPHONE with other Guerrilla leaders.
text: CLAIRE WORKS THROUGH THE CROWD with her mike held high,
text: recording the singing of the crowd.
text: PRICE BACKS UNDER THE AWNING of a stand selling refreshments,
dialog: and especially Rum and Coke mixtures known suddenly and
text: triumphantly as "Nicalibres." As Price snaps off pictures --
text: a voice from an American in casual street clothes drinking
text: at the temporary bar.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Hey, Pricey...
text: Price looks over to see the smiling Oates.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: It's all over, eh? We made it. I
text: like the singing.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What're you doing here?
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Free country. Now it's free, anyway.
dialog: (raises his drink)
dialog: Nicalibre!
text: Oates holds up his Kodak Instamatic camera.
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: How 'bout a quickie?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: No? Things are heating up in
dialog: Thailand... thought I'd check it
dialog: out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You ain't gonna turn me in, are ya?
text: PRICE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY
speaker_heading: OATES
dialog: Am I gonna see ya in Thailand? We
dialog: could be friends!
text: Price keeps walking, into the crowd, where he finds Claire.
text: Oates orders another Nicalibre, and beats his foot to the
dialog: music.
text: PRICE AND CLAIRE IN THE CROWD
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: We've got a plane to catch.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did you get enough pictures?
text: No answer -- a final complicated question from Claire --
text: they smile. Price waves for a cab which pulls over. They get
text: in the cab and drive away.
