scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT ROOM OF A HOUSE IN BELFAST - DAY.
text: Twelve-year-old COLLETTE MCVEIGH is absorbed in making a
text: necklace with a bucket of beads. She’s listening to 10CC’s
text: hit single Rubber Bullets on the gramophone.
dialog: Load up, load up the rubber bullets...
scene_heading: PUNCH UP; JUNE 1973
text: COLLETTE’S father, GERRY SENIOR, puts his head around the
text: door. He has interrupted a call and has his hand over the
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: GERRY SENIOR
dialog: Get us some fags love. Your
dialog: mother’s run out.
text: He disappears again. COLLETTE continues with her fun a
text: moment, then stands and walks through to the...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.
text: ..-where her seven-year-old brother SEAN is eating a bowl
text: of cereal. He’s a cute-looking kid, the baby of the family.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Dad wants you to get some fags.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He asked you.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Doesn’t matter. I went last time.
text: SEAN rolls his eyes. Sisters.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: SEAN emerges into the street, leaving the door open so that
dialog: 10CC’s song comes with us.
text: He instinctively turns left for the shop, but then checks
text: himself. There’s a huge riot at the other end of the
text: street. Curiosity gets the better of him and he heads
text: towards it.
text: Some kids are playing football. Parents gossip in the
text: doorways; every day life in a city torn apart by civil
text: strife.
scene_heading: EXT. FALLS ROAD - CONTINUOUS
text: SEAN’s P.O.V. as he steps out into the fringe of the riot.
text: He can just make out his older brothers GERRY and PADDY
text: with masks around their faces, throwing tear gas at the
text: soldiers. The troops are using armoured Land Rovers as
text: barricades.
text: A bus is burning.
dialog: One hell of a playground.
text: 10CC have got to the chorus again. Load up, load up the
dialog: rubber bullets...
dialog: Wham!
dialog: He’s hit.
text: On the ground.
dialog: Silence.
text: PADDY and GERRY running towards him. A crowd gathering...
text: Why can’t he hear anything? What’s happening?
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - SECONDS LATER.
text: As the sound CRASHES BACK, GERRY and PADDY are stumbling
text: down the street with SEAN in their arms. They are
text: surrounded by rioters, onlookers, neighbors...
text: Chaos. Shouts. Voices. It’s Sean. Aye, it’s wee Sean. Jesus
dialog: Christ, it's Sean. Bastards! They've shot wee Sean!

text: GERRY SENIOR and SEAN’s MOTHER appear in the doorway. MA is
text: white as a sheet as GERRY SENIOR thrusts the others aside.
text: He takes SEAN’s pulse. Tries CPR.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Tries again.
text: The room grows quiet. MA falls to her knees.
dialog: MA.
dialog: Speak to me Sean.
dialog: Silence.
text: A hand on his cheek.
speaker_heading: MA. (CONT'D)
dialog: Speak to me, my boy.
text: He’s dead.
text: She puts her arms around him and draws him to her chest.
text: She starts to cry. It’s gut-wrenching, heart-breaking...
text: GERRY SENIOR catches sight of COLLETTE’s stunned face in
text: the throng. He yanks her into the...

speaker_heading: GERRY SENIOR

dialog: Why wasn’t it you?

speaker_heading: GERRY SENIOR (CONT’D)
dialog: It should have been you!
text: He pushes her into...
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: .--and slams the door.
text: The noise recedes.
text: Terror in her eyes. Desolation. Isolation.
dialog: Silence again.
text: Until we can just make out her breathing...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: IN THE DARK, THE SOUND OF BREATHING AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME
scene_heading: URGENT, HURRIED...

scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - CONTINUOUS.
text: COLLETTE is sprinting -- like her life depends on it --

dialog: That's a straight order. Right.
dialog: Now.
scene_heading: INT. TUBE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS.
text: Thunderous noise and bright lights as the train HURTLES

dialog: to pieces for sure...
text: A service alcove. She’s in.
text: Train whips past. Thwup, thwup.
text: Gone. Now screeching to a halt...

scene_heading: INT. CELL - PADDINGTON GREEN POLICE STATION - NIGHT.
text: COLLETTE faces two cops. Two audio tapes turn in the
text: recording device on the table.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE 1 (SITTING)
dialog: Boy are you in the shit,

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Cute kid...did you tell him you

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Ferry to Fishguard. South to a

text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Onto the train. Flick the timer

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE 2

dialog: Shame about your boy, love.
dialog: No answer.

scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM OUTSIDE THE CELL - A FEW MINUTES
speaker_heading: LATER.

scene_heading: INT. POLICE CELL - CONTINUOUS.

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Can I get you anything?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: A lawyer.
text: open the tape recorder on the desk, removes the

speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I'm legally entitled to speak to--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I know what you’re entitled to,
dialog: Collette. But you just tried to
dialog: go head to head with a five
dialog: hundred ton tube train, so do us
dialog: both a favour and listen. You
dialog: don’t want to be here. And I can
dialog: get you out.
text: He opens the briefcase, takes out a file. It has SEAN
scene_heading: MICHAEL MCVEIGH. SHOT 25th JUNE 1973 MINISTRY OF DEFENCE --
text: CONFIDENTIAL stamped on the front.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: It won’t give you what you want,
dialog: or what your family’s lawyers
dialog: expect. But maybe it’1l help.
text: He closes his briefcase, leaves.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS.
text: He watches from the other side of the glass. She stares at
text: the file like it’s a contagious disease.
text: He walks around the corner, gets a cup of coffee and slips
dialog: out to the...
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS.
text: ...-where he lights a cigarette and leans against the
dialog: window.
text: Footsteps. One of his colleagues with the video grab. Sure
dialog: enough, it’s pretty hard to say definitively that’s
speaker_heading: COLLETTE.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Fine. Lay it on thick. Police
dialog: tonight are still hunting--
speaker_heading: MI5 OFFICER
dialog: Sure, Mac. We got it.
scene_heading: INT. CELL - CONTINUOUS.
text: COLLETTE staring at the file. She breathes in deep and
text: opens it.
text: Shit. Page one; Sean’s naked corpse on the slab.
text: She shuts her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER.
text: MAC at his desk, watching the news. Some reporter outside
dialog: Waterloo Station;
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Trevor, the government continues

text: Stands, to get a glimpse through the glass.
scene_heading: INT. CELL - CONTINUOUS
text: COLLETTE’S P.O.V. as she looks at a photograph of two men

scene_heading: PADDY MCVEIGH.
text: SEAN can just be seen emerging from the side street.
scene_heading: INT. CELL - CONTINUOUS.
text: MAC slips in. COLLETTE closes the file.
text: He takes it, puts it in his briefcase, sits.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I don’t know who you are, but I
dialog: have nothing to say to you.
text: MAC takes out another file. He holds up a photograph.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Remember him?
text: She lowers her gaze.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at it, please.
dialog: She won't.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at it, Collette.
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Raymond Quinn. You used to work
text: at his print factory.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You told Paddy he was a part-time
dialog: soldier and this was the result.
text: A picture of a BODY LYING AMIDST KIDS TOYS...
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You scouted it, Gerry ordered it
text: and Paddy pulled the trigger.
dialog: Raymond's wife found their kids
text: clinging to the corpse.
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Two months ago at his grave...
text: A photograph of her placing flowers in front of a
dialog: headstone.
dialog: No
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to tell me why,
dialog: Collette?
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s no shame in remorse, you
dialog: know. Not for any of us.
text: Another folder. He drops it onto the desk.
dialog: No
dialog: No
dialog: No
dialog: No
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Provisional forensics.
dialog: response.
dialog: answer.
dialog: answer.
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Not one for the boyos back home,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: (steely)
dialog: That would lead to a lot of
text: awkward questions.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: (flicking through)
dialog: What were you planning to tell
dialog: them? That their kit didn’t work?
dialog: That you were being followed?
text: He leans forward.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn’t set the timer,
dialog: Collette! This thing couldn’t
dialog: have blown up a fucking paper
dialog: bag!
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I'd like to speak to my lawyer.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You come all the way over here,
dialog: but you were planning to fire a
dialog: dud. Why?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: So here’s a girl who puts flowers
dialog: on a victim’s grave. And who
text: suddenly can’t bring herself to
dialog: arm the bomb she’s been sent to
dialog: plant.
dialog: Still none.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe your brothers would say
dialog: you're betraying Sean’s memory.
dialog: But I--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (with a flash of anger;
dialog: he’s touched a nerve)
dialog: I have a right to speak to a
dialog: legal representative!
text: MAC takes a video tape from the briefcase, slaps it into
text: the machine, bangs it shut and presses play. We see a
text: grainy undercover shot of COLLETTE and her five-year-old
text: son MARK walking home from school.
text: She's trying not to watch, but it’s hard. He’s a cute-
text: looking boy. Her son. Her pride and joy. Not much younger
dialog: than Sean was when he died.
text: The tape goes on rolling...and rolling.
text: We can just make out his voice now, chattering to her.
text: COLLETTE turns away. She’s a soldier of war. Like her
dialog: brothers. Just got to hold on...
dialog: God, it’s hard.
dialog: Bastard.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You know what it’s going to be
dialog: like; an Irish girl in an English
dialog: jail. Every time you want to see
dialog: your boy, his grandmother will
dialog: have to load him onto a ferry and
dialog: drive four hundred miles. It’1ll
dialog: break his heart.
text: A beat.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe we can talk to our friends
dialog: in the social services. See if we
dialog: can have him put up for adoption.
dialog: After all, he’d surely be better--
text: COLLETTE reaches forward suddenly to stop the tape and MAC
text: seizes her wrist.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me you don’t believe in
dialog: something better.
text: She tries to withdraw, but he won’t let go.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You can have it.
text: She struggles free. He sits back.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Maybe your leaders are serious
dialog: about peace this time. We have to
dialog: believe that. But your brother
dialog: Gerry will kill it off if he
dialog: possibly can. Is that what you
dialog: want?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You agree to talk to us, to watch
dialog: him, and you’re out of here like
dialog: nothing ever happened. Back to
dialog: your Mother. Back to your boy.
dialog: We'll pay you. Well. And one day,
dialog: if you want it, we can give you a
dialog: life far away from this.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I'd like to call my lawyer now.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: This is the road you took when
dialog: you put flowers on Raymond
dialog: Quinn’s grave, Collette. It’s the
dialog: road you took when you decided
dialog: not to arm that--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: You don’t know a damned thing!
text: A beat. He looks at her. Hard.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I know it bugs the hell out of
dialog: you your mother won’t get the
dialog: washing machine fixed. I know you
dialog: ask yourself why your boy still
dialog: wets his bed at night. I know you
dialog: were so lonely the evening before
dialog: you came here that you went home
dialog: with a guy you don’t even like. I
dialog: know he fucked you so roughly
dialog: that--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
text: (on her feet, pushing
dialog: the table back)
dialog: For Christ’s sake--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (on his feet also)
dialog: You went back to your mother’s
dialog: place, took your son into your
dialog: arms and cried until it was time
dialog: to leave.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I want. To speak. To a--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Jesus! You people have no sense
dialog: of irony.
text: He scoops up the files and puts them back in his briefcase.
text: The interview is over.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: If you want to take your anger to
dialog: the grave, be my guest. But you
dialog: can be fucking sure you'll take
dialog: your son with you.
text: He’s at the door.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You have two hours. After that,
dialog: you're on your own. If you really
dialog: want a lawyer, press the button
text: on my side of the desk.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP IN SOUTH ARMAGH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
text: It’s a filthy, windswept evening. MAC’s boss KATE FLETCHER
text: stands by the door of a pavilion. She’s extremely
text: attractive, but dresses to hide it. She’s calm, focused, a
text: little icy, even. She’s considerably younger than MAC.
dialog: 18.
text: Some of her officers lurk in the hedgerows. A car guns down
text: the lane, lights spinning in the darkness. A little rat of
text: a man named GINGY HUGHES steps out.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (like a mother scolding
dialog: her son)
dialog: You're late.
text: They step into the...
scene_heading: INT. PAVILION - CONTINUOUS.
text: .--and sit close on a bench. The wind whistles through the
text: rafters and worries at the windows. GINGY squirms, part
text: supplicant, part child, part suitor. He is highly agitated.
speaker_heading: GINGY
dialog: They’re onto me.
text: She takes his hand. His mother now.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Gingy--
speaker_heading: GINGY
dialog: Mulgrew was here.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: GINGY
dialog: Watching. He came down two days
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: He talked to you?
speaker_heading: GINGY
dialog: No, but--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Gingy, it’s okay.
text: She leans closer, grips him a little tighter. A woman who
dialog: is not afraid to use her femininity...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: We need you, Gingy. More than
dialog: ever. You know that. If McVeigh

text: He closes his eyes. He doesn’t want to do this.
text: There is something impressive and, at the same time,
text: completely grotesque about the way she holds him in place.
dialog: 19.
text: A hard woman to break free from. In every way.
text: The wind rattles the windows and they look around, but it’s

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE OF COMMONS - CARRIAGE GATE - NIGHT
text: A sallow young man, EDDIE MCILHATTON, watches a woman walk

text: behind her as she takes off a security pass and slips it
text: into her handbag.
scene_heading: INT. TUBE TRAIN - NIGHT
text: The woman from the House of Commons is reading a newspaper,

text: The tube is emptier. Coming to the end of the line.
scene_heading: INT. PADDINGTON GREEN POLICE STATION - CELL - NIGHT
text: MAC sits.
text: She’s not pressed the button. So they both know she’s
text: crossed a line.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You want a cup of coffee now?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: You can’t ask me to betray my

dialog: He thinks about this. Betrayal. It’s a big word.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: We all have our secrets. Little

speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a woman who works at the
dialog: travel agent on the Andersonstown

dialog: want to see what your brother
dialog: does to her when Christy thinks
dialog: he’s on IRA business?
text: He reaches for his briefcase again.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No...no.
text: She's a little shocked by that.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You'll be keeping people alive,
dialog: Collette. Boys like your son.
dialog: Women like you. Men like me. So
dialog: don’t talk to me about betrayal.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: They’11 kill me.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: They’11 never know.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I'll be there, day and night,
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Until you don’t need me any more
text: and then...(clicks her fingers)
text: He looks at her long and hard. It’s a stare that says; if
dialog: you cross this line, you’re my girl. Period.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST BROMPTON TUBE STATION - NIGHT
text: The WOMAN from the House of Commons leaves the tube station
text: and steps onto a dimly-lit street. MCILHATTON closes in on

text: He starts to run, RIPS the handbag from her arm and sprints
text: into the night.
text: She is too shocked to scream.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: INT. PADDINGTON GREEN POLICE STATION - CELL - NIGHT
text: Neither MAC nor COLLETTE has moved. He’s leaning on the

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You have two weeks to convince us
dialog: you mean what you say. If you
dialog: don’t make the grade, you’re back
text: in this chair staring at a charge
dialog: sheet. Tonight, we put out a
text: blurred grab from the cameras in
dialog: the train station. Your friends
dialog: in Belfast will guess it’s you,
dialog: but it’s vague enough for us to
dialog: be excused making an ID. That’s
dialog: your cover. You escaped from the
dialog: train station, went to ground and
dialog: hid out overnight. We’ll go
dialog: through your movements step by
dialog: step.
dialog: No answer.
dialog: MAC.
dialog: Have you got that, Collette?
text: She nods, but without meeting his eye.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Are you sure you want to do this?
dialog: No answer.
dialog: MAC.

speaker_heading: MCILLHATTON
dialog: I’ve got what we need. I’1ll take

dialog: This is a lonely calling.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERSEA PARK - EARLY MORNING.
text: COLLETTE and MAC stand by a shed.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: When you got away, you came here.

scene_heading: INT. GINGY’S HOUSE - SOUTH ARMAGH - DAY.

scene_heading: INT. THE BACK SEAT OF A CAR - BATTERSEA PARK - A FEW

speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s an emergency bleep. Hide it
dialog: well. If you press the button,
dialog: half the world will come running.
text: She takes it, but continues to gaze out of the window.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: My code name is Box Man. If you
dialog: call in, you ask for--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I mean your real name.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: It’s better you don’t know.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: If you make a mistake, I’m dead --

text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Mornin’, Gingy. You’se expecting

speaker_heading: GINGY

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: OFFICER

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I’1l deal with it.

text: GINGY HUGHES sits in a chair, naked, with a sack over his

speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: When, Gingy?
text: MULGREW doesn’t receive an answer, so he yanks GINGY up and
text: drags him to a filthy blood red bath.
dialog: 25.
text: He smashes his skull against it as GINGY screams in pain.
text: MULGREW plunges his head into the water and holds him down.
text: The rest of the crew watch. They don’t share MULGREW’s
text: sadism.
text: He yanks GINGY’s head up. We notice he is trying to avoid

speaker_heading: MULGREW. (CONT’D)
dialog: When did you start your touting?
speaker_heading: GINGY

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH ARMAGH - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - DAY
text: COLLETTE leaves the station. The rain stops. The sun
text: shines. She’s close to home now and can’t contain herself.
text: She starts to run...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH ARMAGH - DAY
text: GINGY is on his knees by a ditch. MULGREW holds a pistol to

dialog: You think we should forgive ye,

speaker_heading: GINGY

speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Aye...maybe youse’re right. The

text: MULGREW touches GINGY’s shoulder paternally, but we see
text: from the faces of his crew that they don’t buy the
dialog: possibility of a reprieve.
text: CLOSE on the youngest. He looks like he’s about to shit his
dialog: pants.

scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S STREET - DAY

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS.
text: The house is quiet. COLLETTE’S MOTHER is hunched over the

speaker_heading: MARK

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING
text: An ordinary family scene. MARK is finishing his tea, whilst
text: COLLETTE and her MOTHER wash up. The door opens and in walk
text: COLLETTE’S two brothers, GERRY and PADDY. GERRY is taller
text: and older. He is brooding and handsome, with cropped hair;
dialog: naturally a leader. But PADDY got all the emotional
text: intelligence. He is shorter and bulkier with long, unkempt
text: hair and a moustache.
dialog: There’s a warmth here. They’re a family, right or wrong.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: We heard a rumour our girl was
dialog: back.
text: He hugs his sister and whispers;
speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It was all over the news. Ma’s
dialog: been in pieces.
text: He kisses his mother. GERRY takes a hunk of bread off the
text: side and wipes some of the left-over gravy from MARK’s
text: plate. He winks at his sister.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: (with his mouth full)
dialog: You all right, Collette?
text: She nods. GERRY switches on the TV. The British and Irish
text: Prime Ministers are giving a press conference
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You heard about this?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We’re busting their balls and
dialog: they want us to settle for a

dialog: MA.
dialog: Mind your language in front of
dialog: Mark please, Gerard.
dialog: 29.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: MA. (CONT'D)
dialog: And who’s to say it isn’t
dialog: something.
text: He turns back to the TV and whacks up the volume. The
text: British Prime Minister, John Major, is answering a
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: MAJOR.
dialog: Of course the document entertains
dialog: the possibility of a united
dialog: Ireland. But it also very clearly
dialog: recognises the right of the
dialog: people of Northern Ireland to
dialog: determine their own future. Any
dialog: process must be based on the
dialog: consent of both communities.
text: We cut back to the newscaster. He intones gravely;
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: But even as the two Prime
dialog: Ministers made that announcement,
dialog: police in Northern Ireland
text: discovered a hooded body on the
dialog: border.
text: Now we're looking at shots of GINGY’s house. Kids toys lie
text: abandoned in the garden.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: The dead man has been named as Mr

scene_heading: ANGLE on GERRY.
scene_heading: ON PADDY.
scene_heading: ON COLLETTE.

scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S BACK YARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER.
text: PADDY is playing football with MARK. He collapses and the

text: GERRY joins her on the step. He takes in the scene. Maybe --
dialog: who knows -- he’s a little envious. That isn’t his style.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Glad you made it.
dialog: 30.
text: She nods, still watching her son.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Were they waiting?
text: She hesitates, like she’s working out what’s best to say.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Yeah.
text: GERRY gets up again and, for a moment, we think he’1l place
text: a hand upon her shoulder, but it’s beyond him. He
text: disappears into the house.
text: PADDY joins her. MARK jumps onto his lap again.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Aaagh! You little bugger. Go
dialog: shoot at goal. Man U one nil down
dialog: with a minute to go. Penalty!!!
text: MARK trudges off happily. PADDY turns to his sister.
speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s okay.
text: She watches her son strike the football and then jump onto
dialog: the swing. They both know it’s more complicated than that.
speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: How ‘bout you?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I’m fine.
text: He ruffles her hair.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: They said on the news the girl
text: ran down a tube tunnel.
text: PADDY looks at her. These are crazy risks we run.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: What do you reckon on this
dialog: document?
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Gerry says our leaders want a
dialog: ticket to fancy handshakes at the
dialog: White House.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: What do you think?
text: A beat.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: We made a promise. That’s what
dialog: Gerry says.
dialog: So there it is. GERRY is the self-appointed keeper of the
text: flame. And they’re all still trapped by that day.
text: Except that COLLETTE isn’t any more. Or maybe she is. ON
text: HER FACE as she works the angles. Relief. Guilt. Hope.
dialog: Fear.
dialog: She's got no bloody idea where she stands.
text: He leans closer.
speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: This’ll cheer you up. You know
dialog: the peeler who tried to put us
dialog: away for the guy at the print-
dialog: works?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: PADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: This Friday...

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - IN HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. MI5’S BELFAST HEADQUARTERS - DAY

scene_heading: INT. MI5’S BELFAST HEADQUARTERS - FLETCHER’S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What did they say?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: MAC

text: Both women laugh. MA leans closer and kisses COLLETTE’s
text: forehead. A moment of unalloyed warmth. But it doesn’t fix
text: the yawning chasm between them.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FALLS ROAD IN WEST BELFAST - DAY
text: COLLETTE is taking MARK to school, an arm around his
text: shoulder. She’s stopped to chat to a friend. Just small
dialog: talk. He's out of control, so he is. Someone should tell
text: her. But the friend seems kind of in a hurry to move on,
text: like she doesn’t want them to be seen together in public.
text: CLOSE on COLLETTE for a beat as she reads this. Not the
text: first time by any means, but a tiny wound all the same.
text: They break up. COLLETTE and MARK walk away past an army
text: patrol. A soldier suddenly blocks her way. He’s an older
text: guy with a rugged face, but he’s friendly. Or at least
dialog: polite.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (points)
dialog: We need to check your bag, Ma’am.
text: She lets him search it. No point in a confrontation.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your pockets.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Sargeant, I’m just taking my son
dialog: to school.
text: But he’s not budging. She spreads her arms.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Perhaps you'd be kind enough to
text: step into the doorway here.
text: COLLETTE frowns. But the guy is still being extremely
text: polite, so she complies.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: If you could put your arms
text: against the wall.
text: She shakes her head, but does so. The long RAINCOAT she is
text: wearing is spread wide, like a bat’s wings. Or a screen.
text: The soldier checks her raincoat pockets.
text: He begins with her right wrist. The search is tight.
dialog: slow.
dialog: Too slow.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I’m just taking my son to school,
dialog: Sargeant.
dialog: No answer.
dialog: Elbows.
dialog: Shoulders.

text: Ribs. Slower still.
dialog: Breasts.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Stay there...or you’re in
dialog: Castlereagh for the night and
dialog: we'll stick your boy over the
text: other side of the wall.
text: He puts a hand down her blouse, in her bra, cups her
dialog: nipple.
text: TIGHT on COLLETTE’s face as she turns away, bites her lip.
text: CLOSE on MARK. He knows something is wrong.
text: The soldier slips his hand out.
text: Back to her waist.
text: Slower still.
dialog: Hips.
dialog: Thigh.
dialog: Knee.
dialog: 38.
text: Inner thigh.
text: The band of her knickers.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Since your brothers blew his legs

speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: All my friend Joe has to pleasure
dialog: his wife...
dialog: Lower.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Is the fingers of his right

text: She breaks away, staggers. She leans against the wall,
dialog: sobs.
text: The soldiers move off.
text: TIGHT on MARK again as he watches her.
scene_heading: INT. MAC’S CAR - ON LINENHALL STREET - DAY
text: MAC speaks into a hand-held radio. A DRIVER is beside him.
speaker_heading: MAC

scene_heading: EXT. NEARBY STREET - CONTINUOUS.

scene_heading: INT. MAC’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

speaker_heading: MAC

text: Watches the empty street.

text: No sign of her.
text: Time crawls by.
dialog: Where the fuck is she?
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: (into the radio)
dialog: She’s not coming. Let’s get
dialog: outta’ here!
text: The car guns away. And he’s furious.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FALLS ROAD - BELFAST - DAY
text: We pick up COLLETTE as she approaches her son’s school.
scene_heading: INT. PRIMARY SCHOOL - A MINUTE LATER
text: We’re CLOSE on MARK as he waits for his mum in the
text: classroom and catch his DELIGHT as she arrives. Watching
text: this reunion, the HEADTEACHER approaches. She has a kindly
dialog: manner.
speaker_heading: HEADTEACHER
dialog: Miss. McVeigh, I’m sorry to
dialog: trouble you. Could you spare a
dialog: few minutes?
text: It’s obvious she means without MARK.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (touching his shoulder)
dialog: I won’t be long.
text: The head takes her down to an office. She produces a
text: child’s picture. It depicts a man with a gun lying ina
text: pool of blood.
speaker_heading: HEADTEACHER
dialog: I thought you should see this.
dialog: It’s not the first.
text: COLLETTE stares at the painting. She doesn’t look like she
dialog: really wants to deal with it.
speaker_heading: HEADTEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I know that Mark’s father was
dialog: killed just before he came to us,
dialog: Miss. McVeigh, but I worry that-
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Mark's father was murdered Mrs.
dialog: Davies.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: HEADTEACHER
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Yes. I understand he was a
dialog: Volunteer-
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: He was a patriot.
speaker_heading: HEADTEACHER
dialog: Miss. McVeigh, I don’t seek to
dialog: make a judgement. I just want to
dialog: draw your attention to the fact
dialog: that your son is struggling to
text: concentrate on his school work.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (chastened)
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: HEADTEACHER
dialog: Your mother said that Mark had
dialog: been upset by your recent
dialog: absence, so perhaps that explains
dialog: it.
text: The HEAD is making a point here. COLLETTE folds up the
dialog: painting.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (frosty now)
dialog: Thank you, Mrs. Davies. I
dialog: appreciate your concern.
scene_heading: EXT. FALLS ROAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER.
text: COLLETTE walks home with MARK in the gathering darkness.
text: She drapes an arm around him.
dialog: He thinks
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: How was school?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: How were your lessons?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: What was the best bit of the day?
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: When you came to pick me up.
dialog: 4l.
text: COLLETTE pulls him tighter.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - A FEW MINUTES LATER.
text: COLLETTE comes through the door and throws her keys in the
text: pot. MARK runs out towards the yard. COLLETTE’s mother is
text: cooking the kids dinner, but she’s tense.
dialog: MA.
dialog: You have a visitor.
text: COLLETTE frowns at her mother’s demeanor and tone. She
text: walks through to...
scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS.
text: ...-where a man is sitting with his back to her. He already
text: has an arm around her son. He turns. It is KEVIN MULGREW.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Collette; what about you’se?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Hello, Kevin.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: This is a beautiful wee fella’
dialog: you've got here.
text: MARK doesn’t look too sure. COLLETTE scoops him up. MULGREW
dialog: stands.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I have to give him tea.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: We need to talk about London.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Later.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: A Volunteer is never off duty,
dialog: Collette.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Nor is a mother.
text: For a moment, he looks like he’1ll insist. But then he
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Sure. Tomorrow, then. We have
dialog: time, so we do.
dialog: 42.
text: He waits, makes her sweat.
text: PADDY arrives through the back gate. We sense immediately

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: (to Collette)
dialog: What the fuck’s he doing here?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
text: He’s just leaving.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Doing my job, Volunteer McVeigh.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Then fuck off and do it somewhere
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: (to Collette, unruffled)
dialog: Look after yourself, Collette.
text: He leaves.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: What did he want?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

scene_heading: INT. BOOK-SHOP - CAMDEN - CONTINUOUS.
text: A frumpy middle-aged woman in reception nods at him, but he
text: ignores her and plunges down the back stairs to a small
dialog: basement.
dialog: Standard lamps, photographs, the smell of glue...a forgers
text: paradise. On a stool, MAX CAMPBELL; chain-smoking, fifties,
text: half-German, half-Irish. He looks over his half-rimmed
dialog: glasses.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

text: CAMPBELL rolls his eyes. Kids. MCILLHATTON tips the stolen

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Good lookin’ bird. Who is she?
speaker_heading: MCILLHATTON
dialog: You don’t need to know.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

dialog: Two days. And make sure you have
dialog: the cash. You can remind our
dialog: Gerry I’m not a bloody charity.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’s HOME - EARLY MORNING.
text: COLLETTE lies awake. MARK is snuggled up beside her, fast
text: asleep. All is quiet.
text: There’s a distant rumble, then...
scene_heading: CRASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S STREET - A SPLIT SECOND LATER
text: The dawn calm is broken as a convoy of armored Land Rovers

text: MAC is behind them. He hangs back as the uniforms
text: sledgehammer COLLETTE’s front door.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS.
text: The UNIFORMS’ P.O.V. as they charge upstairs. Screams and
text: shouts from neighbors outside. A helicopter overhead.
text: COLLETTE is on the landing, dressed only in a T-shirt and
text: knickers.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (shaken, angry)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
dialog: Get dressed, Miss McVeigh. You're
dialog: under arrest on suspicion of
dialog: attempted murder. You have the
dialog: right to remain silent, but
dialog: anything you do say may be taken
dialog: down and later used as evidence
dialog: against you.
dialog: 44,
text: ON MARK’s FACE as he emerges from the bedroom. He looks

text: gently back towards the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

text: MARK in her arms. He’s crying.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: It’s all right, love. I'll be
dialog: back before you know it.
dialog: But of course it’s not bloody all right. She’s got no idea
text: what her status is now and that fear is written all over
text: her face.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS.
dialog: Chaos. Quick cuts as:
text: Two officers pull a drawer from a desk.
text: Another sweeps his hand along a kitchen cabinet, tipping
text: everything onto the floor.
text: A fourth rips the back away from a television.
text: She's getting the full treatment.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - LANDING - CONTINUOUS.
text: COLLETTE steps out of the bedroom. She’s behind the officer

dialog: MA.
dialog: Leave her.
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
dialog: Get out of the way, Mrs. McVeigh.
dialog: MA.
dialog: We've had enough.
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
dialog: We've all had enough.
dialog: MA.
dialog: She’s a mother for God’s sake.
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
dialog: And I’m a father. But that won’t
dialog: stop you cutting me down.
text: They stare at each other a moment with worldy, weary eyes.
text: And then he roughly thrusts her aside. COLLETTE frees
text: herself from MARK and he begins to cry. He tries to follow
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Mammy !
text: MA scoops him up. He’s screaming now.
text: On COLLETTE’S FACE as she is forced down the stairs.

scene_heading: CRASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS.

scene_heading: CRASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - SECONDS LATER.
text: MARK still trying to run after his mother. He’s hysterical.
text: MA tries to calm him.
scene_heading: CRASH CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. CASTLEREAGH HOLDING CENTRE - DAY
text: COLLETTE is dragged down a corridor. Detainees’ clothes
text: (concealed by a cloth sack) hang on a peg outside each
dialog: door. We hear;
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m Richard McIlwaine,

speaker_heading: COLLETTE

scene_heading: INT. CASTLEREAGH HOLDING CENTRE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

dialog: Waits.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Where were you?
dialog: No answer.
text: MAC thumps the table so hard she jumps.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I was looking after my son! I...I
dialog: couldn’t get away!
text: He leans towards her, hands on the desk.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s what happened!
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I save you from a lifetime ina
dialog: stinking prison cell. And you’re
dialog: going to sit here and tell me you
dialog: didn’t turn up because you
dialog: couldn't find a fucking nanny!
text: She's shocked. His anger is un-nerving.
text: He sits.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You have one minute to give me
dialog: something or you’re down that
text: corridor looking at a charge
dialog: sheet.
text: A beat.
text: She nods. She gets it; she’s really screwed up.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Have you seen your brothers?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What does Gerry think of the

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Not much.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What’s he going to do about it?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I...I don’t know. Really, I--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: He was round at your house
dialog: yesterday afternoon, just after
dialog: the document was signed. It was
dialog: all over the TV news. What did he
dialog: say?
text: She stares at the table top.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: You said they wouldn’t be
dialog: hurt...you promised that.
text: Brushes her hand nervously across it now.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: CID.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What time?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I've got it.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (steely)
dialog: Again.
text: COLLETTE gazes out of the window.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I was questioned by a detective
dialog: and by a man from London who
dialog: called himself Mr...Jenkins. I
dialog: thought...I assumed he was MI5.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What did he ask you?
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: He wanted to know why I had been
dialog: away from Belfast last week.
dialog: Where was I? What was I doing?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Did he know you were in England?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
text: Suspected...constant questions.
dialog: Wasn’t I here? Didn’t I do this?
dialog: But no evidence.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Mulgrew’s a cunning piece of

dialog: right away. So be ready.
text: They wait.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s time to go.
text: She continues to gaze out at the black night. She doesn’t

speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You lay an ambush and there’1ll be

scene_heading: SENIOR STAFF OFFICER 1

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

scene_heading: INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - IN A CORRIDOR - A FEW MINUTES
speaker_heading: LATER.

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: That’s not true and you know it.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sitting there because I’m

scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER.

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No thanks.

speaker_heading: MULGREW.

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: What if I told you that’s not the

text: She holds his gaze.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Then I'd say you're lying. My

speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: (with cold, hard eyes)
dialog: See, Collette, it’s like this;
dialog: only two men knew the time and

dialog: been squealing to the Brits? Is
dialog: it his shaggy-haired brother?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MULGREW. (CONT'D)
dialog: Or did one of them blab his fat

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (blushing)
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: We lose you in London, but then
dialog: you come home like nothin’ ever

dialog: your Ma’s door and haul you into
dialog: Castlereagh. But you’re out again
dialog: by teatime, like nothin’ ever
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: They knew I’d been away.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: There was an Englishman and--
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: What was his name?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Jenkins.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: MI5?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I guess...yeah.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: What did he want?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Where was I? What had I been

speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: That I'd been staying with an

speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Without your son?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: MULGREW.

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Which one asked about London?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

dialog: It’s a trick he’s used before.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Who's Mac?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (trying hard to retain
dialog: her composure)
dialog: The one...the English guy.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: You said his name was Jenkins.
text: She hesitates. Trying to keep the panic from her face now.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Mac Jenkins.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: You’se were friendly then? First

scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL VICTORIA HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: COLLETTE arrives on the pavement opposite, soaked, just as

scene_heading: INT. MAC’S CAR - A MINUTE LATER.

text: into the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Jesus!
text: He pushes her head roughly down, so she is out of view, and
text: accelerates away.
text: He takes a roundabout at sixty. Roars up the hill out of

text: track, she PUNCHES him. Smack into the face. Hard.
text: He raises an arm for protection, slams on the brakes, skids
text: to a halt.
text: She’s going at him now, punching, scratching...
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: For God's sake!
text: He takes hold of both her arms.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I gave you what you asked for.
dialog: You said no one would be hurt!

speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I have to get out of here.

speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: We need to go home and pick up my

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Calm down, Collette.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: What do you mean calm down?
text: Mulgrew knows. He’s red-lighted
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: He tricked me. I got mixed up. I
dialog: said I’d been interrogated by a
dialog: man called Jenkins, but then I
dialog: used your name.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Mac?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Yes. I told him it was a

speaker_heading: MAC
text: (watching rivulets of

dialog: It’s his job to make you think he

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (desolate)
dialog: I said that you’d use me and
dialog: then...(clicks her fingers). You
dialog: promised me that wasn’t true.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: And it isn’t. You made a small
dialog: mistake. You'll say that I
dialog: introduced myself as Mr Jenkins,
dialog: but I was with a colleague who
dialog: referred to me consistently as
dialog: Mac.
text: She thinks about this.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember who you are. Remember
dialog: where you’ve come from and what
dialog: you've done. One mistake doesn’t
dialog: make you a tout.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Did you kill him?
text: She gestures over her shoulder to indicate she means
text: Baseball Cap back in the hospital.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Did you go in there and kill him?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: You were going to?
text: A beat. Of course not, but no harm in having her think he
dialog: might have done.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I’m here for you. Day and night.
dialog: Waiting. Watching. If I think
dialog: you're at risk, we'll take you
dialog: out.
text: A long silence.

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF

speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF

speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Which one?

scene_heading: EXT. MILLTOWN CEMETERY - DAY

scene_heading: MCVEIGH, BELOVED SON, MURDERED BY CROWN FORCES
dialog: 
text: MA places one of the bunches in the vase and slips the

scene_heading: EXT. FALLS ROAD - DAY
text: A group of men in black leather jackets, white shirts,

text: COLLETTE stand either side of him. But we can pick out MA
dialog: too.
dialog: This is the community the IRA wants to believe it
dialog: represents.
dialog: 73.
text: Cops dressed in riot gear pack the street. A helicopter
text: hovers above. A shot from its MONITOR reveals the cops
text: fanning out into dozens of surrounding alleys. It looks
text: like a siege. In a sense, it is.
text: BASEBALL CAP’s family stand by the doorway waiting for the
text: procession to begin. They look tense. They wouldn’t have
text: chosen an IRA ‘military’ funeral.
text: As the coffin emerges, draped in an Irish flag, a police
text: COMMANDER approaches GERRY, who is clearly the ranking IRA
text: man present. He raises his wooden baton.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: We agreed there’d be none of
dialog: this.
text: GERRY ignores him, nods for the pallbearers to continue.
text: The officer raises his stick again.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER (CONT’D)
dialog: No paramilitary displays. You’re
dialog: not going to bury this man as a
dialog: soldier, McVeigh. Not on my
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: There is no display.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: That’s a colour party.
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: It’s a few grieving men.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: Split them up and have others
dialog: carry it, or this is going
dialog: nowhere.
text: GERRY stares at the man. He oozes a visceral, tribal
dialog: hatred, like those around him.
text: But a confrontation would upset the family. Reluctantly, he
text: nods to the men to indicate he concedes.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - A FEW MINUTES LATER.
text: The coffin has reached the church, but there is no respite.
text: GERRY MCVEIGH sits close to the front of the mourners with
text: COLLETTE and PADDY still beside him.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (from the pulpit)
dialog: Whatever message we may wish to
dialog: give to the massed ranks of the
dialog: crown forces who besiege this
dialog: church today, whatever hatred we
dialog: may tell ourselves it is our
dialog: right to harbour in our hearts, I
dialog: must say this to the paramilitary
dialog: leaders; why did you send this
dialog: young man to his death?
text: On GERRY as he tries to retain his composure.
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT'D)
dialog: After so many years of
dialog: bitterness, what do you hope to
dialog: achieve with this daily litany of
dialog: death? Peace, as Yeats once told
dialog: us, may come dropping slow, but
dialog: come it must...
text: On MA. The priest reflects her sentiments exactly.
text: Back to GERRY, who really can’t stand to listen to much
dialog: more of this.
scene_heading: EXT. FALLS ROAD - DAY
text: The procession is shuffling along, surrounded by police
text: officers in riot gear.
text: It’s tense, but peaceful.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: MAC is standing by a car the other side of the police from
text: the mourners. He’s in a baseball cap and tinted glasses,
text: his collar turned up against the cold. He’s almost
text: unrecognisable.
text: He brings up his camera. THROUGH THE LENS as he fires off
text: some shots; Gerry, Paddy, -- and then a series of IRA man
text: who have filtered into the crowd, including the CHIEF.
dialog: Snap. Snap...
dialog: Boom!
text: Chaos -- shouts -- people cowering -- screaming. What the
dialog: fuck is happening?
dialog: Boom!
dialog: 75.
text: SPIN AROUND. In the side street where MAC is standing --
text: barely fifty yards behind him -- a couple of guys in
text: balaclavas are throwing home-made pipe bombs over the top
text: of the cops and into the crowd. They’re shouting; up the
dialog: UFF! Up the UFF!
text: Loyalists. Protestant paramilitaries from the other side of
text: the wall. Men who claim to be fighting a covert war to
dialog: protect the integrity of the British state against the IRA,
dialog: which would like this territory to be reunited with the
dialog: rest of Ireland.
scene_heading: EXT. FALLS ROAD - CONTINUOUS
text: ON GERRY, at the heart of the mourners.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Loyalists! Get down!
text: He is still on his feet as everyone drops to the ground
text: around him. PADDY and COLLETTE stay with him. They’re
dialog: soldiers...
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS.
text: Cops dressed in riot gear turn away from the IRA mourners
text: to face the loyalist thugs in the street behind them. They
text: begin to charge towards the men, until one opens up with a
text: MACHINE GUN. Now everyone hits the deck, except...
text: MAC. He is closest to the thugs, half-hidden behind a car.
text: ON HIM as he pulls out his Browning revolver.
dialog: Shouldn't be doing this. Not his gig.
text: He stands, aims, fires -- misses.
text: One of the thugs has seen him, swings around...
text: MAC doesn’t flinch. He steps into the road, takes aim
text: again. Blam, blam, blam -- and the guy goes down.
text: The other two thugs are still shouting. As one of them goes
text: to throw a pipe bomb, MAC CUTS HIM DOWN.
text: One left. He hasn’t got a gun. He’s thrown his bombs.
text: MAC closes in.
text: The guy raises his hands.
text: The cops have woken up and are advancing behind MAC, but
text: some of the IRA men have slipped through the lines. They
text: CHARGE towards the loyalist thug. Suddenly it’s a race to
dialog: see who can get there first.
dialog: 76.
text: MAC wins, grabs him, turns his gun on the would-be lynch
dialog: mob.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Get back!
text: They keep coming. Slowly. With menace. The cops are trying
dialog: to push them away, but they want this guy bad. Voices. You
dialog: lookin' after your Proddy friends? Bastards!
text: A couple of the men lunge closer.
text: MAC fires in the air. The men recoil for a moment, but it’s
text: complete chaos. The crowd is SWELLING. The cops are trying
text: to BEAT THEM BACK.
text: The cops REACH THE MAN, take him off MAC and try to get him
text: out. There is pushing, shoving, shouting. MAC loses his
dialog: hat...
text: .-.as he finds himself opposite COLLETTE.
text: She stares at him.
text: And at that moment, she sees that MULGREW is watching
dialog: her...
scene_heading: INT. CONNOLLY HOUSE - A REPUBLICAN ‘COMMUNITY CENTRE’ - AN
scene_heading: HOUR LATER.
dialog: A gathering of anyone who is anyone in the IRA. They’re
text: still pumped up by the events outside.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Are you out of your mind? Did you
dialog: see what just happened?
text: PADDY and COLLETTE flank him. The CHIEF OF STAFF is on his
text: feet on a stage. He looks rattled.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: We're all angry, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Not angry enough!
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: They're trying to rattle us ‘cos
dialog: they know we’re winning. If we
dialog: move now, if we’re bold, we can
dialog: isolate the Brits once and for
dialog: all.
text: ANGLE on an IRA hardliner called FOX. He’s another farmer;
text: head of the East Tyrone Brigade.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (from the front row)
dialog: How's that, Seamus?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: We've got Dublin on board.
text: Washington stands ready. But they
dialog: need somethin’ from us.
text: A moment’s silence. The audience is simmering with rage,
text: but there are thoughtful faces too.
text: The men around GERRY await his intervention. No doubt he’s
dialog: the rebel leader.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: (slowly, like this is
dialog: hard to credit)
dialog: You want a ceasefire now?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: We're not there yet, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: But that’s what you want?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: We have to test out--
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What’s on the table?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: The Brits are talkin’ about a
dialog: serious response to any gesture
dialog: we--
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: What’s on the table is the square
dialog: route of fuck all, so it is.
dialog: What’s on the table is a document
dialog: of surrender.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Gerry, it’s a different way. We
dialog: know that. But the cutting edge
dialog: of the IRA’s sword is always
dialog: going to be there, always ready.
text: FOX and GERRY catch each other’s eye.
text: There are murmurs of dissent. Someone mutters ‘Sell out’.
text: We find COLLETTE as she slips away...
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER.
text: Snow is falling and Christmas decorations are much in
text: evidence as COLLETTE walks home.
text: A voice behind her.
speaker_heading: MULGREW (0.S.)
dialog: You runnin’ away Collette?
text: She spins around.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Christ! Kevin...you gave me a
dialog: shock.
text: ANGLE on his red trainers. They’re spotlessly clean again.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: You know the guy?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
text: The Brit in the crowd. The one
dialog: who shot our friends back there.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No.
text: He waits, menacingly calm.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: (finding strength in her
dialog: terror)
dialog: If you don’t mind me saying,
dialog: Kevin, I think you’re getting a
dialog: little paranoid.
text: A beat.
text: His eyes on her. She doesn’t flinch.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: Happy Christmas, Collette. I hope

speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: (terse)

speaker_heading: MCILLHATTON
dialog: I've got everything ready. I've

text: She cuts the connection.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERSONSTOWN TRAVEL AGENT - BELFAST - NIGHT
text: The GIRL at the other end of the phone is locking up. She’s
text: young and attractive. She can hear the phone ringing again,
text: but doesn’t go back for it. With a start, she notices GERRY
text: leaning against the wall behind her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You gave me a shock.
dialog: But it’s clearly a pleasant one.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - IRA SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: GERRY and the GIRL fuck vigorously. Afterwards, in the

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Wolf Tone called again. He’s
dialog: always calling. He says
dialog: everything’s ready. He keeps
dialog: asking me; ‘when?’
text: GERRY gets up, still buck naked. He lights a cigarette,
text: pulls back the edge of the curtain and looks out.
speaker_heading: GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: You never relax, Gerry, you know
dialog: that? Not even when you're doing
dialog: it to me.
text: He looks at her like she’s from a different planet.
text: And glances out of the window again...
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. MAC’S HOME IN ENGLAND - CHRISTMAS EVE
text: A light dusting of snow on the drive of a suburban home. A
text: taxi pulls up and MAC gets out. He pays the driver and
text: approaches the house.
text: The lights are on in the living room window. His WIFE and
dialog: daughter LUCY are wrapping presents by the tree. We can
text: hear a Christmas carol; ‘As shepherds watched their flocks
dialog: by night...’
text: MAC manages a world-weary smile. Complicated as it may be,
dialog: it’s good to be home.
text: He’s about to move to the front door when another man
text: appears in the living room. He’s carrying a glass of
text: champagne for MAC’s wife and she is SMILING AT HIM.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MAC.
dialog: The price he’s paid...
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
text: It’s Christmas day in the MCVEIGH HOUSEHOLD. COLLETTE is

text: ANGLE on a newspaper folded on the side. EXCLUSIVE; IRA
text: HARDLINERS REJECT PEACE BID.
text: The rest of the family are watching T.V. next door and, as
dialog: the Queen’s annual broadcast, comes on we hear;
speaker_heading: GERRY (0.S.)
dialog: Switch the stupid cow off!
text: The T.V is turned over. MA glances at the washing up still
text: to be done and smiles at COLLETTE
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: I blame myself. Your father never
dialog: lifted a finger either.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Shame Christy’s got a bad back

text: MA smiles.

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: (without much
dialog: conviction)
dialog: I'll get it.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: You're all right love. You relax
dialog: there.
text: Nobody appears to detect the note of irony. MA shakes her
dialog: head.
text: GERRY’s son LIAM has been driving a remote controlled car
text: around the floor and at this moment he’s so excited he
text: knocks over the table GERRY’s glass of beer has been
text: standing on. GERRY leaps to his feet, soaked.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: For Fuck’s sake! What is wrong
dialog: with you?
text: LIAM is stunned. He was so happy for a moment there. He
text: bursts out of the room and charges up the stairs.
text: CHRISTY throws GERRY a furious look and follows.
text: GERRY sets about clumsily cleaning up the mess, but MA
text: pushes him aside. He storms out...
scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S BACK YARD - A MINUTE LATER.
text: GERRY and MA stand together. It’s snowing. GERRY is smoking

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Don’t start, Ma. Not today.
text: She watches him.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'd like you to let Collette go.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s her call. Always has been.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: It used to be. But she’s changed.
dialog: Now she only stays in out of
dialog: respect for you.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You mean you’ve made her change.
dialog: Isn’t that what you want for all
dialog: of us?
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Look what it’s doing to you,
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We've been over this. You want to
dialog: have the same conversation every
dialog: Christmas till we’re dead?
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: Another year. Then another. Is
dialog: that all we can hope for?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: If we give up now, it will all
dialog: have been for nothing. Is that
dialog: what you want?
speaker_heading: MA
dialog: I only know I don’t want this.
dialog: Not any more.
text: GERRY closes his eyes. They’re all quitters. Every last one
dialog: of them.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - A BEDROOM UPSTAIRS - A FEW MINUTES
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: CHRISTY and LIAM on the bed, both with tear-stained eyes.

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I’m sorry.

dialog: happiness or sorrow it’s hard to tell.
scene_heading: INT. MI5’S BELFAST HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: MAC is sitting at a computer. We see him pull up a SEARCH

dialog: Passcode;

text: He’s confused...
scene_heading: EXT. FLETCHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MAC rings the doorbell. It’s Christmas and FLETCHER’s
text: husband answers. He’s wearing a stupid hat and looks at MAC
text: with studied disinterest. He knows why he’s here. KATE
text: emerges from the kitchen. She’s removing her apron.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Who is it, John?
text: She sees.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mac. Are you okay?
text: He nods. She shoves the apron into her husband's hand.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come in.
text: The husband retreats in orderly silence. A small boy
text: appears in the doorway of the kitchen. He’s about the same
text: age as Collette’s son.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Mummy, the mince pies are--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
text: In a minute, Louie.
text: She shoos him back into the kitchen and closes the door.
text: MAC can’t help noticing that he goes happily.
dialog: She’s got it all, this one; husband, kids, job.
dialog: Suddenly, he understands. What she said the other day was
dialog: bang on the money. And the contrast with his own life is
dialog: painful.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER’S HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS.
text: The pair sit in deep arm chairs in front of a roaring fire.
text: She roots around in her husband’s drinks cupboard and holds

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Come on. It’s Christmas.
text: He shakes his head. Like she ever drinks whisky.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: If I’d known you were on your
dialog: own, I'd have invited you to join
dialog: us.
dialog: No she wouldn't.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shoot, Mac.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Why have you locked the Henderson
dialog: file?
text: KATE shrugs, like she doesn’t know what MAC is talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Maybe it was London.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: My Dad had an old saying; if it
text: looks like a dog and barks like a
dialog: dog, it’s a fucking dog.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (half smiling, but still
dialog: as cool as you like)
dialog: That’s a new one on me, Mac.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Barry Delavine works the same
dialog: side of the street. So if you
dialog: were pumping his hand, it must
dialog: have been because he had another
text: angle on Henderson. Another angle
dialog: means another tout.
text: KATE FLETCHER looks at him. She really doesn’t want to go
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Collette McVeigh was your idea.
dialog: So I’m asking myself; why?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Mac--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I spend eight months reeling her
dialog: in and you’re prepared to burn
dialog: her on day one. Why?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Mac, please, I--
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I’1l tell you why; because you
dialog: already have another agent in
text: place. Someone close to her;
dialog: bigger, better. Mulgrew and his
text: friends started sniffing around,
dialog: so you needed someone you could
dialog: feed them if they get too close.
text: She's grim-faced now.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I’ve known worse results, Mac.
text: He stares at her. He can’t quite believe he heard that.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s a good agent, but not a
dialog: great one. Sometimes, we have to
dialog: choose.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You cannot--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: We can. And I do. That’s my job.
dialog: There are no easy choices. This
dialog: is a war. And we have to win it.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: You think we can win anything if
dialog: we're that cynical?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Do you think we can win if we’re
dialog: not?
dialog: Boy, two different styles.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: There are no winners here, Kate.
dialog: There never have been. And there
dialog: never will be.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: They chose this life, Mac. Let’s
dialog: not forget that.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Even you can’t believe it’s that
dialog: simple.

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S BEDROOM - A MINUTE LATER.
text: She climbs into bed in the darkness and stares at the

text: TERROR in her eyes again.
text: She gets up, goes into the roof, takes out the emergency

speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Leave my sister out of this.

dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: As I said, Kevin thinks--
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Fuck what he thinks!
text: GERRY looks at MULGREW with barely concealed contempt.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: That’s not possible any more,
dialog: Gerry. I’ve spoken to the
dialog: council. Nobody is against this.
text: GERRY bites his lip, but smoulders with resentment.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Kevin has a hunch that something
dialog: may have happened to your sister
dialog: in London. But given the stakes,
dialog: I think we’ve got to go on more
dialog: than hunches. Only you and your
dialog: brother knew the full details of
dialog: the Henderson operation, right?
text: GERRY gives a barely perceptible nod.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Then that’s where we should
dialog: start. Say: guns into Hugo Street
dialog: the day after tomorrow. You tell
dialog: Paddy, but no one else. If the
text: cops are waiting, it must be him.
text: He’s in the clear, we move on to
dialog: your sister...
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)
dialog: You got that, Gerry?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)
dialog: If you don’t co-operate, you’ll

text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you agree?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: (through gritted teeth)
dialog: You're wasting your fucking--

speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It's sedition. You’ll get no

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s not support I want. I need

dialog: when it’s done.
text: FOX glances at COLLETTE, starts walking. GERRY falls in

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You've got balls, McVeigh. I‘1l

dialog: Thinks about the proposition.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘ll keep it to myself. You'll
dialog: have that much chance, if you've
dialog: the guts to go through with it.

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Can’t you take him with you? I--
dialog: MA.
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
text: Just into town.
dialog: MA.
dialog: (steely)
text: Then going ‘just into town’ can
dialog: wait.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (getting desperate)
dialog: No it can’t Ma. Please...I have
dialog: to go.
text: She opens the door. Ma blocks her exit.
dialog: MA.
dialog: What are you going to do in town,
dialog: Collette?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Ma, please...
dialog: MA.
dialog: No one has to go into town. No
dialog: one ever has.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (close to tears now)
dialog: Don’t do this. Not now.
text: She pulls the door open and has to more or less force her
dialog: way out.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLETTE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS.
text: She looks back. Her mother is standing in the doorway,
dialog: watching.
scene_heading: INT. MAC’S CAR - CENTRAL BELFAST - DAY.
text: COLLETTE gets into the backseat, beside MAC.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You're late.
text: The DRIVER accelerates away. COLLETTE puts her head in her
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I have to go.
text: MAC glances over his shoulder to scope the road behind.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: I’ve made it here. You can see
dialog: me. I need to get home.
speaker_heading: MAC
text: In a minute.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: My mother is raging. I have to--
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Collette--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: He’s watching me...Mulgrew.
text: He waits.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: He was in the alley last night.
text: Standing there. Staring.
dialog: Please...stop the car.
text: They pull up at a set of lights and COLLETTE dashes out.
text: MAC follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - CONTINUOUS.
text: Ten swift paces and he catches up. They’ve reached a patch
text: of abandoned industrial wasteland.
speaker_heading: MAC
text: This is unprofessional.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: You're the professional. I’m just
text: a dead girl walking.
text: He pulls her towards an alley, where they are out of sight.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I have to get home!
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: We had a report in from East
dialog: Tyrone that you and Gerry were
dialog: seen at Fox’s house. He’s got his
dialog: own man in London--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I don’t know about that!
text: She shakes herself free, but he catches her. He forces her
text: roughly into an abandoned factory; cavernous, spooky and
dialog: damp.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You were with him at Fox’s place.
dialog: Don’t tell me they were
text: discussing the weather.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: You've a job to do, Collette.
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: My job is to end up ina
text: ditch...barefoot, hooded and
dialog: dead. You know it and so do I!
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (steely)
dialog: We've been over this. It’s not
dialog: going to end like--
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: How do you know? How can you
dialog: possibly know?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What was Gerry doing with Fox?
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Collette, we’re under pressure
dialog: here. You’ve got to give me more
dialog: than this.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Or what?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Or this isn’t going to fucking
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I don’t know what they talked
dialog: about. He said he needed my help
dialog: for something.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: He didn’t say.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: In London?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: He didn’t tell me anything.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: But he wants you to go with him?
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Yes. He said he doesn’t trust
dialog: anyone else.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What about Paddy?
text: She shrugs.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: And you said you would?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: You have to go with him,
dialog: Collette.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I can’t leave my son again.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: There’s no choice. You gave up
dialog: the right to...
text: She suddenly breaks free again, runs up a set of stairs and
text: all the way along the first floor. He catches her by a
text: broken window, which affords a panoramic view of the city.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: (quietly -- she’s
dialog: totally petrified now)
dialog: I'm dead. That’s the choice I
dialog: made.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: No, you’re not. Stay close to
dialog: Gerry and see this through and
dialog: you're out. I give you my word.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: It won’t happen. It’1ll never end
dialog: like that.
dialog: (sighs, shakes her head)
dialog: Where would I even go?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Anywhere you want.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: This is my home.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Collette, there’s a better life
dialog: out there.
dialog: 95.
text: He takes hold of her arm.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Believe me.
text: She stares at him.
text: Seismic tension now.
dialog: She wants to believe him. My God, this minute, she wants it
dialog: more than anything in the world...
text: He still has a hold of her wrist. She drifts closer, her
text: face only inches from his.
text: She finds his hand...
text: Touching.
text: Linked fingers.
text: Locked. Tight.
text: They kiss. Suppressed passion explodes and they’re all over
text: each other. Against the wall. He lifts her coat, her dress.
text: Fumbling. Groping. Hushed, urgent, crazy...
text: He’s almost in her.
text: He staggers back.
text: She stands, clothes dishevelled.
dialog: Madness...
text: He raises his hands.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry...
scene_heading: INT. MAC’S CAR - MINUTES LATER.
text: MAC gets in. Through the windscreen, we can see COLLETTE
text: walking away up the road.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Sir, are you...
text: The look on MAC’s face tells him to shut the hell up. He
text: accelerates away past COLLETTE. She does not raise her
dialog: head.
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - AN HOUR LATER.
text: COLLETTE is in the hall. She takes off her coat, unwinds
text: her scarf, closes her eyes and leans against the wall.
text: She hears voices. The door to the yard must be open. GERRY
text: and PADDY sit on the steps with their backs to her. MA is
text: at a garden table playing with MARK.
text: COLLETTE approaches, then checks herself. They are having
text: an argument.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I don’t want Sandy to do it, I
dialog: want you.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: What difference does it make?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s a big shipment and we need
dialog: to make sure it comes in okay.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: Tomorrow, before dawn.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: The safe house in Hugo Street.
dialog: You'll need to split it up quick.
text: COLLETTE watches her mother playing with MARK for a moment,
text: then pulls back into the shadows.
scene_heading: INT - TELEPHONE BOX NEAR COLLETTE’S HOME - NIGHT
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Box Man.
text: She waits.
speaker_heading: MAC (0.S.)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: It’s me.
speaker_heading: MAC (0.S.)
dialog: (business-like)
dialog: How can I help?
dialog: 97.
dialog: She waits. What did she expect?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I’m sorry about...
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I understand. It’s fine.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What do you need, Shadow Dancer?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
text: There are some guns coming into
dialog: Hugo Street. I overheard.
speaker_heading: MAC (0.S.)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Tomorrow before dawn. But you’ll
dialog: be careful? I--
speaker_heading: MAC (0.S.)
dialog: We'll take care of it. You know
dialog: what the guns are to be used for?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MAC (0.S.)
dialog: Do you have any more on your
dialog: brother’s plans?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: No...not yet. I know what I have
dialog: to do and...I’1l do it.
text: He severs the connection.
text: COLLETTE replaces the receiver slowly.
scene_heading: INT. MI5’S BELFAST HEADQUARTERS - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT.
text: MAC and FLETCHER pour over a city MAP.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: If we cut off the roads into Hugo
dialog: Street, we'll have to cover
dialog: ourselves with checkpoints all
text: the way down the Falls.
text: Another officer comes to the door to interrupt. It is one
text: of the men MAC saw being congratulated by FLETCHER the
text: other day. He’s in a hurry.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: DELAVINE
dialog: Ma’am...
text: He checks himself.
speaker_heading: DELAVINE (CONT'D)
dialog: We have a report in. Some guns
dialog: into Hugo Street tomorrow
text: morning, before dawn. Looks like
dialog: it could be a big shipment.
text: FLETCHER looks shifty. These two sources sure are close to
dialog: each other...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: We're aware of it, Barry. Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S HOME - NIGHT.
text: COLLETTE is reading MARK a story: The Jungle Book.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: ‘'Thou wilt not forget thou art a

dialog: anxiously. ‘Never,’ said Mowgli,
dialog: ‘I will always remember that I

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Does Mowgli prefer to be with the
dialog: wolves or the humans?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: I’m not sure, love. I think he
text: feels his loyalties are divided.
dialog: It’s very difficult for him.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But where is he happiest?
text: She closes the book.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: You'll just have to wait and see.
text: MARK wraps his arm around her waist and snuggles against

scene_heading: INT. CAR - BELFAST - JUST BEFORE DAWN
text: Two youths chewing gum, listening to music on the radio as

dialog: 99.
text: DRIVER'S P.O.V. as they round a corner and spot a police

speaker_heading: OLDER YOUTH

scene_heading: CRASH CUT TO:

scene_heading: CRASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OVERLOOKING HUGO STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: GERRY McVEIGH watches. He sees the driver get out and open

text: His brother is a tout.
scene_heading: EXT. PADDY MCVEIGH’S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER.

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: You’1l need to come with us,
dialog: Volunteer McVeigh.
speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Don’t tell me: I’ve won a free

text: MULGREW pulls out his pistol and points it at PADDY’S head.
speaker_heading: MULGREW.
dialog: McVeigh, you are under arrest on
dialog: suspicion of being an informer
dialog: for the crown forces. If you try
dialog: anything stupid, I’1l spread your

text: He takes hold of PADDY, who is naked but for a pair of

text: NEW ANGLE: through a window, we catch GERRY sitting in a

scene_heading: CLOSE ON COLLETTE MCVEIGH - A FEW MINUTES LATER

scene_heading: INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

dialog: MA.
dialog: Don’t. He’s dead to us. He has no
dialog: feeling left.
dialog: 102.
text: COLLETTE is too dazed to respond.
speaker_heading: MA. (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s using you.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Please, Ma.
dialog: MA.
dialog: I can see how he bullies you,
dialog: Collette. It wasn’t your fault...
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: That’s not what it’s about Mam...
text: Now they’re grappling with each other. Collette cups her
text: mother’s cheeks.
text: A desperate half-embrace and then she rips herself free.
text: MA stands at the top of the stairs, tears in her eyes.
text: She sits down on the steps and begins to sob
text: uncontrollably.
scene_heading: INT. COLLETTE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

speaker_heading: MULGREW.

scene_heading: INT. DUBLIN AIRPORT - DAY
text: COLLETTE and GERRY walk through security. On the tannoy:
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: This is the final call for Aer

text: COLLETTE looks highly agitated. She points towards the

text: She walks to a telephone box, takes out a couple of coins

dialog: Waits.

speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Have we got ‘em?

speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER

speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER (CONT'D)

text: More CCTV footage.
speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER (CONT'D)
text: Gerry is standing right under the
dialog: camera. He wanted us to clock

dialog: metro station.
text: Pictures of the two of them leaving Les Halles.
speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER (CONT'D)
text: They walked off in the direction
dialog: of Ile de la Cite. The French

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You think Paris is the

text: The man shrugs.
speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: EXT. CAFE IN PARIS - EVENING

text: Gerry glances at them.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: You ever think about a different

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: All the time.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Will you do anything about it?
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: One day. But no one ever used to

text: She contemplates this. It’s undeniably true.
speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: COLLETTE

speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER
dialog: The British Embassy. We've
dialog: discussed that.
text: Moves on.
speaker_heading: MI5 OPS OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: We think the residence is a

dialog: a distant cousin of the Queen and
dialog: the house itself is more--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (straightening)
dialog: It’s not Paris.
text: They all look at him, including FLETCHER.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Gerry McVeigh wants something big
dialog: enough to derail the process.
dialog: That ain’t the British ambassador
dialog: or any other target in Paris.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: He needs scale or scope. Scale;
dialog: maybe a military barracks. He
dialog: could drive to one of the
text: Rhineland bases in a night.
dialog: Scope; we should run a check on
dialog: all the grade one targets and
dialog: their movements over the next 24
dialog: hours; the Queen, Prime Minister,
dialog: Charles. We know Gerry’s had his
dialog: own man in London. Stands to
dialog: reason this is why.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: But we've got every exit covered.
dialog: If they move out of Paris, we’ll

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Depends how good he is.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS HOTEL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Where are you going, Collette?
speaker_heading: COLLETTE
dialog: Oh...I can’t sleep. I just wanted
