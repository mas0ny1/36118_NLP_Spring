speaker_heading: SOLNESS:
dialog: The funny thing is that I've become so disturbed by younger
dialog: people!
speaker_heading: HILDE:
dialog: What? Younger people?
speaker_heading: SOLNESS:
dialog: Yes, they upset me so much that I've sort of closed my doors here
dialog: and locked myself in. Because I'm afraid they're going to come
dialog: here, and they're going to knock on the door, and then they're
text: going to break in.
speaker_heading: HILDE:
dialog: Well, I think maybe you should open the door and let them in.
speaker_heading: SOLNESS:
dialog: Open the door?
speaker_heading: HILDE:
dialog: Yes - so that they can just gently and quietly come inside, and it
dialog: can be something good for you. . .
speaker_heading: SOLNESS:
dialog: Open the door?

scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER/MARINA APT. - LIVING ROOM, BROOKLYN. DAY 1
text: CLOSE on Cornelia Srebnick, 41. She’s humming softly. We
text: MOVE out slowly to see she’s rocking the infant on a big
text: comfortable couch fionlled with baby blankets, stuffed
dialog: animals and children’s books.
text: We MOVE over to see Josh Srebnick, 44, on the floor watching
text: her -- his expression a kind of awe. She looks at him,
text: hesitating, taken by the intensity of his look. A moment of
text: connection and warmth passes through her.
text: He smiles softly back.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: (to the baby)
dialog: There were three little pigs and they
dialog: made a house out of twigs and the
dialog: wolf came and...
dialog: (to Josh)
dialog: Do you remember how it goes?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He blows it down?
text: The baby starts to fuss.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Yeah. But, what happens in the
dialog: middle?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (thinks )
dialog: I keep wanting to do this little
dialog: piggie went to market but that’s with
dialog: the toes.
text: The baby starts to cry.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
text: The wolf keeps blowing the house in.
dialog: The pigs keep making different
dialog: houses.
dialog: (rocks the baby)
dialog: Oh...shh, shh, shh.
text: The baby is wailing. Cornelia rocks her faster. She looks
dialog: panicked.
dialog: Pink (09/30/2013) 2.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: What the fuck do we do?
text: Josh doesn't know. Bang, a door opens and a woman comes in
text: with a boppy strapped around her waist. This is Marina,
dialog: 30's.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Okay, who’s ready to eat?
speaker_heading: JOSH MARINA
dialog: Are we taking in or -- Who’s ready to eat?
text: She sits down on the couch next to Cornelia, lifts the
text: sobbing infant from out of Cornelia’s arms and places it on
text: the boppy. The baby’s onesie has an image from The Clash’s
text: first album across the chest. Marina opens her bra and gives
text: the baby her breast. The baby nurses, stretches and stops
dialog: crying.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Ha! I love how she stretches...it’s
dialog: just like we do... It’s so funny.
dialog: It never occurred to me that
dialog: stretching is innate.
text: She stretches, imitating the baby. Cornelia smiles politely.
text: A curly haired man with glasses, early 40's, enters. Fletcher.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You want to see it?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah.
text: Fletcher sits near Josh.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: It got infected with staph but it’s
dialog: not the bad staph.
text: He pushes up his sleeve to reveal a square black and white
text: tattoo on his bicep.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Guess.
dialog: (to Josh)
dialog: You can come closer it’s not the bad
dialog: staph.
text: He shoves

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: I still don’t want the baby touching
dialog: it.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
text: It’s Willow’s sonogram.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh...okay.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I did it for Marina. I was so
dialog: fucking proud of her.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Why it’s for me, I still don’t
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Where do you even go for a tattoo?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I asked a guy at work and he told me
dialog: where his kids went. Place in
dialog: Williamsburg. Where else?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know, she didn’t get the
dialog: epidurol.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: It’s a mother fucker -- it’s a ring
dialog: of fucking fire -- but it was the
dialog: most beautiful experience of my life.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: And I fell in love immediately. A
dialog: love I’ve never felt. I mean, don’t
dialog: take that the wrong way, Marina --
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: No, I know exactly what you mean.
dialog: It’s pure.

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: MARINA *
dialog: You’d make such good parents.

dialog: I’m sorry, I’m sorry!
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: No, it’s fine. You know, we --
text: She looks at Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH MARINA
dialog: We... It’s just such a game

text: We STAY on Josh and Cornelia’s faces.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (0.S.)

dialog: you.”
speaker_heading: MARINA (0.S.) *
dialog: It’s true, I recognized her
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (0.S.)
dialog: And because I'd been reading to her
dialog: in the womb, she knew my voice
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: MARINA (0.S.) FLETCHER (0.S.)
dialog: It’s like in one moment, I read her Stephen King’s The +

scene_heading: INT. JOSH AND CORNELIA’S APARTMENT. DAY 2
text: They enter. An open floor-through of a brownstone. The
text: room, separated by large wooden pocket doors, looks half-
text: finished, framed pictures lean against the wall, projects
text: undertaken and abandoned. Some nice stuff, a couple of
text: antique chairs or a table. A water stain untended to on the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I can’t remember Goldilocks either
dialog: anymore. The porridge part, but not
dialog: what happens.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: She gets eaten, right?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Does she?
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: There’s like an oven that’s too hot.
text: Josh shrugs. Silence.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: You don’t want kids, right?
dialog: (Josh hesitates)
dialog: Because I don’t.
dialog: (they both hesitate)
dialog: I’m sorry, I feel so guilty for
dialog: saying that. I mean, I did. If we'd
dialog: had the magic sexy version and one
dialog: day suddenly had a baby... But all
dialog: those drugs and shots and
dialog: miscarriages -- I don’t want to do it
dialog: again and it not to work.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I like our life as it is.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I don’t want things to be different
dialog: than they are right now.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I know. I mean, if we wanted to take
dialog: off for Paris tomorrow, we could.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, I mean I think it would be hard
dialog: to find an affordable fare on such
dialog: short notice, but yeah...
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: No, I know and I couldn’t leave work.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: If we were going to do it we should
dialog: plan it at least a month in advance.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
text: A month is still in the realm of
dialog: spontaneity.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, I know. I mean, the time we
dialog: spent in Rome, what was that --
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: 2006.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (can’t believe it)
dialog: It wasn’t 2006.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Yeah because I was working with my
text: dad on his dance film.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Rome was eight years ago already?
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Yeah, I looked at the pictures
dialog: recently and we’re two younger people
text: standing at the Treve Fountain.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We look similar.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: We look younger.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I tried to get you to go to Mexico
dialog: last summer --
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I needed to finish my documentary.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: But you didn’t finish it!
text: They both take a deep breath. Pause.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well, maybe the point is we have the

speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: Josh, in his boxers, takes off his watch and puts it on the

text: They move about in silence, finishing their nighttime
text: routines. Only the sounds of footsteps, water running,
text: clothes coming off and going on, bed squeaks.
text: Josh lies on his back and shuts his eyes.
text: Cornelia gets in bed and clicks on her bedside lamp which
text: lights up nearly everything. Josh places his arm over his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What is that, a seventy-five watt?
text: She looks under the shade.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
text: I can’t see, it’s too bright.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s too high a wattage.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I‘1l change it tomorrow.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH/CORNELIA APT. - HOME OFFICE. DAY 4
text: Josh paces back and forth in his home-office. His editor,
text: Tim, early 30’s, sits at a desk-top attached to a series of
text: drives. A tousled scholar, Ira Mandelstam, 50’s, talks
text: gravely on a TV screen.
speaker_heading: SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
dialog: There was a poll conducted in 1987 in
dialog: which people were given a series of
dialog: phrases and asked which ones could be
dialog: found in the US Constitution --
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Let me see the continuity...
speaker_heading: SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
dialog: One of the phrases that got the
dialog: highest percentage of votes was:
dialog: “From each according to his ability,
dialog: to each according to his need.”
dialog: This, of course, is not to be found
dialog: in the Constitution, but is the
dialog: famous Communist credo popularized by
dialog: Karl Marx.
text: Josh takes the sheet and holds it about two feet from his
text: face. He squints.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why do they type this stuff so small?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I think that’s 12 point. That’s
dialog: normal.
speaker_heading: SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN) JOSH
dialog: However, when this phrase was That is not 12, that’s at
dialog: presented to people as a most eight. Look at it, it’s
dialog: tenet of Communism, they, of tiny.
dialog: course, overwhelmingly
dialog: rejected it.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We need to cut away from Ira here
dialog: because...
text: We hear a ringing. On the SCREEN: the scholar goes into his
text: pants pocket and retrieves a cell phone from a few years ago.
speaker_heading: SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
dialog: Hold on...
text: He looks at it like he’s never seen anything like it before.
text: He puts on reading glasses and very deliberately presses
dialog: Talk.
speaker_heading: SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
dialog: Hello?...Evelyn, I’m doing an
dialog: interview...Did you look in the car?
dialog: This is every fucking day, sweety!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)
dialog: I keep telling you: put them on a
dialog: fucking chain around your neck!
dialog: (mouths to the camera)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (back to the phone)
dialog: Sweety, if you don’t stop this, I’m
dialog: going to fucking screa --
text: Tim freezes the image on the screen.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We could cut to me asking the
dialog: question about hermeneutics?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We could, but you look like this in
dialog: that footage --
text: He shows an image of a younger Josh in a goatee and Jew-fro.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It’s from eight years ago. And the
dialog: previous shot of you asking any
dialog: relevant questions is this --
text: He pulls up an image of Josh with short hair and his arm ina
dialog: sling.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That’s from when I fell down the
text: subway stairs at Grand Army Plaza.
dialog: The blizzard of 06? You remember how
dialog: icy that was?
dialog: We CUT between a series of Joshes from over the years.
text: Different hair lengths, a beard, a brief moustache, a black
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You remember, I was trying my part on
text: the other side.
text: Tim doesn't.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: God, eight years ago. Has it been
dialog: that long?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It’s been ten.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (counting in his head,
dialog: rationalizing)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Ten this fall. Nine and a half.
dialog: Look at my jaw -- I had more baby
dialog: fat.
text: (looks at his reflection
dialog: in the computer screen)
dialog: Are my eyes getting hollows?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (trying to be positive)
dialog: Well...we’re getting there.
text: Tim looks at him, totally skeptical.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: When the rest of the grant money
dialog: comes in, we'll reshoot me asking the
dialog: questions along with the trip to
dialog: Istanbul.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hey, Josh, I hate to bring this up,
dialog: but I’m gonna need a little money
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, I know, you've been patient. I’m
dialog: just waiting for the rest of this
dialog: last grant money.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: But soon?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, I’1l get you.
text: Goes into his wallet.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You need anything now?
text: He hands Tim a couple of twenties.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You know, get Maggie some flowers
dialog: or...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I’m going to use it to buy food.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh, yeah, yeah...good idea.
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 11.
scene_heading: INT. NEW SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. LATE DAY 5
text: A room with about fifty chairs, about seven of them occupied
text: by people over 50. Josh stands at a lectern with a lap top.
text: A blank TV screen behind him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: “Le documentaire, c'est ce qui arrive
dialog: aux autres, la fiction, c'est ce qui
dialog: m'arrive a moi.” “Documentary is
dialog: about someone else. Fiction is about
dialog: me.”
text: (glances out at the small
dialog: crowd, having made it
dialog: through the French part)
text: This is a quote from Jean-Luc Godard.
dialog: Now, what do we think about this?
dialog: Can a documentary be personal?
dialog: Documentaries, I want to say to you
dialog: today, can and should be about me.
text: Josh hesitates. A guy in the audience wearing a porkpie hat
text: is filming him with a portable camera. Josh is momentarily
text: distracted.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Me meaning all of us.
dialog: (to the room)
dialog: Lights.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Frank, can you just hit that switch?
text: An elderly gentleman obliges. Josh hits a button on his lap
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: This is an image from --
text: Nothing happens on the screen behind him. Josh presses the
text: button again. Nothing.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well...shit...this should be an image
dialog: of seal hunting from “Nanook of The
dialog: North.”
text: CUT TO: Josh collects his things from a chair at the foot of
text: the stage. A squat woman, 50’s, who runs the lecture series,
text: shrugs and smiles tightly at him.
speaker_heading: SQUAT WOMAN
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) lia.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (suddenly paranoid)
dialog: About what?
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 12.
text: The guy, 25, who was shooting Josh, comes forward. He wears
text: his mussed hair under his porkpie hat, an old plaid shirt
text: hanging out over slacks, and beat up boots. This is Jamie.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Hey. Beautiful class.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh...thanks. I don’t know why the
dialog: power point didn’t work, but...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I loved what you said about “hyper-
dialog: reality.” I’m Jamie.
speaker_heading: JOSH JAMIE
dialog: Josh Srebnick. This is my wife, Darby.
text: A girl, 23, in a high waisted dress and lace up boots comes
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Hi. Nice to meet you. It was
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Thanks. I’m not sure why the power
dialog: point didn’t work... How did you get
dialog: in here?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: We're auditing your class.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s a continuing education class,
dialog: you can’t audit a continuing
dialog: education class.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I’m a fan. And hey, I really loved
dialog: your film, Power Elite.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (taken aback, can’t hide
dialog: his pleasure)
dialog: You've seen it? Hey...thanks.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: It’s everything I aspire to and you
dialog: make it look so easy.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Do you make documentaries?
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 13.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I shoot stuff, you know, with
dialog: friends, yeah. Nothing like you’re
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: He’s always shooting.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Um, don’t take this the wrong way,
dialog: but how did you see Power Elite?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I found a VHS on Ebay. I paid like
dialog: sixty dollars for it. You know what
dialog: was great, was that scene with the
dialog: dogs around the garbage? How did you
dialog: stage that?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh...those dogs were just there and I
dialog: said, “Hey shoot those dogs.”
dialog: (not a great story)
dialog: And...we did.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (claps his hands together)
dialog: Beautiful.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’ve been working on this other one
dialog: for...about eight years now but I
dialog: think I’m zeroing in on it.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I'd love to see it.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: When I was a child my dog was killed
text: in front of me by two rottweilers.
dialog: (she starts to laugh)
text: I don’t know why I’m laughing. It’s
dialog: not funny. I was five. My dad and I
dialog: were walking our poodle which I had
dialog: named Toto and these two rottweilers
text: came bounding out of an open gate and
dialog: just attacked. My dad flagged down a
dialog: passing car and we climbed in the
dialog: back and he covered my eyes so I
text: couldn’t see Toto get mauled.
text: She covers her face, she’s still laughing.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: I’m sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You want to come get a bite with us?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh...I’m meeting my...wife around the
dialog: corner at this Chinese place.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Hey, my wife and I are going to the
dialog: same goddamn place!
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT. EVENING 6
text: Josh and Cornelia sit next to each other. Josh is in the
text: middle of talking to Jamie and Darby who face them across the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: ...I’ve learned along the way that
dialog: you can discover more by not knowing
dialog: the answers, by allowing yourself to
dialog: be surprised by what you encounter.
text: Jamie nods with great interest.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sometimes that means waiting years
dialog: for something to happen. I don’t
dialog: know. I could go on about this stuff
dialog: for days.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: How did you start out, like who
dialog: influenced you?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh, I steal from everyone, you know,
dialog: Maysles, Wiseman, Pennebaker... My
dialog: first job out of graduate school was
dialog: working for Leslie Breitbart.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Jeez Louise.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That’s also incidentally how I met
dialog: Cornelia. He’s her dad.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: This is before they hated each other.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We don’t hate each other. Cornelia
dialog: produces her dad’s films.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: He’s amazing.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Yeah, he’s kind of annoying me right
dialog: now, but...yeah.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: He’s a giant. He’s a guy I’d love to
dialog: meet. Do you also produce Josh's
dialog: films?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: No, Josh likes to work alone.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (again with real interest,
dialog: to Josh)
dialog: Josh, what's your new film about?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well, I’m trying to solve the problem
dialog: that Eisenstein never solved -- that
dialog: is how to make a film that is both
dialog: materialist and intellectual at the
dialog: same time --
text: Darby gets a text and starts to reply. Jamie yawns openly.
text: Josh feels he’s losing his audience but keeps going.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s about the distinctly American
dialog: relationship between biography and
dialog: history, theory and method and how
dialog: that relates to power and class in our
dialog: country, particularly the political,
dialog: military and economic elite.
dialog: (sensing he’s lost them)
dialog: It’s really about America.
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 16.
text: Jamie takes out a pad and pen and scribbles something down.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Eisenstein is astonishing. I just
dialog: saw Strike! I’m obsessed with Europe
dialog: in the 20’s, see. The interwar
dialog: period, ex-patriots, that sort of
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: I keep trying to get Jamie to do
dialog: something with before and afters.
dialog: All humans love before and afters.
dialog: Any TV show with before and afters
dialog: will succeed.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (smiles broadly)
dialog: Before you said that.
dialog: (Jamie frowns)
dialog: After you said that.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Fuck you.
text: He grabs her breast she smacks his hand playfully and returns
text: to her phone and answers a text. Cornelia tries an
text: accommodating smile.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: What do you do, Darby?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Darby makes ice cream.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (shrugs, texting)
dialog: Yeah, I make ice cream.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I brought it over to the Whole Foods
text: near us and they’re pumped.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: It’s Jamie’s idea to sell it, I just
dialog: do it because I like it.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: And you guys are married?
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 16A.
text: They both nod in unison.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: That’s so nice and old fashioned.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah. We said our vows in an empty
dialog: water tower in Harlem.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: DARBY
text: There was a mariachi band and a slip
dialog: and slide.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: DARBY JAMIE
dialog: Jamie wanted a big wedding. It was amazing. Some rituals
dialog: exist for a reason, you know.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: (glances at Josh)
dialog: Yeah. We did it at city hall.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (looking up from a text)
text: Isaac and Benny are walking the
dialog: tracks.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Have you guys done this? We walked
text: through the subway tunnels on the D
dialog: line last week.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (as if it’s commonplace)
dialog: No, no, we haven’t.

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JAMIE

dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DARBY

speaker_heading: JOSH

scene_heading: EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT. EVENING 7
text: Jamie and Darby unlock their bikes which are chained to a

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: If you’ve got any time -- and I know
dialog: you’re super busy -- I’d love to show
dialog: you what I’m working on.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Come by our place this weekend.
dialog: (to Cornelia)
dialog: I have my fall flavors.
text: Jamie gives Josh an old Polaroid of himself and writes his
text: number on it with a sharpie. His handwriting is in all caps,
dialog: very precise.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: They don’t make this film anymore. I
dialog: bought four hundred packs before they
dialog: discontinued it.
text: Jamie, without a helmet, hops on his bike which has a

speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (to Josh and Cornelia)
dialog: Jamie is always moving. I can’t leap
dialog: as fast as that kid. I don’t move as
dialog: quickly.
text: They both pedal into the center of the street. The
text: streetlight giving them a kind of glow. We MOVE in on Josh

speaker_heading: JOSH (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: They're all making things and they’re
dialog: so excited for each other. It’s
dialog: selfless. They were so respectful of
dialog: us. I mean, compared to when we go
dialog: out with Fletcher and Marina I feel
dialog: like we're all just talking about
dialog: ourselves... They asked questions.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: They didn’t ask me any questions.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: When I was their age I would never
dialog: have come up to me like that and
dialog: invited me out. I would have been
dialog: too scared... They’re really not
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I wish you hadn’t told him I work
dialog: with my dad.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I don’t know, he seems ambitious.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No! I don’t think he thinks that

speaker_heading: CORNELIA

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That’s really funny.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Yeah. I like Robert Downey. Senior.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: That’s the latest anyway. I’m also
dialog: doing people describing scenes from

text: Josh and Cornelia look back at Darby. She obliges:
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: What have you done to its eyes!?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (playing along)
text: He has his father’s eyes.
text: Cornelia pets the kitten in Darby’s arms.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I want a kitten!
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: That’s Bad Cop. Where’s Good Cop?
text: A black kitten comes out from under the couch. Darby hands
text: the white one to Cornelia and gathers the other one.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: I love these kittens, but I hope they
dialog: don’t grow up to be assholes because
dialog: that can happen.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: This is a great space. You know I
dialog: think I’ve only been to Williamsburg
dialog: once before.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: This isn’t even Williamsburg, it’s
dialog: Bushwick. We were in Williamsburg,
dialog: before then Park Slope, now we're
dialog: here.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: We live where we’re supposed to live.
text: She indicates a series of old typewriters.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Jamie’s a collector. My decorating
dialog: sensibilities veer towards 4th grade
dialog: teacher. I like bulletin boards.
text: We see the place now. It’s old, open, and has the feel of
text: being haphazardly curated: from the mouse trap stuck to the
text: molding to the flea market furniture to the VHS tapes of
text: random movies stacked against the wall. A framed NY Times
text: front page of the moon landing. A framed Polish poster of
text: the Bob Dylan doc “Don’t Look Back.” A photo of Darby going
text: down a slip and slide in her wedding dress.
text: Josh looks at a stack of records. Velvet Underground, Kinks,
text: John Coltrane, Suicide, Serge Gainsbourg, Thin Lizzy...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: This looks like my record collection.
dialog: Except mine are CD’s. It took me
dialog: years to discover this stuff.
text: Jamie smiles and puts a record on the turntable. A Notorious
text: B.I.G/Miley Cyrus mash-up. Josh admires a long wooden desk
text: with a computer and editing equipment.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I need to buy a new desk.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You should come with me to the lumber
dialog: yard. We’ll make one.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: A whole desk?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: It’s so much cheaper than buying one,
dialog: see. And more fun.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joshy, don’t overpay at some douche

speaker_heading: TIPPER
dialog: Darby, can I borrow your bike, I’m
dialog: going to the deli for Goldfish.
speaker_heading: DARBY

speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: TIPPER
dialog: (disappearing into the

dialog: I forgot.
text: Off Cornelia’s perplexed look:
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (with a hint of disdain)
dialog: That’s our roommate, Tipper.
text: Jamie grabs a bag of bird seed from a counter, he opens a
text: small door that leads to an outdoor landing. A chicken paces
text: in a cage. Cornelia hesitates.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Nico’s a chicken.
text: CUT TO: They sit around a small table. Darby prepares
text: something in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I have to say I really admire how you

dialog: enjoying doing and making things.
dialog: It’s inspiring.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Thanks, Joshy.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: The people our age are so success and

dialog: about process.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Josh, are you success oriented?
speaker_heading: JOSH CORNELIA
dialog: No. Totally.
text: Josh looks at Cornelia, surprised. A crash from the kitchen.
text: Darby reenters, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: I feel like there are people who
dialog: don’t drop things as much as I do.
dialog: (to Cornelia)
dialog: I don’t keep things yar.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: She’s a mess. And an ugly eater. I
dialog: say that with love.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Darby places down a home-made container with a hipster cow on
text: it and four spoons. She and Jamie eat straight from the
text: container. Josh and Cornelia follow.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: It’s an avocado and almond milk
dialog: sorbet. Benny designed the container.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: It tastes like that candy that they
dialog: sometimes make into pigs or little
dialog: fruits.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, it’s... Shit. I know that.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I keep wanting to say baklava, but
dialog: that’s a Greek dessert.
speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You should see this guy’s record

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s complicated, I felt I was seen

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH

dialog: Which part?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA

speaker_heading: JOSH

dialog: “always?”
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I don’t know, twice. I wanted to do

dialog: proudly.
text: Josh hesitates, looks back at the group. He shrugs and downs
text: it, a significant portion missing his mouth. He quickly
text: wipes at his chin and tries to get the spillage back into his
text: mouth. He licks his fingers and palm and the sides of the
text: glass then hands the glass back to the shaman, who looks

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: But the shards were from the platter?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (can’t help himself)

speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: I wrote a lot of poems.

speaker_heading: CORNELIA
text: She tries too hard.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Exactly! But it’s low-key so you

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I don’t know from Cookie Puss.
speaker_heading: JOSH

dialog: whiskey. Nah, it’s not. It is.
text: He drinks.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: So, tell me more about your project.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well, maybe a good way to start is by
dialog: asking you a question.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Hey, they were all raped when I got
dialog: there.
text: Josh stares at him blankly.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: (re: highball)
dialog: This is my second in twenty minutes.
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Do you know the percentage of African
dialog: American adult males currently in jail?
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Take a guess.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: (playing along but not
dialog: really thinking)
dialog: Like 60%?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jesus, no!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It's over 9%. That's nearly 1 in 10
dialog: African American adult males, nearly
dialog: a million and half.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: A million and a half is a lot.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It's insane, but people don't realize
dialog: this. They think because we have a
dialog: black president...
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: (as if he's helping Josh
dialog: out)
dialog: So this is about prison. Like a
text: black Shawshank. But real. A real,
text: black Shawshank.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: No, not...no.
dialog: (pause and then speaking
dialog: quickly)
dialog: There's a section, an Entr'acte
dialog: really, on the function of race in
dialog: the prison industrial complex...
dialog: (trying to get back on
dialog: track)
dialog: But the film is really about how
dialog: power in America works... Do you know
dialog: the historian, Ira Mandelstam?
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well, we have over a hundred hours of
dialog: interviews with him. Now --
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: The movie’s a hundred hours?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, we'll cut it. Now, this guy,
dialog: he’s not particularly charismatic,
dialog: he’s kind of anti-social, maybe
dialog: asbergers, but not interesting
dialog: asbergers. He’s kind of boring even.
text: But he’s a charismatic thinker.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: How do you show what he thinks?
dialog: Cartoons?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (what?!)
dialog: No, not cartoons. He says it.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: But he’s boring.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well...yes, but like many boring
dialog: things, the longer you watch it, it
dialog: takes on a different dimension --
text: Josh wipes the sweat that has now accumulated on his face.
text: Dave's glance goes to his Blackberry. He types something
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Mmm hmm. So, what’s it about?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s really a very simple idea. The
dialog: three sections correspond to the
dialog: three nodes of what Mills called the
dialog: power elite: the political, military
dialog: and economic. But, and this is key,
dialog: each part has to interconnect to show
dialog: how none of these three nodes
dialog: functions without the other.
text: Dave tries to surreptitiously glance at his Blackberry.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s a linear film of course, but I
dialog: imagine it as a kind of hypertext.
dialog: To be clear, the film is really about
dialog: the working class and, I can’t speak
dialog: on behalf of the working class. I
dialog: can't make their film, of course.
dialog: They have to be felt as the
dialog: impossible subject of the text.
dialog: Through an examination of the power
dialog: structure the voice of the working
dialog: class has to be revealed in the
dialog: margins through its very absence. If
dialog: that makes sense.
text: The phone rings. Both Dave and Josh look at it.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Hey, I’m suddenly so popular.
dialog: 48
dialog: 49
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (barrels on)
dialog: But it’s not even really about the
dialog: power structure but about what it
dialog: means to make a film about it. It’s
dialog: about the very possibility of making
dialog: this film...It’s really about America.
text: Dave can’t help it. He lunges for the phone.
text: The sound of KNOCKING.
scene_heading: INT. BREITBART’S APARTMENT - DOORWAY. DAY 48
text: Josh stands in the doorway, he wears his bike helmet and
text: holds his hat. Breitbart smiles.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I was just working on my speech for my
dialog: memorial. What’s on your mind, son?
text: Josh nervously unstraps his bike helmet and puts on his hat.
text: An awkward exchange as he has trouble holding both. He
text: exhales. Breitbart finally accommodates by taking the helmet.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Would you watch what I have? I think
dialog: I’m at a point where I need a new set
dialog: of eyes.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Ten years with the same project will
dialog: do that to you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: Of course I’1l watch it. Come in,
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BREITBART’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN. DAY 49
text: They watch the scholar on Breitbart’s new TV. Josh can’t
text: look at the screen, his eyes on are Breitbart.
text: CUT TO: Josh, still watching Breitbart. The movie ends.
text: Breitbart nods, shuts off the TV with a remote.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I just got this TV. It’s a smart TV.
dialog: 75.
text: He gets up and stretches, clearly very stiff from sitting for
dialog: so long.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I’1l put a kettle on. You want some
dialog: tea?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay.
text: Breitbart goes to his kitchen. Josh waits, impatiently.
speaker_heading: BREITBART (0.S.)
dialog: Well, you have a lot of good material
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: BREITBART (0.S.)
dialog: Lots to think about. I need to
dialog: process it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Breitbart reappears in the kitchen doorway.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Do you need the stuff about Turkish
dialog: politics?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yes, because it connects to what he’s
dialog: saying about the shift in power in the
dialog: contemporary global economy. And, of
dialog: course, it relates back to the earlier
dialog: stuff on the Ottoman Empire.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
text: Right, but it feels like a detour.
dialog: What about the lengthy history of the
dialog: Triangle Shirtwaste Factory Fire? Do
dialog: you need that?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: The interview with Tillie
dialog: Kupferschmidst’s great great niece?
dialog: That’s the emotional center of the
dialog: movie. That’s where things come
dialog: together. Without that scene...why
dialog: make the film at all?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: But it’s too long.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It has to be long. The point is it
dialog: makes you uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I wasn’t uncomfortable, I was bored.
text: The kettle goes off. Breitbart goes back into the kitchen.
text: Josh follows him in.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well, maybe boredom is your defense
dialog: from the discomfort.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: (growing impatient)
dialog: You just showed me a six and a half
dialog: hour movie that runs about seven
dialog: hours too long. I’m trying to help.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I understand, I understand. I think I
dialog: need to shoot some more interviews --
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Don’t shoot anymore! You have enough.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah? I just don’t think you're
dialog: getting it or maybe there’s something
dialog: about me or what you saw that’s
dialog: clouding your judgement.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I’m telling you what I really feel.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I don’t believe it. I think you’re
dialog: being deliberately critical.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Josh, I’m trying to help you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Bullshit! Is it because Cornelia and
dialog: I didn’t have children?
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Oh, come on, Josh.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We tried. There were miscarriages.
dialog: I had to give her a shot in her ass
dialog: every day for three months. It’s a
dialog: huge fucking needle.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I didn’t know you tried so hard. She
dialog: didn’t tell me. I thought you guys
dialog: didn’t want kids.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We didn’t want to hope for something
dialog: we probably couldn’t have.
dialog: (collecting his things)
dialog: This was a mistake.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I’m sorry you feel that way.
text: Josh starts for door.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I know you think I didn’t reach my
dialog: potential.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: No, son, no I don’t think you did.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your first film was so wonderful and
dialog: entertaining. We recognized ourselves
dialog: in it. This is ungenerous, it’s like
dialog: you took your ball and went home.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You know what? I’m sorry I didn’t
dialog: become you.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I don’t want you to be me, Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I‘1l see you at Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m not going to eat another fucking
dialog: fried turkey FYI.

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Ha! You want to play?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nah, I don’t have the right shoes.

scene_heading: INT. JAMIE AND DARBY’S APARTMENT, BUSHWICK. DAY 52
text: Josh enters -- he’s late. The space is packed -- mostly with
text: a sea of 20-something kids who lie on top of each other on
text: the floor watching Jamie’s movie. Tipper, dressed up ina
text: sort of Mary Jane outfit and horn-rimmed glasses, perched up
text: on a table, watching very seriously, her arms wrapped around
text: her long bent legs. Jamie stands in back, he looks nervous.
text: Darby a few feet away from him is texting. Cornelia waves
text: from a crowded corner. Josh smiles wearily.
text: Kent talks soberly on screen.
speaker_heading: KENT (ON SCREEN)
dialog: In the report it says we followed
text: procedure. A flashlight, three
text: flares, and the hand signals...
text: A quick jerky zoom into Kent, missing his face and then
text: adjusting to find him. He does the hand signals, punctuating
dialog: them with:
speaker_heading: KENT (ON SCREEN)
dialog: .---bum, bum, bum...but that’s not how
dialog: I remember it. It was sheer fucking
dialog: panic when the bus approached the
dialog: convoy. We opened fire --
text: Josh moves closer, looking for a place to sit or stand. He
text: steps over a couple lying on the floor.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Ow. Those are my fingers.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sorry, sorry.
text: Josh stops in his tracks. Over on the side, the Moon Landing
text: headline above his head, stands Breitbart. To his right, the
dialog: hedge fund dude, Dave.
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 80.
text: A light sweat breaks out on Josh’s face. Darby is looking
text: straight at him. She gives him a sad smile. Josh looks back
text: at the screen.
text: CLOSE: Josh’s scholar, Ira, talking about the politics of
dialog: war.
text: CUT TO: The movie is over. The mostly 20-something crowd
text: laughs, drinks beers. Breitbart picks an Oreo from a bowl of
text: Oreos on a table. Josh pushes through the kids to find
dialog: Jamie.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yoshy!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You invited Breitbart?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah, he called me after you
dialog: introduced us.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He called you?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah...and at our dinner I invited
dialog: him to tonight.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: At “our dinner?” Dinner with him?
dialog: When did you have dinner?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: After he called me, he suggested we
dialog: get dinner.
speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That’s where he goes.

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Great burgers. Have you been there?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yes, I’ve been there with hima
dialog: million times.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Have you gotten the Buffalo burger?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Of course!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: He dug the footage.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Is something wrong?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I guess I wish you'd asked me before
dialog: you just went to him...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Hey, I’m sorry. I called him
dialog: actually just to ask him a question
dialog: about how he shot something and we
dialog: just got to talking, see, and he
dialog: asked me what I was working on...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So you called him?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You said he called you.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: He called me back, yeah.
speaker_heading: JOSH

dialog: We're going to Afghanistan, we're

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: You're going to Afghanistan?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
text: To interview soldiers in Kent’s unit.

dialog: before we go. I’m going to need
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Afghanistan, Afghanistan!
text: Josh starts to retreat into the crowd. He hesitates. It
dialog: pains him to say this, but:
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Um, if you have any other editing
dialog: work, my guy Tim, is great and could
dialog: use some cash.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: That would be beautiful.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: I‘1l text you his info.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: (to Jamie)
dialog: Dude, I want you to meet Diane, she’s
text: a reporter for the Times.
text: Dave drags Jamie across the room. Darby takes Jamie’s arm as
text: he passes, she asks him a question. He replies tersely back.
text: She walks away, pissed. Dave pulls Jamie onward.
text: We MOVE in on Josh. Color vanishes from his face as a
text: terrible sinking feeling enters his body.
text: Two hands wrap around his neck like choking. He reacts.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Ahh!
text: It’s Cornelia. She smokes a cigarette.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I’ve been looking for you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You're smoking?

text: Across the room, Breitbart is approached by Dave and Jamie.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: (re: her dad)
dialog: I had no idea Dad was coming. I saw
dialog: him when I got here.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you sure? Are you sure you’re
dialog: not just saying that?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Yes, Josh! Why would I lie to you?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Do you think Jamie came to my talk
dialog: because he knew I was married to you?
dialog: That this was all so he could meet
dialog: your dad?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Josh, you know, the world isn’t a
dialog: conspiracy against you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You know, fuck you.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Fuck you. Don’t talk to me like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m saying “Fuck you” in that way
dialog: Jamie and Darby say it where it’s not
dialog: a real Fuck you, it’s a semi-playful
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: We’re not Jamie and Darby. We don’t
dialog: talk to each other that way. If you
dialog: say Fuck you to me it feels like a
dialog: real Fuck you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It is real.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Fuck you. And not semi-playfully
dialog: either!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Fuck you. Total real, cutting to the

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What about Jamie?
speaker_heading: DARBY
text: Jamie’s in love with Jamie.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I thought you guys seemed great.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: You know how no one will ever pick up
dialog: just a male hitchhiker? But if it’s
dialog: a couple, you might pull over? I’m
dialog: the girl so you'll pull over and pick
dialog: up Jamie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Doing ayawasca I realized I never
dialog: forgave my mom for dying and until I
dialog: do I’1l never have a decent
dialog: relationship with a guy.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: When did she die?
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: When I was in highschool. She had
dialog: ovarian cancer.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m sorry...
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Isn’t that also how Jamie’s mom died?
text: He talks about it in the film.
text: Darby hesitates.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Why’d you let Jamie use your scholar?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I was trying out being generous.
dialog: He'd do the same for me. That’s how
dialog: you guys are.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: (with sympathy)
dialog: Oh, Josh... You’re such a man-fox.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: A man-fox? I wish it didn’t need the
dialog: “man” qualifier?
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Because you’re like a hot dad.
dialog: Without children.
text: Suddenly, she pulls her chair over to him, leans in, and
text: kisses him on the mouth. He slowly moves away.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We shouldn't...
text: She slides her chair back to her side of the table.
text: hesitates, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: This is the part where I say, “I was
dialog: a bet?!”
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: You know those romantic comedies
dialog: where the girl was a bet?
text: He nods. She nods too.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: Yeah. Just because they did, doesn’t
dialog: mean we have to.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What...what do you mean?
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: She never told you? Jamie and
text: Cornelia made out at the ayawasca.
text: It was in the Papyrus reeds behind
dialog: the pyramids.
text: Josh looks staggered.
speaker_heading: DARBY
dialog: I'm sorry, I stole one of Tipper’s

dialog: I’m almost finished with it.

speaker_heading: CORNELIA
text: (looking at her phone to

dialog: Yeah...I’ve heard that.
speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I mean, you’re producing, but he
dialog: could bless it essentially...
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Bless it? Like a sneeze?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I was thinking more like the Pope.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: He doesn’t do that kind of thing --
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I think if you asked him, he might.
text: Cornelia hesitates. She says, suddenly:
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Did you ever see Power Elite?
text: Jamie gets up and exchanges his fork with one on another
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What’s that?
text: The corner of Cornelia’s mouth turns up.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: Josh's movie! Goddamn, yes. I told
dialog: him that. I loved that scene with
dialog: the dogs.
text: Jamie returns with the new fork.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: When you went to Josh’s class, you
dialog: knew Josh and I were married, didn’t
dialog: you? And that Leslie was my dad.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Hey, I admire lots of people, I want

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It seems kind of cool though.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: It’s like the pregnancy is its own

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You know, before you have a kid,

speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: It’s been very strange looking back

speaker_heading: BREITBART

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I didn’t do anything nobody else does --
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (trying to make sense of
dialog: that sentence)
dialog: “I didn’t do anything nobody else...”
dialog: You reveal everything and nothing.
dialog: (beat, composes himself)
dialog: You said you wanted to be a real
dialog: documentarian.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I thought you were about process.
dialog: Process and...ice cream. But you

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Success isn’t my thing, Josh. It’s
dialog: yours.
text: Josh is about respond, he hesitates. Nods.

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, you're right, it is my thing.
dialog: I have a fucked up relationship with
dialog: success. I want it and I don’t have
dialog: it. But what you have scares the
dialog: shit out of me. You’re not
dialog: uncomfortable at all.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Why should I be uncomfortable?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: See, that I just find weird.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You're the only person who is weird

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (indicating Breitbart)
dialog: His documentaries are over. What
dialog: you're doing is something else. If
dialog: everyone is filming everything,
dialog: what’s a documentary anymore? It has
dialog: no meaning, it’s just shit you
dialog: recorded! Is that old man talk?
dialog: Maybe it is. You kids have been told

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I can’t let Cornelia and Leslie walk

dialog: to go in there and tell them what
dialog: you’ve done. If you won’t, I’1l do

text: For a brief moment, Jamie’s face elicits what looks like
text: fear. It passes.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: Josh!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sorry I’m late.
dialog: (to Breitbart)
dialog: Leslie, I caught your speech from the
dialog: lobby, though and it was really
dialog: inspiring, spot on...
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Are you okay, son? Do you want to
dialog: sit down?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jamie has something he wants to tell
dialog: all of you.
text: Josh takes a seat and crosses his legs comfortably.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Go ahead.
text: They all look at him and then Jamie blankly.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Not all of the stuff in my movie
dialog: happened exactly as I said it did.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I played around with some of the time-
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (humbly)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: “Yeah?” And...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You did a lot more than that, come
dialog: on.
text: Josh stands back up. He says to the table:
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He didn’t even know Kent. Darby did.
dialog: And Darby’s mother died of ovarian
dialog: cancer. Jamie’s mom is probably
text: alive and kicking in Idaho.
text: He sits back down.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: (trying to put an end to
dialog: it)
dialog: Josh, this is kind of my night --
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You just need to hear this.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: That's basically it.
text: Josh leaps back up.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, that’s not basically it! You
dialog: knew that Kent had tried to kill
dialog: himself...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Say it!
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Josh, come on, let him speak.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: The gist is the same. I authored a
dialog: bit of how we came to it. I mean,
dialog: I’m not that good a writer. If I
dialog: made it all up, I'd be the best
dialog: writer in Hollywood and...and Kent
dialog: would be Marlon Brando.
text: Breitbart laughs. Hedge Fund Dave laughs harder.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I never said it was amazing. I just
dialog: said it was faked.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: And some of the time-line was
dialog: adjusted --
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Stop with the time-line crap!
text: Josh pulls out his video camera and gestures with it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jamie knew that Kent tried to kill
dialog: himself. That he’d been in
dialog: Afghanistan. We didn’t just stumble
text: upon it. It was rigged. Jamie
dialog: invented the whole Facebook thing
dialog: because he knew it would play better.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Kent wasn’t in Afghanistan?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, Kent was in Afghanistan.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: So, what’s the problem?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s...it’s...the way, the way he
dialog: said that he found him is not true.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: Kent served our country, you’re being
dialog: offensive.
text: Breitbart looks at Jamie.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Is what Josh is saying true?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Well...I did know, but I don’t think
dialog: it really matters though, the movie’s
dialog: not about that.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Of course it matters. Leslie,
dialog: explain...
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I don’t know that it matters totally
dialog: in this case.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: What?
text: Dave leans in from the next table.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: I don’t care.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: I didn’t expect you to care.
dialog: (quickly back to Leslie)
dialog: Leslie, are you kidding me? You
dialog: don’t care? You just gave a speech
dialog: about authenticity!
speaker_heading: HEDGE FUND DAVE
dialog: (thinks about it again)
dialog: Yeah, I don’t care.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I just think the movie works on many
dialog: levels, the happenstance of it, to be
dialog: honest, I find the least interesting
dialog: part.
text: Josh sputters, practically stomps his foot.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I can’t believe it! This movie isn’t
dialog: worth the...RAM...it’s...stored on.
dialog: (pointing at Jamie)
dialog: He’s acon artist. Leslie, your
dialog: generation of sit-ins and protesters
dialog: and...pack rats would be horrified by
dialog: this...demon!
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: You're hysterical, Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (hysterically)
dialog: I’m not hysterical!
text: He swings his arm, gesturing, knocking a tray full of food
text: and glasses out of a waiter’s arms. It goes crashing to the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Shit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
text: He helps the waiter pick up the plates. Everyone at the
text: table waits. Josh finally gets back up.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Cornelia...
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I don’t know. I think he’s an
dialog: asshole, but the movie’s pretty good.
dialog: And I'm sorry I think that.
text: Jamie takes a seat and starts eating the dessert that was
text: placed in front of him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: This is so frustrating! I’m going to
dialog: get no satisfaction here, am I? This
dialog: guy’s just going to win no matter
dialog: what.
text: Everyone at the table stares at Josh. His says with
dialog: certainty:
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: This is not how the world works.
text: We MOVE in on Josh. His face fills with emotion.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Why does it have to be one thing or
dialog: another? Things change. Different
dialog: things matter now.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Forget ethics then. What about me?!
dialog: You played me. I was played.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: But you acted in it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Only because I thought it was real!
dialog: (pause, with genuine
dialog: feeling)
dialog: I loved you.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I like you too! We’re friends.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I really believed it.

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m not crying. I’m not.
text: Josh's attention goes to a tiny camera in Jamie’s lap aimed
text: right at him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you filming this?!
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: Josh, your sleeve is on fire.
text: Josh's sweatshirt has dipped into the flame of a candle on
text: the table and is indeed on fire. Jamie stands, grabs a
text: pitcher of water and douses Josh.
text: Josh drips, soaked. He shakes his head like a wet dog and,
text: dejected, moves to leave. He hesitates and turns to Breitbart:
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I took your note by the way. I cut
dialog: the stuff on Turkish politics out of
dialog: my film. You were right, I don’t
dialog: need it.
speaker_heading: BREITBART
dialog: I’m glad to hear that, son.

text: arrives. She holds a plate with a napkin covering it. She
text: hands it to Josh.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
text: It doesn’t matter that it’s faked.
dialog: (Josh nods)
dialog: It doesn’t matter because it’s not
dialog: about Afghanistan and it’s not about
dialog: Kent it’s about Jamie.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: In my head, when I was blading over,
dialog: I swept in here and exposed
dialog: everything. I was such a hero.
dialog: 117.
text: He lifts the napkin on the plate to see a piece of chocolate
text: cake drizzled with chocolate sauce and a fork.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Thanks.
text: Cornelia takes a swig from the bottle.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: When we first started seeing each
dialog: other I was so jealous. I would get
dialog: so upset when you’d talk to another
text: girl at a party.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I know! I liked that...
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I was so sure you’d fall in love with
dialog: someone else and leave me.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Did you want me to?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I think I wanted to know that I
dialog: wasn’t your only option. But you
dialog: didn’t fall in love with someone
dialog: else. Until you did. And then it
dialog: was two people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m so sorry I kissed him. I really
dialog: did think it was you at first...then
dialog: I kind of kissed him again. I don’t
dialog: know why I did it. I wanted to like
dialog: him as much as you did.
text: Josh starts to eat the cake.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: I wanted so badly...I wanted to be
dialog: admired. I wanted a protege.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He looked at me like I was a real
dialog: grown-up person. Someone who has
dialog: done things. For the first time in
dialog: my life I stopped thinking of myself
text: as a child imitating an adult.
dialog: Blue (09/16/2013) 118.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: You feel that way too?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I’m forty-four and there are things I
dialog: will never do. Things I won’t have.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What’s the opposite of “the world’s
dialog: your oyster?”
text: Cornelia’s eyes water. She nods.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I think I stopped taking you in.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Am I a failure?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: You’ve never failed me.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: But am I a failure?
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I feel like I failed you. I wish we
dialog: could go back and meet each other all
dialog: over again.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'd present myself differently. So I
dialog: didn’t get your hopes up. Maybe not
dialog: use the expression “conquer the
dialog: world” so often.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: You said that a lot.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I think it’s hard for me to have
dialog: something be great every day and to
dialog: acknowledge it.
dialog: (smiles at her)
dialog: I have something great every day. If
dialog: we were different people, I’d ask you
dialog: to renew our vows.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: I think it’s nice to renew vows.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Maybe we are different people.
