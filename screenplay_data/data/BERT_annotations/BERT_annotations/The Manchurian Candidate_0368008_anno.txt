speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: After all, you're young and you have

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Paper or plastic.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: From the grocery store. You were
dialog: wondering where, we, you know -- and
dialog: right at the check-out stand, "paper or

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARCO

speaker_heading: ROSIE

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Rosie. My full name is Eugenie Rose.
dialog: I've always liked the Rosie part better.

speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Still. When I asked you your name, you

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Yeah. Well. Maybe 'cause I was feeling

scene_heading: 95 INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - AS BEFORE 95

dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
text: sinks down next to him. Calm. Deftly plucking the pills
text: from the floor.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: My mother would tell you to wash these.
text: Marco looks up at her blankly. She takes the vial, caps it,
dialog: gives it back.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: I didn't mean to upset you.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: It's not you, it's me. I'm not -- my

scene_heading: 96 INT. TRAIN MEN'S ROOM - DAY 96
text: Marco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face,

scene_heading: IN THE MIRROR: THE DOOR OPENS

text: Marco pivots -- no Noyle. The door is shut, locked. He's
text: all alone. Losing his mind.
scene_heading: 97 INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ROSIE 97
text: Lost in thought. Faint smile. She puts her hand flat

scene_heading: 98 INT. TRAIN MEN'S ROOM - MARCO 98
text: Turns to the mirror again ... and again SEES Dr. Noyle
text: behind him, smiling:
speaker_heading: NOYLE

scene_heading: 99 INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - MARCO 99

speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR ROSIE
dialog: Are you okay, sir? Ben?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: ... Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Jesus. You've been in here twenty

scene_heading: 100 INT. PENN STATION - DAY 100
text: Marco comes up the escalator, into a SEA OF COMMUTERS.
text: Momentarily lost. Rosie is behind him, a moment later with

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: I'm gonna get a cab, you want me to drop
dialog: you somewhere?
dialog: 8/18/03 54.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: No. I'm okay, thanks.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Your friend gonna meet you here?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: No.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: El Dorado 59970.
dialog: (off Marco's frown)
dialog: My cell phone, in case you -- you know.
dialog: I like to say it the old way -- can you
dialog: remember the number, or should I write it
dialog: on your chest with a sharpie?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: (small smile)
dialog: I'll remember.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: You're sweating.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What?
text: Marco feels his shirt -- soaked. Long beat. She reaches
text: out and feels his forehead. No fever. Sizing him up.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Listen. You got a place to go and get
dialog: freshened up?
scene_heading: 101 INT. ROSIE'S COUSIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 101
text: Rosie lets Marco in. It's incredibly cramped, everything in

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: -- It's my cousin's apartment. She's in
dialog: Cleveland with the road company of 'Mamma
dialog: Mia.' There's ... a view of the park ...
dialog: if you go out on the fire escape and
dialog: kinda ... tilt your head ...
text: Marco puts down the suitcases and waits in the middle of the
text: room while Rosie takes off her coat, turns on some lights.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: I'm nervous. I'm sorry. I yak when I
dialog: get nervous.
dialog: 8/18/03 55.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Me, I get quiet.
text: Another awkward beat. She stands there. Studying him.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Dreams, I've been having these --
text: Catches himself. That's just how Melvin said it.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Is that what happened on the train?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Sort of.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I could be dreaming you.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: What if you are?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You'd be the best dream I've had in a
dialog: long time, Rosie.
text: Beat. Rosie smiles at him.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: If that's a line, Ben Marco, it kinda
dialog: worked.
scene_heading: 102 INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - MARCO 102

speaker_heading: (KNOCKING loudly)

scene_heading: 105 INTERCUT - ROSIE - OUTSIDE THE DOOR 105
text: -- Rosie's KNOCKING HARDER, NOW.

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: BEN MARCO!?
text: PUSH IN as Ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin
text: ... cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of
scene_heading: AN EXTREMELY TINY OBLONG THING

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Oh Jesus.

speaker_heading: MARCO
text: -- loses his grip on the oblong thing before he can even get
text: a good look at it, and it goes into the sink --
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: SHIT. Oh no NO ...
text: -- and down the drain -- Marco twists the faucet off, and
speaker_heading: DIVES TO
scene_heading: FLOOR LEVEL - UNDER THE SINK
text: where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap
text: and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water
dialog: spewing everywhere --
text: -- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy
dialog: hairballs and pipe corrosion and water ... but not the thing
dialog: he wants. It's --
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: -- Gone. Shit.
text: MARCO -- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away.
text: Defeated. Rosie crouches next to him. A little scared.
text: She blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then
text: presses her ice pack against it.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Tell me you saw that.
text: Rosie just stares at him.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: (hollow)
dialog: You didn't. You didn't see it.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: See what?
text: Marco closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: MARCO

scene_heading: 112 INT. DELP'S RESEARCH LAB - SKY BOOTH - DAY 112
text: A narrow, glassed-in space with a cluster of monitoring

speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: -- Delp. It's not GWS.
text: Delp has known Marco too long, and too well, not to take him
dialog: seriously.
speaker_heading: DELP
dialog: A dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny
dialog: implantable I.D. thing -- you could imbed
text: it under the skin, then scan it like a
dialog: bar code for medical emergency
dialog: information, blood-type, DNA. Pentagon
dialog: ordered up half a million, and stuck
dialog: about five thousand experimentally into
dialog: high-risk soldiers and infantry. But the

speaker_heading: DELP

speaker_heading: DELP
dialog: Ha ha.
text: Marco stares down into a big pit. Among the racks of

speaker_heading: DELP
dialog: You seriously believe somebody's messed

speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What are you studying here, Delp?
speaker_heading: DELP
dialog: Fear.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: For the Agency?

dialog: 8/18/03 60.
text: Wal-Mart? Fear? Marco looks at the monkeys. Doesn't want

dialog: him. Then:
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Look, Delp. My experiences during the
dialog: war, in Kuwait ... feel dreamlike to me.
dialog: And my dreams? About what happened?
dialog: Feel as real as you and me, here, right
dialog: now.
text: Delp just waits.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: It's like ... I feel like somewhere along
dialog: the line, I've been ... brainwashed. Or
dialog: something. You know? All scrambled up.
speaker_heading: DELP
dialog: We've all been brainwashed, Marco.
dialog: Religion, advertising, television.
dialog: Politics. We accept what's normal
dialog: because we're told it's normal and we
dialog: crave normalcy. Hell, look at the
dialog: Germans under Hitler. Disco, in the
dialog: seventies.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And if you're really worried about
text: somebody imbedding electric probes and
dialog: computer chips in your brain to make you
dialog: do things -- it's horseshit, man. Turns
dialog: out Pavlov had it right from the getgo.
dialog: Dogs and all. A little ECT and sleep
dialog: deprivation will do the trick for a
dialog: fraction of the price. Ask the Uzbeks.
dialog: And you would remember it.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What about my dreams?
speaker_heading: DELP
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: What if all this is the fucking dream and
dialog: you're still back in Kuwait?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You're not helping me.

text: volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW
text: logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert
text: Arthur and Raymond Shaw. Anderson comes out and opens the

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Am I in your dreams?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: (evasive)
dialog: -- You know.
text: Raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Saving everybody?
text: PEDESTRIANS pass between them on the crowded sidewalk.
dialog: 8/18/03 64.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: It's more complicated than that.
text: Marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of Melvin's
dialog: notebooks --
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: People just don't have the same dreams
dialog: accidentally --
dialog: (holds out the notebook)
dialog: -- Melvin made drawings, he wrote down
dialog: what he dreamed, this is one of his
dialog: notebooks -- it's all in here.
text: -- and Raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it,
dialog: the way Marco once did with Melvin. Anderson and Mirella --
text: the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the
text: same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I don't have dreams, Captain.
dialog: (then, gently:)
dialog: Maybe you should ... see somebody -- talk
dialog: to somebody who specializes in this kind
dialog: of thing --
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I've been to doctors.
dialog: ... which is exactly what Melvin said to him.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.
text: Marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I'm not crazy, Shaw.
text: He jams the notebook back into his folder, starts to walk
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (calls after)

scene_heading: 119 INT. RAYMOND'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CAMPAIGN HQ - DUSK 119
text: Huge posters featuring Raymond's face, emblazoned with
text: SECURE TOMORROW, stacked against the wall. A desk covered
text: with papers and enough take-out Chinese food for ten people,
text: and Raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and
text: pointedly ignoring Melvin's notebook, while:
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I kill Mavole?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: It's a dream --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: -- could mean something else.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: -- could be I'm just supposed to think
dialog: you did.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: -- I killed the enemy. I didn't know
dialog: them, either. So it was okay. And,
dialog: anyway, I remember what we did in Kuwait,
dialog: I remember it perfectly. But now that
dialog: you mention it, I don't remember doing it
dialog: ... exactly.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Maybe you didn't.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: NO. What a thought.
text: Now he picks up the dream book. Marco watches. Raymond
text: flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively. Then
text: stops at something Melvin has drawn. Frowns. Raises his
text: eyebrows. Closes it, sets it down:
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Life is so bizarre, isn't it? This
text: absurd campaign, the sordid world of
dialog: politics, my whole public life and
dialog: persona -- sometimes, occasionally, for
text: an instant, the fog clears and I look and
dialog: I think, what am I doing? I mean, what
dialog: the fuck am I doing? Posing and grinning

dialog: with total strangers who must be blind if
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: RAYMOND (CONT'D)
dialog: they can't see what I am, at the core.
dialog: What my mother has made me.
text: Raymond looks steadily at Marco ... who nods, interested:
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: A Prentiss. Ferociously, a Prentiss --
dialog: but not a Shaw, God forbid -- I was
text: molded by cold hard hands, every detail
dialog: of my existence preordained. Can you
dialog: even imagine, Ben, how it would feel
dialog: never to have a say in what your life
dialog: would be? I was twenty years old before
dialog: I had a friend -- no, worse, a girlfriend
dialog: -- well, almost -- but, yes, a friend, or
dialog: I thought so -- outside my mother's
dialog: circle of approved encounters -- and it
dialog: didn't -- she wouldn't -- precipitating
dialog: my one act of rebellion, storming off and
dialog: enlisting --
dialog: (grimaces)
dialog: -- in the Army. Which, ironically, only
dialog: served ultimately to pad my gilded
dialog: Prentiss resume. You know: "fluent in
dialog: five languages, Phi Beta Kappa,
dialog: Congressional Medal of Honor, blah blah
dialog: blah."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And after the war I came back to her.
dialog: And the family legacy. This. Mother
dialog: calls it, "fulfilling my Manifest
dialog: Prentiss Destiny."
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Why did you come back, Raymond? What
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What?
text: Seeming startled, Raymond's reverie is broken. His eyes
text: harden as he refocuses on Marco.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Weren't you listening? Mother happened.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know, the truth is, I hate it. I've
dialog: always despised it.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: (lost)
dialog: Which?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
text: The medal. The cloying adulation of the
dialog: little people. Your pitiful jealousy --
dialog: 8/18/03 67.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Who said I was jealous?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I don't have the dreams, Ben.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: How can you not remember saving the unit?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I do. I said I did.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You said you don't remember doing it.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Ha ha, don't mix me up, I'm tired, and --
dialog: Fine. It's like this. It's as if I know
dialog: what will happen, Ben, but I never get to
dialog: the part where I feel that it actually
dialog: did happen. But I think that's probably
dialog: perfectly normal.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Did you ever talk to anybody about this
dialog: little discrepancy?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What? No. Who would I ask? My old Army
dialog: "buddies," who love and adore me for
dialog: saving their pathetically unimportant --
dialog: present company excluded -- asses?
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: No. You ask Army Intelligence.
dialog: (getting excited)
dialog: Look, we can go together, tomorrow. You
dialog: tell them what you just told me,
dialog: everything you do remember, what you
dialog: don't "exactly" remember, about Kuwait,
dialog: let 'em run some tests on you --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I'm sure the press would have a field day
dialog: with that.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Raymond. They put an implant in me. I
dialog: found it yesterday. Maybe they put one
dialog: in you.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Nobody's put anything in me.
dialog: 8/18/03 68.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Great. Let's prove it. We can go get an
dialog: x-ray -- we can check it right now --
text: Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I want to be supportive of you, Ben, I
dialog: do, but --
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Just check your back, Raymond --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: -- this can wait until after the
dialog: election.
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What are you afraid of? See if there's a
dialog: bump.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You should leave. This is not, this is
dialog: not --
speaker_heading: MARCO

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: MARCO

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: (disbelief)

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

dialog: door.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Sir --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: ROSIE
