scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBOAT CASINO PARKING LOT - IOWA - NIGHT 1
text: Outrageous flashing lights sparkle in the reflection of the
text: windshield of a 2003 Subaru station wagon. Slumped behind the
text: wheel is GERRY KARTWELL (early-40s, mustached). He listens to
dialog: Joe Navarro’s audio book of “200 Poker Tells” on CD.
speaker_heading: JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE
dialog: Ninety-eight. Furrowing of Forehead.
dialog: Furrowing of the forehead is a good
dialog: indicator that something is amiss or
dialog: the person is insecure. It is also
dialog: seen when people are concentrating or
text: trying to make sense of something.
text: CLOSE ON Gerry, glassy-eyed, perhaps fighting back tears.
speaker_heading: JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: It is usually associated with doubt,
dialog: weakness, or concern.
text: Gerry looks in his rearview mirror, contorts and relaxes his
text: face in a tension-releasing exercise. He does this several
text: times, until he’s ready.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO BATHROOM - SAME 2
text: We are behind the shaggy hair of a bearded man. He brushes his
text: teeth, leans over the sink and spits.
scene_heading: INT. RIVERBOAT CASINO ENTRANCE 3
text: Gerry steps through the entrance, nods to the SECURITY GUARD,
text: who smiles.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Hey Gerry. Good luck tonight.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO BATHROOM 4
text: Still from behind, we see the bearded man apply deodorant under
text: his shirt, then tuck the stick back into his leather duffel.
scene_heading: INT. POKER ROOM 5
text: Gerry enters the casino’s poker room, steps up to the CASHIER,
text: hands over his player’s card and sixty bucks.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Hey Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hey Louise. How’s the knee?
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 2.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It’s gettin’ there.
text: She hands him a printed ticket.
speaker_heading: LOUISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good luck.
text: He glances at his ticket and wanders over to his assigned table,
text: where he joins several players awaiting the start of tonight's
dialog: low-stakes tournament.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: (to the dealer)
dialog: Hey Chuck.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Whatta ya say there, Gerry?
text: Gerry nods and Chuck slides over a stack of chips.
text: Also seated at the table are-- CLIFFORD HOUSTON (40s, wearing a
text: visor and goatee, with a permanent cranky scowl).
text: WILL (20s, wearing a hoodie and sunglasses, listening to iPod).
text: “BLOODY MARY” KATE (60s, drinking a bloody mary).
text: LARRY (30s, black, laid back).
text: Gerry folds his cards for the first several hands. There is a
text: calm, casual banter at the table.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Anyone know the spread on the Hawkeyes
dialog: game?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Six points.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Gettin’ hot out there.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It’s just weather.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: What does that mean, “It’s just
dialog: weather?”
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hot, cold... it’s just weather, baby.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 3.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I like that. “It’s just weather,
dialog: baby.”
text: Gerry and the others laugh.
text: Meanwhile, Clifford has been raising Larry, and they reveal
text: their cards. Clifford wins and reels in his chips.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Yeah, well, it’s just poker, baby.
dialog: How’s that? You like that one?
text: We ZOOM past Gerry at the table to reveal the bearded drifter
text: approaching in the background.
text: This man is CURTIS VONN (30s, handsome with a devil-may-care
text: attitude). We reverse ZOOM back to Gerry at the table, where
text: the conversation continues...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Anyone see that rainbow yesterday?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Missed it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I drove to the end of a rainbow once.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Wasn't nothin’ there. Just faded out
text: into the trees.
text: Curtis has now arrived at Gerry’s table, pulls out a chair.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Table seven looks like heaven. How is
dialog: everybody feeling tonight?
text: Not sure what to make of this guy, most folks just nod.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (passing him chips)
dialog: Have a seat.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What’s the word, people?
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 4.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It’s just poker, baby.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hey, it’s okay with me. lLet’s play
dialog: some cards.
text: Chuck dishes out the next hand; everyone peeks at their cards.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Aces are good, right?
text: Curtis smiles, bets a stack of chips. Most players fold. Not
text: Gerry. He raises. Without missing a beat, Curtis meets Gerry’s
dialog: raise.
text: When the flop comes down with an Ace, the one other remaining
text: player folds. But Gerry looks quietly at the still-smiling
text: Curtis and calls bullshit, raising him once again.
text: Curtis looks Gerry over, zeroing in on a MISSING BUTTON ON
text: GERRY'S SHIRT. (It’s an odd detail to focus on in a moment like
text: this, but that’s the kind of guy Curtis is.) He mucks his
text: cards, and Gerry reels in the pot.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Aces, huh?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Why would I fold Aces?
text: MINUTES LATER. A waitress comes by.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Anyone need any drinks?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Bloody Mary.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Bourbon.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What is the bourbon?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Just the cheap stuff.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Make mine a Woodford.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I’ll have to check if we have--
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 5.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (to Gerry)
dialog: --Hey friend, you want a Woodford?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: The cheap stuff is fine with me.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Bring him a Woodford, too.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: That’s okay.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Don’t worry, it’s on me.
text: Gerry nods thanks. The friendly banter continues over multiple
text: hands...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What’s the bad beat jackpot at?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Ninety five.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: When's the last time it hit?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Long time.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I got a bad beat jackpot story... My
dialog: old buddy, Tony Roundtree-- anyone know
dialog: Tony?
text: Blank looks and head shakes.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hosts a high rollers game every other
dialog: month in New Orleans now. But I knew
dialog: him when he was up in Detroit.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You from Detroit?
text: The bet comes around to Curtis, who nonchalantly bets a large
text: stack of chips. The next two players fold.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Me? I’m from all over, but I knew Tony
dialog: Roundtree up in Detroit.
dialog: (MORE )
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 6.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: He loved to play poker, but he kept
dialog: dodging my invitations to play in the
dialog: casinos. Story goes like this...
text: ON GERRY scrutinizing Curtis for a tell...
text: CLOSE ON CURTIS’ details as he continues with the story: hand
text: gestures, smile, hazel eyes... he shows no signs of stress.
text: Gerry folds his hand, and Curtis rakes in the pot.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Apparently Tony had a little bit of a
dialog: gambling problem before I met him. You
dialog: guys know about the disassociated
dialog: persons list? Not sure you have it in
dialog: Iowa. But some states you can put
dialog: yourself on this list if you’re trying
dialog: to quit gambling. Which means you are
dialog: legally banned from all casinos in the
dialog: state.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: For life.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: For life. So you know what I’m talking
dialog: about. It makes sense, right? Well,
dialog: not to Tony. He put himself on the
dialog: list to show his girlfriend he was
dialog: serious about changing his ways. Of
dialog: course, a few months go by and she
text: dumps him for a guitar player.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's always a guitar player.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It is always a guitar player, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Nice hands.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: So he’s lonely and depressed and gets
text: the itch to play poker again. Walks to
dialog: the MGM-- “Sorry buddy.” Greektown--
dialog: “no can do, amigo.” Motor City-- “no
dialog: dice, pal.” So what does he do?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Disguise.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 7.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yes! He puts on sunglasses, fake
text: mustache-- a wig.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: C'mon, a wig?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’ve never been more serious. He makes
text: it past security, takes a seat in the
dialog: poker room, and he’s in heaven. What a
dialog: rush that must have been. He’s finally
dialog: back in action, and--
text: The waitress returns with a tray of drinks.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I’m sorry, they don’t have Woodford.
dialog: Our top shelf is Bulleit.
text: She sets the bourbon glasses in front of Curtis and Gerry.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Okay, fine... but I’m not paying for
dialog: his.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I said his Woodford is on me. That is
dialog: not a Woodford.
text: Awkward beat. Curtis smiles.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m only kidding... Keep the change,
dialog: darlin’.
text: Curtis takes a moment to enjoy the ritual of a toast. He holds
text: his glass up to Gerry, who does the same.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good luck to you, my friend.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thanks.
text: They sip their drinks.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Better than the cheap shit, right?
text: Gerry shrugs, nods politely.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 8.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So what happened?
text: Beat. Curtis transitions back into story mode.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: He’s at the table for a couple hours,
dialog: playing the best poker of his life. Up
dialog: four, five thousand, when some guy’s
dialog: straight flush beats another guy’s four
dialog: cowboys.
text: Everyone at the table knows what this means and laughs.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Jackpot!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hundred fifty thousand dollar bad beat
dialog: jackpot. To be split between all five
dialog: players at the table.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Thirty grand a piece.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Thirty grand a piece. Unless you
dialog: happen to be a disassociated person who
dialog: is breaking the law by just being in
dialog: the room. So while everyone else is
text: high-fiving and back-slapping, Tony
text: jumps up, leaves his chips on the
text: table, and makes a bee-line for the
text: nearest exit... And he hasn’t stepped
dialog: foot inside a casino since.
text: Curtis sips his bourbon. Gerry smiles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And what is the lesson here?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: The lesson? Lady, lighten up, it's
dialog: just a story.

scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Gerry enters the bar with a bounce to his step. A college
text: basketball game plays on the TV. The bartender, DALE, greets
dialog: him.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 9.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hey Gerry, how’d it go tonight?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Placed third.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Congrats! What’s the payout on that?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Nine hundred. What’s the score here?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Not sure. Have a seat.
text: Gerry straddles a bar stool, scans the TV screen for a score.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Oregon up six. Okay. That’s okay.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: The usual for ya?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Uh... actually, do you have Woodford?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Let’s do one of those.
text: Gerry keeps his eyes on the TV. A player misses a free throw.
text: He winces.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: How much you got on this?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Nine hundred.
text: Dale pours the Woodford and Gerry takes a sip, nods.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: It’s a Woodford kind of night.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: That guy over there shooting darts
dialog: likes it too.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 10.
text: We follow Gerry’s gaze over to the dart board, where Curtis
text: tosses a dart, shrugs, and pays his opponent five bucks.
text: Gerry smiles, calls out to Curtis--
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hey! Woodford man!
text: Curtis looks over, recognizes Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT’D)
dialog: Next one’s on me!
text: Curtis (a little tipsy) steps over to the bar, sits next to
text: Gerry. They shake hands.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Name’s Curtis.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Curtis! Like Tony.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: More like Mayfield.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I’m Gerry.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Like Lewis?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No. Just Gerry. With a G. Short for
dialog: Gerald... Like Ford, I guess.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: How'd it go for you tonight?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What’s “not bad”?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Second.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Get outta here. That’s great.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Could have finished first if you didn’t
dialog: bully me out of that mountain before
dialog: you left.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 11.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Win some, lose some.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hey, where'd you disappear to anyway?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I can never last through those
dialog: tournaments.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Then why’d you buy in?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I like people.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Well you should've stuck it out.
dialog: You're a good player.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: For a few hours, maybe, but I don’t
dialog: have the stamina for poker. I get
dialog: restless.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: So what’s your game?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Darts.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You any good?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I can hit the board.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hey, I gotta ask... what were you
dialog: holding?
text: Curtis smiles, pauses for effect.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Pair a deuces.
text: Gerry stares at him, always looking for the tell.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You asked.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 12.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: That’s all?
text: No response. Is this guy for real?
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can usually read people like a damn
dialog: book. But you were all over the map my
dialog: friend. I still can’t spot your tell.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You know why?
text: Gerry waits for it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t care about winning...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Bullshit!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I just like to play.
text: Curtis shrugs. Gerry watches him in wonder, then turns back to
text: the TV.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You see that rainbow yesterday?
text: Gerry stares at Curtis. Is he serious?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yes! Amazing! It was fucking amazing!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Best - rainbow - ever.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hey, why have I never seen you before?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m just passing through town.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Headed where?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: New Orleans.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I love New Orleans! You going to your
dialog: friend’s high roller game?
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 13.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Tony Roundtree. Nah, I don’t have that
dialog: kind of money.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: So, what then?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You’re just going down to New Orleans
dialog: for the hell of it?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Pretty much.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Damn, that sounds alright.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It’s alright with me.
text: LATER.
text: Gerry and Curtis are hunched over the bar, drunk as hell, Gerry
text: in the middle of describing a memorable poker hand.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I knew he had my two pair beat. But I
dialog: also knew that he didn’t know he had me
dialog: beat by the way he was betting. I had
dialog: four or five already on the line, so I
dialog: figure, what the hell, and I push the
dialog: rest of my chips in. He sits there for
dialog: five minutes. Just staring at me. So
dialog: I say “Tell ya what. For fifty bucks,
dialog: I‘1l show you one of my cards,
dialog: whichever one you wanna see.”
text: Curtis breaks into a smile.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: And whichever card you flip...
speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Beautiful!
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yeah, it really was. It was beautiful.

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 14.
text: Beat. Gerry takes a quarter out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Twenty bucks... heads or tails?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Tails.
text: Gerry flips the coin. It’s tails. He hands Curtis a twenty.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Where did you come from?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m from a far away land where rainbows
dialog: run free and whiskey grows on trees.
text: ON GERRY for a bewildered beat. He almost believes him.
text: LATER. Gerry and Curtis drunkenly play darts, missing the board
text: entirely, laughing.
scene_heading: INT. CLUTTERED LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY 10
text: Gerry is passed out on the couch with a blanket draped over him.
text: Sun shines through the windows.
text: The sound of silverware clinking stirs him awake. Gerry
text: struggles to open his eyes, and sees a young woman, DENISE (20s)
text: sitting down at the chair opposite him. She’s wearing pajamas
text: and sprinkling Quik chocolate powder over a bowl of ice cream as
text: she watches the morning news.
text: Gerry looks around, struggling to remember where he is, when
text: Curtis passes through the doorway in the bg and stops upon
text: seeing Gerry. He’s naked, brushing his teeth.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (mouthful of toothpaste)
dialog: Oh, good, you’re up.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

dialog: Just friends.
speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I have work.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You have a job?
text: Gerry nods, puts on his shoes.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Where'd I leave my car?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hang on... Look who’s running in the
dialog: sixth race.
text: Curtis hands a newspaper folded on the race schedule to Gerry.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Dynamic Rainbow! Are you kidding me?
dialog: Is that not our dog? Look me in the

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 16.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s a good name.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It’s a great name!
text: Standing up, Gerry instinctively pats his left pant pocket to
text: check for his wallet. Nothing there.
text: Curtis notices, picks up a wallet sitting on the coffee table
text: and tosses it to him.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Gerry holds his wallet awkwardly, fighting against the urge to
text: look inside.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Go on. Count it.
text: Gerry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Naw, I don’t--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: C'mon. It’s okay.
text: He opens the wallet, quickly checks his cash and cards, then
text: slips it into his left pocket.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Trusting a stranger, Gerry. It’s just
dialog: one of those things.
scene_heading: INT. GERRY'S HOUSE - DAY 11
text: Gerry enters his home through the side kitchen door with a stack
text: of mail. He flips on the light switch, but nothing happens. He
text: turns the switch off and on again. Still nothing. He mutters
text: to himself, but doesn’t appear surprised that the electricity
dialog: has been shut off.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Honey, I’m home.

speaker_heading: GERRY.
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. GERRY'S LIVING ROOM 13
text: Gerry changes his clothes in a hurry, when his cell phone rings.
text: He checks the number, sees an incoming call from SAM, and
dialog: declines it.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY 14
text: Wearing dark shades to conceal his hangover, Gerry fumbles with
text: a huge key ring outside the front door. He can’t find the right
dialog: key for this home’s lock.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Okay, I think this is it...
text: He jams the key in and furiously wiggles it, but it won’t turn.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nope. We’ll get there.
dialog: He tries another one.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 20.
speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: CURTIS

dialog: beautiful, Gerry. They walked it
dialog: through, you should have seen it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Good legs?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: Great legs. Strong, but agile. He’s a
dialog: real winner.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I can’t remember the last time I’ve
dialog: been to a dog track.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: But you love cats. Am I right?
text: Gerry stares at Curtis. How could he possibly know this?
text: Curtis pinches a clump of cat hair off Gerry’s coat. Gerry
text: smiles, tries to brush off the remaining cat hair.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I’m more of a poker man. Poker and
dialog: sports.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It’s a sport for dogs. C’mon, let’s
dialog: get closer.
dialog: (to the regulars)
dialog: Good luck you beautiful losers!
speaker_heading: LOSER
dialog: Give’m hell, weirdo!
text: Curtis and Gerry stroll to the seating area.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Did you know Herbert Hoover was the

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Right here in Iowa.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You win anything yet?
dialog: Alg
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 21.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m only here for one race.
text: ON THE TRACK. The dogs step into the starting gate. A19
text: GRANDSTAND. A commotion erupts behind Curtis and Gerry as
text: betters cheer on a horse from the off-track-betting monitors.
text: Drawn in by the excitement, Gerry turns around to watch. Curtis
text: notices, pulls his attention back towards the dogs.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Be here now, Gerry. This is the only
dialog: race.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: HERE COMES RUSTY!!
text: A HORN sounds and the dogs sprint out of the gate, chasing a
text: furry lure (Rusty) attached to a mechanical arm.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Here we go!
text: The announcer provides a moment by moment description of the
text: race as the dogs tear into the first turn.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I can’t see. Where is he?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: C'mon rainbow!
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
text: Coming out of the first turn it’s
dialog: Goldilocks followed by Mystery Train.
text: As the other spectators cheer on their picks, a cacophony of
text: voices shouting out different numbers nearly drowns out the
text: announcer’s voice.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Where is he? Which number’s ours?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Number four! *
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
text: Coming up on the outside is Dynamic

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: C'mon rainbow!
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Cc’mon four!
text: As the dogs come into the home stretch, we see dog #4 (Dynamic
dialog: Rainbow) move up into second place. Gerry and Curtis go nuts,
text: urging on their dog.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: C'mon rainbow!
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hot damn! C’mon rainbow!
text: Dynamic Rainbow is now even with the leader as they approach the
text: finish line. Gerry lets out a howl.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
text: And it’s Dynamic Rainbow by a nose.
text: Curtis screams, hugs Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What? What did he say?
text: Curtis doesn’t respond, but continues to dance in celebration,
text: breaking into song...
speaker_heading: CURITS
dialog: “Somewhere over the rainbow...”
text: The realization finally sets in and Gerry joins in the
text: celebration dance as if he just scored the winning touchdown of
text: the Superbowl. He screams and points at the other spectators,
dialog: which may go against proper track etiquette, but who cares?
text: The triumph is short-lived, however, as Gerry is suddenly
text: overcome with despair.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I fucking bet to place!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You still won big.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I’m an idiot! Why didn’t I listen to

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 23.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Gerry, we won. Let’s go celebrate!
dialog: We'll get some drinks, meet some

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Go where? I love this place. We can
dialog: have drinks here, meet ladies here.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Gerry, Gerry, Gerry... It don’t get any
dialog: better than this. Let’s go have some
dialog: fun!
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I just got here! Okay, listen to
dialog: this... next person through that door--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Gerry--
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: If the next person through that door is
text: wearing glasses, we stay for one more.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You’re on.
text: They look over to the men’s room door, where a gray-haired man
text: with a cane and glasses, steps out. Gerry smiles.
scene_heading: INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT 20
text: Gerry and Curtis drink bourbon at the bar.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’1l tell you what, Gerry... never bet
dialog: on a dog named after a disabled
dialog: president.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I thought it was Teddy.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Rollin’ Roosevelt?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It was a good name.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It was not a good name. Next time
dialog: listen when I say it’s time.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 24.
text: Gerry’s phone registers a new message. He checks it, then tucks
text: it away, ignoring the text.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: There was this guy back in Kansas City,
dialog: Archie Hannahan. Never knew when to
dialog: quit.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I know where this is going and you
dialog: don’t need to tell me--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Listen, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Archie owed every poker player in town
dialog: at least a few hundred bucks. Got to
dialog: the point where he was asking his
dialog: little nephews for the change in their
dialog: piggy banks. One day he’s in the poker
text: room at Harrah’s. I walk over to say
dialog: hello, notice he’s got a handsome pile
dialog: of chips, over five grand. Archie
dialog: starts bragging that he started the
dialog: night with just sixty bucks-- sixty
dialog: bucks he borrowed from some new chump,
dialog: by the way. So I pull him aside, tell
dialog: him he should cash out now. He’s got
dialog: enough there to pay back everyone he
dialog: owes and still get a slab at Oklahoma
dialog: Joe's. “You're right, you're right,” he
dialog: tells me. “I’1ll stop as soon as the
text: blind comes around.” I smile, walk
dialog: over to my table thinking I'd done a
dialog: good deed... Next thing I hear is
text: Archie's high-pitched voice saying...
dialog: “I'm all in!”
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: And then he lost it all.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Of course he lost it all. But you know
dialog: what he says to me? “Don’t worry. It
dialog: was only sixty bucks.”
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Some guys are just born to lose.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 25.
text: A burst of jubilation from the pool tables nearby draw Curtis
text: and Gerry’s attention.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You play?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: A little, but not in a long--
text: Before Gerry can finish, Curtis is calling out across the room.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hey! Twenty bucks on my friend here.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What’re you doing?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m gonna watch you play this big
dialog: winner here. You said you played.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s been a long time.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: So you'll lose.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No, you'll lose.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m spending twenty bucks to watch you
dialog: make a fool of yourself. That’s not
dialog: losing; that’s entertainment.
text: Gerry smiles. Who does this guy think he is?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Okay. You want entertainment?
text: Gerry strolls over to the Big Winner’s table.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s make it a hundred.
text: Curtis’ demeanor suddenly shifts.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Whoa, hey, Gerry! Play nice now.
text: Big Winner smiles, racks up the balls, as Gerry chalks his cue,
text: and leans over the table. Curtis sips his drink, then--
dialog: 21
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 26.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Five hundred!
text: Gerry pauses, looks to Big Winner who is now looking a little
text: less confident. He nods in agreement anyway.
text: Not to be outdone, Gerry stares down Curtis, then...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Let’s play for a thousand.
text: Curtis smiles, loving it, but Big Winner (and his friends) are
text: not amused. OTHER FOLKS at the bar also begin to take notice
text: and step over.
text: Gerry leans over the table, prepared to break, but Big Winner
text: puts his hat over the cue ball--
speaker_heading: BIG WINNER
dialog: That’s enough. You fellas don’t belong
dialog: here, do you?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I’m really not very good at this.
text: Curtis steps over to the table, pulls Gerry away, while Big
text: Winner and his tough guy friends give hard looks.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Let’s go, Gerry. These guys don’t want
dialog: our money.
text: Curtis and Gerry head for the exit and we HOLD ON A SKINNY THUG
text: watching them go.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL HALL - NIGHT 21
text: Curtis and Gerry stroll through the parking lot, laughing.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I can't believe you almost blew a
dialog: thousand bucks of my money.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Are you kidding? I just saved you from
dialog: losing twenty... So what are you up to
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I think it’s Macchu Picchu time for me.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Say again?
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 27.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Time for me to hit the road.
text: Gerry tries to conceal his disappointment.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Okay. Well, it was great to meet you.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You too, Gerry. Good luck.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You need a ride someplace?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Nah, I’m just gonna steal a bike.
text: Gerry smiles, watches Curtis drift away, then wanders over to
text: his car. He reaches into his pocket, fumbling with his keys,
text: when the skinny thug from the bar approaches him with a
text: cigarette in hand.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Hey man, you got a light?
text: Beat. Gerry looks the guy over.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Uh, no, sorry...
text: Suddenly, the thug pulls out a switchblade.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw man, what’s that for?
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Gimme the money.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I don’t have any money.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Bullshit. Thousand dollar bets? I
dialog: heard you back there.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I can’t believe this.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Just give it to me!
dialog: 22
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 28.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I told you, I don’t have any money! I
dialog: lost it on Rollin’ Roosevelt.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Don’t make me cut you.
text: The thug threatens him with the knife. Gerry is getting
text: nervous.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Okay, just relax.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Hurry up!
text: Gerry takes out his wallet. Flashes it. Empty.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Do I look stupid?
text: A burst of LAUGHTER breaks out from the pool hall exit.
text: Startled, the thug reacts by stabbing Gerry in the belly (not
text: deep) and booking it out of there. Gerry cups his stomach, then
text: checks his hand, now bloodied by the wound.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Damnit!
text: Gerry realizes the thug dropped his knife before running. He
text: picks it up.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You forgot this, asshole!
text: He throws the knife. Winces in pain. Gerry gathers himself,
text: then climbs in the car.
scene_heading: INT. BLUEBERRY HILL DINER 22
text: Gerry steps into the diner, looks around, and spots SAM
text: (Samantha, a gentle-looking woman in her 50s). She hugs Gerry
text: like they’re old friends having a reunion. Gerry hugs her back,
text: but we sense his discomfort.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 29.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It’s so great to see you, Gerry. How
dialog: long’s it been?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. A few months now.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Too long. It’s been too long. You've
dialog: been avoiding me, haven’t you?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No, I--
text: The WAITER steps up.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to Gerry)
dialog: Can I bring you anything to drink?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Um, coffee, please.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Forgive me, I got here a few minutes
dialog: early, and ordered a salad. But order
dialog: anything you like. It’s on me.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Oh, no, that’s okay.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Of course, it’s okay. I insist.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thank you. I’11 have a burger, medium-
dialog: rare. And fries.
text: The waiter walks away.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: And how are you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, you know, same old grind. I’d love
dialog: to retire soon, but it feels like a
dialog: long way off. How’s the real-estate?
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: Slow and low.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That’s too bad. I’m sure it’1l pick
text: up.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 30.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yeah. Eventually.
text: A long, awkward pause. Gerry tunes in to the details of Sam’s
text: behavior: her nail CLICKING against her coffee mug, her FALSE
text: SMILE, the narrowing of her eyes as she stares at Gerry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don’t make me ask, Gerry...
text: Gerry straightens up, as the waiter returns with a salad.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Unbelievable. Excuse me, I asked for
text: the dressing on the side.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry. Do you want me to take
dialog: it back?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want you to hold it between your
text: knees.
text: The waiter stares at her, confused.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Gerry)
dialog: He doesn’t get it... Yes, take it back,
dialog: please.
text: The waiter takes off with the salad, and Sam calls after him.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m here three days a week and every
dialog: time with the dressing. Oh, boy.
dialog: What’re you gonna do?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What’re you gonna do?
text: Another odd beat. An uncomfortable tension is mounting.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, look-- I had eight hundred last
dialog: night and some meth head robbed me by
dialog: knife point and stabbed me in the gut.
text: He lifts up his shirt, revealing the blood-stained bandage.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT’D)
dialog: See?
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 31.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, god, you should have that checked
dialog: out. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yeah. Thankfully.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can’t imagine.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It was pretty scary.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, at least you’re okay.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Just a scratch.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Could have been a lot worse ya know?
text: Beat. Gerry sips his coffee, recognizing Sam’s veiled threat.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: So what did you bring me today?
text: Gerry nervously opens his wallet, hands over everything in it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: That’s about eighty. I’11 have more
dialog: for you next week. I mean I had eight
dialog: hundred, but--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: --the meth head.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: The fucking meth head.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It was a bad beat.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: The worst.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Things’1l look up.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: They always do.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well... not always.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 32.
text: Another threat. Another tense beat. The waiter returns with
dialog: Sam’s salad.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That’s okay. I’m sorry about that
text: knees comment. It’s from a movie. I
dialog: couldn’t resist.
text: Sam’s phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you mind?

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)

dialog: need to bring him into this. If you
dialog: could just give me a few more days, I
dialog: have a commission coming in--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: --Get it together, Gerry.
text: Sam stands up and lays $40 of Gerry’s money on the table. Gerry
text: puts his hand over hers.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I had the money.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I’m sure you did.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: This time it wasn’t my fault.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I understand.
text: Sam yanks her hand back and starts walking away.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Just a few more days! Things are

scene_heading: INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY 23

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I’m gonna head out now, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY

scene_heading: INT. HOME CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT 26
text: Surrounded by hanging tarp and construction materials, SIX MEN
text: sit around a card table, playing poker, Gerry among them.
text: The other players banter back and forth, relaxed and friendly,
text: but Gerry sits low in his chair, playing quiet and tense.
text: He watches as another player collects a pile of chips.
text: New cards are dealt, and Gerry takes a peek. He folds his hand
text: immediately, slouches deeper into his chair.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT 27
text: Gerry drinks, slumped over the bar-- the same bar he met Curtis
text: in. He’s been there awhile, but orders another bourbon. He
text: mumbles to himself as he pulls a crumpled single and a handful
text: of change from his pocket, counting out the last of his cash.

dialog: Yeah, we play softball on weekends.

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Listen, what I’m getting at here--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Does it hurt?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No-- it stings a little. What I’m
dialog: getting at, Curtis... Good things

dialog: things when you leave.
dialog: Where is this going?
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I was just sitting here thinking before

dialog: Can I ask you a personal question?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You may.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: How much money do you owe?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: A lot.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: To who?
text: Gerry thinks of the best way to answer this, then--
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Everyone.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I gotta be honest with you, Gerry... I
dialog: don’t think this is realistic.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I’m a damn good poker player.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: That may be true--
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: --this is very realistic.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It is. It’s extremely realistic.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Not with five hundred...
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 39.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You'd be amazed what I can do with--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’1l stake you two thousand. Your car,
dialog: my cash.
text: Hold on Gerry-- a little stunned, as if he’d never expected
dialog: Curtis to go along with his plan. Then...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hot damn. That’s what I’m talkin’
text: about.
scene_heading: 28 INT. GERRY’S HOUSE - MORNING 28
text: Gerry fills a second cat bowl with food. The cat meows her
text: disapproval, so Gerry takes down two more bowls and fills them
text: next to the others.
text: He opens his dark refrigerator and dumps the rotting food into a
text: garbage bag.
text: Gerry picks up his cat, gives her a kiss.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Wish me luck.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. GERRY’S CAR - OUTSIDE DENISE’S HOUSE - DAY 29
text: “200 Poker Tells” plays on the stereo, as Gerry taps the horn.
text: Curtis comes out with his leather duffel bag, climbs in the car.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Where’s your cat?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: My house.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You just left her all alone?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: She’1ll be fine.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Uh-huh...
text: Curtis slams the door, and they pull away.
scene_heading: 30 INT. GERRY’S CAR - MINUTES LATER 30
text: Heading southbound on the highway.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 40.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Tony Roundtree once had a pet tiger.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: A pet tiger?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: He won it playing baccarat with an Arab
text: prince. Cleans the guy out, the prince
text: doesn’t want to stop playing so he puts
text: his tiger on the table-- not literally,
dialog: but you know.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Joke was on Tony, though. Didn’t know
dialog: he’d be hemorrhaging money on the
dialog: thing. He’s got to register it with
dialog: the federal government, get a special
dialog: permit. Costs a fortune. And he can’t
dialog: leave it alone for more than a few
dialog: hours or it rips up his furniture. Not
dialog: easy to find a pet sitter for a
dialog: carnivorous tiger, so what’s the guy do
dialog: when he travels?
text: Curtis pauses for effect. Smiles.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: First time I met him was on the bar car
dialog: of an Amtrak train from Denver to
dialog: Albuquerque. I remember he wore a blue
dialog: velvet smoking jacket and drank from a
dialog: copper flask.
text: Gerry nods, developing a picture of Tony Roundtree in his mind.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: And the tiger...?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Tranquilized and checked with the other
dialog: cargo.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: He checked a tiger? On an Amtrak train?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Apparently they have a policy. But
dialog: wanna know what it costs to check a 600
dialog: pound animal?
dialog: 31
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 41.
text: Beat. Gerry shrugs, waiting for it. But Curtis’s attention is
text: suddenly drawn to the car radio.
speaker_heading: JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE
dialog: Number twenty-three: Dilated Pupils...
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hold on-- what’re we listening to?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: This is “200 Poker Tells” by Joe
dialog: Navarro. It relaxes me.
speaker_heading: JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE
dialog: When we are comfortable or like
dialog: something, our pupils dilate. We have
dialog: no control over this and with players
dialog: that have blue or green eyes, it can be
dialog: quite visible. Remember, sudden pupil
text: dilation says, “I like what I see.”
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: How often do you listen to this?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Whenever I’m driving.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Are you gonna make me listen to this
dialog: all the way to New Orleans?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We don’t have to listen to it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Thank you.
text: Curtis ejects the CD, hooks up an AUX cable to his iPhone. A
text: funky blues song begins to play. At first hesitant, Gerry
text: begins to bob his head, enjoying the music.
scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD HIGHWAY - DAY 31
text: Gerry’s car cruises past a highway sign: “St. Louis 211 miles.”

scene_heading: EXT/INT. GERRY’S CAR - LATER THAT DAY 32
text: The music
dialog: in play.
dialog: he checks
dialog: didn’t last long, as Gerry has “200 Poker Tells” back
text: Curtis is asleep next to him. Gerry’s phone rings and
text: the call. Declines it. Curtis stirs awake.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You bring any snacks?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I have some jerky in the backseat.
dialog: Grab me some too.
text: Curtis leans into the back seat, comes back with a plastic
text: grocery bag and a cigar box.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Nice! You brought cigars?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Oh no that’s not--
text: Curtis opens the box to find a random assortment of items.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What’s all this?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Nothing. It’s an emergency fund. Just
dialog: in case.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: In case of what?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Emergency.
text: Curtis looks through the box, finds a couple watches, several
dialog: rare coins, vintage baseball cards, and--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: This a wedding ring?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Get outta here; you were married?
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 43.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hard to believe, huh?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I didn’t mean it like that... What
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: She left.
text: Before Curtis can respond, Gerry turns up the car radio volume.
text: Curtis watches Gerry, who stares straight ahead, trying to focus
text: on Joe Navarro’s voice. Clearly, this is still a sore subject.
speaker_heading: JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE
dialog: False smiles are used by bluffers.
dialog: They look odd because sometimes only
text: one side of the face is involved or the
text: smile goes towards the ear rather than
text: the eyes. It is an obvious sign of
dialog: weakness and lack of confidence...
scene_heading: 33 EXT. ST. LOUIS STEAMBOAT - SIDE DECK 33
text: Gerry waits behind Curtis as he KNOCKS on a cabin door. A sexy
text: redhead, (SIMONE, 30s) answers.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hi.
text: She stares at him, smiling.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m Curtis.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Simone.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m wondering if you might be able to

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: What sort of woman you looking for?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Oh, about this tall...
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 44.
text: He extends his hand to her height, then describes her features.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
text: Cinnamon hair... soft pale skin...
text: devastating blue eyes...
text: They exchange long, familiar grins. Gerry looks on, waiting for
dialog: the payoff.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Hmm, I think I’ve seen this woman
dialog: you're looking for.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (leaning in to her)
dialog: I know she’s close. I’ve been tracking
text: her sweet scent for miles.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: They say working class hound dogs have
dialog: the best sense of smell.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Woof woof.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Well don’t just stand there barking,
dialog: little doggy. Come inside and get
dialog: yourself a treat.
text: We hold on Gerry wondering what the hell is going on.
scene_heading: 34 INT. PRIVATE CABIN DRESSING ROOM 34
text: Gerry and Curtis enter the tight cabin, which is being used as a
text: dressing room.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Gerry, meet Simone.
text: Simone hands them each a coat on a hanger.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: These were the best I could do.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Did I ever tell you you’re amazing?
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Too often to feel sincere.
text: As Curtis begins to disrobe, Gerry looks for a private place to
dialog: put on his suit.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 45.
text: His eyes stop on a cracked curtain, where a topless woman (20s)
text: is applying makeup in front of a vanity mirror. He stares for a
text: beat too long, until she notices and he looks away. She smiles
text: and slides the curtain shut.
speaker_heading: SIMONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t be shy, Gerry, we’re all friends.
text: Gerry smiles awkwardly, starts unbuttoning his shirt.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You guys play poker?
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: No, we just work here, honey.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What is it you do?
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Vanessa and I get paid for our

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Oh... Got it.
text: VANESSA-- the woman from the bathroom-- emerges in a gown.
text: Gerry is now topless.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (re: his gut bandage)
dialog: What happened there?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s nothing.
speaker_heading: VANESSA

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Not yet, sweetie. But it’s on the

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (to Gerry)
dialog: You can change in there if you want it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thanks.
text: BEHIND THE CURTAIN 35
text: Gerry shuts himself in the dressing area, looks in the mirror.
text: He pulls back the bandage to reveal a red and swollen wound. He
text: grimaces, then replaces the bandage.
text: Gerry scrunches his face to release tension like we saw him do
text: in the opening scene.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVING STEAMBOAT DECK - SUNSET 36
text: From the front deck, we see clearly for the first time that we
text: are floating down the Mississippi River on a private steamboat.
text: Suited up in cheap ill-fitting coats and sipping champagne,
text: Curtis and Gerry stare at the St. Louis skyline drifting by.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: First thing when we get to New Orleans
dialog: we buy new suits.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I don’t really wear suits.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Well we can’t go to Tony’s dressed like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: In that case, I’ve always wanted a

dialog: Mental note: next trip, open sea.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What's this about Peru?
dialog: (off Curtis’s look)
dialog: You told Vanessa...
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It’s kind of a joke. Like when I

dialog: it’s time to move on, I’1l say, “It’s
dialog: Machu Picchu time.”
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Machu Picchu time?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You might say it’s the end of my
dialog: rainbow... A place so exotic and
dialog: mysterious, I could get lost and never
dialog: come back... And it’s fun to say.
dialog: Machu Picchu. Try it.
speaker_heading: GERRY

dialog: 40
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 48.
text: AT THE TABLE 38
text: Gerry checks the pair of cards he’s dealt and puts in a couple
text: chips to meet the blind. As the flop is dealt, Gerry slouches
text: in his chair ever so slightly. When the betting comes around to
text: him, he thinks for a beat, then folds his hand.
text: BACK AT THE BAR 39
text: Curtis looks around, but still can’t find anyone to get hima
text: drink. IT’S THE FIRST TIME THAT WE’VE SEEN HIM ALONE, WITHOUT
text: AN AUDIENCE, AND HE DOESN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF.
text: He scans the room, notices Simone giving a massage to one of the
text: players. He watches for an extended beat, until she looks up,
text: making brief eye contact. Curtis motions for her to come over,
text: but she turns away.
text: Desperate, Curtis stands up, starts slow dancing with an
text: invisible partner until Simone can't ignore him anymore. She

scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF THE BOAT - LATER THAT NIGHT 40

dialog: Tell me something I don’t know about
dialog: St. Louis.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I’ve only been here a few months.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: That’s no excuse. I was in Iowa for a
dialog: few days and I can tell you that Marion
dialog: Robert Morrison was born in Winterset,
dialog: Iowa, 1907.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Am I supposed to know who that is?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You probably know him by his stage
dialog: name: John Wayne. I can also tell you
dialog: that Iowa is the only state in the

dialog: And that the National Balloon Museum in

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (sitting next to her)
dialog: Doesn’t matter. Lay it on me.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: You know how some hotels put little
dialog: chocolates on pillows for their guests?
dialog: That was started in St. Louis by...
dialog: You’re supposed to guess who.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Ben Franklin.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Close. Cary Grant. Apparently, he was
dialog: staying in the Mayfair and wooing a

text: Curtis smiles at first, but then...
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: A friend.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I don’t remember.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: C'mon, think about it.
speaker_heading: SIMONE

text: a neck massage to a different player at the table, watching as
text: the tension mounts.
text: On the table, the Ten and Nine of spades are displayed alongside
text: the King of diamonds. A significant mound of chips is already
dialog: in play.
text: Gerry, holding two spades (the King and Four) has a pair of
dialog: Kings with a good chance for a flush. There is also a straight
dialog: opportunity on the board, if his opponent can make a Queen/Jack.
text: Gerry places a bet for five hundred dollars, and the Professor
text: raises the pot to a thousand. Gerry quietly meets the bet.
text: The TUXEDOED DEALER lays down the turn... the three of hearts...
dialog: which can’t help anyone.
text: Gerry studies his opponent. Could he have the straight? Gerry
text: doesn’t bet this time around, checking to the Professor...
text: .+-who confidently tosses in a thousand dollars in chips.
text: Gerry meets the thousand, and everyone at the table waits for
dialog: the last card... A seven of hearts.
text: Gerry doesn’t make his spade flush. With only the pair of
dialog: Kings, he checks.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 50A.
text: The Professor calmly counts out his chips and...
dialog: 42
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 51.
text: ...pushes all of them towards the center of the table. Hold on
text: Gerry looking for the tell.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: How do you get a sweet, little old lady
dialog: to shout, “Go fuck yourself!”
text: Some players smile or chuckle, but Gerry focuses his attention
text: on the Professor.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You get another sweet little old lady
dialog: to shout, “Bingo!”
text: Vanessa and the other players genuinely laugh. Gerry’s opponent
text: attempts to give a carefree chuckle, however it comes off as
text: fake. He’s got him. Gerry meets the bet, calling the
dialog: Professor's bluff.
text: The Professor mucks his cards to the dealer, frustrated. Gerry

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: That’s what you said about George.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Sure.
text: Dorothy goes into the kitchen.
text: Gerry pulls out a chair, which gets stuck on a stuffed animal on
text: the floor. He picks up the stuffed animal and sits, nervously
text: fidgeting with it as he glances around the room. He sees a
text: family photo of Dorothy and another man posing with a little
text: girl-- Gerry’s daughter, WENDY (6, adorable with curls).
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE GERRY’S CAR 69
text: Inspired by Gerry, Curtis picks up his phone, begins to dial.

speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: At school.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: That’s good... And how are things with
dialog: Gary?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Things are good.
text: Beat. They sip their tea. Gerry focuses in on little details
text: of Dorothy’s body, as if looking for “tells” in a poker
dialog: opponent.
text: Gerry’s POV: her tight pursed lips, tense jaw, blinking eyes,
text: her hand fidgeting with her wedding ring...
text: She notices him looking at her hand.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY (CONT'D)
dialog: We got married.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Congratulations.
text: It’s even more awkward now.
scene_heading: EXT. GERRY’S CAR 71
text: Curtis holds his cell phone to his ear. We hear muffled

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Curtis?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hey darlin’.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Did I wake you? I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: It’s okay. Where are you?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: We’re on a little detour in Little

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: What happened to New Orleans?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: I’m sitting in a car outside Gerry’s ex-

dialog: trying to win her back. And it got me
dialog: thinking... about you, me, St. Louis,
dialog: Kansas City... all kinds of places,
dialog: really.
scene_heading: INT. DOROTHY’S LIVING ROOM 72
text: With Gerry attempting to break the awkwardness.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Do you ever think it’s funny you traded

text: She doesn’t. Gerry plots his next move, as Dorothy begins to
dialog: lose patience.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: He’s working.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Oh... what does he do?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: He’s an electrician.
text: Gerry nods. Then he notices another photo on the wall.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 77.
text: It features his daughter Wendy-- about 2 years old, sitting next
text: to a birthday cake, hugging a kitten (Gerry’s cat, a few years
text: younger). It’s a lovely photo, but something is amiss to Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Wait a second...
text: He moves over to the photo, takes it off the wall.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I was in this. You cut me out of this.
dialog: That’s my hand. Right there. You can
dialog: still see my hand.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I didn’t want you on my wall, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: So you just erase me from my daughter’s
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Is that a joke? You erased yourself
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No--
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: When’s the last time you visited or
dialog: sent a present on her birthday?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You know I’ve been having a hard time
dialog: with money, but--
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: It’s not about money. How about
dialog: checking her homework or making dinner
dialog: or, or just calling to say hi?
text: A long pause. Gerry doesn’t have any answers, So...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thanks for the tea. Can I use the
dialog: bathroom before I go?
text: Dorothy rolls her eyes, exasperated. Picks up his mug, brings
text: it to the kitchen.
text: Gerry sets down the picture on a shelf (balanced precariously)
text: as he makes his way down the hall. Before entering the
text: bathroom, he turns back to make sure she isn’t watching, then
text: ducks through the bedroom door on the right.

scene_heading: INT. DOROTHY’S BEDROOM 74
text: Gerry rummages through dresser drawers, looking for something
text: specific. After a few beats of searching, he finds it. A
text: purple stocking. He smiles, amused that she keeps the same
dialog: hiding place after all these years.
text: Gerry digs into the stocking, comes up with a wad of cash and
text: quickly counts out a stack of $100 bills. He puts the rest back
text: in the stocking, returns it to its hidden position, and closes
text: the drawer. He pockets the cash and turns toward the door, when--
dialog: 75
dialog: 76
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 79.
text: --He’s busted. Dorothy is perched in the doorway watching him.
text: A long awkward beat, but Dorothy doesn’t seem surprised.
text: Ashamed, Gerry takes the cash out of his pocket and puts it on
text: the dresser.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I was going to pay you back.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Get out.
text: Gerry slowly squeezes past Dorothy, into...
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY 75
text: Gerry stops, turns to Dorothy. He wants to say so much, but all
text: he can manage is a pathetic shrug.
text: Enough is enough. Dorothy shoves Gerry out of the hall and he
text: accidentally knocks over the photo of Wendy and his cat.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Shit!
text: The glass SHATTERS on the floor, and Gerry kneels down to pick
text: it up, but slices his hand in the process. He’s bleeding on the
text: floor and broken picture frame.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Leave. Now.
text: Still holding the photo, Gerry hurries towards the door. He
text: stuffs the bloodied photo in his pocket.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. GERRY’S CAR 76

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Simone...
speaker_heading: SIMONE

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: FRAT BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get off me!

dialog: I thought so. But one, two, three come

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: So how’d you lose a toe?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: My grandfather’s brilliant idea of

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Are you feeling it?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (he isn’t)
dialog: I'm feeling it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No. I need you to really feel it.
dialog: I‘1l ask you again-- is this our horse?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: This is our horse.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Is this our horse, Curtis?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: This is our horse, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Say it again.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Toto’s Revenge is our horse.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thank you.
text: Curtis takes a few steps away towards the betting window, while
text: Gerry watches him.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 92.
text: 93 GRANDSTAND - MINUTES LATER 93
text: They both sit down in the sparsely populated seating area.
text: Gerry anxiously bites his lip, as the horses step into the
text: starting gate.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: She’s a winner. I can feel it.
text: Curtis nods. A bell sounds and the horses fly out of the gate.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon three!
text: Curtis remains silent, as the horses pull into the first turn.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: And it’s Toto’s Revenge breaking out
dialog: into the lead with Sweet Feet and
text: Mississippi Grind on the outside.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Hot damn! C’mon Toto!
text: Gerry leaps to his feet, while Curtis stares straight ahead,
text: unable to watch.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Toto’s Revenge loses steam with Sweet
text: Feet moving into the front of the pack.
dialog: And here comes Mississippi Grind on the
dialog: outside!
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No! C’mon Toto! Damnit, c’mon you
dialog: stupid horse!
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Mississippi Grind and Sweet Feet are

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Run! Run! Don’t stop!
text: The horses cross the finish line.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: And it’s Mississippi Grind at the
dialog: finish line!
text: Gerry and Curtis both stare at the track in shock. Gerry can’t
text: believe it. He lowers his head, closes his eyes.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 93.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It had to end like this, Gerry. Here’s
dialog: a hundred bucks. Get yourself a bus
dialog: ticket and go home.
text: Gerry perks up.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You didn’t bet it all?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I saved us a hundred each. Just in
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: So we have two hundred.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: No. You have one hundred. I have one
dialog: hundred.
text: Gerry fumbles through the schedule, looking at the lineup for
dialog: the next race.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Thunder Clap!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Stop it, Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Forty to one. We lay the two hundred
dialog: and we're back in business.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: We're done.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: What about Tony Roundtree? My white
dialog: suit? We can still make it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: It’s over Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: But we’re so close.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It was a fantasy.
dialog: 94
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 94,
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We just need to believe--
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It was never going to happen for us,
dialog: Gerry.
text: Beat. Gerry looks Curtis over, as if searching for a tell. Did
dialog: he find it?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: So that’s that.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Thanks for the ride. I’m sorry it
dialog: didn’t work out.
text: Gerry nods. He gives a false smile and heads for the exit.
text: We HOLD on Curtis for an extended beat, until he finally stands
text: up, slowly strolls to the...
scene_heading: INT. HORSE TRACK BETTING WINDOWS 94
text: Curtis calmly steps up to the teller, hands her his ticket.
text: She processes the ticket, then proceeds to count out a large sum
text: of cash. Curtis stares at it without emotion.
text: The teller loads a stack of $100 bills into an envelope. Curtis
text: takes the envelope and turns around to find...
text: ...Gerry. Standing a few feet back. Watching him.
text: The two stare at each other for an extended beat, then...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I thought you didn’t care about the
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Then, why?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It’s not fun watching you lose.
text: Gerry looks away, unsure what to say. Then...
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: How’d you know it was Mississippi
dialog: Grind?
dialog: 95
dialog: 96
dialog: 97
dialog: 98
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 95.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: He was the favorite.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: But how’d you know?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I didn't. It’s not magic, Gerry.
text: Curtis lets this land, then hands over the envelope of cash.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, take it.
text: Gerry stares at the money, but shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I'd just blow it anyway, right?
text: He walks away, leaving Curtis with the cash in his hand. HOLD
text: ON Curtis, watching Gerry go.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. STREETCAR - DUSK 95
text: CLOSE ON Gerry staring out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER HOOD - DUSK 96
text: Curtis strolls down the street in a rougher part of town with a
text: cigarette hanging between his lips. He gets strange looks from
text: the LOCALS as he swigs from a flask.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETCAR - DUSK/NIGHT 97
text: Gerry dials 4-1-1 and an operator answers.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: New Orleans, Louisiana... Last name
dialog: Roundtree. First name Tony.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT 98
text: A dimly lit court, where a two-on-two basketball game is taking
text: place among some rough and tumble LOCALS. Curtis approaches the
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You fellas know where a guy can shoot
dialog: some darts around here?
text: The tough-looking players stop their game and size Curtis up.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 96.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘1l play your best guy for a hundred
dialog: bucks.
scene_heading: 99 EXT. ALGIERS NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 99
text: A cab pulls away, leaving Gerry standing in front of an ordinary
text: single-story house, dwarfed beneath a lit-up bridge. Less than
text: glamorous. He checks the address in his hand. This is not how
dialog: he imagined Tony Roundtree’s home.
text: Gerry cautiously approaches the front door. Knocks. He looks
text: both ways down the street.
scene_heading: 100 EXT. PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT 100
text: Curtis is doing his best, but he is extremely overmatched by his
text: opponent, who dunks over him.
scene_heading: 101 EXT. TONY ROUNDTREE’S HOUSE 101
text: A disheveled man (late 60s) opens the door. An e-cigarette
text: between his lips. He is TONY ROUNDTREE. He stares blankly at
dialog: Gerry.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Tony? Tony Roundtree?
text: Tony sizes Gerry up, says nothing.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m Gerry. You don’t know me, but I’m
dialog: a friend of Curtis.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Curtis Vonn.
text: Tony sucks on his e-cig. His silence is unnerving.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there a poker game here tonight?
dialog: Still nothing.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you the Tony Roundtree I’m looking
dialog: for? You met Curtis on an Amtrak train
dialog: to Albuquerque?
dialog: (suddenly uncertain, even
dialog: as he says it...)
dialog: (MORE )
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 97.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: He said you were wearing a Blue Velvet
dialog: smoking jacket and traveling with a
dialog: tiger you won from an Arab prince?
text: Tony stares at Gerry. The ultimate poker face.
scene_heading: 102 EXT. PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT 102
text: Curtis’ opponent hits a fade-away jump-shot.
speaker_heading: BALLER
dialog: That’s game... Hundred bucks.
text: Curtis stares at the guy, smiling.
speaker_heading: BALLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Something funny?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I don’t have it.
speaker_heading: BALLER
dialog: You don’t have the money?
text: Curtis shrugs as the other players converge onto the court,
text: surrounding him.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What’re you gonna do about it?
text: And WHACK! He is immediately punched in the face. Falls down.
scene_heading: 103 EXT. TONY ROUNDTREE’S HOUSE 103
text: Gerry pleads with Tony.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You lived in Detroit, right? That's
dialog: where you became a disassociated person
dialog: who couldn’t collect on a bad beat
dialog: jackpot. Please, tell me you know what
dialog: I'm talking about. There can't be two
dialog: Tony Roundtrees in New Orleans.
text: A long, excruciating beat. Then finally...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know Curtis?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yes! Yes, I know Curtis. He’s a
dialog: friend. A close, personal friend of
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14
text: Tony continues to look Gerry over.
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you hosting a poker game here
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Curtis with you?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: No. He couldn’t make it. But he
dialog: wanted me to let you know that you
dialog: should let me in.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Let you in?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Okay, full disclosure-- I’m a little
dialog: short on the buy-in. I’ma little
dialog: short. But you seem like a reasonable
dialog: guy and I’m willing to bet we can work
dialog: something out. You know what I mean?
dialog: Some kind of financial agreement-- like
dialog: say sixty/forty... or seventy/thirty?
dialog: 98.
text: There is a long awkward pause between them. Tony starts to
text: laugh. So Gerry does the same. Both men are laughing, then--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What’s your name, man?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Gerry.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: And you say Curtis is a close friend of
dialog: yours?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Yes! Very close. Extremely close. We
dialog: go back-- oh, I don’t know...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Gerry, can you give Curtis a message
dialog: for me?
text: Before Gerry has time to respond--
text: WHACK! Tony socks Gerry in the face. Gerry stumbles back. And
text: before he knows what hit him, Tony goes inside, SLAMMING THE
text: DOOR behind him. HOLD ON Gerry rubbing his jaw.

scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT 104
text: Curtis’ nose is swollen and bleeding. His opponent hovers over
text: him, grabs him by the collar, and digs into his jacket pocket.
text: He comes up empty, then digs into the other pocket.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Bingo.
text: The baller’s hand comes out of Curtis’ coat with the envelope.
speaker_heading: BALLER
dialog: (seeing the cash)
dialog: What’s wrong with you, man?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I had it coming.
speaker_heading: BALLER
dialog: There’s like five grand in here.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: So take it.
speaker_heading: BALLER
dialog: You're a crazy son of a bitch, you know
dialog: that?
text: The baller peels off two hundred dollar bills, pockets them, and
text: tucks the envelope back in Curtis’ jacket. He and his friends
text: leave the court, shaking their heads.
text: Curtis stands up, dusts himself off.
scene_heading: EXT. CANAL STREET - NIGHT 105
text: PAN off of a receding streetcar onto Gerry looking off-screen.

scene_heading: INT. CRESCENT LOUNGE - NIGHT 106
text: An OLDER WOMAN, life experience etched on her face, sings and
text: plays the piano in the corner with a three-piece band. The bar
text: patrons chat quietly and listen to the music. No tourists in
text: sight-- this place is a far cry from the French Quarter.
text: Curtis pauses as he steps through the door, watches the jazz
text: singer for an extended beat before making his way to the bar.
text: Curtis sits down and the bartender (PETE, 50s) seems to
text: recognize him. They shake hands.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s been too long, man. How ya been?
dialog: 107
dialog: 108

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 100.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Livin’ the dream.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What happened to your face?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You should see the other guy’s hand.
dialog: Gimme a bourbon.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Cheap stuff.
text: The bartender pours some cheap shot of bourbon for Curtis who
text: continues to watch and listen to the woman performing.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN CASINO 107
text: Gerry strolls past the slots, but stops upon seeing a bedazzled
text: slot machine with a blinking rainbow theme. He thinks for a
text: beat, then digs into his pocket for a quarter.
text: He deposits it into the machine, pushes the spin button, and the
text: reels start spinning... one, two, three, they come to a stop
dialog: with no winning combination. The rainbow magic is gone. Gerry
text: thinks for a beat, then walks away.
scene_heading: INT. CRESCENT LOUNGE - NIGHT 108
text: The jazz singer finishes her set to mellow applause and steps
text: off the stage. She notices Curtis and approaches the bar, where
text: the bartender has a mint julep waiting for her. Curtis smiles.
speaker_heading: SINGER
dialog: Thanks, Pete. You got my smokes?
text: Pete, the bartender, passes her a handbag from behind the bar,
text: and she takes out a pack of cigarettes. Curtis lights her up.
speaker_heading: SINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks darlin’.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Happy birthday, mom.

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 101.
text: Gerry steps up, lays down his $100 bill. He takes a seat as the
text: croupier changes his bill, handing him a stack of chips.
text: Gerry places ALL OF HIS CHIPS onto the “double zero” square with
dialog: 37-1 odds, one of the least probable bets on a roulette table.
text: Then steps back and nods to himself, resigned to lose.
scene_heading: INT. CRESCENT LOUNGE 110
text: Curtis’ mom, CHERRY VONN, sits down beside him. Years of
dialog: smoking and drinking and crooning have taken their toll on
text: Cherry's voice, which is rough and tough.
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: A little late, aren’t ya?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Just a day or two.
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: Was beginning to think you might not

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Not hiding... traveling.
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: Uh-huh... travelers have a destination,

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Didn’t have time to stop.
speaker_heading: CHERRY

text: of his earlier scuffle.
speaker_heading: CHERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You lost a button, baby.

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 102.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Will you sew me a new one?
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: You came alone?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: All by myself.
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: You should find somebody. A man alone
dialog: is half a man.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I think I’m doin’ all right.
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: Uh-huh...
text: Cherry takes a long drag on her cigarette.
speaker_heading: CHERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, baby, this year’s been unkind
dialog: to your mama...
text: Curtis smiles like he knew this was coming.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: How much do you need?
text: Cherry shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHERRY
dialog: It don’t really matter. Life’s a long
dialog: grind, ain’t it? I gotta get back to

dialog: next set, I’1l buy you a drink.
text: She gives Curtis a wink as she slides her handbag toward Pete
text: and saunters back to the stage.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN CASINO 111
text: The croupier spins the wheel and drops the ball in. We slowly
text: ZOOM IN on the ball spinning around the wheel.
text: Gerry watches without emotion.
scene_heading: INT. CRESCENT BAR - NIGHT 112
text: Cherry begins to perform again on stage. Curtis watches her for
text: a beat, then reaches into his envelope, takes out a single $100
text: bill. He folds it, keeps it for himself, then slides the rest
text: across the bar to Pete.

text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 103.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Make sure she gets this.
speaker_heading: CHERRY (0.S.)
dialog: This one’s for my little boy over
dialog: there...
text: Pete nods, stashes it safely behind the bar. Curtis turns back
text: to the stage, listens to his mother sing. Slow and haunting.
text: Cherry sings a cover of an old song about RAINBOWS.
text: Curtis smiles. (There’s only one person could truly appreciate
text: the serendipity of this moment.) With purpose, he stands and
text: exits as Cherry’s singing carries over...
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN CASINO 113
text: CLOSE ON the little white ball spinning round and round... Gerry
text: takes a deep breath, ready to start life again with absolutely
dialog: nothing.
text: CLICK. The ball drops into the “double zero” slot and the small
text: group of onlookers ERUPT. Gerry stares at the ball, as
text: onlookers cheer and slap him on the back.
scene_heading: EXT. BOURBON STREET - NIGHT 114
text: We follow Curtis pacing down the middle of the street as festive

text: Cherry's rendition of “The Rainbow Song” ends to mild applause.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN CASINO - HIGH LIMIT ROOM 115
text: Gerry sits alone at a $100 minimum bet Blackjack table. He has
text: a hefty stack of chips in front of him, and he’s playing large
text: bets on multiple hands... And he’s winning.
text: Someone steps into frame and lays $100 on the table. Gerry
text: looks up, watches as the new player takes a seat. The dealer
text: passes a single $100 chip to the man, and we discover...
dialog: ...the new player is Curtis.
text: Curtis and Gerry check each other out silently, both noticing
text: the other's new bruises. But they don't acknowledge each other.
text: Curtis places his only chip in the betting circle.
text: Gerry pushes a stack of chips in each of his three betting
dialog: circles.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 104.
text: The dealer dishes out the cards, and Gerry waves his hand,
dialog: sticking with his dealt cards on all three hands.
text: Curtis taps the table, and the dealer flips over another card: a
text: Queen. Curtis busts and the dealer collects his only chip.
text: Curtis watches as the dealer also busts.
text: Curtis nods to Gerry as he stands to go, when Gerry tosses him
text: another chip. Curtis smiles thanks to Gerry and retakes his
dialog: seat.
text: For the next hand, Curtis bets his single chip again, while
text: Gerry lets the winnings from the previous hands ride.
text: The hands are dealt. This time, both Gerry and Curtis stick
text: with their cards. The dealer busts with a king. He passes a
text: single chip to Curtis and doubles Gerry’s giant stacks. Curtis
text: tosses the borrowed chip back to Gerry. Gerry smiles as a
text: waitress steps up to the table.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Two Woodfords.
text: Another hand is dealt. They both win.
text: A rapid-fire series of cuts propel us through several more
text: hands. Curtis manages to double his winnings with each hand.
text: So does Gerry. They are on fire. A small group of onlookers
text: has gathered around their table. They cheer with every win.
text: As the waitress arrives with their Woodfords...
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (indicating Curtis's
dialog: broken nose)
dialog: I was planning to give you a message
text: from Tony Roundtree... but looks like
dialog: you already got it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: You saw Tony?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: He was just like you described him.
text: Curtis shoots him a sly grin. The two men raise their glasses
dialog: and...
scene_heading: THE CRAPS TABLE - LATER 116
text: We PUSH IN on Gerry and Curtis SCREAMING after a roll of the
text: dice. They are men possessed. Chips coming out of their ears.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 105.
text: Gerry rolls again. Another ERUPTION. The atmosphere is insane.
text: It feels like half the casino is gathered around their table.
text: Gerry is visibly manic with conflicting emotions. Giddy with
dialog: joy one moment, spooked with fear the next. (In many ways, this
text: is his worst nightmare. Is he capable of walking away from the
dialog: streak of a lifetime?)
text: Curtis’ phone RINGS and he checks the incoming...
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It’s Simone! I have to take it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: You can’t leave!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'll be right here. I’m not going
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Make it quick.
text: Curtis takes one step away from the table, while Gerry continues
dialog: to win behind him.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

dialog: Do you hear this? That is the sweet
dialog: sound of success! Pack your bags
dialog: tonight! We did it!... I don’t know
dialog: where we're going, but we want you
dialog: there with us. Vegas, Monte Carlo,

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We can’t lose.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: We can’t lose.
text: They smile at each other. A long beat. Gerry surveys his

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: One last roll. All or nothing.
text: Curtis stares at Gerry. Is he serious?
speaker_heading: GERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m serious.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Wait, Gerry, hang on a sec.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: It’s okay. We can’t lose.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: GERRY

text: Beat. There’s a strange tranquility between them.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: We made it.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We made it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I’m not afraid.
text: Gerry pushes their mountain of chips towards the betting area.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Everything?
text: Gerry nods. The croupier hesitates, then calls over a MANAGER
text: to approve the massive bet. The manager watches with a silenced
text: crowd as the croupier stacks the chips into piles... fifty
dialog: thousand, hundred thousand, one fifty, up and up until...
speaker_heading: CROUPIER (CONT’D)
dialog: Two hundred eighty five thousand.
text: The manager looks at Gerry and Curtis, who are patiently
text: waiting. He speaks into a walkie talkie, then finally...
text: ..-nods his approval.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER (CONT’D)
dialog: Your roll.
text: The crowd around the table remains tense as Gerry holds the dice
text: up for Curtis, who gives them a blow.
text: OFFICIAL YELLOW 3/3/14 107.
text: Gerry shakes the dice in his hand... and let’s them fly.
text: We rapidly PUSH IN on their faces as Curtis and Gerry both lean
text: forward in anticipation--
scene_heading: INT. CASINO STEAKHOUSE 117
text: Curtis and Gerry sit across from each other in a restaurant
text: overlooking the casino floor. They are both emotionally dazed.
text: We PULL BACK to reveal a table filled with champagne, steak and
dialog: lobster.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I love this country.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: (still processing)
dialog: I just bet two hundred eighty five
dialog: grand on a roll of the dice.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: A hero is nothing more than the guy who
dialog: pulls off what the rest of us are
dialog: scared to do. I was wrong about you.
dialog: I thought you were a sick pony that I
dialog: was going to have to put down. But
dialog: you're a hero, Gerry. A new American
dialog: legend.
text: Gerry takes a few bites. Chews. Something isn’t right.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I don’t know. Try it.
text: Curtis samples a bite of Gerry’s steak. Curtis melts.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: That is delicious.
speaker_heading: GERRY
text: You can’t taste it? Something’s off.

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Could I get a cheeseburger?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: No, don’t worry, it’s perfect. I'll

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay. I’11 be back with that burger.
