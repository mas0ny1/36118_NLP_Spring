text: Katherine’s crowded in the back seat with her siblings

dialog: she’s...
scene_heading: INT. WEST VIRGINIA COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE - ANOTHER DAY
text: ...staring out another window in a new classroom. A fancy
text: classroom in a prestigious academy. The class is full of

text: Unbeknownst to Katherine, her new teacher, PROFESSOR GRAVES,
text: is standing right in front of her.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR GRAVES
dialog: Ms. Coleman.
text: Katherine whips back to reality. Embarrassed.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR GRAVES (CONT’D)
dialog: You find something out there more
dialog: interesting than quadratic equations?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
dialog: Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.
text: Professor Graves holds out a piece of chalk.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR GRAVES
dialog: Why don’t you figure out the equation on

text: Then fast. Faster. With passion and fury.
text: The Students crane their heads.
text: Professor Graves rubs his temple.
text: And Katherine writes on, chalk dust dropping like snow from
text: her chalk stick. On and on and on...until she’s at the very
text: bottom, far side of the board. She circles the answer.
text: Stands and faces the class. The equation behind her dwarfing
text: her in stature. She clears her throat...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD)
dialog: If the product of two terms is zero, then
dialog: common sense says at least one of the two
dialog: terms has to be zero to start with. So,
dialog: if you move all the terms over to one
dialog: side, you can put the quadratics into a
dialog: form that can be factored, allowing that
dialog: side of the equation to equal zero. Once
dialog: you've done that, it’s pretty straight
dialog: forward from there...
text: You can hear a pin drop. There’s nothing to say. Katherine
text: shuffles. Adjusts her glasses.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD) (CONT’D)

text: The Senators are silent. Harrison swings for the fences:
speaker_heading: AL HARRISON (CONT’D)
dialog: We have to know what’s out there,

speaker_heading: PAUL STAFFORD (CONT’D)
