speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: As the twenty-first century began,
dialog: human evolution was at a turning

dialog: While most science fiction of the

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...all signs indicated that the human

dialog: direction -- a dumbing down.
dialog: We PAN from the images over to a bunch of modern-day dumbasses

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: How did this happen? Evolution does
dialog: not make moral judgments. Evolution
dialog: does not necessarily reward that
dialog: which is good or beautiful. It simply

speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Gentlemen, CNAPA, or Chronological

speaker_heading: COLLINS (CONT'D)
dialog: The most average person in our entire

dialog: Various officers nod, approving.
speaker_heading: COLLINS (CONT'D)
dialog: We had a little less luck finding a

dialog: and by simply being unconscious for
dialog: several hundred years, Joe had managed
dialog: to become something neither he, nor
dialog: anyone who had ever known him, thought
dialog: he had the potential to become...
dialog: the smartest person on Earth...
dialog: As the sun rises, we see that this is not a natural mountain
dialog: range -- it is a huge, stinking mountain of garbage,
dialog: ridiculously steep and unstable, the result of centuries of
dialog: stacking garbage with no plan whatsoever. We are definitely
dialog: in the future.
speaker_heading: PUSH IN ON:
text: The highest peak. A truck winds its way up a small road, a
text: Dr. Suess-looking path carved into the side of an absurdly
dialog: steep face.
text: At the wheel of the truck is the DRIVER, the dumbest looking
dialog: guy you've ever seen, a fat gum-drop-headed guy, with a weird
dialog: futuristic haircut, an ugly uniform and the McDonalds golden
text: arches tattooed on his forehead.
text: He is looking at a porn magazine while he drives. He
text: alternates between excited grunts from the porn and startled
text: grunts as he nearly swerves off the road.
text: The driver manages to navigate the truck to the summit. He
text: parks it, pulls a lever and the garbage begins to unload,
text: causing the mountain to quiver under the new extra weight.
text: The driver cracks a beer and watches. In the background we
text: see an OMINOUS BLACK DUST STORM of epic proportions
dialog: approaching -- like the Great Dust Bowl.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: Idiocracy p. 17
dialog: 7-1-07
text: The truck finishes unloading and the driver tosses his empty
text: can on top, but the dusty wind knocks it back down. The
text: driver tries again. And again. Frustrated, he finally takes
text: the can and plants it forcefully on top, causing the small
dialog: peak to collapse, which causes the next part below to
dialog: collapse, and a chain reaction on down the mountain. It was
dialog: one beer can more than this mountain was designed to hold.
dialog: In a WIDER SHOT, we see a huge, epic
dialog: GARBAGE AVALANCHE!!!!
text: The huge waves of garbage engulf the city below. CLOSER, we
text: see Joe AND RITA'S PODS emerge, riding the crest of the
dialog: garbage wave. They split into two directions. We FOLLOW
dialog: Joe's pod for a while.
text: CLOSE ON Joe'S POD as it comes to a stop. PULL OUT to reveal
dialog: we are in
scene_heading: 20 EXT. FILTHY STREET - CONTINUOUS 20
text: Joe's pod has come to rest on a dirty street below a giant
text: billboard ad of a scowling, Neanderthal looking macho-man
dialog: with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. It reads, "If you
dialog: don't smoke Carltons...Fuck you!"
dialog: As we PULL OUT further, we see that every single square inch
dialog: of everything is plastered with advertisements. Even the
text: passersby's clothes are covered with ads. Everything seems
dialog: to be in some stage of decay.
text: TV screens everywhere blast out competing trash and talking
dialog: vending machines compete like carnival barkers for the
dialog: attention of passersby.
text: WIDER ANGLE. Dumb-looking, overweight people wander around.
text: On the back of everyone's left hand is a UPC tattoo. No one
dialog: seems to have noticed or cared much about the garbage'
text: avalanche. They pay no attention to Joe's pod.
text: Suddenly, the ground RUMBLES. Another wave of garbage comes
text: roaring down the street, smashing into Joe's pod, sending it
dialog: flying into the air.
scene_heading: 21 EXT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 21
text: A half-built, dirty-looking place. Joe's pod goes crashing
dialog: into a window.

scene_heading: 22 INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 22
text: The pod lands on the floor of a tiny room with only enough
text: space to house a La-Z-Boy recliner and a giant TV. DIZZ,
text: mid-30s fatass, sits sunken deep in the recliner. He watches
text: TV, his jaw hanging open in a dull expression, doesn't seem
text: to register the pod that just crashed through his window.
text: Outside Dizz's window, the dust storm and avalanche continue.
dialog: He couldn't care less. From the TV we hear an announcer
dialog: with that testosterone-heavy Fox style, but even dumber
dialog: sounding.
speaker_heading: TV (V.O.)
dialog: Next, on the Violence Channel, an
dialog: all-new episode of "Ow! My Balls!"
dialog: Huh huh, yeah...
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON TV:
text: The TV show begins: The MAIN CHARACTER, a frail, feeble
text: looking man with a permanently worried look on his face,
text: stands on a high-rise balcony looking out at the view.
text: A big lumbering JOCK comes up behind him, kicks him in the
text: balls, sending him over the balcony.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DIZZ, amused.
speaker_heading: DIZZ
dialog: (primitive laugh sound)
dialog: Uuuugh!...
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: Joe's pod. It starts to come to life. We hear fluids
text: flowing, LED lights come on. The pod displays a message:
dialog: Unfreezing!
speaker_heading: BACK ON THE TV:
text: The show continues. In rapid succession, the Main Character
text: falls off the balcony, lands on a high voltage wire, on his
text: balls, gets sling-shotted off, starts falling, heading
text: straight for a fence, lands on his balls, then falls into
text: someone's yard. A dog runs up, bites his balls, he scrambles
text: over the high fence, falls down the other side, lands on a
text: sawhorse, right on his balls, then finally falls to the
text: ground. He stands up, brushes himself off, then notices
text: something: a huge wrecking ball swinging right towards his
text: balls. He stands there like a deer caught in the headlights,
dialog: then WHAM, right in the balls. We follow him through the
text: air, his balls straddling the wrecking ball...

text: burned eyes, looks around dazed. He's still in his military
dialog: hospital outfit.
text: Joe looks at Dizz. He has no idea what he's looking at or
text: where he is. He clutches his head in pain.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Uhhhh...
text: Dizz's eyes remain glued to the TV, but he is momentarily
text: distracted by Joe's noise.
speaker_heading: DIZZ
dialog: Ugh?
text: Joe rubs his eyes, takes in his surroundings. He is
text: completely disoriented. Nothing makes sense to him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (really groggy)
dialog: Urn, where...? Is this ah...
speaker_heading: DIZZ
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: (back to TV, laughs)
dialog: Huuuh-uuugh...
text: Joe looks at Dizz, confused. Joe tries to get up, stumbles
text: a couple of times, falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (rubbing his eyes,
dialog: trying to figure it
dialog: out)
dialog: Urn... Where's Officer Collins? Is

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm just... where am I?
speaker_heading: DIZZ
dialog: SHUT UP!!!
text: Dizz gets up angrily, revealing that the "recliner" is also

speaker_heading: DIZZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah!
scene_heading: 23 EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS 23
text: Joe hits the ground hard. Joe gets up and painfully limps
text: around. He looks across the street, sees something that
dialog: makes him do a double-take:
speaker_heading: JOE' S POV:
text: A cheerful T.G.I.F.-looking restaurant. The sign reads:
dialog: Buttfucker's! (In the exact shape, colors and font of
dialog: Fuddrucker's.)
text: Joe looks at the sign a beat, at the kids' birthday party
text: going on inside, back at the sign, and shakes his head. A
dialog: guy and a girl walk by, each obese and wearing those T-shirts
dialog: that make it look like you're naked.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Excuse me, (points to Buttfucker's)
dialog: could you read that sign for me?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Read? What do I look like, a fag?
text: The guy growls at Joe. Joe stumbles off, nearly getting run
text: over by a broken-down futuristic car being pulled by a team
text: of dogs. The car is continually making that annoying dinging
text: sound they make when the door is open. Joe rubs his eyes in
text: disbelief, then walks unsteadily, holding his head.

scene_heading: 24 EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 24
text: Joe stops near a group of guys.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Joe wandered the streets, desperate
dialog: for help, but the English language
dialog: had deteriorated into a hybrid of
dialog: hillbilly, valley-girl, innercity
dialog: slang, and various grunts. Joe was
dialog: able to understand them, but when he
dialog: spoke in his ordinary voice, he
dialog: sounded pompous and "faggy" to them.
dialog: Joe asks for directions. The guys all laugh and make fun of
text: him. Joe pleads. One of the guys freaks out and starts
text: beating his chest and yelling incomprehensible obscenities.
text: Joe runs away, then he notices something.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh thank God...
speaker_heading: JOE'S POV:
text: A (misspelled) sign reads: "Memorial" Hospitle. Above it is
dialog: a huge billboard which reads:
dialog: "Surgery with an ATTITUDE!" With a picture of a Vin Diesel
text: type in a scrub suit, holding a scalpel, with an anti-
dialog: authority, "fuck you" scowl.
text: Joe just shakes his head and walks towards the entrance.
dialog: [NOTE: For the purpose of this script, the dialogue of people
dialog: of 2974 will be written in normal English, but for the movie,
dialog: a future-dumbass accent and appropriate slang would be
dialog: created, as described above.]
scene_heading: 25 INT. "MEMORIAL" HOSPITLE - SAME TIME 25
text: Joe walks through the waiting room. People are sprawled
dialog: around with a variety of strange injuries -- a fat guy tangled
dialog: up trying to take off his sweatshirt who's violently
dialog: struggling to free himself, a whole family with their hands
text: all stuck in a big jar of food like it's a raccoon trap.
text: Joe staggers up to what looks like a fast food counter. A
text: dull, bored-looking COUNTER WOMAN is behind the counter,
text: wearing a uniform that's halfway between Mcdonalds's and
dialog: hospital whites.

dialog: Hi.. uh, I was in this army experiment-

speaker_heading: COUNTER WOMAN
dialog: Uuuh...
text: We see the Counter Woman looking down at a machine that looks
dialog: like one of those cash registers at Mcdonalds where there
dialog: are no words or numbers, just pictures, icons depicting
dialog: various ailments -- a picture of an elbow with pain lines
text: coming out, a picture of a guy with a knife in his head making
text: a frowny face, a guy's butt, a knee, etc.
text: She glances up at Joe, back at the key pad, thinking hard:
speaker_heading: COUNTER WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Uhhhhh...
text: Finally her finger lands on a key with an icon of a guy

speaker_heading: COUNTER WOMAN
dialog: Uh... go over there.
text: Joe starts to leave then turns around.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Is there a drinking fountain?
text: The woman just points over her shoulder. Joe walks up to the
text: drinking fountain and hits the button. He starts to drink
text: and then makes a confused, disturbed face.
text: He pulls away from the fountain to reveal some fluorescent
text: greenish gatorade-type liquid is being dispensed. On the
text: side of the fountain is a logo that reads, "RAUNCHO, THE
text: THIRST MUTILATOR." Joe stops a passing doctor.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me, I think this is Gatorade

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: DIZZ
dialog: Congratulations man. I didn't know

dialog: Everyone.
dialog: Joe leans in to Dizz.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Look, I'm glad you're happy about

dialog: need your help. I don't know what
dialog: he's talking about. I can't solve

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: DIZZ
dialog: Smart? You mean like you?

speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: Oh good. He's here.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: So did you solve all the problems

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well... I just got here yesterday.

speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: Oh man. President Camacho is

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: He did a press conference this

dialog: starvation, crops, the economy, the
dialog: dust storms, the garbage abulanches,
dialog: and a bunch other stuff.
speaker_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD
dialog: You better get on that. It's already
dialog: been like four days.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No it hasn't!
speaker_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD
dialog: Well that's what he told everyone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So you guys are saying I've got three

speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: Yep.
text: Overwhe1med, Joe clutches his head miserably, then gets an
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, if I'm gonna solve your

speaker_heading: GUARD

dialog: Idiocracy p. 70

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah well, they arrested me for

dialog: faith in your legal system. She's an
dialog: artist.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Yeah, she charged some guy a bunch
dialog: of money and didn't put out. That
dialog: could get her ten years. Don't worry
dialog: though, we can get her a temporarY

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: GUARD

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So what are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm thinking we'll escape. Trust me,

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sounds good to me. Shouldn't be too

speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.)

dialog: Joe lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm really sorry but, just so they

dialog: just ah, well... here...

speaker_heading: making a SQUEAKING NOISE.
speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah! It's about time!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: By the way, don't worry, I'll sleep

speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.)

scene_heading: 71 EXT. CROPS - THE NEXT DAY 71
dialog: Joe, Rita, Dizz, Joe's Guards and Cabinet Members stand at

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Boy ah... Yeah, that sucks...
text: Joe discreetly looks down at his pocket, sees the folded map
dialog: from Dizz.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey ah, I need to go to the bathroom,

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (lecherous)
dialog: Aw, yeah! I get it!
dialog: The cabinet all start laughing like idiots, doing the juvenile

text: to some bushes, in a ravine.
dialog: Rita and Joe reach a place where they can't be seen.
speaker_heading: BEHIND THE BUSHES:
text: Joe pulls the map out of his pocket and unfolds it. It's
dialog: incredibly crude and useless, like a 3-year-old would draw:
dialog: a big box in the corner says "time masheen." There's no scale,

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Aw, Damnit! Way to go, Dizz...
text: Joe throws it down in frustration.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Maybe we should just make a run for
dialog: it-- ask for directions.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't think that's a good idea. We
dialog: can't take any chances. My face was
dialog: all over national TV. There's no way
dialog: I'm going back to that jail.
text: Joe has a QUICK FLASHBACK, like a Vietnam flashback of the
text: 400 pound guy sitting on the guy's face.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit!... Okay, we'll go back, I'll
dialog: get a better map. Next chance we
dialog: get, we'11 make a run for it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What if we don't get another chance?
dialog: Boy, I better find Upgrayed before
dialog: he finds me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Upgrayed can't find you! Okay? It's
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, you think so? Let me tell you a
dialog: story. I ran off to Buffalo once,
dialog: didn't tell no one where I was going.
dialog: I check into a motel, the phone rings--
dialog: BAM! It's Upgrayed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, that was a thousand years ago!
dialog: Just trust me. You're safe.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (starting to believe)
dialog: You really think so?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes... And I know it's none of my

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Alright let's get back.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (tasting it)
dialog: Is it that gatorade stuff?
text: They look up and see a giant tank/water-tower with the Rauncho

speaker_heading: ELECTROLYTES."
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Once again, I'm pretty sure all that
dialog: Rauncho stuff might be what's killing
dialog: the plants.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: But Rauncho's got what plants crave.
dialog: It's got electrolytes.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: (thinking painfully
dialog: hard)
dialog: So wait a minute... You're saying
dialog: you want us to put water on the crops?
dialog: Water? Like out of the toilet?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It doesn't have to be from the toilet,
dialog: but yes, that's the idea.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: Okay, but Rauncho's got what plants
dialog: crave.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: It's got electrolytes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Look, your plants aren't growing. So
dialog: I'm pretty sure the Rauncho's not
dialog: working. Now I'm no botanist, but I
dialog: do know that if you put water on
dialog: plants they grow.
speaker_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD
dialog: Like from the toilet?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Look, you want to solve this problem,

speaker_heading: 14-YEAR-OLD
dialog: Oh, and it's got electrolytes.
dialog: Joe's about to lose it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What are electrolytes? Does anyone

speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: They're what's in Rauncho.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But what are they?
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: They're what they use to make Rauncho.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But why do they use them to make
dialog: Rauncho?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: Cuz Rauncho's got electrolytes..
dialog: Joe has had it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Alright, look. I'll prove it to you.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 76 INT. LIBERRY OF CONGRESS - DIFFERENT SECTION - DAY 76

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (his mind reeling)
dialog: I figured it out! Electrolytes are

speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: Yeah, Camacho said you could get it
dialog: as soon as the crops grow. That way

text: He runs over and pulls the Driver out. But as soon as the
