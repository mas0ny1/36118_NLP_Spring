speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT
text: We move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages
text: outside. THUNDER roars, and lightning flashes in the giant
text: windows. in the center of the room lies an oak coffin.
text: Suddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past
text: the edge... and then the lid slams up! Famed psychic CRISWELL
text: pops out. Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming
text: eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair. He intones,
dialog: with absolute conviction:
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Greetings, my friend. You are
dialog: interested in the unknown, the
dialog: mysterious, the unexplainable...
dialog: that is why you are here. So now,
dialog: for the first time, we are bringing
dialog: you the full story of what
dialog: happened...
dialog: (extremely serious)
dialog: We are giving you all the evidence,
dialog: based only on the secret testimony
dialog: of the miserable souls who survived
dialog: this terrifying ordeal. The
dialog: incidents, the places, my friend, we
dialog: cannot keep this a secret any longer.
dialog: Can your hearts stand the shocking
dialog: facts of the true story of Edward D.
dialog: Wood, Junior??
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY
text: Lightning CRACKS.
text: We drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential
dialog: rain... and end up...
speaker_heading: OPTICAL:
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
text: We've landed in Hollywood, 1952. We're outside a teeny, grungy
text: playhouse. The cracked marquee proclaims "'THE CASUAL
scene_heading: COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR."
text: Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero.
text: Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style
text: handsome, Ed is a human magnet. He's a classically flawed
text: optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons
dialog: within.
text: The doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN "BUNNY" BRECKINRIDGE, 45,
text: hurries out. Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a
text: string of pearls.
scene_heading: [PAGE 2 MISSING]
text: Suddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset. In a
text: flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry-
text: for-a-career ingenue. She's near tears.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Eddie, my dove just flew out the
dialog: window!
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER
dialog: She goes on in two minutes! What
dialog: are we gonna do??
text: They all look to Ed, awaiting a response. He thinks a second,
text: then excitedly CLAPS his hands.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dolores, give me your shoes.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The ghost can be barefoot. Give
dialog: me your shoes!
text: She hands Ed her white shoes. He snatches one, grabs a pair of
text: scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe. Everyone is baffled.
text: He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape
dialog: of a dove!
text: Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and
text: sprints into the dressing room. He takes some green eye shadow
text: and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners. Ed then hurries
text: back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe...
text: and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth!
text: The cast is flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: BACK ONSTAGE
text: The soldiers suddenly look up.
speaker_heading: ACTOR #1
dialog: Hey, I think I see something!
text: Dolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I offer you mortals the bird of
dialog: peace, so that you may change your
dialog: ways and end all this destruction.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCRUFFY COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Ed and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour
text: diner. They're noisily slugging down drinks, in a big red
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What a show! Everyone was terrific!
dialog: Paul, your second-act monologue
dialog: actually gave me chills,
text: He grins at Actor #1, aka PAUL MARCO, a young eager beaver
text: who's loyal like a dog.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: Aw thanks, Eddie.
text: Actor #2, aka CONRAD BROOKS, a friendly, simple-minded lug,
text: runs up waving a newspaper.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: I got the early edition! It was just
text: dropped off at the newsstand.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he smiles at everyone)
dialog: This is the big moment...!
text: Ed opens the paper to the entertainment page.
dialog: 
text: INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER. Ed turns to a column, "The Theatrical
text: Life, By Victor Crowley." Under this is a photograph of an old
text: man with an ascot.
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: Everybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading. A
text: moment... and then their faces drop. Clearly, this is a
text: disastrous review. Their faces get sadder, and sadder... and
text: then they finish. A melancholy beat, until --
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: What does that old queen know? He
dialog: wasn't even there!
dialog: (he knocks back a drink)
dialog: Sending a copy boy to do his dirty
dialog: work. Well fuck him!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Do I really have a face like a horse?
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: What does "ostentatious" mean?
text: Ed calmly waves his arms for attention. He tries to smile.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey. Hey, it's not that bad. You
dialog: just can't concentrate on the
dialog: negative. He's got some nice things
dialog: to say...
dialog: (he scans the review)
dialog: See, "The soldier costumes are very
dialog: realistic." That's positive!
text: Everyone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed. Ed
text: launches into an upbeat speech.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews.
dialog: I've seen ones where they didn't even
dialog: like the costumes! Like, that last
dialog: "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got
dialog: terrible notices. But it was a huge
dialog: hit.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
text: Lines around the block.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So don't take it too seriously.
dialog: We're all doin' great work.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: You really think so?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Absolutely! It's just the beginning.
dialog: I promise this: If we stick together,
dialog: one day I'll make every single one
dialog: of you famous.
text: He smiles at everyone at the table. They all believe what he
text: says, and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOLORES' APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
text: Ed and Dolores lie in bed, in the dark. He stares vulnerably
text: at her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if
dialog: I just don't have it?
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, it was only one review.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Orson Welles was 26 when he made
dialog: "Citizen Kane." I'm already 30!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, you're still young. This is the
dialog: part of your life when you're
text: supposed to be struggling.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know... But sometimes I get scared
dialog: this is as good as it's gonna get...
text: Dolores kisses Ed affectionately.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Things'll change for us. Nobody
dialog: stays on the fringe forever.
text: She gets out of bed. We see her tiny apartment is drab and
text: crumbling. Dolores turns on the shower, then walks to the
text: closet. She looks inside.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: God, where's my pink sweater? I can
dialog: never find my clothes anymore...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ED
text: He rolls over in bed, away from her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: CU on Ed reading "The Hollywood Reporter." A RUDE BOSS in
text: suspenders suddenly strides up.
speaker_heading: RUDE BOSS
dialog: Hey big shot, get off your ass. They
text: need a potted palm over in the Carl
dialog: Laemmle Building.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
text: Ed jumps up. We WIDEN, revealing he's in a giant greenhouse,
text: packed with rows of potted plants and shrubs. Ed grabs a small
text: palm tree and hurries out.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE STUDIO - DAY
text: Ed strolls across the busy movie lot, lugging the palm. He
text: passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack.
text: Ed glances around, then puts down the palm and hurries in.
scene_heading: INT. SOUNDSTAGE ó SAME TIME
text: A big-budget foreign legion movie is shooting, with a huge cast
text: and crew. A giant desert set has been erected, with camels and
text: real sand dunes. Ed is blown away.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Whoa, look at all this sand. This
dialog: is real sand! My God, where'd they
dialog: get all this sand?!
text: A SECURITY GUARD sees him.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey, YOU. This is a closed set.
text: Ed is caught. He hurries out.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE STUDIO ó DAY
text: Ed continues across the lot, carrying his palm tree. An OLD
text: CRUSTY MAN sticks his head out an office window.
speaker_heading: OLD CRUSTY MAN
dialog: Hey, Eddie! Come in here. I got
dialog: some great new stuff to show you.
text: Ed puts down the plant again and runs in.
scene_heading: INT. EDITING ROOMS ó DAY
text: The old guy is proudly showing Ed STOCK FOOTAGE on a moviola.
text: The footage is totally random: Giant explosions, buffalos
text: stampeding, tanks, an octopus swimming, etc.
text: Ed is dazzled.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This is fantastic! What are you
dialog: gonna do with it all?
speaker_heading: OLD CRUSTY MAN
dialog: Eh, probably file it away and never
dialog: see it again.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's such a waste. If I had half a
dialog: chance, I could make an entire movie
dialog: out of this stock footage!
dialog: (getting inspired)
dialog: See, the story opens with these
dialog: mysterious explosions. Nobody knows
dialog: what's causing them, but it's
dialog: upsetting all the buffalo. So the
dialog: military is called in to solve the
dialog: mystery.
speaker_heading: OLD CRUSTY MAN
dialog: Ya forgot the octopus.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, I'm saving that for the big
dialog: underwater climax!
text: The old guy cackles.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE STUDIO - DAY
text: Ed finally carries the tree into the Laemmle Building.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO OFFICES - SAME TIME
text: Young SECRETARIES in June Cleaver hairdos are giggling.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY #1
dialog: They say he was a girl trapped in a
text: man's body.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY #2
dialog: I'll bet it hurt when they snipped
dialog: his thing off.
text: EEWWW! All the girls shriek in horror. Ed walks in and puts
dialog: down his plant.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What are you ladies gabbin' about?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY #1
dialog: You know that Christine Jorgensen
dialog: freak? He/she/it's in "Variety."
text: Some producer is making a biopic.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (startled)
dialog: R-really? I didn't see the story.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY #1
dialog: Ah, it was buried in the back. The
dialog: guy's a real smallótime operator.
text: She holds up her "Variety." Ed hurriedly takes it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSERT - VARIETY
text: The story headline says "BOYóTOóCHICK FLICK TO CLICK." We PULL
dialog: OUT, revealing we're now in
scene_heading: INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ed holds the newspaper while he paces around his apartment.
text: The place has threadbare carpet, faded wallpaper, and an
text: electric burner for a kitchen. A handful of mangy DOGS run
text: around. Tacked-up are movie posters for "DRACULA," "FREAKS,"
text: and "THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS."
text: Dolores talks on the phone, while Ed silently coaches her.
speaker_heading: DOLORES (on phone)
dialog: Yes, I've got Mr. Edward Wood on the
dialog: line. Could you please hold?
text: Ed gives her a thumbs up -- perfect! He confidently takes the
dialog: phone.
dialog: ED (on phone)
dialog: Hello, Mr. Weiss? I heard about your
dialog: new project and was curious if you
dialog: signed a director. Oh -- you
dialog: haven't? Well, if we could get
dialog: together, I could explain why I'm
dialog: more qualified to direct this than
dialog: anyone else in town.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Uh, I'd rather not go into it over
dialog: the phone... Alright. Great! l'll
dialog: see you then!
text: Ed hangs up and YELPS excitedly. He kisses Dolores. She pulls
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Eddie, I don't understand. Why are
dialog: you the most qualified director for
dialog: the Christine Jorgensen Story?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (nervous, he lies)
dialog: Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air.
dialog: I had to say something to get in the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOW-RENT HALLWAY - DAY
text: Ed walks jauntily along, wearing a snappy suit. He reaches a
text: door that says "SCREEN CLASSICS ó George Weiss, President." Ed
text: fixes his hair, checks his clothes, then enters.
scene_heading: INT. SCREEN CLASSICS ó SAME TIME
text: It's a crowded root, piled with paperwork and files. Film cans
text: are stacked everywhere, and framed oneósheets for "TEST TUBE
text: BABIES," "BLONDE PICKUP" and "GIRL GANG" litter the cracked
text: walls. Sitting behind the messy desk is GEORGIE WEISS, 60, a
text: rug merchant turned exploitation film producer. He juggles a
text: large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (on phone)
dialog: Look, when I said you could have the
dialog: western territories, I didn't mean
dialog: all eleven states! I meant
dialog: California, Oregon, and uh, what's
dialog: that one above it... Washington. Oh
dialog: really?! Well screw you!
text: Georgie slams down the phone. He smiles warmly at Ed.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about
dialog: directing the Christine Jorgensen
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yeah, well a couple of things have
dialog: changed. It ain't gonna be the
dialog: Christine Jorgensen story no more.
dialog: Goddamn "Variety" printed the story
dialog: before I had the rights, and now that
dialog: bitch is asking for the sky.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: So you're not gonna make the movie?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the
dialog: movie! I've already preósold Alabama
dialog: and Oklahoma. Those repressed Okies
dialog: really go for that twisted pervert
dialog: stuff. So we'll just make it without
dialog: that she-male. We'll fictitionalize
dialog: it.
text: Georgie bites into his sandwich. Ed is dazed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Is there a script?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Fuck no! But there's a poster.
text: Georgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite: Man on the left
text: side, woman on the right. The lettering screams, "I CHANGED MY
dialog: SEX!"
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
text: It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (mustering up his courage)
dialog: Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy. I
dialog: work fast, and I'm a deal: I write
dialog: AND direct. And I'm good. I just
dialog: did a play in Hollywood, and Victor
dialog: Crowley praised its realism.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Hmm. There's five-hundred guys in
dialog: town who can tell me the same thing.
dialog: You said on the phone you had some
dialog: kind of "special qualifications."
text: Ed takes a measured piuse. This is his big revelation.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told
dialog: anyone what I'm about to tell you...
dialog: but I really want this job.
dialog: (he gulps)
dialog: I like to dress in women's clothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Are you a fruit?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, no, not at all! I love women.
dialog: Wearing their clothes makes me feel
text: closer to them.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: So you're not a fruit?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in
dialog: WW2.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 'Course, I was wearing ladies'
text: undergarments under my uniform.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: You gotta be kiddin' me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Confidentially, I even paratrooped
text: wearing a brassiere and panties.
dialog: I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of
dialog: being killed, but I was terrified of
dialog: getting wounded, and having the
dialog: medics discover my secret.
text: Georgie sits back. It's a hell of a story.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: And this is why you think you're the
dialog: most qualified to make my movie?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah. I know what it's like to live
dialog: with a secret, and worry about what
dialog: people are gonna think of you... My
dialog: girlfriend still doesn't know why her
text: sweaters are always stretched out.
text: Georgie shrugs.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but
dialog: look around you...
text: (he gestures at the posters)
dialog: I don't hire directors with burning
dialog: desires to tell their stories. I
dialog: make movies like "Chained Girls."
dialog: I need someone with experience who
dialog: can shoot a film in four days that'll
dialog: make me a profit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry. That's all that matters.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BAR ó DAY
text: Ed sits morosely in a scuzzy bar, three empty shot glasses in
text: front of him. A BARTENDER ambles over.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Are you gonna get something else?
text: Ed glumly empties his pocket. All he has is change. Ed sighs,
text: and staggers out.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY
text: Ed shuffles down the street, his head hanging low. A
text: restaurant door opens, and an EISENHOWER ERA NUCLEAR FAMILY
text: exits. Whitebread Dad, Mom, Son, and Daughter stride out in
text: their starched clean clothes.
text: They march obliviously past Ed. He watches them go, then
text: continues. Ed reaches a building, "HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY," and
text: glances in the window. A pause, then he does a doubletake.
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: The showroom is filled with sample coffins. Lying inside one
speaker_heading: is BELA LUGOSI.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ED
text: He is flabbergasted.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY - SAME TIME
text: Lugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin. Bela is an aged 70-
text: year-old man, once a great star, now a faded memory trying to
text: hang on to his nobility. Quite frail and tired, he is still a
text: master of the grand gesture.
text: An UNCTUOUS SALESMAN steps up. Bela speaks, in a thick
text: Hungarian ACCENT which gives him an Old World elegance.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Too constrictive. This is the most
dialog: uncomfortable coffin I have ever been
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I've never had any
dialog: complaints before.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: The selection is quite shoddy. You
dialog: are wasting my time.
text: Mildly annoyed, Bela climbs out. He straightens his cloak and
text: walks to the exit -- where be bumps into nervous Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I told you, I don't want any of your
dialog: goddamn coffins.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. I don't work here.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Huh?
text: Bela peers at Ed, then glances confusedly over his shoulder at
text: the salesman. Oh. Bela looks back at anxious Ed.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Who are you? What do you want?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't want anything. I'm just a
dialog: really big, big fan. I've seen all
dialog: your movies.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Ha!
text: Bela strides out.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - SAME TIME
text: Bela hurries along. Ed chases after him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why were you buying a coffin?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Because I'm planning on dying soon.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Yes. I'm embarking on another bus-
dialog: andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve
dialog: cities in ten days, if that's
dialog: conceivable.
text: Bela pulls out a large smelly cigar and lights it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know, I saw you perform
text: "Dracula." In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Eh, that was a terrible production.
dialog: Renfield was a drunk!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I thought it was great. You were
dialog: much scarier in real life than you
text: were in the movie.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I waited to get your autograph, but
dialog: you never came outside.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I apologize. When I play Dracula,
dialog: I put myself into a trance. It takes
dialog: me much time to re-emerge.
text: A CITY BUS approaches.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Oh, there's my bus.
dialog: (he checks his pockets)
dialog: Shit, where's my transfer?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't you bave a car?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I refuse to drive in this country.
dialog: Too many madmen.
text: The bus pulls up, and the doors open. Ed is worried he's about
text: to lose his new friend. He gets an idea...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. 1948 NASH RAMBLER - DAY
text: Ed drives anxiously. Bela sits next to him, filling the car
text: with smoke from his big cigar.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such
dialog: an exciting life. When is your next
dialog: picture coming out?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I have no next picture.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man
dialog: like you... I'll bet you have dozens
dialog: of 'em lined up.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Back in the old days, yes. But now
dialog: -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
text: Bela puffs on his oversized cigar.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But you're a big star!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: No more. I haven't worked in four
dialog: years. This town, it chews you up,
dialog: then spits you out. I'm just an
dialog: ex-bogeyman.
dialog: (he points)
dialog: Make a right.
scene_heading: EXT. BELA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood.
text: They reach a tiny, well-manicured house. Ed and Bela get out.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (bitter)
dialog: They don't want the classic horror
dialog: films anymore. Today, it's all giant
dialog: bugs, giant spiders, giant
dialog: grasshoppers -- who would believe
dialog: such nonsense!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The old ones were much spookier.
dialog: They had castles, full moons...
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: They were mythic. They had a poetry
dialog: to them.
dialog: (he lowers his voice)
dialog: And you know what else? The women
dialog: prefer the traditional monsters.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The women?
speaker_heading: BELA
text: The pure horror, it both repels and
dialog: attracts them. Because in their
dialog: collective unconsciousness, they have
text: the agony of childbirth. The blood.
text: The blood is horror.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I never thought of that.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Take my word for it. You want to
dialog: "score" with a young lady, you take
dialog: her to see "Dracula."
text: Bela's eyes twinkle. He reaches his front door and unlocks it.
text: INSIDE... it's awful. Squalid, dark, with skulls and strange
text: voodoo objects scattered about. Up front hangs a large
text: photograph of shockingly young Bela, handsome and regal.
text: Ed is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything.
text: Within, DOGS start BARKING crazily.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Ugh, what a mess.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My wife of twenty years left me last
dialog: month. I'm not much of a
dialog: housekeeper.
text: The dogs BARK louder.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Shh! I'm coming! I will feed you!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps
dialog: we could get together again?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (he shakes his hand)
dialog: Certainly. But now the children
dialog: of the night are calling me.

text: Dolores is in her 1950's kitchenette, making a green jello

dialog: got the most incredible news!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: (excited)
dialog: You got the job?!!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?!
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job.
dialog: But something better happened!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Better than not getting a job?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody
dialog: really big!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Who? Robert Taylor?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: No! A horror movie star!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Boris Karloff!?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Close! The other one!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: You met Basil Rathbone!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA
speaker_heading: LUGOSI!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I thought he was dead.
text: Ed's eyes pop.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No! He's very alive. Well... sort
dialog: of. He's old, and frail -- but he's
dialog: still Bela Lugosi! And he's really
dialog: nice.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Boy, I can't even remember the last
text: time he was in a picture.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's a shame. He's such a rest
dialog: actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: So did you get his autograph?
text: Ed calms down. He smiles beatifically.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. It wasn't like that at all. It
dialog: was just the two of us, and we were

dialog: the years? "Dracula"! "The Raven"!
dialog: "The Black Cat"!
speaker_heading: RUDE BOSS
dialog: Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He
dialog: don't deserve to work.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's not true --
speaker_heading: RUDE BOSS
dialog: He's so great, you hire him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Well, uh, if I could I would...
text: The guy takes a mocking face and struts out. Ed glares.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BELA'S ROUSE - NIGHT
text: It's Halloween night. CHILDREN in trick-or-treating costumes
text: parade up and down the streets. Through Bela's window, we see
text: him and Ed watching TELEVISION -- a small fuzzy screen in a
text: huge console.
scene_heading: INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: ON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays. Bela's
text: evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the
text: famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture.
speaker_heading: ON ED AND BELA
text: They are entranced. The men drink beers in silence. Bela's
text: TWO DOGS lie at his feet.
dialog: ON THE TV
text: The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV
text: screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess,
text: a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress.
text: She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set. There is a
text: pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween."
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA (on TV)
dialog: Ooo! Those eyes! He gives me the
dialog: willies! The only thing scarier than
dialog: him is this guy I dated last week:
dialog: Charlie from Pittsburgh. Boy, talk
dialog: about the living dead...
speaker_heading: ON THE MEN
text: Ed is disgruntled.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ugh! I hate the way she interrupts
dialog: the pictures. She doesn't show 'em
dialog: the proper respect.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (glued to the TV)
dialog: I think she's a honey. Look at those
text: jugs.
text: Ed LAUGHS. Bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic
text: hand gesture at the TV.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Vampira! You will come under my
dialog: spell! You will be my slave of love.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (fascinated by Bela's hand)
dialog: Hey Bela, how do you do that?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: You must be double-jointed, and you
dialog: must be Hungarian.
dialog: (back at the TV)
dialog: Vampira, look at me! Stare into my
text: eyes.
text: Ed joins Bela in this activity. The two of them wave their
text: arms spookily at the TV.
text: Bela becomes fatigued.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I am getting tired. I need to take
dialog: my medicine.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Do you want me to get it for you?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: No thank you, Eddie. I'll be
dialog: alright.
text: Bela smiles. He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps
text: behind a curtain. Ed is puzzled. Bela's thin arm appears and
text: draws the curtain tight. We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers
text: opening and closing, and then silence.
text: Ed sits, waiting.
text: Behind the curtain, something DROPS. We hear a muffled "Shit!"
text: Ed is getting worried. But then the curtain whips open, and
text: Bela bounds out, grinning. He's a bundle of energy.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I feel better now.
speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR
text: The doorbell RINGS. Kids SHOUT "Trick or treat!" Bela jumps
text: up gleefully.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Children! I love children.
text: Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and
text: sticks them in his mouth.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle
text: expectantly.
text: Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count
text: Dracula! The real Count Dracula. YEOWWWW!!! The kids SCREAM
dialog: and run.
text: Bela chuckles. Every kid is gone... except one TOUGH BOY.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Aren't you scared, little boy? I'm
dialog: going to drink your blood!
speaker_heading: TOUGH BOY
dialog: Ehh, you're not a real vampire.
dialog: You can't turn into a bat, and
dialog: those teeth don't frighten me.
text: Suddenly Ed lurches out, menacingly.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well how about these teeth?!!
text: Ed RIPS HIS TEETH out of his head and thrusts them at the
text: kid. The boy SCREAMS in terror and races away.
text: Bela is wowed.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Hey, how'd you do that?
text: Ed smiles impishly, then sticks the teeth back in his mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dentures. I lost my pearlies in
dialog: the war.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Ed and Bela run toward us, Bela's cape flapping in the wind.
text: Ed takes a swig from Bela's flask. They're a bit tipsy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Are you sure this is okay?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Don't worry. I do it every
dialog: Halloween.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
text: The moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery. The wind
text: blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness.
text: Ed and Bela reach the locked gates. They glance at each other,
text: then start to climb over. Ed helps Bela. They jump down, and
text: Ed peers nervously.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Now what?
text: Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning. He takes another
text: swig, then starts running giddily.
text: He disappears into the cemetery.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I am DRACULA!
text: Bela darts happily through the graves.
text: His cape flies behind him.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I am the BAT!!
text: Ed's eyes light up. He starts chasing after Bela.
text: Bela's heart is racing. He zig-zags past ancient crypts.
text: Gargoyles peer down. The wind howls through the skeletal
text: trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky.
text: Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up.
text: Bela flaps his cape up and down. We almost think he's going to
dialog: fly.
text: Ed races up, then quietly stops. He eagerly watches Bela,
text: practically expecting him to turn into a bat. It's a magical,
text: crazed moment.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I am DRACUlA! I will LIVE FOREVER!!!
text: Bela laughs, then lies down on the grass.
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: Ed slowly walks over and lies next to Bela. They're happy,
text: eyes alert, on top of the world.
text: Ed peers in wonder at his new friend.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCREEN CLASSICS OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed sits across from Georgie. Ed's very excited.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: So what's the big news you couldn't
dialog: tell me over the phone... again?
text: Ed gulps excitedly. He has a spiel all planned out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what
dialog: you said, about how all your movies
dialog: have to make a profit. And I
dialog: realized, what's the one thing, that
dialog: if you put in a movie, it'll be
dialog: successful??
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (he thinks)
dialog: Tits.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. Better than tits -- a star!
text: Georgie shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Eddie, you must have me confused with
dialog: David Selznick. I don't make major
dialog: motion pictures. I make crap.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, but if you took that crap and
dialog: put a star in it, you'd have something!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yeah. Crap with a star.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (impassioned)
dialog: No! It would be something better!
dialog: Something impressive. The biggest
dialog: moneymaker you've ever had!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Fine, maybe you're right. But it
dialog: doesn't friggin' matter. I can't
dialog: afford a star, so I don't even know
dialog: what we're talking about.
text: Ed grins.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What if I told you you could have a
dialog: star for $1000??
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Who?
text: Ed opens his valise and whips out an 8x10 GLOSSY OF BELA.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Lugosi?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah! Lugosi!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Isn't he dead?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: No, he's not dead! He lives in
dialog: Baldwin Hills. I met him recently,
dialog: and he wants to be in our picture.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: OUR picture?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Uh, yeah. Our picture.
text: Georgie mulls this over. He's interested.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Why would Lugosi want to be in a
dialog: sex-change flick?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because he's my friend.
text: Georgie stares carefully at Ed, then finally smiles.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Alright, fine! You can direct it.
dialog: I want a script in three days, and
dialog: we start shooting a week from Monday.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ED
text: He leaps up euphorically. He eagerly pumps Georgie's hand.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Thank you! Bless you, Mr. Weiss!
dialog: I promise I won't let you down!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: CU on a ROYAL TYPEWRITER. Ed's hands whirl across the portable
text: typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can
dialog: type. We PULL OUT.
text: Ed sits on the bed, typing. He's a blur of activity, juggling
text: a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes.
dialog: ED (on phone)
dialog: But Bunny, you're perfect for this
dialog: job! You're so good at organizing.
text: His adrenalin is pumping. Ed pours some booze into his coffee.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know these people. I need all
dialog: the transsexuals and transvestites
dialog: you can get.
dialog: (he sucks on his cigarette)
dialog: No, I don't care if they're not
dialog: actors. I want realism. I want this
dialog: film to tell the truth! I've waited
dialog: my whole life for this shot, and I'm
dialog: not gonna blow it.
text: There's a KNOCK at the door. Ed carries the phone on a long
text: cord and answers it. Bela hurries in, smiling broadly.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture!
dialog: You'll love your character!
dialog: (back into the phone)
dialog: Bunny, Bela's here. Look, hit the
dialog: bars, work some parties, and get me
dialog: transvestites! I need transvestites!
text: Ed hangs up and resumes typing. Bela is puzzled.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, It's about how people have two
dialog: personalities. The side they show
dialog: to the world, and then the secret
text: person they hide inside.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I've
dialog: always wanted to play Jekyll and
dialog: Hyde! I'm looking forward to this
dialog: production.
text: Ed stops typing. He pours Bela a drink.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ehh, your part's a little different.
dialog: You're like the God that looks down
dialog: on all the characters, and oversees
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well... you control everyone's fate.
dialog: You're like the puppetmaster.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (getting it)
dialog: Ah, so I pull the strings!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah. You pull the strings --
text: (he suddenly gets a look)
dialog: "Pull the strings"... hey, that's
dialog: pretty good!
text: Ed quickly starts typing again.

scene_heading: INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Ed and Dolores sit at a card table, finishing up dinner. The
text: dogs eat scraps below them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wipe off your hands. I've got a
dialog: little surprise for you...
dialog: (he smiles nervously)
dialog: I finished my script.
dialog: 
text: Ed anxiously pulls out a pile of pages. Dolores looks in awe
text: at the cover: "'GLEN OR GLENDA' By Edward D. Wood, Jr""
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as
dialog: soon as I get home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (apprehensive)
dialog: Well, I'd really like to know what
dialog: you think. Why don't you go in the
dialog: bedroom and take a look at it? I'll
dialog: Wait...
text: There's an uneasy moment between them. She senses something
text: funny. Dolores takes the script and goes into the bedroom.
text: The door closes. Ed starts pacing...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Dolores reads the script. She finishes the last page, then
text: looks up. She is very shaken.
dialog: 
text: Dolores stands. She grabs the door and opens it.
text: THROUGH THE DOORWAY
dialog: 
text: Ed stands somberly in drag. He's in a pantsuit, heels, and
text: pink angora sweater.
dialog: 
text: Dolores is totally rattled. She struggles for a response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: So that's where my sweater's been.
dialog: 
text: Ed silently nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: How long have you been doing this?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a
dialog: girl, so she used to dress me in
dialog: girlie clothing. It just kinda
dialog: became a habit.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This is my way of telling you --
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: (furious)
dialog: What, by putting it in a fuckin'
dialog: script, for everyone to see?! What
dialog: kind of sick mind would operate like
dialog: that?
text: Ed is terribly hurt. Dolores shakes tht script.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: And what about this so-called
dialog: "Barbara" character? It's obviously
dialog: ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is our
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Of course it is. And that's why you
dialog: should play the part.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
dialog: 
text: He calmly points at the script.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's a damn good role.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: That's not the issue!!
dialog: (she suddenly stops)
dialog: Ugh! How can you act so casual, when
dialog: you're dressed like that?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It takes me comfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Oh, just like in the script!
text: Ed smiles serenely.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: (he takes her hand)
dialog: So what do ya say? Do you wanna
dialog: break up... or do you wanna do the
dialog: movie with me?
text: Dolores sighs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCREEN CLASSICS - DAY
text: The hallway is filled with eager TRANSVESTITES. It's a very
text: festive atmosphere, and Bunny tries to create some order.
text: Inside the busy office, Paul types, and Conrad cranks a
text: mimeograph machine.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: It's good to have a job. Now I can
dialog: get my phone reconnected.
text: In a corner, Georgie angrily waves the script at Ed.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I thought this was gonna be a sex-
dialog: change film!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: There's still a sex-change --
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yeah! Five pages right before it
dialog: ends! The rest of the show is about
text: some schmuck who likes angora
dialog: sweaters.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't think he's a schmuck.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: And what's with this new title?! My
text: poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So change the poster. Trust me,
dialog: you'll be better off. This is a
dialog: story that's gonna grab people.
dialog: (he goes into a pitch)
dialog: It's about this guy. He's crazy
dialog: about this girl but he likes to
dialog: wear dresses. Should he tell her?
text: Should he not tell her? He's torn.
dialog: George, this is DRAMA.
text: Georgie throws up his hands
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Fine, shoot whatever baloney you
dialog: want! I give up. Just make sure
text: it's seven reels long.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING
text: We are on location for Ed's first film! A SMALL CREW of a
text: dozen unpacks the camera and reflectors from their cars. Ed's
text: voice rises above the hubbub.
speaker_heading: ED (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me, could I have everyone's
dialog: attention?! Could you gather around?
dialog: I've got something to say.
text: The crew members put down their things and gather in a circle.
text: In the middle, we reveal Ed, in complete drag. Dress, nylons,
text: pumps, lovely blonde wig... he's quite a sight. Like an eager
text: Scoutmaster, he addresses his troops.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Everybody, we're about to embark on
dialog: quite a journey. Four days of hard
dialog: work... but when it's over, we'll
dialog: have a picture that'll entertain,
dialog: enlighten, and maybe even move
dialog: millions of people.
text: A COUPLE GRIPS glance at each other.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Now the only way we're gonna achieve
dialog: all this is if we stay on schedule.
dialog: Day one -- TODAY -- we'll start easy.
dialog: We have eighteen silent scenes that
dialog: can be shot quickly: Cars parking,
dialog: Patrick's suicide, me strolling as
dialog: a man, me strolling as a woman, etc.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: After lunch, we'll bring in the
text: Inspector and the Doctor. The Doctor
dialog: is very important to the plot, so we
dialog: might have to spend time on retakes.
dialog: But it's worth it. Scene totals for
text: the first day is thirty-four.
dialog: (he catches a breath)
dialog: Day Two, we'll be a little busier --
text: Veteran CAMERAMAN BILL, an old guy with thick glasses, speaks.
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN BILL
dialog: Excuse me Eddie, I don't mean to
dialog: interrupt... but I'm gettin' a little
dialog: worried about those clouds.
text: He points up. Everybody looks at the sky. The clouds are
dialog: gray.
text: Ed nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Good thinkin'. We'll talk about Days
dialog: Three and Four later. Now let's get
dialog: that first shot off! It's Scene 17,
text: Glenda looking in the window.
speaker_heading: THE CREW
text: disperses. Ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly
text: make-up man, HARRY.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, do I need any touch-up?
scene_heading: MAKE-UP MAN HARRY
dialog: I'm telling ya, eyelashes are the way
dialog: to go.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Harry, we've discussed this a million
dialog: times. I don't want to look like a
dialog: girl. I want to look like myself.
scene_heading: MAKE-UP MAN MARRY
dialog: (disgruntled)
dialog: Fine. Then you look beautiful.
text: Harry humorlessly powders Ed's nose. Ed turns away and
text: suddenly SHOUTS into a giant megaphone.
speaker_heading: ED
scene_heading: PLACES, EVERYONE! ROLL CAMERA!
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN BILL
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: Rolling.
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: Ed chucks the megaphone and runs crazily past the camera and
text: behind a building.
speaker_heading: ED'S VOICE
dialog: And -- ACTION!
text: A pause, and then Ed, in character as Glenda, calm and
text: dignified, steps out and walks down the sidewalk.
text: Ed stops at a store window. He's totally in shadow.
text: A grip grimaces. He TURNS ON a light
text: Ed lights up. He looks in the window, admires a dress on
text: display, then silently walks out of frame.
text: A beat. Ed SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: ED
text: And, CUT! PRINT IT! LET'S MOVE ON!
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN BILL
dialog: Don't you want a second take, for
dialog: protection?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (exhilarated)
dialog: What's to protect? It was perfect!
text: Suddenly a police car turns the corner.
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER
dialog: Cops!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We don't have a permit. RUN!
text: Everyone grabs equipment and takes off.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LARCHMONT STUDIOS - DAY
text: The company is now shooting inside a dinky soundstage. There
text: are dirty mattresses tacked on the walls. They prep Bela's
text: set: A fishnet-draped armchair in front of a flat. Ed is
text: perched high in his director's chair, back in men's clothes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The set doesn't look right! It looks
dialog: too... empty. Clutter it up. Put
text: a skeleton in the corner. And what's
dialog: that thing over there?
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well it looks good. Let's use it!
text: Georgie hurriedly strides over. He holds the script.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Ed! What's with these revised
text: pages?! A scene in a smelting
dialog: factory? A buffalo stampede??
text: Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio
dialog: Beach??! What's going on here? I
dialog: can't afford to film this nonsense!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't worry. We're not gonna film
dialog: any of it.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Then how's it gonna get in the
dialog: picture?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know a guy in Universal's stock
dialog: house -- he's giving me the footage
dialog: for free. This movie's gonna look
dialog: like a million bucks.
dialog: Georgie nods. Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: O.S. VOICE
dialog: Mr. Lugosi has arrived!
text: Ed jumps excitedly.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh my God!
dialog: (he YELLS)
dialog: Mr. Lugosi is here! Now everyone,
text: when he walks on the stage
dialog: (nobody is listening; so Ed uses
speaker_heading: his MEGAPHONE)
text: Now everyone, when he walks on the
dialog: stage, treat him normal. I know Bela
dialog: Lugosi is a world-famous star, and
dialog: you're all a little excited, but
dialog: we're professionals. So if you treat
dialog: him with respect, everything will be
dialog: alright.
scene_heading: AT THE STAGE DOOR
text: The door swings open, and Bela strides in, looking dapper. He
text: glances at the teensy stage, and his face falls imperceptibly.
text: Ed runs up, bounding with enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela! It's so great to see you!
text: (he glances at his watch)
dialog: And eight o'clock on the dot. Right
dialog: on time!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I am always on time.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Of course! Well, we got a big day
dialog: planned for you... First, we're gonna
dialog: start off a little easy, with you in
dialog: that armchair over there. Then, once
dialog: you're up to speed and cooking, we'll
dialog: reset and bring out the laboratory
dialog: equipment --
speaker_heading: BELA
text: (he leans in and WHISPERS)
dialog: Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.
text: Ed and Bela step over to a corner.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: From a distance, Ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and
text: peels off a few bills for Bela. The crew watches, fascinated.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Bela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set. Harry does
text: his make-up. Harry glances at Bela's arm, and it is full of
text: TRACK MARKS. Harry grimaces, but doesn't say anything.
text: Conrad eagerly scurries up.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy,
dialog: but could I have your autograph?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (cordial)
dialog: Of course.
text: Conrad hands him a scrap of paper. Bela signs it.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: You know which movie of yours I love,
dialog: Mr. Lugosi? "The Invisible Ray."
dialog: You were great as Karloff's sidekick.
text: Bela's face suddenly hardens. He snaps.
speaker_heading: BELA
text: "Sidekick"?? "KARLOFF"?!!
text: Bela insanely RIPS up the autograph.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Fuck you!! Karloff doesn't deserve
dialog: to smell my shit! That limey
dialog: cocksucker can rot in hell, for all
dialog: I care!!!
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: Ed panickedly runs up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what
dialog: did you do?
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: (upset, close to crying)
dialog: Nothin'! I told him he was great.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: How dare that asshole bring up
dialog: Karloff?!! You think it takes talent
dialog: to play Frankenstein?! NO! It's
dialog: just make-up and grunting! GRRR!
speaker_heading: GRRR! GRRR!
text: Ed is frozen in fear. He glances across the stage.
text: Georgie is flabbergasted. He points urgently at his watch.
text: Ed nods. He motions to Conrad: Get out of here. Conrad runs
text: away. Ed leans in to Bela.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're right, Bela. Now Dracula,
dialog: that's a part that takes acting.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Of course! Dracula requires
text: presence. It's all in the voice, and
dialog: the eyes, and the hand --
text: Bela waves his outstretched arm. Ed tries to calm him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, you seem a little agitated.
dialog: Do you maybe wanna take a little
dialog: break, go for a nice walk... and then
dialog: we'll come back and shoot the scene?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: BULLSHIT! I am ready now! Roll the
dialog: camera!!
text: The crew is baffled. Ed shrugs at them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Um, okay... roll camera
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN BILL
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: Rolling.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sound!
speaker_heading: SOUNDMAN
dialog: Speed.
speaker_heading: CAMERA ASSISTANT
text: Mark. Scene Thirty-One.
text: The Assistant CLAPS the slate in front of Bela, then runs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And... action?
text: It's dead quiet. Nobody knows what's about to happen.
text: WE MOVE IN TO BELA. And... he suddenly assumes character.
text: Like the consumate pro he is. Bela gets a wicked, sinister
text: leer, then starts intoning threateningly:

scene_heading: INT. STAGE - NEXT DAY
text: Dolores studies her script, as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen

text: earrings. She stares in disbelief.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: How can you just walk around like
dialog: that, in front of all these people?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hon', nobody's bothered but you.
dialog: (he gestures)
dialog: Look around -- they couldn't care
dialog: less.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, this isn't the real world!
dialog: You've surrounded yourself with
speaker_heading: WEIRDOS!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Say it a little louder. I don't
dialog: think Bela heard you in his trailer.
text: Dolores quiets down. She feels bad.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dolores. I need your help...
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: FILMING IN PROGRESS - LATER
text: A scene is being shot, on camera. Ed (as Glen) and Dolores (as
text: Barbara) stare into each other's eyes. He's dressed normal,
text: and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater.
speaker_heading: ED (as GLEN)
dialog: "My mind's in a muddle. I thought
dialog: I could stop wearing these things.
dialog: I tried, honestly I tried..."
speaker_heading: DOLORES (as BARBARA)
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: "Glen, I don't fully understand this.
dialog: But maybe together -- we can work it
dialog: out."
text: She stands up, dramatically takes off her angora sweater, and
dialog: gives it to Ed.
text: He holds it meaningfully, then smiles proudly.
speaker_heading: ED
text: Music swells... and CUT and PRINT IT!
text: Ed and Dolores hug.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY
text: On a MOVIOLA, we see the black-and-white image of Dolores
text: taking off her angora and giving it to Ed.
text: WE PULL OUT. Ed and Georgie are hunched over, watching the
text: movie. Ed smiles proudly.
speaker_heading: ED
text: And we fade out. "The End."
dialog: (the film runs out)
dialog: What do you think?
text: Georgie peers at his watch. He shakes his bead.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I think it's fifty-seven minutes
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (like a lecturing teacher)
dialog: Ed, what was the one thing I asked
dialog: you to do? Make it seven reels long.
dialog: I've got contracts with my
dialog: exhibitors. If it ain't over an
dialog: hour, they won't play it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Gee, I used every frame of film we
dialog: shot. Maybe they won't notice.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: They'll notice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, why don't you let me take over
dialog: from here? I can do a few tricks:
dialog: Pad it out with more stock footage,
dialog: add establishing shots...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Um, I guess --
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Good. And one more thing. I think
dialog: your "Written, Directed, and Starring
dialog: Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why?! I did all those things! Hell,
dialog: I even built the props.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: And you did a bang-up job, too. But
dialog: you don't want other producers to
dialog: know that's you in drag. Trust me.
dialog: It's a career killer.
text: Ed is quite upset.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But I'm proud. I wrote, directed,
dialog: and starred in it just like Orson
dialog: Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yeah?? Well Orson Welles didn't
dialog: wear angora sweaters, did he??!
text: Ed is beaten.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's the cast and crew screening! The eager two-dozen people

text: The lights dim, and the movie starts. A LIBRARY MUSIC fanfare,
dialog: and then: "Bela Lugosi in GLEN OR GLENDA"
text: Everyone APPLAUDS excitedly. Bela smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: Credits continue: "Featuring Daniel Davis and Dolores Fuller"
text: The audience is audibly baffled. Bunny BLURTS out.
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: Daniel Who?!
text: Dolores leans in to Ed.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (sour)

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: LATER IN THE MOVIE
text: ON-SCREEN, Dolores looks tenderly at Ed.
speaker_heading: DOLORES (on screen)
dialog: "Glen. Is it another woman?"
text: Ed as Glen nervously ponders his response.
text: But suddenly -- MUSIC THUNDERS in. The movie cuts to buffalo
text: stampeding. Bela's angry face is superimposed over this.
speaker_heading: BELA (on screen)
dialog: "Pull the string! Pull the string!"
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: People are impressed by this technique. Bela nods in approval.
speaker_heading: ON-SCREEN
text: Out of nowhere, CHEAP JAZZ MUSIC starts, and the movie abruptly
text: cuts to SLEAZY STAG PARTY-STYLE FOOTAGE! A bare-chested man
text: whips a bound woman! A woman dominates another tied to a large
text: stick! A brunette violently rips off her dress and does a
dialog: hoochie-coochie dance!
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: The crowd is stunned.
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN BILL
dialog: I didn't shoot that!
text: Ed looks back at Georgie, who's wearing a big satisfied grin.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Georgie, what's with the stag
dialog: footage?? You said you were cutting
dialog: in establishing shots!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I did. I established some tits and
dialog: ass.
text: Ed rolls his eyes. He turns back to the movie.
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Everybody is CELEBRATING, with a raucous party. People are
text: boozing it up. BIG BAND MUSIC plays. Ed dances with Dolores.
text: Paul smokes a joint. Conrad falls over a table and breaks a
text: lamp. Bela dances happily with a cute young REDHEAD.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Wasn't I something..? Did you see
dialog: how I command the screen?!
text: Ed's giddy buddies stumble over with foaming glasses of beer.
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: Ed, it was superb.
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: A great show! A little strange...
dialog: but great -- especially my scenes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Just like I always promised. Now
dialog: you're among the immortals. You're
dialog: movie stars.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
text: (he raises his glass)
dialog: Here's to Ed. For making us into
dialog: something.
text: It's a warm moment. They all CLINK their glasses.
text: Dolores kisses Ed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE - DAY
text: We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house. Ed and
text: Dolores are moving in. They lug furniture from a rented truck.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: From today on, our lives are
dialog: different! We'll be swimming laps
dialog: in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I don't know. It's so much money...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These
dialog: are the moments in life you're
dialog: supposed to grab.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: But Ed, we're not even married. And
dialog: you don't have a job.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But you do! And anyway, I've got
dialog: tons of new scripts. And now that
dialog: I have a track record, studios are
dialog: bound to hire me!
text: She just stares. Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look on the bright side. If we miss
dialog: the rent, what's the worst they can
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Toss us out on our ass.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Exactly.
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW - DAY
text: The house is moved in. Ed's unkempt dogs run about. Pumped-up
text: Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an
text: angora sweater. A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a
text: bottle of booze lays in his lap. Bela sits quietly nearby.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How 'bout a western? People love
dialog: westerns.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: But, I don't like horses. Do I have
dialog: to get on one?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Eh, forget it. What else is big?
dialog: (his face lights up)
dialog: Teenagers! Jailbait pics! Yeah...
dialog: You got the juvenile delinquent, his
dialog: girlfriend from the wrong side of the
dialog: tracks --
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Who do I play?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father.
dialog: He's angry! He doesn't like seeing
dialog: his son -- no -- he doesn't like
dialog: seeing his daughter behave this way!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (cautious, not to offend)
dialog: Well... can't I play the romantic
dialog: part? I'm tired of always being the
dialog: bad guy. You know, back in Hungary,
dialog: I played Romeo! I would like to be
dialog: the lover again -- me, in a boat,
dialog: with the girl...
dialog: Ed considers this.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sure. Romance, that's great! To
dialog: engineer your comeback, we're gonna
dialog: need a whole slate of pictures. Once
dialog: "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll
dialog: slam you into one, then another, then
dialog: another!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: That's good. I could use the money.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But we need to start off with a bang!
dialog: Something we know the audience will
dialog: want to see. Mmm. What was your
dialog: biggest hit?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (he thinks)
dialog: Hmm... my biggest hit? That would
dialog: probably be "Dracula."
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Of course!
text: Ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "DRACULA."
text: Bela frowns.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Those bastards at Universal. I made
dialog: so much money for them, and now I
dialog: can't get the time of day.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So let's make another "Dracula."
dialog: Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: We can't. Those sons-a-bitches
dialog: control the rights.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They do? Shoot. There must be a
dialog: way to get around that...
text: Ed's mind is working. He holds out the paper and stares at
text: it. Suddenly, he grins. He grabs the pen and makes a period
text: after the "DR." It now says "DR.ACULA"
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Dracula?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No! Doctor Acula! You can still
dialog: wear the cape, have the fangs...
dialog: but you're a doctor! Not a count.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Ah! This is very exciting.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (inspired)
dialog: I gotta type this up, while it's
dialog: still fresh!
text: Ed rips the paper from his typewriter, puts in a blank page,
text: and starts typing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE STUDIO GATE - DAY
text: We're outside the imposing gates of MGM. The lion logo is
text: overhead. Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible.
text: He wears his nicest suit. Ed peers nervously at the GUARD.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr.
dialog: Feldman.
text: The Guard stares suspiciously at Ed. His filthy car is leaking
dialog: oil.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Edward D. Wood, Junior.
text: The man frowns. He looks through his files -- then finds a
text: parking slip with Ed's name. He is surprised.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Oh. Eh, he's in the Executive
dialog: Building. You can park in the
dialog: reserved section.
text: Ed smiles.
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: The room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors.
text: Ed sits nervously under posters for "GRAND HOTEL" and "QUO
text: VADIS." Film cans labled "Glen Or Glenda" rest in his lap.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Sir, Mr. Feldman will see you now.
text: She hits an electric button. A large oak door swings open.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE
text: Behind a giant desk is MR. FELDMAN, a glib, thin over-
text: caffeinated man. He jumps up, smiling.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (shaking his hand)
dialog: It's Wood. Ed Wood.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Wood? Ward? Wood.
text: (puzzled, he glances at his
dialog: appointment book)
dialog: Hey, what do you know. It is Wood.
dialog: Dang secretaries, you can never get
dialog: a good one. Right?
text: Ed shrugs. Feldman grins.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: So what are you bringing me? Looks
dialog: like you got some film cans.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have
dialog: resumes to show. I've got my own
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Really?! Well good for you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I just made this picture, over at
text: Screen Classics. It opens next week.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Screen Classics? Hmm, don't know
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm
dialog: givin' you first crack at my talents.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: I can't wait to take a look.
text: (he claps his hands)
dialog: So what's up next?
text: Ed leans in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe
dialog: in thinking small. So I've got a
dialog: whole slate of pictures for you: "The
dialog: Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes
dialog: West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Doctor Acula? I don't get it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dr. Acula!
text: Ed writes it out, "DR. ACULA," then waves it in Feldman's face.
text: Feldman nods.
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Oh, "Dr. Acula." I get it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't like it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But Bela Lugosi's in it!
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Lugosi's washed-up. What else you
dialog: got?
text: Ed grimaces. Lugosi was 90% of his pitch. He vamps.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well... I've got another project I
dialog: wasn't gonna tell you about.
dialog: Lugosi's in it, but he's got a
text: smaller part. The lead is an
text: ingenue, a sterling young actress
dialog: named Dolores Fuller. The title is
dialog: "Bride Of The Atom."
speaker_heading: MR. FELDMAN
dialog: Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like
dialog: it.
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why
dialog: don't you leave those film cans, and
dialog: my associates and I will take a look
dialog: at your little opus. Maybe we can
dialog: do business together.
text: Ed is elated.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO SCREENING ROOM - DAY
text: Feldman and his fellow SMARMY EXECUTIVES sit in a plush
text: screening room. They are viewing "Glen Or Glenda."
text: ON-SCREEN, Ed is in drag. A SOLEMN NARRATOR within the movie
dialog: speaks:
speaker_heading: SOLEMN NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: "Give this man satin undies, a dress,
dialog: and a sweater... and he's the
dialog: happiest man in the world. He can
dialog: work better, think better, even play
dialog: better -- and be more of a credit to
dialog: his community and his government."
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE EXECUTIVES
dialog: They are stupefied. Yikes!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: What the hell is this?!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: Is this an actual movie?!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: It can't be.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: It's fuckin' ridiculous!
text: Feldman squints at the screen.
speaker_heading: FELDMAN
dialog: Wait a minute. That guy in the dress
dialog: -- he's the one I met with today!
dialog: This must be a big PUT-ON!
speaker_heading: (he CHUCKLES)
dialog: It's probably another one of Billy
dialog: Wellman's practical jokes!
text: Everybody suddenly starts HOWLING with laughter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY
text: Ed zooms up and chipperly jumps from his car. He buys a "Los
text: Angeles Herald-Express," eagerly opens it to the entertainment
text: pages... and then gets a confused look. Ed quickly starts
text: rifling through the pages -- something is wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
text: Ed angrily shouts into the phone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Georgie, what happened?! I thought
dialog: "Glen Or Glenda" was opening next
dialog: week! Where's the ads?
text: An OLD-FASHIONED SPLIT SCREEN of Georgie on the phone appears.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (pissed-off)
dialog: "Where's the ads"?! The ads are in
dialog: Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri! You
dialog: schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why not??
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Because I can't sell it to save my
dialog: life! You made a goddamn feathered
dialog: fish. Is it an art film, a horror
dialog: show, a hygiene flick? Nobody knows!
dialog: I'm beggin' people to book it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (insulted)
dialog: Maybe it needs special handling.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more
dialog: money into different titles:
dialog: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led
dialog: Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER!
dialog: Nobody wants to see the piece of
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You can't talk that way about my
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: "Your movie"?! I wish it was your
dialog: movie! I wish I hadn't blown every
dialog: dime I ever made into this stinkbomb.
dialog: If I ever see you again, I'll kill

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: WHAM! A WRESTLER throws another WRESTLER at the mat. The

dialog: Matches!
text: In the stands are Ed, Dolores, Bunny, and Bunny's new YOUNG
text: MALE "FRIEND." Seated around them are hollering truckers and

speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: So guess where I'm going next
dialog: weekend?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't know. Where?
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: Mexico! And guess what I'm going to
dialog: do there?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (not enjoying this game)
dialog: I dunno. Lie on the beach?
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: WRONG! I'm getting my first series
dialog: of hormone shots! And once those

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jesus! Are you serious?
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: Yes! I've dreamed of it for years,

dialog: got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS!
text: The truckers nearby stare. Dolores covers her face.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ssh! Will you keep it down?
text: The crowd suddenly ROARS and jumps up. A favorite wrestler has
text: entered the ring, massive TOR JOHNSON, 50. Tor is an
text: incredible sight: A bald, lumbering behemoth.
scene_heading: RING ANNOUNCER (amplified)
text: Now entering the ring, in the gold
text: trunks, 350 bone-crunching pounds of
dialog: pure strength, the "Swedish Angel"...
dialog: Tor Johnson!!!
text: The crowd goes apeshit. The stands are going to collapse from
text: the SHOUTING.
text: Ed's eyes are the size of saucers.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: My God, look at that guy. He's a
dialog: mountain!
text: The bell RINGS. Tor quickly grabs his OPPONENT, a man in a

text: his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes.
text: People CHEER. Ed is flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I've never seen anything like him!
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and
dialog: I are getting married --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (eyes glued to the ring)
dialog: Ssh! He's so big! He's a monster!
dialog: Can you imagine what that guy would
dialog: be like in a movie?
speaker_heading: ON TOR

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WRESTLER'S BAR - NIGHT
text: A tiny miniature European car pulls up. Tor Johnson is
text: squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle. Tor

scene_heading: INT. WRESTLER'S BAR - SAME TIME
text: This rowdy bar is packed with burly WRESTLERS. Tor walks in,

text: In person, he actually seems a jolly, outgoing fellow.
text: Ed waves from the corner
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mr. Johnson, over here!
text: Tor smiles and lumbers over
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Glad you could fit me in your
dialog: schedule.
speaker_heading: TOR
text: (in a hoarse SWEDISH ACCENT)
dialog: Da pleasure be mine.

dialog: mitts.
text: Tor tries to sit in the booth. But he can't fit.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Could we moovf to table?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, of course!
text: Ed jumps up. They move to a large table. Now Tor is happy.
text: He starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So, Mr. Johnson --
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Tor!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Tor. Have you ever thought about
dialog: becoming an actor?
speaker_heading: TOR
speaker_heading: (he CHUCKLES)
dialog: Mm, not good-lookink enough.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I think you're quite handsome.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: No. With hair, yah. But I must
dialog: shave head for wrestlink. It scare
dialog: da crowds. Dey like that.
text: Ed smiles.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, I think you'd be a sensation
dialog: in pictures.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: But what bout accent? Some people
dialog: tink I haf too much accent.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nah, that doesn't matter! It's a

text: A WAITRESS saunters over.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Tor, what can I get ya?
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: I'll haf eight beers.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (nonchalant, to Ed)
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uhh, I'll have just one.
text: She walks off. Tor shakes the now-empty nut bowl.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: And more nuts!
text: Ed tries to grab Tor's attention.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So anyway, I've got this new script,
dialog: "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a
dialog: part you're ideal for: "Lobo." He's
text: tough. A brute. But he has a heart
text: -- and at the end he saves the girl.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: (he laughs merrily)
dialog: I like. When do movie shoot?
speaker_heading: ED

scene_heading: EXT. BELA'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela?!
text: Ed tries the door. It's unlocked.
scene_heading: INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Ed steps into the dark room, and is stunned by what he sees:

text: next to him.
text: The dogs crouch behind him, whimpering, despondent,

speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Eddie... my friend.
text: Aghast, Ed runs over.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela, what happened?!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I didn't feel well...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Let me take you to the hospital.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: No hospital. Just take me to the

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Should I call a doctor?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Nah. This happens all the time...
text: Ed puts a pillow under Bela's head.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: BELA

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm no good.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela needs a job... I can't even get
dialog: a film going...
dialog: (listless)
dialog: But of course I can't -- I made the
dialog: worst movie of all time.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: That's ridiculous.
text: Ed sighs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: All I wanna do is tell stories. The
dialog: things I find interesting...
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Well maybe you're not studio kind of
dialog: material. Maybe you just need to
dialog: raise the money yourself.
text: Ed looks up.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Ed sits opposite a LOAN OFFICER.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The movie is called "Bride Of The

scene_heading: INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...It will star Bela Lugosi. Each

scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
text: Ed stands at a busy intersection. He YELLS into a phone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yes, that's right. The Bela Lugosi.
text: He's still alive.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Huh? Is he available Friday night?
dialog: Gee, I suppose so... Why?
dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
text: We're backstage at a '5Os variety show. It's exciting live TV:
text: Showgirls, techies, and cast members dart about in a state of
text: hyped-up tumult.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Bela and Ed sit in his dressing room, running lines. Bela is
text: in his Count outfit: Cape, jet black hair, red lips, etc. They
text: both read off SCRIPTS.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: "Greetings. I am the Count."
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: "Greetings. I am Slick
dialog: Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure."
dialog: Audience laughs. Applause. "Say,
dialog: that's a funny place to sleep."
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: "It is my home."
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: "Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh.
dialog: "You need a new real estate agent."
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: "Beg to differ. This casket
dialog: incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
text: Ed interrupts.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No Bela, that's "incorporates." Look,
dialog: just say "This casket has..."
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Ach! How do they expect a Hungarian
dialog: to pronounce this dialogue? This
dialog: live television is madness!
text: An ASSISTANT knocks and sticks her head in.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
text: Five minutes, Mr. Lugosi.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - MINUTES LATER
text: Ed and Bela stand in the wings. Onstage is the SHOW HOST, a
text: cheesy comedian. He is doing a routine with Criswell, the
text: famed psychic who opened this movie. Criswell wears a tux and
text: a turban and is acting mysterious.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: And then what's gonna happen?
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: In 1960, the automobile will have
text: retractable wings, so it can fly.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Sounds like a heck of a way to beat
dialog: traffic.
text: Audience LAUGHS. Criswell rubs his temples enigmatically.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: By 1970, Man will have colonized
dialog: Mars. Millions of people will live
dialog: there.
text: Ed is mesmerized.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wow! Ain't that something.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - LATER
text: We're out in the audience. The curtain rises on a SPOOKY SET:
text: Shadows, cobwebs, and a coffin in the center. The Host walks
text: onstage, to huge APPLAUSE. He's playing his "Slick" character,
text: a befuddled moron in a funny hat. The Host shines a flashlight
text: around, and then the coffin opens. Bela sits up. There's more
speaker_heading: APPLAUSE.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Greetings. I am the Count.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz,
dialog: Seeker of Adventure.
text: The audience LAUGHS. Then APPLAUSE.
speaker_heading: HOST

speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: It is my home.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Oh, tract housing, huh?
scene_heading: (he starts AD-LIBBING)
dialog: I guess I shouldn't complain about
dialog: my duplex in Burbank. What a dump.
dialog: Some places have a Murphy bed, this
dialog: place has a Murphy shower. I still
dialog: don't know where to hang the towels!
text: The audience HOWLS with laughter. Bela is totally lost. He
text: seems incredibly confused.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Uh, beg to differ.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: "Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin'
dialog: about my duplex in Burbank!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (terrified, groping)
dialog: Uh, Greetings. I am the Count...
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - LATER

speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: I told you we should've gotten
dialog: Karloff.
text: He exits. A door opens, and Ed and Bela quietly step out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela, don't worry. You're better
dialog: than all this crap.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (distraught)
dialog: I never said I could ad-lib...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Forget about it. We'll make our new
dialog: movie, and you'll be a star again.
text: They shuffle away... until Criswell and his snazzy ENTOURAGE
text: burst around a corner. Even in person, Criswell is ethereal
text: and quite self-important. He is delighted to see Bela.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Mr. Lugosi! It is an unparalleled
dialog: privilege to meet you. Allow me to
dialog: introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (morose)
dialog: It's a pleasure...
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over
dialog: what happened tonight.
text: (he points at his temple)
dialog: I predict that your next project will
dialog: be an outstanding success!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: And who may you be?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Edward Wood, Sir.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Ah. The director of "Glen Or
dialog: Glenda."
speaker_heading: ED

text: Criswell shouts above the din at a WAITER.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.
dialog: Eddie will have another whiskey,
dialog: Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha
dialog: and King are chablis -- hey Bela,
dialog: would you like a wine?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: No. I never drink -- wine.
text: The whole table CRACKS UP. Bela cheers up. Ed turns to
dialog: Criswell.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be
dialog: living on Mars by 1970? How'd you
dialog: know it wouldn't be 1975, or even
dialog: 1980?
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: I guessed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: I made it up. It's horseshit!
text: Ed's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: There's no such thing as a psychic.
dialog: People believe my folderol because
text: I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's that easy?
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all
text: about razzle-dazzle. Appearances.
dialog: If you dress nice and talk well,
dialog: people will swallow anything.
text: Criswell smiles knowingly. Ed nods at this profound wisdom.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONSERVATIVE MAN
dialog: Excuse me. We're here for the Wood

speaker_heading: DOORMAN

scene_heading: INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT

text: strutting about with flutes of champagne like they're extras
dialog: in "The Great Gatsby."
text: Bewildered POTENTIAL BACKERS wander around. Ed shmoozes them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We're gonna have the most terrifying
dialog: monster ever seen on film! A ghastly
dialog: creature created from an atomic
dialog: mutation!
speaker_heading: BACKER'S WIFE
dialog: I don't like scary movies. I go more
dialog: for ones with love stories.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (without dropping a beat)
dialog: Well that's what this movie is...
dialog: a heartbreaking romance! It's about
text: a young reporter, Janet Lawton, in
text: love with a young cop, Dick Craig.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: Conrad and Paul sit in a corner. Conrad has a shoe off and is
text: scratching his foot. Ed alarmedly runs over.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What do you think you're doin'?!
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: These shoes are itchy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You can't sit! You gotta walk
dialog: around, with good posture. You want
dialog: these people to think we have class.
dialog: Otherwise they'll never invest in our
dialog: movie.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE PARTY
text: Two AMAZED BACKERS have their hands around Tor's giant arm.
speaker_heading: AMAZED BACKER

speaker_heading: TOR

dialog: Biceps 22! Chest 62! Stomach 54!
speaker_heading: AMAZED BACKER

scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: An excited HICK BACKER shakes Bela's hand.
speaker_heading: HICK BACKER
dialog: Mr. Lugosi, I can't believe I'm

dialog: life.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Thank you. And you are?
speaker_heading: HICK BACKER
dialog: Charlie Johnson! I manufacture
text: toothpaste tubes.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE PARTY
text: Criswell struts in the b.g., talking to someone.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: I predict "Bride Of The Atom" will
dialog: be the biggest moneymaker of all
dialog: time!
text: In the f.g., Ed introduces Dolores to a SOUTHERN BACKER.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And this is lovely starlet Dolores
text: Fuller, who will play Janet Lawton.
scene_heading: SOUTHERN BACKER
dialog: And how much will this picture cost?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: In a normal studio it would be
dialog: half-a-million, with all their
text: wasteful overhead and fancy offices.
dialog: But because we're more efficient, we
dialog: can bring it in for seventy grand!
scene_heading: SOUTHERN BACKER
dialog: Hmm. Well I'll consider it...
scene_heading: EXT. BROWN DERBY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Ed and his buddies wave goodbye to the departing backers.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (to Ed)
dialog: So how'd we do?
speaker_heading: ED
text: (faking a big smile, but SOTTO
speaker_heading: VOCE to Bela)
dialog: We didn't make a dime.
text: IN THE PARKING LOT
text: A VALET hands the car keys to the Conservative Backer.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: That's twenty-five cents, sir.
text: The man glances at his Wife. She shrugs.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I gave all my money to the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND DOLORES'S BACKYARD - DAY
text: Ed sits in a chaise lounge by the pool, studying papers and

speaker_heading: DOLORES
text: Ed, the landlord called again. He
dialog: wants his money.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's the problem! Nobody cares
dialog: about my movie! I'm tryin' so hard,
dialog: I don't know what else to do!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Don't get angry at me. Maybe you
dialog: just need a day job.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Dolores, don't you understand? I'm
dialog: a director now! I made "Glen Or
dialog: Glenda." Directing is my day job.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: (irate)
dialog: All I know is, ever since "Glen Or
dialog: Glenda," all you do is booze it up
dialog: and wear my clothes!

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (dour)
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: Well my cousin Fred met this dame

dialog: money," and he thinks she's loaded.
dialog: And here's the kicker: She's very

speaker_heading: ANGLE - ED

text: The waiter is bewildered. He hurries away. Ed leans in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So my associate Mr. Marco tells me
dialog: you may be interested in investing
text: in a motion picture.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
text: Perhaps a small amount of money.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: How much do one of your motion
dialog: pictures cost?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: For this one, we need $60,000.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: That's all?? That seems very
dialog: reasonable for an entire picture.
dialog: Ed perks up. She's a live one!
text: Ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to look at the
dialog: photoplay.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Oh my, this is very interesting.
dialog: (she skims the pages)
dialog: Say... do you think it would be
dialog: possible for me to maybe play one of
dialog: these parts?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (very enthused)
dialog: Oh, of course!! There's a couple
dialog: characters you'd be perfect for: The
text: secretary at the newspaper office,
dialog: or the file clerk!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Hmm. Those sound kind of small.
dialog: (stopping at a page)
dialog: Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet
dialog: Lawton. I'd sure like to play her.
text: Ed blanches.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: J-Janet Lawton???
speaker_heading: LORETIA
dialog: Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part
dialog: to play. She's got some real meaty
dialog: scenes! Can't you just see me in
dialog: that part??
speaker_heading: CU - ED

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Who do you think's been paying the
dialog: rent?! Who helped type your script,
dialog: and did all your grunt work?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm sorry! What did you want me to
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Like what?!
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This is gonna be Bela's laboratory,

speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: You mean a Tesla coil?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: If you say so.
text: Tor lumbers over, in his ripped Lobo outfit. His face has fake

speaker_heading: TOR

dialog: like.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Really? Was the third act too

speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: (trying to be polite)

speaker_heading: ED

dialog: You're second billed.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk.
dialog: But Tor, he no talk.
text: Ed thinks. He quickly puts a spin on this.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Tor, dialogue is overrated. You look

dialog: they? Fairbanks. Chaplin. They
dialog: didn't talk! They did it all with
text: their face.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: (still bothered)
dialog: But Greta say --

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN BILL

speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: BELA

text: Ed turns to Tor and Loretta. She wears a wedding gown.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Here's the scene. Loretta, you're
dialog: in a trance. You glide in and get
text: on the operating table. Now Tor,
dialog: you're supposed to tie her down. But
dialog: you have an angora fetish... and
dialog: when you rub that swatch of angora,

speaker_heading: TOR

scene_heading: SHOOTING - LATER
text: The scene begins.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ACTION!
speaker_heading: BELA (as VORNOFF)

speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: "Dear, you are a woman of super
dialog: strength and beauty. A lovely vision
dialog: of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"
dialog: (he breaks character)
dialog: Damn! Eddie, I'm sorry I can't
dialog: remember all this. I'm an old man.
dialog: It's too long.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's fine, Bela. We're still

dialog: lovely."
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (he snaps back into character)
dialog: "Dear, you're lovely."
dialog: (he turns to Tor)
dialog: "Strap her to the table."

text: Bela is furious.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: "Do as I command you!"

speaker_heading: BELA

dialog: stage needs his money.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Well then you should pay him,
dialog: shouldn't you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: Yeah. Exactly!
text: There's a pause. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I kinda need it now.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (baffled)
dialog: What are you looking at me like that
dialog: for? I already gave you my
dialog: three hundred.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah. Well I need the other
dialog: sixty-thousand.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What other sixty-thousand?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The other sixty-thousand you said
dialog: you'd give me.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You misunderstood. I gave you
dialog: everything I have in the world:
dialog: Three-hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - ED
text: He looks like he s going to throw up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
text: The large stage door SLAMS shut.
text: Ed's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street. Bela, Tor,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT
dialog: We're back at the Brown Derby, for another backers party. The
text: same banner is hanging: "BRIDE OF THE ATOM -- NEXT YEAR'S SMASH
dialog: HIT!"
text: The whole crowd is there, dressed up. Bela sits in the corner,
text: knocking back a drink.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Here we go again.
text: Paul whispers to Bunny.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: So is Dolores coming?
speaker_heading: BUNNY
dialog: (very catty)
dialog: I can't imagine why. I wouldn't put
dialog: up with a boyfriend who sold me out
dialog: for three-hundred dollars...!
speaker_heading: ON ED
text: Ed stands with a circle of POTENTIAL BACKERS. He has an edge
dialog: of desperation we've never seen before.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...lemme tell you, you can't lose.
dialog: It's scary! And if you don't like
dialog: that, it's romantic! Bela Lugosi
dialog: portrays Dr. Vornoff, and lovely
dialog: ingenue Loretta King is reporter
dialog: Janet Lawton.
scene_heading: POTENTIAL BACKER
text: Hmm. Lugosi looks pretty old.
text: (he squints across the room)
dialog: Which role is Vampira playing?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Vampira...?
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Why do you ask??
scene_heading: POTENTIAL BACKER
text: Well I see her standing over there.
text: The guy points. Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing
text: in the next room. She's at a different party.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well... she's playing --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Could you excuse me one moment??
text: Ed dashes from the room.
scene_heading: NEXT ROOM OVER
text: Vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types. She's
text: in street clothes, but clearly recognizable. Ed runs up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (sweaty)
dialog: You don't know me, but my name is Ed
dialog: Wood. I'm a film producer. I'm
dialog: currently in production on a
dialog: science-fiction piece, with Bela
dialog: Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor
dialog: Johnson. And I saw you here, and I
dialog: thought: Kismet!
text: Vampira stares, totally uncomprehending.
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: I don't understand. Do you want my
dialog: autograph?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. I think my film is perfect for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: You want me to show it on my TV
dialog: program? Well I got nothing to do
dialog: with that. You should call up the
dialog: station manager at Channel Seven --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (unyielding)
dialog: No! I don't want you to show the
dialog: movie, I want you to be in it! See,
dialog: maybe I should explain: We started
dialog: shooting, but then after three days
dialog: we got shut down. So we're having
dialog: a backers party, to raise some more
dialog: money. Perhaps you'd like to come
text: next door and meet some of the
dialog: backers...?
text: Vampire glances at her friends. They uncomfortably turn away.
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and
dialog: we're about to eat --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (begging)
dialog: Please! It'll only take a minute.
dialog: You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and
dialog: meet my backers! There's a really
dialog: nice dentist from Oxnard...
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: Look buddy, I'm a big star. I've got
dialog: real offers from real studios. I
dialog: don't need to blow some dentist for
dialog: a part. So forget it!
text: BACK AT THE PARTY
text: The backers glance into the next room. Ed is in front of
text: Vampira, begging on his hands and knees.
speaker_heading: BACKER
dialog: (to another backer)
dialog: I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
dialog: Let's get out of here.
text: The backers pick up their coats. Through the doorway, Ed sees
text: this. He jumps up and frantically runs back in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Where are you guys going?! You can't
dialog: leave!
speaker_heading: BACKER
dialog: (running out)
dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Wood.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (insane)
dialog: You can't go! You haven't seen the
dialog: storyboards!
text: The backers run out of the room. They're gone.
text: Ed shouts after them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Fine! SCREW YOU! If you don't have
dialog: the balls to roll the dice, then I
dialog: don't want your stinking money!!
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Please, come back!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND DOLORES' HOUSE - DAY
text: Ed and Dolores are being evicted. Their belongings are
text: scattered in front. They bitterly carry furniture out of the
text: house. Ed stumbles and slurs his speech. He is drunk.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Goddamn landlord.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I told you this was gonna happen.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Maybe if you'd come to the backers
dialog: party, I would've gotten the money.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: That's moronic. Why would a bit
dialog: player impress a backer?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he starts yelling)
dialog: Look, how many times can I say I'm
dialog: sorry? I blew it! I thought she was
dialog: rich.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: That's a good reason to dump your
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't dump you! Get it through
dialog: your skull -- I just recast the part!
text: Ed drops the furniture. He flops onto the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: You're a fuckin' mess.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out
dialog: where we're gonna stay.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I'm going to my mother's.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Does she have room for me?

speaker_heading: DOLORES

scene_heading: EXT. TOWERING TEMPLE - NIGHT
text: Ed and Bela stroll through a parking lot. Ed is sobered up and

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela, I don't know what I'm doin'
dialog: anymore...
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Stop worrying. This is going to
dialog: raise your spirits.
text: They reach the strange entrance to an avant-garde, Eastern
text: based quasi-religious temple. Bela puts out his cigar, and
text: they enter the oversized doors.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME
text: Sphinxes and Bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls. A

speaker_heading: LECTURER
dialog: Thou eternal sun, who has covered the
dialog: consciousness with thy golden disc,
dialog: do thou remove the veil so that I may
dialog: see the truth within?
text: Bela leads Ed to a seat, stepping past men in fezzes and odd
text: elderly women in fur coats. As the lecture continues, Ed
text: WHISPERS in bafflement.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: This is the Philosophical Research
dialog: Society. A refuge for free thinkers.
dialog: I've been coming here for twenty
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: LECTURER
dialog: ...for the truth which is within thee
dialog: is within me. And I am Truth.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Most people in this country, they
dialog: know nothing, about Eastern mysticism.
dialog: They are afraid of it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I am open-minded. It gives me
dialog: hope.
speaker_heading: LECTURER
dialog: We have the wisdom to govern and the
dialog: divine right to inherit the earth in
dialog: good condition. We have the power
dialog: to build worlds.
text: Ed leans in to Bela.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Bad decisions are easy to live with.
dialog: Forget. Just keep looking forward.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But was it a bad decision? At the
dialog: time, I thought her money would save
dialog: the movie.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Eddie, you screwed up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Yeah, I did.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LATER
text: The lecture is over. The speaker shakes hands with people.
text: Bela leads Ed along.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: In life, the decisions that haunt you
dialog: are the ones where you just don't
dialog: know... where right or wrong will
dialog: never be answered.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Years ago, the Hungarians contacted
dialog: me. The government wanted me to come
dialog: home, to be Minister of Culture.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: It was a very impressive offer.
dialog: Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be
dialog: treated like a king.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So why didn't you do it?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I didn't know if it was a trick.
dialog: They might arrest me and throw me in
text: a gulag.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I am Hungary's most famous emigrant.
dialog: they'd use me as a lesson to anyone
text: who tries to leave.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But maybe not.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Correct. So instead, I stayed here,
dialog: waiting for my comeback. Always
dialog: hoping... the next film, the next
dialog: film... that would be the one.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Your next film. That will be the
dialog: one.

scene_heading: INT. MCCOY MEATPACKING PLANT - DAY
text: We're in a noisy meat-packing plant. WORKERS in blood-stained
text: aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef.
text: Ed walks down an aisle with DONALD E. McCOY, a wealthy Texan
text: meat man. Old Man McCoy is a tough-talking, tobacco-chewing,
dialog: straight shooter.
speaker_heading: ED
text: ...and then Dr. Vornoff falls in the
text: pit, and his own octopus attacks and
dialog: eats him! The End.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: Whew! That's quite a story. So you
dialog: made the movie, and now you want to
dialog: make it again?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (gently correcting him)
dialog: No. We shot ten minutes of the
dialog: movie, and now we're looking for
dialog: completion funds.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: Son, you're too vague. I come from
dialog: the world of business. I need to
dialog: know what I get for my investment.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Movies are very popular. You could
dialog: make a lot of money.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: Yeah, but most of 'em flop, don't
dialog: they? What am I tangibly guaranteed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well... you get "Executive Producer"
dialog: credit.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: That don't mean diddley.
text: (he suddenly SHOUTS angrily)
dialog: BILLY BOB! You're cutting 'em TOO
speaker_heading: LEAN.
text: McCoy grabs a CLEAVER from a worker and slams it into a chop.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mr. McCoy, how can I make you happy?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: Cut to the chase, heh? That's good!
dialog: That's very good.
text: McCoy SPITS his tobacco.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: Okay, two things. Number one: I want
text: the movie to end with a big
text: explosion. Sky full of smoke.
speaker_heading: ED
text: But the story ends with Dr. Vornoff
dialog: falling in the pit --
speaker_heading: OLD MAN McCOY
dialog: Not anymore. And number two: I've
dialog: got a son. He's a little slow -- but
dialog: a good boy. And something tells me

speaker_heading: WRESTLING COACH

speaker_heading: TOR

speaker_heading: WRESTLING COACH

speaker_heading: BUNNY

speaker_heading: AT DOLORES

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure
dialog: you got my message.
speaker_heading: DOLORES

speaker_heading: DOLORES

dialog: (she looks around)
dialog: Say, who's the lug?
text: In a corner, standing by himself, is dumb TONY McCOY, Old Man
text: McCoy's worthless son. He's a good-looking, moody hunk. Tony

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: "Now Janet, I want you straying away
dialog: -- oops -- staying away from the old
dialog: Willows Place."
text: Ed shrugs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's Tony McCoy. He's playing
dialog: Lieutenant Dick Craig.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Oh really? How much money did he put
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: None.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But his dad gave me fifty grand.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: (snide)
dialog: Wood Productions. The mark of
dialog: quality.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey, the movie's getting made.
dialog: That's the main thing.

text: Ed stands alone, feeling bad.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: The set is a one-wall "office hallway": A doorway and a water
text: cooler. Loretta sits in a make-up chair, as Harry works on

speaker_heading: DOLORES (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Harry -- long time no see.
text: Harry turns, surprised. Dolores stands behind him. There's a
text: thick tension. He smiles anxiously.
scene_heading: MAKE-UP MAN HARRY
dialog: Hi Dolores...
speaker_heading: LORETA
dialog: Oh, you're Dolores?! I've heard so

speaker_heading: DOLORES

speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Mm, that mole still shows.
text: Loretta frowns. Ed quickly steps in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ladies! You both look fine. Why

dialog: Okay. Janet Lawton has discovered

dialog: Eddie, what's my motivation?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (thrown off)
dialog: Oh. Er... well you're the file
dialog: clerk. You're hurrying into the

speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: But what's our relationship? Are
dialog: we good friends, or is she just a

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Dolores, I got five days to shoot
dialog: this movie. Quit kidding around.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DOLORES (as File Clerk)
dialog: "Janet, the boss has been looking
dialog: for you."
speaker_heading: LORETTA (as Janet Lawton)

speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: I'm good at bashink!!
speaker_heading: CRISWELL

scene_heading: OUTSIDE A SOUNDSTAGE
text: They reach a stage door. Ed tries it -- but it's locked.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: TOR

speaker_heading: CONRAD

text: It drops incredibly fast. The thing must weigh half a ton.
text: Tor's eyes widen.
text: And the octopus smashes straight on top of him.
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: Tor is gone from sight. One of the eight tentacles snaps off.
text: UP IN THE CATWALK
text: Criswell moans.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Oh my God. We killed him.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: Ed runs to the octopus and looks for Tor underneath.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Bedder than wrestlink!

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You don't understand! The octopus
dialog: is supposed to live in a lake!
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: This is kind of a stream--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: NO! It has to be UNDERWATER!
text: Ed storms away. Conrad scratches his head.
text: IN A DUSTY PARKING LOT

speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know
dialog: if I can handle a night shoot...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nonsense! You look great --

dialog: speaks more sincerely)
dialog: Look, uh, why don't you lie down and
dialog: take a little nap? We'll film around
dialog: you for a while.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Thanks, buddy...
text: Ed smiles warmly, then walks off.
text: Bela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through
text: his pockets. Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a
text: rubber tube. Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then
text: ties the tube around his upper arm...
scene_heading: AT THE SET - LATER
text: Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny
text: fills it with a hose. There is now a foot of water.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey. This is looking good!
dialog: (he turns to Paul)
dialog: Paul, where's the octopus motor?
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: What octopus motor?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know, to make the legs move --
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Hey, don't blame me! You didn't say
dialog: anything about no motor when I was

text: Bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Let's shoot this fucker! Where do
dialog: I go?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You'll be fighting with the octopus.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Out there?!
dialog: (he points at the water)
dialog: What happened to the stream?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This'll look a lot better. We have

speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake.

text: A crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels.
text: Bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig. He
text: licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela, somebody misplaced the motor.
dialog: So when you wrestle the octopus,
dialog: shake the legs a bit, to make it look
dialog: like it's killing you.
text: Bela stares, deadpan.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Do you know I turned down
dialog: "Frankenstein"?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: After I did "Dracula," the studio
dialog: offered me "Frankenstein"! But I
dialog: turned it down, the part wasn't sexy
dialog: enough. It was too degrading for a
dialog: big star like me.
text: The crew glances at Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to
dialog: shoot tonight.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Don't let me slow you down.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Alright! Let's put it on film.
dialog: CAMERA! SOUND!
text: Bela takes another swig of J.D., then throws it off-camera.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ACTION!
text: Bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and SCREAMING in
dialog: horror. This image is truly ridiculous.
text: Ed is pleased.
text: Some crew members nod: Pretty good.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And CUT!
text: Everybody cheers.
text: Then suddenly the dam walls BURST.
text: WHOOSH! The water rushes from the lake and floods the park
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DINKY SOUNDSTAGES - EARLY MORNING
text: Crew members straggle in for the final shoot. Everybody looks

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: C'mon! Just one more day! Just have
dialog: some coffee, you'll feel better!
text: Tony staggers up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Mr. Wood, I only got one hour of
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah? Well I got no sleep, and I
dialog: feel great!
text: Ed sees Bela slowly shuffling along. Ed runs over to him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bela. I just wanna thank you again
dialog: for last night.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: That's fine, Eddie. All in the line
dialog: of duty.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. Seriously. I want you to know
dialog: how much I appreciate what you've
dialog: done for me. A great man like you
dialog: shouldn't have to run around in
dialog: freezing water at four in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Well, there aren't too many other
dialog: fellas I'd do it for...
speaker_heading: ED
text: (he smiles, then pulls out a
dialog: script page)
dialog: I wrote something special for you.
dialog: I got to thinking about all the
dialog: sacrifices you've made... and so I
dialog: wrote you a new final speech.
text: Ed hands him the paper. Bela starts reading it, as Ed watches
text: anxiously. Bela is very touched.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (still reading)
dialog: Eddie, this is quite a scene.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know it's a lot to give you at the
dialog: last second.
text: Bela looks up.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: These lines -- I'll have no problem
dialog: remembering.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
text: They are shooting. Ed watches off-camera, as Bela acts a
text: somber scene with an actor playing PROFESSOR STROWSKI, a
dialog: threatening European.
speaker_heading: STROWSKI
dialog: "Our government wants you to
dialog: return... to continue your
dialog: experiments there. Where you can
dialog: have everything at your disposal."
speaker_heading: BELA (as VORNOFF)
dialog: "My dear Professor Strowski, twenty
dialog: years ago I was banned from my home
dialog: land. I was classed as a madman --
dialog: a charlatan -- outlawed in the world
dialog: of science which previously honored
dialog: me as a genius!"
dialog: (he gets very subdued)
dialog: "Now here in this forsaken jungle
dialog: hell, I have proven that I am
dialog: alright."
speaker_heading: STROWSKI
dialog: "Yes, the authorities have learned
dialog: how correct your findings were. So
dialog: I am here -- sent to bring you home."
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (impassioned)
dialog: "Home. I have no home. Hunted...
dialog: despised... living like an animal
dialog: -- the jungle is my home! But I
dialog: will show the world that I can be
dialog: its master. I shall perfect my own
dialog: race of people -- a race of atomic
dialog: supermen that will conquer the
dialog: world!"
text: It's an incredible performance of crowning tragedy. Bela is
text: totally drained.
speaker_heading: CU - ED

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Cut. It's a wrap.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT
text: The wrap party is being thrown in the meat packing plant.
text: People laugh and shout and carry on. Tor pours booze in the
text: punch. R&amp;B MUSIC plays. Old Man McCoy dances with Loretta.
text: Bunny dances with a young stud. Dolores stands by herself.
text: Bela and Criswell are giggling.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: So you sleep in coffins?!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Yes. There is nothing more
dialog: comfortable.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: I can't believe this! I sleep in
dialog: coffins!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: YES! My father ran a mortuary --

scene_heading: EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND #1
dialog: "McCoy Meat Packing"? Are you sure
dialog: there's a party here?
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: (holding an INVITATION)
dialog: Yeah, I got this invitation. It's

scene_heading: INT. PARTY

speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: "Glen Or Glenda," now that was a hell

speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: Well, this new one's gonna be a
dialog: hundred times better.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: Is that possible?
text: Dolores overhears this. She stares in disbelief.
text: AT THE TURNTABLE
text: Someone changes the record. Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins.
text: A door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag.
text: Everybody turns. They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING.
text: Ed grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Go, baby, go!
text: Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits.
text: People LAUGH hysterically.
text: Dolores is appalled.
text: Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around. He sees
text: Vampira and waves.
text: Vampira's jaw drops in recognition.
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: I don't believe it. It's him!
text: Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him. The
text: music is building to a climax. Ed hurries off to center stage
text: -- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips,
text: then suddenly yanks out his teeth!
text: This brings down the house. Everyone STAMPS their feet and
text: CLAPS crazily.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - DOLORES
text: Everyone, except Dolores. Suddenly, she explodes.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: You people are INSANE! Take a look
dialog: around -- you're all FREAKS!
text: The room quiets. Dolores has snapped.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: You're wasting your lives making
dialog: SHIT! Nobody cares! These movies
dialog: are TERRIBLE!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can't take it any longer!
text: The group is shocked. Nobody speaks.
text: Dolores runs out of the party.
text: Ed just stands, dumbstruck. Then he chases after her, in his
text: high heels and dress.
scene_heading: EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME
text: Dolores runs across the parking lot, in tears. Ed catches up
dialog: with her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dolores, wait!
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Did you really mean those things you
dialog: said..?
text: Dolores stops.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: I'm tired of living on the fringe.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But you used to say --
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Ed... I just stuck it out so you
dialog: could finish your movie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now that it's done, so am I.
text: She turns and walks away. Ed is crushed. He stands

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ED'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ed's new home is a single apartment, still filled with moving

text: The phone RINGS. Ed awakens and woozily answers it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: TOR (on phone)

speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Edvard, you come!
text: Tor gives Ed a back-breaking hug.
scene_heading: INT. TOR'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

text: Swedish knick-knacks. Tor gestures proudly.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: I'm so happy you visit. Meet my
dialog: family! Greta, Karl, and Connie!
text: THREE COLOSSAL PEOPLE lumber out. Tor has the largest family
dialog: we've ever seen. Not fat -- but big-boned. GRETA is Tor's
text: gigantic Swedish wife, and KARL and CONNIE are their two
text: elephantine children. They ADLIB greetings: "Hallo!"
dialog: "Welcome!" "Is a pleasure!"
text: Ed cannot believe what he's seeing.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Everyone noisily eats dinner. The table looks like a
text: Smorgasbord. Entire hams, turkeys, a full case of beer,
text: incredible quantities are being shoveled in. Tor empties a
text: beer in one gulp, then opens another.
speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Pass the meatballs.
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: This strudel is delicious, Mama.
text: Ed is stupefied. He picks at a little dainty serving.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Hey! You're not eatink.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh, I don't have much of an appetite
dialog: lately.
speaker_heading: TOR

speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Don't worry. You just haven't met
dialog: right woman yet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oopsy. That cabbage goes right
dialog: through me.
text: Tor stands and hurries from the room. Ed awkwardly makes
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Greta, your husband is a terrific
dialog: actor. You should come down and
dialog: visit the set.
speaker_heading: GRETA
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, it's really no problem at all!
speaker_heading: GRETA
dialog: (steely)
dialog: I do not approve of what you do with
dialog: my husband Tor. He is not a monster.
dialog: These horror pictures are
text: humiliating.
text: Ed has no response. Suddenly -- CRASH! There's a loud o.s.
text: SLAM, falling porcelain, then Tor SHOUTS FURIOUSLY in Swedish.
speaker_heading: TOR (O.S.)
text: OUCH! GODDAMMIT!
text: Earl and Connie begin giggling. Ed is totally baffled.
text: Tor runs out, angrily holding a BROKEN TOILET SEAT. It is
dialog: split in two.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Look, it happened again!

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Tor, I should be getting home.
speaker_heading: TOR

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: LATER

dialog: woman I ever see? No! Many duds,
dialog: before I find her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But I thought me and Dolores had
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: Forget her! Move on. A good lookink
dialog: boy like you as you can have any girl
dialog: you wish.
text: Tor finishes his glug, and then his eyes roll back into his

speaker_heading: ED'S VOICE
dialog: Well, I was wondering if maybe

speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: You mean like a date? I thought you

speaker_heading: ED'S VOICE
dialog: ME?! No, uh, I'm just a

speaker_heading: VAMPIRA

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Why... yes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't you think angora has a tactile
dialog: sensuality lacking in all other
dialog: clothing?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: I suppose. It's very expensive.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's made from specially-bred rabbits
dialog: that live in the Himalayas.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: What are you, an angora wholesaler?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, I work in pictures. I'm a
dialog: director-actor-writer-producer.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Two people do. Orson Welles and me.
speaker_heading: NORMA

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: NURSE

dialog: You look like that Dracula guy.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (very somber)
dialog: My name is Bela Lugosi. I wish to

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: For what reason?
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: I have been a drug addict for twenty
dialog: years. I need help...
text: The nurse nods. She takes Bela's arm and leads him away. Bela
text: glances at Ed, then steps through a wide door. As it swings
text: shut, we see a DOCTOR walk over and shake Bela's hand.
text: Ed stares at the door, dazed by all that's happened. He sits
text: down in a chair, exhausted.
text: Ed's eyes slowly close, and he falls asleep...

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING
text: Ed is still asleep, but now sunlight beats in.
text: Ed stirs and wakes up. He groggily looks around, and sitting

text: 26, solid, reflective, with a dry sense of humor. Ed peers at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Hello.

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: This is my thirteenth pair.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Excuse me.

dialog: Doctor? I'm with Mr. Lugosi. How

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well... there's a lot of junk in his

dialog: Apparently, he was addicted to

text: Ed angrily pushes through.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Everybody out! This is a hospital!
dialog: Get out of here.
text: Ed forces them out, then SLAMS the door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What happened?!
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: (in a hoarse whisper)
dialog: Isn't it wonderful? After all these

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Bela, they're parasites! They just
dialog: want to exploit you.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Fine. Let them! There is no such

speaker_heading: OLD MANAGER

speaker_heading: ED

text: Bela nods. He mulls this over.
speaker_heading: BELA
dialog: Okay. But what if I'm not in too big

speaker_heading: ED

dialog: That's great. Let's do a take.
speaker_heading: WIDE

text: A man in a plain brown suit steps out. This is J. EDWARD
text: REYNOLDS, 50, Ed's santironious southern Christian landlord.
text: Reynolds assertively bangs on Ed's front door.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Mr. Wood?!
speaker_heading: ED (O.S.)
dialog: Hruphh...?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your
dialog: landlord. Could you please open up?
text: The door opens a crack. Bleary Ed peers out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third
dialog: and final rent check.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he sloppily lies)
dialog: I'm real sorry. My stockbroker must
dialog: have transferred the wrong account...
dialog: C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME
text: Ed motions Reynolds in. Reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado
text: inside. Then he notices a framed one-sheet for "BRIDE OF THE
text: MONSTER." Reynolds admires it.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Hmm, so you're in the picture
dialog: business?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (rummaging for a check)
dialog: You could say that --
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: I'm interested in the picture
dialog: business. My associates and I wish
dialog: to produce a series of uplifting
dialog: religious films, on the Apostles.
dialog: But unfortunately, we don't have
dialog: enough money.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Raising money is tough.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Oh! Our church has the money for one
dialog: film. We just don't have it for all
dialog: twelve...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ED
text: His eyes suddenly pop.
text: The color comes back to his fact. A plan is quickly boiling
text: over inside Ed's head. He starts feverishly pacing around.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay -- you know what you do? You
dialog: produce a film in a commercially
dialog: proven genre. And after it's a hit,
dialog: you take the profits from that, and
dialog: make the twelve Apostles' movies.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Would that work?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Absolutely! You see this script..?
text: Ed randomly grabs a script off the messy floor, then glances
text: down, to see which one he picked up. It says "Graverobbers
dialog: From Outer Space."
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: "Graverobbers From Outer Space"!
dialog: It's money in the bank.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Graverobbers from what??
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: From outer space! It's science-
dialog: fiction. Very big with the kids!
dialog: If you make this picture, you'll have
dialog: enough money to finance a HUNDRED
dialog: religious films!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And pay my back rent from the
dialog: profits.
text: Reynolds scratches his head.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: I don't know... this is all a lot to
dialog: absorb.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Um, I understand that this science
dialog: friction is popular -- but don't the
dialog: big hits always have big stars?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (in a frenzy)
dialog: Yeah, well we've GOT a big star!
dialog: Bela Lugosi!!
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: Lugosi??! Didn't be pass on?
text: Ed grins maniacally. He grabs a SMALL REEL of 35mm film.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yes, but I've got the last footage
dialog: he ever shot!
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Just, it doesn't look like very much.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's plenty! It's the acorn that
dialog: will grow a great oak. I'll just
text: find a double to finish his scenes,
dialog: and we'll release it as "Bela
dialog: Lugosi's Final Film"
text: A beat. Reynolds stares, intrigued...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ED'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: The place is cleaned-up. Ed shouts excitedly into the phone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bunny! We're making another film!
dialog: Yeah -- I got the Baptist Church of
dialog: Beverly Hills to put up the cash!
text: Paul sticks his head in.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Great! Bring 'em in! Bunny, I gotta
dialog: run.
text: Ed hangs up.
text: Paul leads in THREE. They look nothing like Bela. One is
text: a HOMELESS BUM, one is a SHORT FAT MAN, and one is CHINESE.
text: Ed inspects them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Too tall... too short...
text: (he glances at the Chinese guy)
dialog: And this guy doesn't work at all.
speaker_heading: PAUL MARCO
dialog: Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela
dialog: played "Fu Manchu."
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That was Karloff.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Paul, you gotta try harder. I don't
dialog: want this film to be haif-assed.
dialog: This time, we go for the quality.
text: Paul turns to go.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And by the way, keep Sunday free.

scene_heading: INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Kathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater. Ed
text: is typing deliriously fast -- in one of his artistic fevers.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know, when you rewrite a script,
dialog: it just gets better and better!
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Do you want your buttons on the left
dialog: or the right?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The left. It's more natural.
text: (he squints at his script)
dialog: Hey, I've got a scene where the
dialog: aliens have the ultimate bomb. What
dialog: would that be made of?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Uh, atomic energy?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. They're beyond that! They're
dialog: smarter than the humans. What's more
dialog: advanced?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Dynamite --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, BIGGER! What's the biggest
dialog: energy??
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: The sun.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: Yes! BINGO! Solar energy! Oh
dialog: that's gonna seem so scientific.
dialog: (he resumes TYPING)
dialog: This movie's gonna be the ultimate
dialog: Ed Wood film. No compromises.
text: Kathy suddenly jumps up, shocked.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh my God. Look at this!
text: She runs over and shows Ed the newspaper.
scene_heading: INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER
text: A small headline says "VAMPIRA REVEALED TO BE RED." Underneath
dialog: is the story: "Channel 7 has fired popular horror hostess

scene_heading: ON ED AND KATHY
text: They're astonished.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Those assholes.
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: The poor girl's out of a job.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah...

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: Ed and Kathy sit with a shaken-up Vampira.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm really sorry...
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: It's terrible. People won't even
dialog: return my calls. It's like I don't
dialog: exist.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know what that's like.
text: (he pulls out his SCRIPT)
dialog: Anyway, I brought a copy of the
dialog: script. You would play the "Ghoul's
dialog: Wife."
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: (she grimaces)
dialog: The Ghoul's Wife?! God, I can't
dialog: believe I'm doing this...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You should feel lucky. Ed's the only
dialog: guy in town who doesn't pass judgment
dialog: on people.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any
dialog: friends.
text: Vampira smiles uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: Look... would it be possible to make
dialog: the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less
dialog: prominent, so people won't really
dialog: notice me in the movie?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You don't wanna be noticed?
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: Exactly. Hey, how 'bout this -- what
dialog: if I don't have any lines? I'll do
dialog: the part mute!
text: Kathy suddenly sees someone.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Look, it's Dr. Tom.
speaker_heading: (she SHOUTS)
dialog: Hey, Dr. Tom!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Who's Dr. Tom?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: My chiropractor!
text: DR. TOM MASON, a tall, slender 35-year-old chiropractor,
text: strides over. He smiles.
speaker_heading: DR. MASON
dialog: Kathy, how are you?! You're looking
dialog: in alignment today.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Actually, my neck's a little funny.
text: Dr. Mason grabs Kathy's neck and CRACKS it loudly.
speaker_heading: ON ED
text: Ed stares at the Doctor in astonishment. Ed is riveted.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wait a second. Don't move!
text: Ed excitedly jumps up, takes his NAPXIN, and covers the
text: Doctor's face from the nose down.
speaker_heading: ED
text: It's uncanny.
speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: What's uncanny?
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: DR. MASON

dialog: "I want to suck your blood!"

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: REVEREND LEMON
dialog: Brothers and Sisters, we've reached

scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

text: Criswell whispers to Vampira.
speaker_heading: CRISWELL
dialog: Why couldn't we do this in the

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Oh my God, I dropped him --

speaker_heading: CRISWELL

speaker_heading: VAMPIRA
dialog: This can't be the right address...

text: unmarked grimy door, gulps, then slowly opens it...
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
text: And inside is the "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" famous
text: CEMETERY SET! The film is in production! Packed into a

text: Tot struts about gregariously, in his "Inspector Clay" suit.
text: He chats up the CREW.
speaker_heading: TOR
dialog: I am so happy! Finally I am star wit
dialog: dialogue! I memorized every wordt.
dialog: Eddie will be so proud!
text: The Baptists chase Ed around. They wave the script.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood,
dialog: we have a few questions --
speaker_heading: REVEREND LEMON
dialog: The script refers on numerous
dialog: occasions to graverobbing. Now we
dialog: find the concept of digging up
dialog: consecrated ground highly offensive.
dialog: It's blasphemy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (very annoyed)
dialog: What are you talking about?! It's
dialog: the premise of the movie. It's even
dialog: the title, for Christ's sake!
speaker_heading: REVEREND LEMON
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Mr. Wood!
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Yes, about that title, it strikes us
dialog: as very inflammatory. Why don't we
dialog: change it to "Plan Nine From

text: Ed shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's ridiculous!
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
speaker_heading: CEMETERY SET

scene_heading: CUE DR. TOM!
speaker_heading: DR. TOM (o.s.)
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: ED
text: YES, NOW! LURK HIM. AND BE SURE TO
dialog: KEEP YOUR FACE COVERED!
text: The door of a large paper-mache crypt creeps open. Dr. Tom
text: uncertainly steps out, impersonating Bela. He holds the cape

text: Ed is pleased as punch. He whispers to the Baptists.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives!
speaker_heading: REVEREND LEMON
dialog: Doesn't this strike you as a bit
dialog: morbid?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, he would've loved it! Bela's

speaker_heading: CUE VAMPIRA!

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I like to think so.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
text: That cardboard headstone tipped over.
dialog: This graveyard is obviously phony!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: People won't notice. Filmmaking

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Oh, you wanna talk about the "big
dialog: picture"?! How 'bout that the

speaker_heading: ED

scene_heading: STRAPPING YOUNG MAN
dialog: Reverend, I'm here.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: REVEREND LEMON
dialog: This is our choir director. He's

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: ED

text: Ed is taken aback. He slowly removes it from the hanger and

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mmm. I need to calm... Take deep
dialog: breaths...
dialog: (he rubs the angora)
dialog: Ohh, it's so smooth...
scene_heading: INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SAME TIME
text: The dressing room door flies open. Ed slowly struts out, in

text: The stage quiets. People are staring.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, everyone! Let's set up for
dialog: Scene 112! Move the crypt stage left

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUSSO &amp; FRANKS - DAY

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Imperial whiskey, straight up.

text: Sitting at a table is ORSON WELLES! The portly, world-famous
text: filmmaker sits alone, eating lunch with one hand and drawing
text: STORYBOARDS with the other.
text: Ed is thunderstruck.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh my God. It's Orson Welles...
text: Ed nervously stands. He starts to step forward -- when he
text: catches his own reflection in a mirror. He's still in drag.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Ed rolls his eyes. He runs his hand through his hair, then
text: slowly approaches Orson Welles. Ed is terrified.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Excuse me, Sir...?
speaker_heading: ORSON WELLES

dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood!
dialog: (he smiles anxiously)
dialog: So, what are you working on now?
speaker_heading: ORSON WELLES
dialog: Eh, the financing just fell through
text: for the third time on "Don Quixote."
dialog: So I'm trying to finish a promo for
dialog: something else. But I can't find the
dialog: soundtrack --
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: I think I left it in Malta.
text: Ed is astonished.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I can't believe it. These sound like
dialog: my problems!
speaker_heading: ORSON WELLES
dialog: It's the damn money men. You never
dialog: know who's a windbag, and who's got
dialog: the goods. And then they all think
dialog: they're a director...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ain't that the truth! I've even bad
dialog: producers recut my movies --
speaker_heading: ORSON WELLES
dialog: Ugh, I hate when that happens.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (on a roll)
dialog: And they always want to cast their
dialog: buddies -- it doesn't even matter if
dialog: they're right for the part!
speaker_heading: ORSON WELLES
dialog: Tell me about it. I'm supposed to
dialog: do a thriller at Universal, and they
dialog: want Charlton Heston to play a
dialog: Mexican!
text: Ed shakes his head. He's discouraged.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
speaker_heading: ORSON WELLES
dialog: It is when it works.
dialog: (solemn)
dialog: You know the one film of mine I can
dialog: stand to watch? "Kane." The studio
dialog: hated it... but they didn't get to
