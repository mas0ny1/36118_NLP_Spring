dialog: «.. SO Madelyn turned up.

dialog: Madelyn turned up?
speaker_heading: HARDY (V.O.)
dialog: Completely out of the blue. Haven’t
dialog: seen her in fifteen years...
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM/ROACH LOT/STUDIO - DAY 1
text: Oliver HARDY leans against the door to a dressing room,
text: worried expression, talking to his friend Stan LAUREL. Both
text: are in their late-40s, (at the peak of their movie careers),
dialog: but to begin with we have no real clue as to who they are,
text: where they are or what they do. They are just two guys in
text: cheap suits talking to each other. HARDY lights up a
text: cigarette as he talks.
speaker_heading: HARDY
text: There she was, all gussied up on
dialog: the front door step. And that’s
dialog: something I never thought I’d see
dialog: again.
text: LAUREL picks up a boot (the right one) with a large hole in
text: the sole. Using a knife he levers off the heel.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What’d she want?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Twenty thousand bucks.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Twenty thousand?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Fifteen years of back alimony. I
dialog: said ‘what alimony? When we broke
dialog: up I gave you whatever money I had
dialog: and you took the car.’ We both
dialog: agreed that was that.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Jeez even Mae wasn’t after that
dialog: much - and she wanted me to pay for
dialog: a chauffeur. It’s because our faces
text: are plastered all over town.
dialog: Probably some lawyer’s bright idea.
text: LAUREL levers off the other heel.

text: As he pulls the boots on LAUREL considers this but doesn’t
text: reply. HARDY picks up his Bowler hat, then LAUREL picks up
text: his and they leave the dressing room (without putting them
text: on). In a CONTINUOUS SHOT we follow them out to...
text: A studio corridor.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Goldenrod Revisions 20.04.17
text: As they continue on their journey LAUREL finishes fastening a
text: frayed cuff with a paper clip for a cuff-link.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You been down to Tijuana?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: We had a few days off.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I did have a little run down there
dialog: with Mysterious Montague yes,
dialog: trying to win some back. Not...
dialog: entirely successfully. Which
dialog: reminds me. Would you do me favour,
dialog: don’t talk money with Hal today.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Charlie, Buster, Harold - they get
dialog: ten times what he pays us.
text: They pass through a door and emerge into the bright
text: California sunshine, now making their way along an alleyway
text: between buildings on the Roach lot.

dialog: Culver City California, 1937
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well they own their own pictures.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Exactly. And that’s what we’re
dialog: gonna do.
text: As they pass a couple of SCENE HANDS moving parts of
text: set along on a trolley - starting to give us a sense
dialog: business they are in.

dialog: Hey boys how’s it goin’!
dialog: a Roman
dialog: of the
text: The first SCENE HAND moves his hair up into a mad quiff -

text: Hardy. LAUREL and HARDY smile and wave back politely.

text: turn a corner we see, in the background, the ranch-fronted
text: main building to Hal Roach’s Culver City studios, pure old
dialog: Hollywood.
text: Still, the conversation continues:
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: How we gonna do that? We’re under
dialog: contract, we can’t just change the
dialog: terms.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: We stick together, renegotiate with
dialog: Hal and get a slice of the pie. Or
text: we walk and we set up on our own.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Oh I don’t know Stan. I’d love to
dialog: own our pictures but it’s just not

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Oh that reminds me. I proposed to

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Script-y Lucille?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Damn! That’s great news Babe.

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I’m never marrying again. I’m just
dialog: gonna find a woman I don’t like and
dialog: buy her a house.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: That’s a good one. But listen, it’s
dialog: not a good time for me to fool
dialog: around with my income. Please don’t
dialog: antagonize Hal, I don’t like to
dialog: talk business. Not when we’re
dialog: working.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Alright, I promise I'll be nice as

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Hey I’m chartering a sail boat on

text: supervisor, sitting by the camera, clipboard on her knees.
text: Director James HORNE, 50s, calls over to her:
speaker_heading: HORNE
dialog: Lucille you got my sides over
dialog: there?
text: She holds up the director’s well-thumbed script and he
text: wanders over to her. HARDY catches her eye and gives her a
text: secret smile, then kisses the tips of his fingers and blows
text: them to her. She smiles back, shyly. HARDY turns to LAUREL:
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Hey Stan. Why don’t we hold off on
dialog: leaving right now and just push him
dialog: for a raise?
dialog: kk
dialog: kk
text: Actor James FINLAYSON, 50, bald head, big whiskery moustache,
text: walks past them on his way out of the studio having overheard
text: the end of their conversation. HARDY greets him:
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Hey Jimmie.
speaker_heading: FINLAYSON
dialog: Give you a raise? He’d rather lower
dialog: Hollywood. And that’s a Scotsman
dialog: talking.
text: With familiar grumpy face and big eye, he bustles off.
speaker_heading: FINLAYSON (cont'd)
dialog: Ah’m goin’ for a smoke.
text: LAUREL sees studio boss Hal ROACH, 40s, a bullish native of
text: New Jersey, heading straight for them with a red, angry face.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: (To LAUREL)
dialog: That’s it Stan, we’re through.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Good morning Hal.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: I’m pullin’ a morals clause on ya.
text: A couple of MAKE-UP GIRLS - trying desperately to concentrate
text: on their job - start to touch up LAUREL and HARDY. One pulls
text: HARDY’S hair, which was parted at the side, down into a
text: fringe. The other applies pancake-white make up to LAUREL. In
text: CLOSE UP we see some bruising and discoloration around
text: LAUREL'S upper lip, which is swiftly covered up.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Goldenrod Revisions 20.04.17
speaker_heading: ROACH (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (To HARDY)
dialog: Another fight at his place last
text: night, one of the neighbours sees
text: Ruthie sock him in the mouth so
text: they call the cops.
text: LAUREL turns to HARDY, embarrassed:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: She found out bout Vera.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Cost me five hundred bucks to keep
dialog: it out the papers - and that’s
dialog: comin’ out of your paycheck. You
dialog: signed a contract: ‘Second party
dialog: agrees not to shock, insult or
dialog: offend the community, or prejudice
dialog: Hal Roach studios’.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: That's the last thing I'd want to
dialog: do, not when you have so much
dialog: prejudice already. How’s your old
dialog: buddy Mussolini, the one you were
dialog: gonna go into business with before
dialog: he started bombing all those poor
dialog: people in Africa?
dialog: kk
text: See ROACH, fuming. Laurel’s MAKE-UP GIRL now arranges his (un-
text: styled) hair into a spiky quiff; Hardy’s starts to apply the
text: pancake white make-up to him.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: All he wants to do is fight. How
dialog: many times you been married Stan?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: My personal life is my own business
dialog: - that’s one thing you don’t hold
dialog: the rights to.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Why can’t we all be friends here?

text: of them, and that huge back projection screen behind.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Needled)
dialog: I'm looking for a fair price for a
dialog: Laurel and Hardy picture and you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Money. His favourite subject.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh right, you don’t like money Hal.

dialog: got rich off our backs!

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Stan please-
speaker_heading: LAUREL
text: A cheapskate, a skinflint, and a...
dialog: a... parvenu!
text: He nods, satisfied that he’s landed a blow. But ROACH - and
text: HARDY - clearly don’t know what a ‘parvenu’ is.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: A parvenu?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
speaker_heading: (To HARDY)
dialog: My contract's up and he thinks
dialog: because you've still got another
dialog: ten months on yours I can’t go
dialog: anywhere and I’1ll have to take what
text: he’s offering.
speaker_heading: ROACH **
dialog: (suspicious) **
dialog: Wait. What’s a Parvenu? **
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Goldenrod Revisions 20.04.17 6A
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It’s someone who’s come from
dialog: nowhere and made a load of money
dialog: but has no class. Look it up in the
dialog: dictionary Hal, there’s a picture
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: You’re such a smart ass. Well guess
dialog: what, I’m smarter.
speaker_heading: LAUREL

dialog: Hal, it might be better if you

speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: What happens to Babe when you go

dialog: under contract to me. And I ain’t

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You can’t have Hardy without
dialog: Laurel.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: We'll see about that.
text: Director HORNE is ready to shoot. He tries to interject:
speaker_heading: HORNE
dialog: Hal could you maybe continue this
dialog: some other time? Unless you wanna
dialog: pay for an extra day?
text: ROACH is aware all eyes are on him.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Go ahead - shoot!
dialog: (HORNE looks at him)
dialog: Go ahead!
speaker_heading: HORNE
dialog: (Turning to LAUREL)
dialog: Okay, we’re on a wide two-shot here
dialog: Stan, like you wanted, and then-
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: What are you checking with him for -
dialog: you're the director!
text: The CREW, COWBOY EXTRAS and a four piece harmony group the
text: ‘AVALON BOYS’, dressed in cowboy outfits and arranged in

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Clark Gable I think.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No... women.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Carole Lombard. I think she’s

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Ok. I’m gonna come.
speaker_heading: HORNE
dialog: Okay show’s over. Let’s roll
dialog: camera.
text: This has no impact, everybody just looks at him, dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: HORNE (cont'd)
dialog: I said roll camera!
text: As the crew now prepares for a shot, HARDY looks at LAUREL:
dialog: They have to be funny now?
speaker_heading: HORNE (cont'd)
dialog: Ready boys?
text: A beat, then the boys exchange a nod and pull on their
text: Bowlers. They are ready. HORNE sees this and knows they are

text: They start to nod their heads and tap their toes, letting the

text: ‘AVALON BOYS’ repeat the first verse, adding deep harmonies
text: and yodels, and LAUREL and HARDY now start to perform an
text: apparently impromptu dance routine in time with the song.
text: Building slowly, it is all light steps, twirls and
text: synchronized movement. The watching CREW get caught up in it;
text: LUCILLE seems entranced. Even FINLAYSON has come back to
text: watch, leaning against a wall, moustache twinkling. LAUREL
text: and HARDY come together and hold each other like ballroom
text: dancers, clasping each other close and marching up and down

scene_heading: INT. PICTURE HOUSE, NEW YORK - NIGHT 2
dialog: 
text: A huge New York audience is packed into a magnificent Art-

text: rows of faces full of laughter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: We follow the dance on screen, (full screen), the
text: extraordinary grace and daintiness of HARDY and the slapstick
text: of LAUREL. But above all they seem to project such a deep
text: dependency and affection for each other, as if nobody else in
text: their world exists. They come together again, LAUREL holds
text: HARDY’S hand and he twirls, then they swap and LAUREL twirls.
text: They skip jauntily up... down... and then back up the steps
text: to the saloon and, with one final kick, enter through
text: swinging doors. The audience in the theatre breaks into
text: thunderous, applause. We feel as if we have witnessed magic.

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - DAY 3
text: CLOSE UP: LAUREL and HARDY sitting together on a train,
text: swaying gently with the motion of the carriage as they speed
text: through the English countryside. Sixteen years have passed
dialog: since we last saw them, and it’s a shock to suddenly see them
text: so old and tired, neither seemingly in the best of health.
text: LAUREL is much more skinny, whilst HARDY is heavier than ever
text: - now nearly three hundred pounds.
dialog: Caption
dialog: England, 1953
text: HARDY’S mind is pleasantly blank. LAUREL, ever-industrious,
text: reads a script, marking it with his pen. Finally, LAUREL
dialog: turns to HARDY:
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 11
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: How about if I punch you right on
dialog: the nose? I haven’t done that ina
dialog: long time.
text: HARDY thinks about this for a few moments.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Can I poke you in the eye?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Nodding)
dialog: Or maybe you could punch me in the
dialog: throat?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (After due consideration)
dialog: I think I’d prefer the eye.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Offering this up)
dialog: I can do the tongue if you punch me
dialog: in the throat?
text: LAUREL mimes a chop to his throat, sticking his tongue out at
text: the moment of impact (as if caused by it). HARDY laughs -
dialog: LAUREL can always make him laugh.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 4
text: As the shadows lengthen their steam train thunders north
text: through a barren, wintry English countryside. From inside:
speaker_heading: HARDY (V.O.)
dialog: You know, I’m not so sure of my
dialog: balance any more Stan.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - DUSK 5
text: LAUREL is looking at the countryside go by.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: That’s okay, we can just finish
text: with a song instead of the dance.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I’m not talking about the stage
dialog: show - I mean the scene in this
dialog: movie, where I cross the river.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: But it’s historical - Robin Hood
dialog: has this fight in the middle of a

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well, all I can do is give it my

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: They put me on these blue tablets.

dialog: any good-
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: -so he put you on the blue ones.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Overlaps)
dialog: -blue ones.
text: They both nod in agreement.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I'll talk to this producer, Miffin -
dialog: I’m sure he can cut round you when
dialog: we shoot it.
text: HARDY now looks out of the window for a few moments, taking

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Maybe I’1l1 punch you in the throat.
scene_heading: EXT. GUEST HOUSE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 6
dialog: 
text: To establish a small, shabby guest house in the shadow of the

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: It sure takes it out of you, that

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It’s swell of you to come up here
dialog: to meet us Mr. Delfont.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Bernie, please. This is a
dialog: partnership gentlemen, I want to do
dialog: everything I possibly can to make
dialog: sure this tour starts off on the
dialog: right foot.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Yes we wanted to talk to you about
dialog: that over dinner - we’re just a
dialog: little concerned that some of the
dialog: show dates might clash-
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Ah so sorry-
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: -with the Robin Hood picture we're
dialog: gonna be doing?
text: The Rolls Royce is now alongside DELFONT, he opens the door
text: and gets in.
speaker_heading: DELFONT (cont'd)
dialog: -such wretched bad luck but I’ve
dialog: promised to drop in on one of my
dialog: other acts tonight - Norman Wisdom?
dialog: A blazing new talent - huge fan of

speaker_heading: DELFONT (cont'd)
dialog: And we must nurture the next
dialog: generation gentlemen, I know you
dialog: both feel as passionately about
dialog: that as I do. We’ll talk anon!
text: DELFONT waves as he is whisked away in his Rolls Royce.
text: LAUREL and HARDY look on, nonplussed. LAUREL pulls a beret
text: from his pocket and puts it on. HARDY looks at him, puzzled.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 14
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Where d’you get that?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
text: From a shop.
dialog: It’s handy ‘cos you
dialog: can fold it away in your pocket.
text: He demonstrates taking it off, folding it up and putting it
text: in his pocket, then pulling it out and putting it on again -
text: spreading his hands in a ‘what d’you think of that’ gesture.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Somehow irritated by
dialog: this)
dialog: We're here to make a movie -
dialog: Delfont knows that doesn’t he Stan?
dialog: The tour is just something we do
dialog: while-
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: -we're waiting to get started.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Overlapping)
text: -waiting to get started.
dialog: (Continue
dialog: Don’t worry.
dialog: Ss)
dialog: Our lawyer spelled it
dialog: out and it was all agreed up-front,
dialog: one hundred and ten per cent.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Thinks about it)
dialog: The extra ten is strangely
dialog: comforting.
text: During this the TAXI DRIVER has pulled all their luggage from
text: the car - a very large trunk (Hardy’s), another case
text: (Laurel’s), a small valise each and a set of Hardy’s golf
text: clubs - and drives off leaving them alone on the pavement
text: with their luggage, nobody coming out to help them.
text: Abandoned. A look between them.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST HOUSE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 7
dialog: 
text: A female RECEPTIONIST, mid-30s, watches as the front door
text: opens, allowing in smog
scene_heading: LAUREL and HARDY, HARDY
dialog: whilst LAUREL struggles
text: the golf clubs over his

dialog: to ‘perform’, no matter how small the

text: HARDY pompously places his valise on the desk; LAUREL heaves
text: the other luggage behind him and - giving the RECEPTIONIST a
text: smile - presses the bell for attention. HARDY looks at him,
text: ‘irritated’. When LAUREL rings it again he slaps his hand.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 15
text: LAUREL slaps back HARDY’S hand, they squabble, HARDY gives
text: LAUREL a push, LAUREL gives HARDY a push back and he nearly
text: falls over the trunk which LAUREL has left behind him. He
text: kicks it away angrily. LAUREL rings the bell again and now
text: HARDY pulls the bell away. LAUREL looks at him, blankly
text: ‘confused’. HARDY sighs, gestures to the RECEPTIONIST.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Now can’t you see with your own two
dialog: eyes this nice lady standing here?
dialog: There’s no need to ring that bell,
dialog: is there.
text: LAUREL looks at him, looks at the RECEPTIONIST. He shakes his
text: head, guiltily, starting to ‘cry’. HARDY turns back to the
text: RECEPTIONIST, who is spellbound at this ‘show’ just for her.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Please excuse my friend, now can
dialog: somebody show us to our rooms? You
dialog: should be expecting us - I’m Mr.
dialog: Hardy, and this is my very dear
dialog: friend Mr. Laurel.
text: The RECEPTIONIST is about to burst.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You just wait ‘til I tell me mam
dialog: it’s you! We never get anybody
dialog: famous stayin’ here - to be honest
dialog: I thought you'd retired!
text: HARDY takes the pen from it’s holder and with an extravagant
text: flourish signs in to the register.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No no, we may be getting old but
dialog: we’re not done yet.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You know, I’m so old now I walked
dialog: into an antique shop the other day
dialog: and they bought me.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 16
text: The RECEPTIONIST laughs.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: He’s exaggerating, of course. But
dialog: we've come a long way since our
dialog: first job, selling hot dogs at
dialog: Custer’s Last Stand.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: All me family loves your films -
dialog: where are yous gonna be appearin’
dialog: then - the Theatre Royal?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No it’s...
text: He’s forgotten the name - LAUREL answers for him:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: The Queen’s Hall.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: Queen’s Hall? That can’t be right.
dialog: All the big stars play at the
dialog: Theatre Royal. That’s where you’1ll
dialog: be playing.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I’m sure you’re right.
dialog: (to Laurel)
dialog: It is the Theatre Royal?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No, It’s the Queen’s Hall.
text: A few moments of uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST (cont'd)
dialog: Well never mind, here’s your room
dialog: keys.
text: She hands LAUREL and HARDY their keys.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (Looks round expectantly)
dialog: Is there a Bell Boy please?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, GUEST HOUSE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 8
text: There are no Bell Boys. LAUREL and HARDY struggle along a
text: corridor to their rooms, HARDY - now with the golf clubs over
text: his shoulder - dragging his heavy trunk behind him. LAUREL
text: stops by his door and, as he unlocks it, turns to HARDY who
text: is in the room opposite.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 16A
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: My room in ten minutes?
text: HARDY looks at him, aghast. He still wants to work tonight?
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)

scene_heading: INT. HARDY’S BEDROOM, NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 9
dialog: 
text: HARDY struggles in with his luggage. He turns the light on
text: and surveys the room: shabby and uninviting, a tatty,
text: candlewick bedspread on the bed. He goes to haul the trunk up
text: onto his bed, but it pops open and a huge cache of tinned
text: food - ham, peaches, potatoes, corned beef, which were on top
text: of his clothes - tumbles out and rolls all over the floor.
text: HARDY sighs heavily.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Oh death where is thy sting?
scene_heading: EXT. GUEST HOUSE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 10
dialog: 
text: Yellow light spills from a curtained, upper storey window.
text: Over this we hear, SFX the clack clack of a typewriter.
scene_heading: INT. LAUREL’S ROOM, NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 11
dialog: 
text: A meagre coal fire glows in the grate as LAUREL, puffing on a
text: cigarette, taps at a battered portable typewriter by the
text: light of a table lamp. A pot of tea and a plate of dog eared
text: sandwiches has been set out on a coffee table. He pauses,
text: pulls the typed page from the typewriter and reads it back.
scene_heading: INT. JOE SCHENCK’S OFFICE - DAY [FLASHBACK] 12
dialog: 
text: A CLOSE UP of a contract, the logo of ‘Twentieth Century Fox’
text: at the top of the page.
text: It’s 1938 and we REVEAL LAUREL on a chair, an empty one next
text: to him, flicking through the contract. He is in the luxurious
text: office of executive Joe SCHENCK, late 50s. Surrounded by wood
text: panelling, leather, and portraits of stars of the day - Sonja
dialog: Henje, Betty Grable, Spencer Tracey, Tyrone Power -— LAUREL
text: feels uncomfortable, out of place. The man next to him is
text: obviously his lawyer (round glasses, 40s, curly hair slicked
text: back) and LAUREL hands him the contract. LAUREL is acutely
text: aware that he is keeping SCHENCK waiting; he catches him
text: looking at his watch and tries a smile which is not returned.
speaker_heading: SCHENCK
dialog: You sure he wants to do this Stan?
dialog: I mean, Fox would love to have you
dialog: here, but...
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: This is what we’ve both been
dialog: waiting for Joe. I can’t imagine
dialog: what’s held him up.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Why doesn’t Stanley sign, then all
dialog: we have to do is have Oliver sign
dialog: when he gets here.
dialog: 13
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 18
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Taking out his pen)
dialog: That’s a good idea, isn’t it Joe?
text: SCHENCK - who is quickly losing patience - doesn’t respond.
text: The LAWYER hands LAUREL the contract back and LAUREL hands
text: him the pen. LAUREL realises he needs the pen and takes it
text: back from the LAWYER, giving him the contract at the same
dialog: time. Is it genuine confusion, or a little bit of business?
text: LAUREL takes pen and contract back from his LAWYER and signs
text: next to his name, leaving Hardy’s blank. He looks up, tries
text: another smile with SCHENCK - again, not returned. We hear
text: HARDY’S voice under this:
speaker_heading: HARDY (V.O.)
dialog: I wish I was there with you...
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK, NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 13
dialog: 
text: Back to 1953. HARDY is using the hotel telephone to make a
dialog: transatlantic call to his wife:
speaker_heading: HARDY

text: «+. sitting out the back, watching
text: the sun go down.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (V.O.)

dialog: (Warming to it)
dialog: «+. which go down to a lake, with a

text: The RECEPTIONIST returns to the desk from a back office.
text: HARDY, a little embarrassed, gives her a polite smile.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (V.O.)
dialog: Are you getting enough to eat?
speaker_heading: HARDY
text: The staff lay out little sweetmeats
dialog: and pastries wherever we turn.
dialog: Everyone’s so happy to see us
dialog: touring again we’re being treated
dialog: like kings.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (V.O.)
dialog: Ida and I received our tickets
dialog: today so we’re just as excited as
dialog: can be.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I am too, and this...

dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 19
text: He sees the NIGHT PORTER is watching him so turns away-
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: -is for you, with all my love-
text: -kisses his finger tips and blows the kiss down the phone.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (V.O.)
dialog: I love you too Oliver, you know I
dialog: do.
dialog: (Beat, slight edge in her
dialog: voice)
dialog: So... how are things with Stanley?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Oh... you know Stan.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: How has he been towards you?
text: On HARDY, thoughtful for a moment.
scene_heading: INT. SOUND STAGE - DAY [FLASHBACK] 14
text: HARDY, serious expression, walks on set wearing a dark suit
text: but carrying an unfamiliar top hat.
speaker_heading: HAL ROACH
dialog: Babe! Where have you been? You had
dialog: me worried for a minute there...
text: He gives a (plainly uncomfortable) HARDY a bear hug.
speaker_heading: HAL ROACH (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell, you’re here now.
dialog: You’re both here.
text: He gestures and HARDY looks across to someone with his back
text: to us, also wearing a dark suit and top hat, being given a
text: last check over by a MAKE-UP LADY. From his build we assume
text: it must be Laurel. HARDY takes position next to an ELEPHANT
text: with a hot water bottle bandaged to its head. The set is a
text: wooden barn scattered with bales of hay, and he’s playing a
text: vet treating a sick circus elephant. As he sits on a stool
text: LUCILLE, carrying a clip board, stops by to reassure him:
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Mr. Hardy, everything alright?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: You know, first day of school Mrs.
dialog: Hardy. I’m glad you’re here. Do you
dialog: think it’s going to be ok?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: It’s just a movie Babe.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 20
text: She squeezes his hand then carries on to her position (as
text: script supervisor) next to the director GORDON DOUGLAS, who
text: is younger than Horne and less assured in his manner. A
text: WRANGLER hands HARDY a mallet and gives him some last minute
text: instructions - though HARDY looks totally preoccupied:
speaker_heading: WRANGLER
dialog: (Patting the elephant)
dialog: When you touch her knee with the
dialog: Mallet, she’ll lift her leg like
dialog: you’re checking her reflexes.
dialog: ROACH calls over:
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: You wanna go for one you two?
text: HARDY looks over again to ‘LAUREL’, and now, as he turns, we
text: see that he’s... not Laurel. It is in fact HARRY LANGDON, a
text: Laurel look-alike, who is playing the elephant’s owner.
text: LANGDON is of similar build to Laurel and wears the same
text: pancake white make up.
speaker_heading: LANGDON
dialog: Ready when you are Babe.
dialog: We now see that this is Roach’s attempt at a new partnership -
text: just with different hats. LANGDON comes over and stands next
text: to HARDY. He puts his hand lightly on HARDY’S shoulder (and
text: he involuntarily stiffens at the touch). As he looks around
text: HARDY becomes aware that various CREW MEMBERS, who have
text: worked on Laurel & Hardy films, are avoiding eye contact with
text: him as they go about their work.
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: This is great, you and Harry are
dialog: gonna be just great together.
text: HARDY looks at LANGDON, who spreads his hands and gives him a
text: blank smile, exactly as Laurel would. HARDY returns a polite
text: smile, but we can see he’s uncomfortable - that he can’t
text: escape the feeling he’s betraying Stan. He looks to LUCILLE,
text: who tries to encourage him with a smile.

dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 21
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Okay let’s roll camera...
text: He gets the response ‘Rolling’ from sound and camera. On

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (cont'd)
dialog: Aaand - action!
text: ROACH, over-excited, shouts out simultaneously:
speaker_heading: ROACH
dialog: Action!
scene_heading: INT. LAUREL’S ROOM, NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 15
dialog: 
text: A closed door. SFX KNOCKING from outside. LAUREL, who has
text: been frowning in concentration, looks up:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Just a minute!
text: He quickly stubs his cigarette out and wafts away the smoke,
text: hides the ashtray in the bin, then unlocks the door to HARDY,
text: who sniffs theatrically, looks at LAUREL suspiciously.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Do you realise what you've done?
text: A beat, then LAUREL - going along with it for fun - nods
text: miserably. HARDY enters and turns to LAUREL:
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Well, come on - out with them.
text: LAUREL takes a packet of Chesterfield cigarettes from his
text: inside pocket and HARDY snatches it off him. He takes one,
text: then offers the pack to LAUREL who also takes one. HARDY
text: produces a lighter and they both light up and take deep
text: puffs, HARDY putting the pack back in his pocket.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Now isn’t that better? Sharing?
text: LAUREL nods, big smile on his face.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: And here’s something else we’re not
dialog: supposed to have.
text: He produces a half bottle of Scotch from inside his jacket.
text: LAUREL rustles up a couple of cups and HARDY pours them each
dialog: a large measure.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: For medicinal purposes...
text: They clink cups together and the ‘skit’ ends.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 22
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: I’m getting a sinking feeling about
dialog: this place. Did you see her face
dialog: when we told her what theatre we
dialog: were playing?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It'll be fine, Queen’s Hall is a
dialog: good theatre.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well we gotta make sure we’re in
text: nicer hotels when the girls arrive.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I‘1l get onto it.
text: HARDY crosses to the window to peer out into the murky night
text: with a shiver.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: You heard from Muffin?
text: LAUREL starts to correct his script by hand.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Miffin.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Miffin. Is that really his name?
dialog: Has he given you our shooting dates
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I’m waitin’ on a call.
text: HARDY lets the curtain drop and sits down in one of two easy
text: chairs by the fireside - his leg causing him some pain as he
text: lowers himself. He picks up his cup of Scotch, takes a sip.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: What do you think about this for a
dialog: title: ‘Rob ‘Em Good’. You know,
dialog: playin’ off ‘Robin Hood’? There was
dialog: a picture used that in the 20s but
dialog: nobody would remember by now.
text: During this HARDY takes a sandwich from the plate on the
text: coffee table, peels back the top and looks suspiciously at
text: the filling smeared inside, wrinkling his nose as he sniffs.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What is this stuff?
text: LAUREL takes one, bites into it.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Fish paste. It’s the war rationing.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 23
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Still?
speaker_heading: (LAUREL shrugs)
dialog: Explains why they looked at me like
dialog: I was nuts when I asked for an egg
dialog: sandwich.
text: HARDY looks at LAUREL, already making corrections to the page
text: he’s just typed with his pen as he flicks through his work.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: ‘Rob ‘Em Good’. I like that Stan.
text: HARDY takes another sip of his Scotch.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I been workin’ on this scene for
dialog: the movie where we go into the
dialog: castle to rescue Maid Marian, and
dialog: we're hiding behind this curtain-
text: HARDY decides hunger has got the better of him and - after
text: liberally sprinkling salt over the filling - tries the
text: sandwich. LAUREL starts to giggle as he tells the story.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: -and the guards are lookin’ for us-—
text: He’s really making himself laugh as he tells the story - and
text: it’s infectious. HARDY starts to chuckle too - even though he
dialog: doesn’t know the punchline.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: -and, I'll show you, turn around...
text: HARDY turns round; we stay on him as we hear some rustling:
speaker_heading: LAUREL (OOV) (cont'd)
dialog: Okay...
text: HARDY turns back and sees LAUREL’S shoes poking out from
text: beneath the curtains in his room.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (OOV) (cont'd)
dialog: (From behind curtain)
dialog: Now you stab me with your sword-
text: HARDY looks about, picks up a shoe horn and, getting into
dialog: character-
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: A-ha! A-ha! So you think you can
dialog: play that game do you - well you
dialog: can’t hide from me!
text: -uses it to stab the curtain at about chest height.
dialog: 16
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 24
speaker_heading: LAUREL (OOV)
dialog: And then you pull the curtain back,
dialog: and...
text: HARDY pulls the curtain back and there is LAUREL on his
text: knees, below where the ‘sword’ went in to the curtain,
text: kneeling on his shoes like Toulouse-Lautrec, looking at
text: himself in a dressing mirror opposite. He looks so ridiculous
text: that HARDY howls with laughter - which makes LAUREL laugh
dialog: even harder.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: Isn't that silly!
text: HARDY pulls his shoes off and - with some painful grunting -
text: lowers himself to kneel on them the same as LAUREL. Now
text: they’re both doing it - getting a little hysterical with
text: laughter as they look at themselves in the mirror.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Now I’m down here - I can’t get up
dialog: again!
text: This sets them both off again. LAUREL tries to get up-
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Neither can I!
dialog: (Gasping for air)
dialog: We're stuck!
text: We go OUT on the boys, howling with laughter at themselves in
dialog: the mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE - DAY 16
text: A grey day, the rain falling. A provincial English theatre,

dialog: Well, beggars can’t be choosers can

speaker_heading: IDA (V.O.)
dialog: Why are you not play West End? I
dialog: don’t like this Delfont.
text: As the shot TRACKS we see LAUREL in a public phone box next
text: to the theatre, on a transatlantic call:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Ida, he’s put this tour together
dialog: for us, and we didn’t exactly have
dialog: too many other offers did we?
dialog: Anyway, we got the movie to look
dialog: forward to.
text: He glances at the little Queen’s Hall Theatre outside.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: Okay the theatre is a little on the
dialog: small side, but that means it’1l be
dialog: easier to sell it out.
speaker_heading: IDA (V.O.)
dialog: How is Oliver - is he pulling
dialog: weight?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: He’s doing fine.
dialog: (Quickly moves on)
dialog: Tell me all the news. How are the
dialog: ducks?
speaker_heading: IDA (V.O.)
dialog: Well, I try to get them into duck

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Hello? Ida?
speaker_heading: IDA (V.O.)

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh thank goodness, I thought I’d

scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE, QUEEN'S HALL THEATRE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 17
text: Opening night. LAUREL and HARDY are in costume, preparing to
text: go on. HARDY sits himself on a hospital bed and a stage hand
text: (BILLY BRADY, 20s) encases his leg in an oversized plaster
text: cast. LAUREL glances through a crack in the curtain and,
text: worried, sees the house is barely half full. BRADY attaches a
text: cable to HARDY’S plaster cast and starts to hoist it up like
text: it’s in traction. BRADY glances over to LAUREL and sees he is
text: going through his pre-show ritual of checking his cuffs are
text: held in place by paper clips, and that there are no heels on
text: his boots. BRADY plucks up the courage to talk to him:
speaker_heading: BRADY
dialog: You worked with my grandad Mr.
dialog: Laurel.
text: LAUREL looks up at him.
speaker_heading: BRADY (cont'd)
dialog: He told me how you never have heels
dialog: on your boots, to make you walk
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Your grandad?
speaker_heading: BRADY
dialog: Billy Brady, I was named after him.
text: LAUREL looks at him. BRADY does a wide-eyed, goofy smile and
text: a camp flutter of his hands.
speaker_heading: BRADY (cont'd)
dialog: ‘Billy Brady - He’s No Lady’?
text: Suddenly the mists part, and LAUREL realises who this man is.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh my goodness, it’s like staring
dialog: straight into the past!
dialog: (Shakes his hand warmly)
dialog: You're Billy’s grandson... he was a
dialog: wonderful comic. Very funny drag
dialog: act.
speaker_heading: BRADY
speaker_heading: (To HARDY)
dialog: He always said, Mr. Hardy, that
dialog: Stan were obsessed with his comedy.
dialog: Never stopped working on his act -
dialog: even though he reckoned in them
dialog: days it were crap.

dialog: Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 11.04.17 27
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Nothing much has changed there
dialog: Billy.
text: BRADY laughs - so does LAUREL.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: He was a very good friend of mine
dialog: your grandad was - how is he?
speaker_heading: BRADY
dialog: Oh, he passed away a few years ago.
text: LAUREL seems very moved by this.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I’m sorry to hear that.
text: The STAGE MANAGER comes out to give them all a heads up:
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: Curtain up in one minute Stan?
text: LAUREL nods his okay.
speaker_heading: BRADY
dialog: He was on stage right up ‘til the
dialog: end. Did a panto the night before
dialog: he died.
text: HARDY listens to this as BRADY wheels his bed to centre
text: stage. LAUREL takes a position in the wings and BRADY now
text: comes over and hands him a paper bag and a bunch of flowers.
speaker_heading: BRADY (cont'd)
dialog: He was very weak but he was
text: determined to get through it.
text: This seems to hit home with LAUREL who, as the lights dim,
text: falls quiet. He looks to HARDY, alone in bed in the backstage
dialog: gloom.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 18
dialog: 
text: There’s a buzz of expectation out front, then the orchestra
text: strikes up ‘The Dance Of The Cuckoos’, Laurel & Hardy's
text: instantly recognisable theme tune. LAUREL looks across to
text: HARDY and they exchange that same nod. Then, stage lights up,
text: curtain open, and loud applause as the audience sees HARDY on
text: stage in the bed. LAUREL silently counts in his head, then-
text: LAUREL strides on stage to another round of warm applause,
text: clutching the bunch of flowers and paper bag, blank
text: expression. The sketch begins:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Hi Ollie, how are you?
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 11.04.17 27A
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Never mind how I am - what took you
dialog: so long to get here?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well they said no visitors so I
dialog: said I was your son and it worked
text: like a charm.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: My son! You have a lot of nerve
dialog: telling them I was your father.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I couldn’t tell them you were my
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Of course you couldn’t. I’ve never
dialog: even been married...
text: Big laughs - the audience are loving it.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What have you got there?
dialog: %
speaker_heading: + eH
dialog: %
dialog: 19
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 28
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I brought you some hard boiled eggs
dialog: and some nuts.
text: HARDY looks to the audience, exasperated, and they laugh. The
text: reaction is warm and genuine, but the theatre is only half
text: full - there are empty seats everywhere.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Now you know I can't eat hard
dialog: boiled eggs and nuts! If you wanted
dialog: to bring me something why didn't
dialog: you bring me a box of candy?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well, they cost too much.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What has that got to do with it?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: And you didn't pay me for the last
dialog: box I brought you.
text: Laughter. LAUREL offers HARDY the bag:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Have one?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No. I’d rather not.
dialog: (To the audience, with
dialog: disgust)
dialog: Hard boiled eggs and nuts...
text: LAUREL ignores him, takes an egg out and starts to peel it
text: and eat it. HARDY watches, incredulous, as Laurel pulls a
text: salt cellar from his pocket and sprinkles some on.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE/STAGE, QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE, NEWCASTLE - NIG#?r
dialog: 
text: Helped by BRADY and another STAGE HAND, LAUREL and HARDY -

text: crumpled suits and Bowler hats, ready for the finale.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Dismayed)
dialog: What’s going on out there? All
dialog: those empty seats...

scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE, NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 19aA
text: ‘The Dance Of The Cuckoos’ plays again, and the curtain
text: rises. LAUREL waits for a particular note, then steps out on
text: set... but he only manages two paces before HARDY reaches out
text: and pulls him back. He goes out first in this partnership.
text: Laughter. But as HARDY strolls out self importantly, LAUREL
text: kicks him up the ass. More laughter. Finally they both walk
text: out together to warm applause. They go into a bowing routine,
text: to the side, to the front, then towards each other - clashing
text: heads. Laughter. LAUREL sees HARDY put his hand on his knee
text: to push himself straight again - sees a flash of pain across
text: his face. HARDY covers it well as he fiddles with his tie;
text: LAUREL takes his hat off and scratches his hair underneath.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
dialog: making us feel so welcome on our
dialog: first night back in England. We

speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We certainly have Stanley, we've

dialog: here in Newcastle, and now we’d
dialog: like to finish-
text: He gives LAUREL a brief nod of reassurance about his knee-
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: -with a little dance routine we
dialog: like to do. Music please maestro.
text: The tune to ‘At The Ball, That’s All’ strikes up.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Stanley.
text: Formally, HARDY holds his hand out and LAUREL takes it, as if
text: he were his dance partner, and they begin to perform the same
dialog: dance routine we saw in ‘Way Out West’. Though older and
text: slower, they still dance beautifully, the affection their
text: characters have for each other shining through. They come
text: together to finish, hold hands and take a bow. They look out
text: at the half full auditorium, but still keep up their smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STAIRWELL, TRAIN STATION - DAY 19A
text: LAUREL and HARDY puff and blow as they clamber up a long
text: staircase carrying their luggage. HARDY, golf clubs again
text: over his shoulder, drags the heavy trunk behind him.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It was a little slow last night,
dialog: wasn’t it.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Slow? We could have invited the
dialog: audience back for a party in our
dialog: hotel suite - there’d have been
text: plenty of room.
text: LAUREL smiles, HARDY is struck with a sudden thought:
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: We got to be careful Muffin doesn’t
dialog: come see us ‘til the houses pick up
dialog: - we don’t want him getting cold
text: feet about the movie.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You're right. I’1l put him off ‘til
dialog: we get to London...
text: LAUREL reaches the top, rests his case, looks about for where
dialog: to go next.

dialog: Which way is Platform Four..?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Still struggling up the
dialog: stairs)
dialog: 8.05? What time is it now?
text: LAUREL looks at his wrist - he’s not wearing a watch:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I don’t have my watch on.
text: HARDY instinctively brings up his left wrist to look at his
text: watch - but in doing so he lets go of the heavy trunk...
text: which promptly slides away down the staircase. A moment as
text: they both watch it trundle to the bottom and come to a stop -
text: an inescapable echo of the piano famously plummeting down
text: those long flight of stairs in their movie ‘The Music Box’.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: You know one of us is going to have
dialog: to get that.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It’s me isn’t it?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: It certainly is.
scene_heading: 20 INT. RESTAURANT CAR, TRAIN - DAY 20
text: HARDY lies back in his seat, bad leg propped up, dozing.
text: LAUREL brings back two Scotches from the buffet bar. He sets
text: them down, then resumes his seat, the remains of some
text: sandwiches and tea in front of them. LAUREL glances at HARDY,
text: takes a sip from his Scotch, then nudges him.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Babe.
dialog: (No response, so louder)
dialog: Babe.
text: HARDY wakes up, sees LAUREL. With a grimace of pain he sits
text: up, bringing his leg down from the seat opposite.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I got you a drink.
text: HARDY sees the Scotch, takes it and downs it.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 30aA
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Thank you.
text: LAUREL now hands him a few typed pages of script. HARDY looks
text: at them, confused for a moment, then takes them.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 30A
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I been workin’ on some new scenes
dialog: for ‘Rob ‘Em Good’, thought we
dialog: could run ‘em?
text: HARDY sees a pot of tea and some cups in front of them, puts
text: the script down and pours himself a cup.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: We don’t have to if you don’t want
dialog: to.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 31
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No no...
dialog: (Almost as an aside)
dialog: I know my place.
text: It’s a little barb he throws out but LAUREL doesn’t take it.
text: With great delicacy HARDY begins a long ritual: dropping four
text: cubes of sugar in, then milk and carefully stirring, making
text: sure the lumps dissolve. He then spills some red tablets from
text: a bottle onto the little table in front of him.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Knee still bad?
text: HARDY nods as he counts out four and puts the others back in
dialog: the bottle.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: I thought you were on the blue
dialog: tablets?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I already had the blue ones and
dialog: it’s still killin’ me. I thought
dialog: I'd give the red ones one more
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well won’t the blue ones get upset
dialog: about that?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I never thought about it.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It’s got to be one or the other,
dialog: you can’t keep both of them on the
dialog: go at the same time...
text: Finally, after one last emphatic stir, HARDY puts the first
text: tablet in his mouth, picks his cup up with a crooked little
text: finger, and takes a sip to wash it down.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: -they’1l get jealous and start
dialog: fighting over you.
text: HARDY immediately reacts, pulls a face, but is forced to
dialog: swallow.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me it was cold?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I thought you knew?
text: HARDY looks at him, exhales in frustration, and downs the
text: other three tablets quickly with another gulp of cold tea.
dialog: 21
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 11.04.17 32
text: He shudders with distaste, then picks the script up again and
text: starts to read through it. But he’s distracted, can’t
text: concentrate. He turns to LAUREL:
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: That guy who went on stage the
dialog: night before he died....
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Billy Brady?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Yeh.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Wasn’t that something, to still be
dialog: working in his old age like that?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: That’s what's been bothering me. He
text: wasn’t working, he was dying.
dialog: Didn't you find it sad?
text: As LAUREL thinks about this, HARDY takes the flask from him
text: and has a sip.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
text: Well... look at Jimmy Finlayson.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Nobody even knew he’d died, just
text: lay there in his bed, all alone. He
dialog: finished too soon - same cafe every
text: morning, reading the papers, trying
dialog: to make that stretch to midday so
dialog: he’s only got the afternoon to
dialog: kill? Who wants that?
text: HARDY has another sip.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Maybe he was happy doing nothing.
dialog: There’s an awful lot to be said for
dialog: it...
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE THEATRE, GLASGOW - DAY 21
text: A grey morning, the wind whipping across the Clyde. HARDY
text: smokes a cigarette as he stands down the street from the
dialog: boys’ next venue - the ‘Empire Glasgow’. Under this we hear:
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 32A
speaker_heading: LAUREL (V.O.)
dialog: Mr. Miffin please... Yes this is
dialog: Stan Laurel... Well that’s very
dialog: nice of you to say so...
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 33
text: Shot TRACKS to REVEAL LAUREL making another call in a public
text: phone box. HARDY, out of earshot, waits for him.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Mr. Hardy? Oh he’s indisposed right
dialog: now-
dialog: (Sees HARDY outside)
dialog: -he’s working in a Swiss cheese
dialog: factory. He got a job putting in
dialog: the holes-
dialog: (He obviously gets a
dialog: laugh, listens some more)
dialog: He’s in a meeting? Okay, it’s just
dialog: that I need to confirm a date for
dialog: him to come see us in London.
dialog: (Listens)
dialog: No please don’t interrupt him, I'11l
dialog: try again another time.
dialog: (Listens)
dialog: No that’s fine... you too.
text: He hangs up and emerges from the phone box, joins HARDY and
text: they walk away together.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: How was Ida?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Fine. Ducks were fine...
text: LAUREL suddenly stops and pulls out another beret from his
text: coat pocket and hands it to HARDY.
dialog: 22
dialog: 23
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 34
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: Here, I got you a present.
text: HARDY takes it and, delighted, puts it on immediately (LAUREL
text: is already wearing his).
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: How does it look?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Swell.
text: WIDE SHOT: the two of them walk off towards the theatre.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We're two peas in a pod.
text: They pass a WOMAN pushing a pram and both politely doff their
text: berets to her.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN (V.O.)
dialog: -yes but we just wanted to know
dialog: who’s going to be playing Laurel
dialog: and Hardy please?
speaker_heading: DELETED 22
scene_heading: INT. FOYER, EMPIRE GLASGOW - DAY 23
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE are at the box office with the MANAGER:
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: They're playing themselves.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Who are?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Laurel and Hardy. ‘Here In Person’
dialog: the poster says - they’re here in
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Yes but they’ve been retired for
dialog: years. Before we buy any tickets we
dialog: want to know the names of the
dialog: actors who are going to be playing
dialog: them here? In this actual theatre?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (Exasperated)
dialog: They are playing themselves!
text: At this point LAUREL and HARDY walk through the foyer on
text: their way into the theatre. They spot the ELDERLY COUPLE and
text: once more politely doff their berets:

dialog: Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 11.04.17 35
speaker_heading: LAUREL AND HARDY
dialog: (Smiling politely)
dialog: Good afternoon.
text: Out on the ELDERLY COUPLE’S astonished expressions. UNDER

speaker_heading: HARDY (V.O.)
dialog: .-- Ladies and gentlemen, we’d like
dialog: to thank you for making us feel so
dialog: welcome here in Glasgow...
scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE, GLASGOW - NIGHT 24
dialog: The audience tonight is again, disappointingly, only half
text: full - though they are enjoying seeing the boys resplendent
dialog: in kilts especially for their Scottish fans. We pick out
text: DELFONT in the audience, looking around, noting the gaps.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Not just Glasgow, the whole of
dialog: Wales.
text: Hardy points to the kilts they are wearing
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: Why aren’t we wearing any trousers?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Because we're in Scotland.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yes but why aren’t we wearing any
dialog: trousers?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Never mind. Ladies and gentlemen
dialog: we'd like to finish with a dance.
text: Laurel throws him a knowing look - Hardy’s not well enough to
dialog: do the dance number.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No. No, you sing a song and I’1l do
dialog: a dance.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Alright, have it your way. What
dialog: song would you like to do?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: We'd like to perform ‘Shine on
dialog: Harvey Moon’.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 11.04.17 35aaA
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: ‘Shine on Harvest Moon’.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Alright, we’ll do that one then.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Maestro, may I have a ukulele?
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 35aA
text: HARDY starts to play on his ukulele then sings the song in
text: his beautiful tenor voice, LAUREL harmonizing, his gentle,

speaker_heading: LAUREL AND HARDY

scene_heading: INT. GLASGOW PUB - NIGHT 25
text: That evening. LAUREL and HARDY, glum and apprehensive after
text: another poorly attended show, sit in a corner booth with
text: DELFONT, who tucks into a pub meal of sausage and mash.
text: LAUREL and HARDY don’t eat but have pints of beer in front of
text: them and both smoke heavily, a thick haze hanging over the
text: booth. Nothing is said until, finally, DELFONT finishes his
text: last mouthful and dabs vigorously at his mouth with a napkin:
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Now then, gentlemen...
dialog: (More dabbing, puts napkin
dialog: down )
dialog: Terrific though the show is, and it
dialog: really is terrific-
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: -we really do have to have a little
dialog: think about where we go from here.
text: Sweating profusely, HARDY pours himself a glass of water from
text: the ever-present jug he has at the dinner table.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We have new material we can work
dialog: in, don’t we Stan.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: We have a double door routine we
dialog: can do, set in a railway station,
dialog: and as soon as Babe’s leg is better
dialog: we can bring back the dance number
text: at the end.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: It's getting better all the time.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Yes, I think that would all help
dialog: enormously. And of course it’s
dialog: early days and all that but,
dialog: unfortunately, the houses have thus
dialog: far been extremely disappointing.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: But that’s because we’re playing in
dialog: all these little theatres.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Yes and I’m absolutely furious
dialog: about that.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 37
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: But you booked us in them? What
dialog: happened to the big ones we played
dialog: last time we were over?
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Well we couldn’t be sure how ticket
dialog: sales would go you see, and-
text: LAUREL, suddenly getting it, looks thunderstruck.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Wait a minute, wait a minute... you
dialog: want to close us down?
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Absolutely not. That’s the last
dialog: thing I want to do.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We haven’t even done a week!
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: When do you want us to finish?
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: I thought it would be best if we
dialog: wrapped it up before you got to
dialog: London?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: That would give us another ten
dialog: shows or so. With a bit of a push -
dialog: ‘last shows’, that sort of thing -
dialog: and the advance bookings we already
dialog: have, we should just about be able
dialog: to wash our hands.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: But the producer of the movie’s
dialog: coming to see the show in London
dialog: next month, isn’t he Stan?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: And Lucille and Ida are coming over
dialog: in a couple of weeks - we can’t
dialog: finish early.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We made it perfectly clear-
dialog: (Grasps at the figure)
dialog: -one hundred and ten per cent
dialog: clear, that the only reason we came
dialog: over for this tour was to be
dialog: available for that movie.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 38
text: DELFONT looks at them both, considering the situation.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: I thought you'd jump at the chance.
dialog: Neither of you looks particularly
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I'm in perfect health.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: And so is he.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Mr Delfont, we need this tour to
dialog: continue.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: And of course I’m enormously
dialog: sympathetic. Enormously. But your
text: audience doesn’t quite seem to be
dialog: what it was, and advance bookings
dialog: are very slow. It’s a wonderful
dialog: show, very charming and sweet, but
dialog: perhaps... tastes have changed? All
dialog: good things must come to an end,
dialog: that sort of thing?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: We can turn it around.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: The public moves on. So many don’t
dialog: even come to the theatre now, just
dialog: stay at home watching their
dialog: television sets... watching your
dialog: films on their television sets,
dialog: come to think of it - and you not
dialog: even getting any residuals.
dialog: (Shakes his head and tuts)
dialog: Filthy business.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Just tell us what you want us to do
dialog: and we’ll do it.
text: DELFONT looks from HARDY, who wipes the sweat from his
text: forehead with a napkin, to LAUREL, who looks at him
text: expectantly.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Well... if you really want to keep
dialog: this tour going, then all I can
dialog: think of... is you’re going to have
dialog: to get out there and publicize it.
text: (He looks at them both)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 38A
speaker_heading: DELFONT (CONT'D)
dialog: Which would mean a very large
dialog: amount of extra work for you both,
dialog: making personal appearances,
dialog: opening shops, meeting local
dialog: dignitaries and so on and so forth.
dialog: And for, broadly speaking, very
dialog: little extra money.
dialog: 26
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 39
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I take it that ‘very little’
dialog: actually means no extra money at
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: That we would have to flog
dialog: ourselves half to death for
dialog: nothing?
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Well...
dialog: (Sees in their eyes that
dialog: there’s no point lying)
dialog: Yes.
text: LAUREL and HARDY exchange. A beat, then:
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well okay.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: LAUREL

text: pauses to study a poster outside a cinema: ‘Abbott & Costello
text: Go To Mars’. The blurb tells us they are ‘Hollywood’s No. One
dialog: Comedy Duo’. This is the double act that has effectively
dialog: replaced Laurel & Hardy in the affections of modern
text: moviegoers. LAUREL looks at their young faces, the silver
text: space suits, the shiny rocket, the future...
text: A MAN walks up and stands next to him, also to look at the
text: poster. A few moments then LAUREL, aware of the MAN standing
text: on his shoulder, turns to look at him. At the same time the
text: MAN turns to LAUREL and gives him a polite smile. LAUREL goes

dialog: Let me call you Sweetheart, I'm in

dialog: Let me hear you whisper that you
dialog: love me too
dialog: Keep the da-da hmm hmm in your eyes
dialog: so true
dialog: Let me call you Sweetheart, I'm in
dialog: love with you...
text: He passes a little florist’s stall outside the tube station,
text: is about to go down the stairs when he decides he’s feeling
text: so good he wants a buttonhole. He selects a red carnation
text: and, with great delicacy, pulls a shilling from his wallet to
text: pay for it. Back to the song, he hums and whistles as he
text: carries on jauntily into the tube station, pinning the

dialog: response - she simply thinks him rather odd. So he tries
text: something else: putting his hat back on, he puts his finger
text: in his mouth and blows it like it’s a valve. He can see the
text: RECEPTIONIST trying not to look, but finding herself
text: wondering what on earth he’s doing. He puts his finger in
text: again and blows harder; by leaning the brim of his hat back
text: slightly against the wall behind him, he makes it look as if
text: his hat is lifting off his head. She watches this, but
text: there’s still no laugh - she just looks vaguely

text: gives HARDY a look and he reluctantly nods, ‘okay’. He goes
text: to the side of the car nearest the wall and from there opens
text: the rear door whilst LAUREL goes to the other side of the car
text: and opens that. LAUREL leans in and in the back are LUCILLE
text: HARDY, a pretty, unfussy Southern belle, 40s, and Laurel’s
text: wife IDA, same age glamorously dressed, of Russian descent.

speaker_heading: LUCILLE

speaker_heading: LUCILLE

speaker_heading: HARDY

speaker_heading: IDA

dialog: Stanley.
text: He hands it to her and she drinks it.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I think we got something here - the

text: As LUCILLE waits on the phone:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I’m really sorry Lucille.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Thank you Stan, I’ll take it from
dialog: here...
text: LAUREL looks miserably at his stricken friend on the bed,

text: his shoulders.
scene_heading: INT. LAUREL’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 83
dialog: 
text: LAUREL sits on the edge of his bed, loosening his collar and

text: his shoes and taking them off for him. She looks up at him,
dialog: knows there’s nothing she can say.
scene_heading: INT. HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 84
dialog: 
text: A DOCTOR finishes listening to HARDY’S heart with his
text: stethoscope. He listens intently, then removes the instrument
text: from his ears and folds it up.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I can get you admitted to hospital
dialog: tonight-
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Oliver don’t be ridiculous.

dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 81
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Weak, distressed)
dialog: I’m not going to hospital. I’m in
dialog: the middle of a very important tour
dialog: and we also have a movie scheduled
dialog: to go into production. I just had a
dialog: funny turn.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Oliver please!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mr. Hardy I believe you've suffered
dialog: a mild heart attack today. I also
dialog: believe that there is some evidence
text: of congestive failure.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Oh dear God, I knew it-
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: If you won't admit yourself to
dialog: hospital here, I suggest you go
dialog: home as soon as you possibly can to
dialog: seek specialist treatment in the

dialog: go on stage again in your current
dialog: condition.

speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: What’s the latest?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Lucille won't let anybody near him.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: So we can’t expect him back any
dialog: time soon?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Shame, the advance London bookings

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It’s not Babe’s fault he got sick.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Of course not, of course not.
text: He cuts off a strategic slice of smoked salmon, wolfs it
text: down. A few moment’s silence, then DELFONT ‘casually’ changes
dialog: tack.
speaker_heading: DELFONT (cont'd)
dialog: Stanley am I right in thinking that
dialog: before you teamed up with Oliver
dialog: you worked with other partners?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well, I had lots of different
dialog: partners in Vaudeville yes, I once
dialog: worked with Charlie Chaplin, but...
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: And of course Oliver made his
dialog: elephant film with a different
dialog: partner?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What’s that got to do with
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Oh.. I don’t know, random thought -
dialog: there’s a very popular double act
dialog: here called Cook and Baker, I know
dialog: them very well. Cook is the Hardy
dialog: to Baker’s Laurel, if you see what
dialog: I mean.
dialog: (Takes a sip of orange
dialog: juice)
dialog: I was just wondering whether you
dialog: might not consider trying a couple
dialog: of shows with Nobby Cook, just to
dialog: keep things going until Babe can
dialog: return?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You mean, go on without Babe?
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: No no. Silly idea.
text: DELFONT glances at LAUREL and can see he’s got him thinking;
dialog: that he’s planted a seed.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, SAVOY HOTEL - DAY 87

scene_heading: INT. HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 88
text: HARDY is propped up in bed with pillows, looking pale. He
text: sees LAUREL enter and gives him a weak smile. LAUREL takes
text: his coat off, sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I got you a present.
text: He pulls two boiled eggs from his pocket and holds them out.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Eggs?
text: It looks like Laurel is echoing the moment on stage when he
text: visits Hardy in hospital - but he’s perfectly serious.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I went down to the kitchen to see
dialog: if they could spare any. Cost me
dialog: three shillings each.
text: HARDY takes them, delighted.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I‘’1l have one now if I may.
text: He starts to peel the shell off one straight away; sees
text: LAUREL looking enviously at the other one.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Go ahead.
text: LAUREL needs no further encouragement, and takes the other
text: egg, also starting to peel it.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I’1ll get you some more.
text: The two men peel the shell off their eggs contentedly.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: Where’s Lucille gone? She could
dialog: have stayed, it was just a silly
dialog: row about nothing the other day.
dialog: Just... nothing.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I got something to tell you Ollie-
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Overlapping)
dialog: I’m retiring.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: -about the movie... what?
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 84
text: LAUREL falls silent, cut off in mid-sentence.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: The doctor’s told me I can’t go on
dialog: with the tour, and I’ve promised
dialog: Lucille I won't.
text: LAUREL stares at him - no words will come out.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: So I’m retiring Stan. I’ve promised
dialog: Lucille and that’s all there is to
dialog: it. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I should never have made us take
dialog: this tour.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Je ne regret rien. And you
dialog: shouldn't regret rien either.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Can’t you rest, and then we can
dialog: start again when you're better?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Shakes his head)
dialog: He’s told me my heart won’t stand
dialog: it. I’m going back home as soon as
dialog: we can arrange a crossing.
text: A long beat. HARDY can see LAUREL’S finding this so
text: difficult. Both of them hold their half-finished eggs.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You're retiring...
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Yes. Retiring.
text: HARDY looks at his friend, his head down, clearly devastated.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: I know how much this tour, and...
dialog: doing the picture meant to you.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh that’s... forgotten.
dialog: (Long beat)
dialog: You're retiring.
text: It's like he has to say it out loud again, as if this will
text: somehow change things. HARDY can see he’s in distress.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What have you been working on?
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 85
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What?
text: LAUREL takes out a handkerchief from his pocket.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What new scenes for the movie have
dialog: you been working on?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Loudly blows his nose)
dialog: Oh... nothing really.
text: HARDY gives LAUREL a hard stare. Silence. Finally LAUREL
text: meets his gaze.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Now aren’t you ashamed of yourself?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Lying to me, your oldest and
dialog: dearest friend, here on my sickbed.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I don’t know what you mean?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I haven’t seen you for two days,
dialog: and you're trying to tell me you
dialog: haven't been working on any new
dialog: material in that time?
text: A beat, then LAUREL has to smile.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Come on then, out with it.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Long beat)
dialog: I did think of this romantic scene.
dialog: You're pining for Maid Marian, who
text: has been holed up in the castle by
dialog: the Sheriff of Nottingham-—
text: LAUREL even feels sufficiently cheered to take another bite
text: of his egg. Through a mouthful he continues:
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: -so we hear this sad violin music.
text: HARDY starts to hum some sad, sweet tune to LAUREL.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: And it’s all too much for you, and
dialog: you begin to cry.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 86
text: HARDY starts to look upset as he hums, wiping away a ‘tear’.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
text: And the tears begin to fall. And
text: they fall pretty heavy, splashing
dialog: down your cheeks... but I’m not
dialog: upset one bit and I don’t know what
dialog: to do, but you’re crying so much...
dialog: so what I do is move a pot plant
dialog: under you to catch them, so the
dialog: plant gets a good watering, and it
text: starts to grow like crazy...
text: HARDY slaps his thigh and laughs, LAUREL is thrilled.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: The props guys can fix me up so the
dialog: tears are like two little
dialog: waterfalls - it'll be a riot!
dialog: That’s great Stan, that’1ll go big.
text: As he laughs HARDY is gripped by another coughing fit; LAUREL
text: quickly hands him a glass of water but HARDY has to find his
text: breath first before he takes a sip; he slumps back against
text: his pillow, exhausted.
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: Can you get me another blanket, I
dialog: feel so cold.
text: LAUREL grabs another blanket and throws it over him.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Your hands are like ice.
text: He gets under the blanket with him to warm him up, lying
text: right next to him - just like they did in their films.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: There, is that better?
text: The two men lie together happily side by side, each
text: envisaging the ‘pot plant’ scene - but knowing they’1l never
dialog: get to perform it. A beat, then:
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Have you spoken to Delfont?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yeh I saw him this morning.
text: They are both gazing up at the ceiling rather than at each
text: other as they talk.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What'd he say?
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 87
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well he didn’t know you were
dialog: retiring of course but he asked me,
dialog: since you were sick, how I felt
dialog: about carrying on the show with
dialog: somebody else.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: English comedian, called Nobby
dialog: Cook.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: That makes sense.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I haven't said I would yet.
text: HARDY turns to LAUREL.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Why not? You didn’t get sick.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: It’s for the best Stan.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yes. Maybe it is.
text: HARDY returns to gazing at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well, that’s it. I’m retiring, and
dialog: you're going on with a new partner.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yes. That’s it.
text: OUT on the two of them in bed together, accepting the end.
scene_heading: 89 INT. PALLADIUM THEATRE, LONDON - DAY 89
dialog: 
text: The auditorium is empty, a rehearsal in progress. Nobby COOK,
text: 50s, not Hardy’s size but a big, stout, northerner, is on
text: stage lying on the bed in the hospital set we are now so
text: familiar with. DELFONT brings LAUREL onto stage and
text: introduces him to COOK.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Stanley can I introduce you to
dialog: Nobby Cook, one of our finest music
dialog: hall comedians.
text: COOK looks nervous, but LAUREL shakes his hand warmly.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 88
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Very pleased to meet you Nobby - I
dialog: heard a lot of great things about
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: How do you do Mr. Laurel, I’m a big
dialog: fan of yours - watched all your
dialog: films.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Come on now, we’ll have none of
dialog: that - I’m Stan and you’re Nobby.
dialog: I’m looking forward to working with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: Thank you very much, very nice of
dialog: you to say so. How’s Mr. Hardy?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh he’s doing fine, and sends you
dialog: his very best wishes.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: That means a lot to me.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: This is terrific. You two are going
dialog: to be just terrific together...
text: DELFONT allows himself a satisfied smile. LAUREL is trying
dialog: very hard to be positive.
speaker_heading: DELFONT (cont'd)
dialog: Shall we have a run through?
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: If you like - it’s up to Stan.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Why don’t I go out and then come
dialog: back in and we can run it from the
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: DELFONT
dialog: Good idea.
text: LAUREL walks back to the wings. He picks up a bunch of
text: flowers and a paper bag that has been put there for him. He
text: sees COOK readying himself in the hospital bed, his leg in
text: the plaster cast which is then hoisted up on pulleys.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: Beltin’ this. Guaranteed laugh here
dialog: Stan.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 88A
text: COOK gives LAUREL a smile and a thumbs up, which LAUREL
text: returns, trying to reassure him. COOK then briefly runs some
text: lines in his head, saying them quietly to himself:
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: What have you got there? Hard
text: boiled eggs and nuts. Hard boiled
dialog: eggs and nuts? Don’t be so daft!
dialog: What’s the matter with you - you
dialog: know I can’t eat them...
text: As we see LAUREL listening to him, we see he’s as
dialog: uncomfortable about this as Hardy was all those years ago...
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 89
speaker_heading: DELFONT (OOV) (cont'd)
dialog: Okay and... cue Stanley!

scene_heading: 92 INT. DRESSING ROOM, PALLADIUM THEATRE, LONDON - NIGHT 92
dialog: 
text: LAUREL is alone in his dingy dressing room, applying his

dialog: Open up - we know they’re in there!
speaker_heading: MAID MARIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Quick, hide...
scene_heading: 93 INT. CASTLE - DAY [ROBIN HOOD ‘MOVIE’] 93

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: MAID MARIAN
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
text: One of the others attracts the GUARD’S attention, nodding to
text: a curtain with two sets of feet poking out from the bottom.
text: The GUARDS gesture amongst themselves to ‘sshhh’ and creep
text: over to the curtain. Two of them draw swords, and...
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: A-ha! A-ha! So you think you can
dialog: Play that game do you-
text: -they both stab viciously through the curtain at chest
text: height. A moment’s confusion, then they pull the curtain back
text: to reveal LAUREL (Stanley-A-Dale) and HARDY (Friar Hardy) on
text: their knees looking up at them, shoes tucked under them like
dialog: Toulouse-Lautrec. [Note: the boys are physically in their
dialog: prime, just like they looked in ‘Way Out West’].
scene_heading: 94 INT. HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 94
dialog: 
text: HARDY, now alone in bed, smiles, as if thinking to himself of
dialog: the same piece of material. Under this we hear:

dialog: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 90
speaker_heading: HARDY (V.O.)
dialog: We’re on our way to give him a
dialog: piece of my mind, aren’t we
dialog: Stanley?
speaker_heading: LAUREL (V.O.)
dialog: We sure are.
speaker_heading: HARDY (V.O.)
dialog: We’d give him a piece of his too,
text: but he doesn’t have any to spare.
scene_heading: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY [ROBIN HOOD ‘MOVIE’ ] 95
dialog: 
text: And there are LAUREL and HARDY, standing on one end of a log
text: across a river running through the forest, attempting to
text: cross. ROBIN HOOD blocks their way. HARDY is dressed as
text: ‘Friar Hardy’ in a cassock, his hair in a monk’s tonsure;
text: LAUREL is standing next to him, as ‘Stanley-A-Dale’ with a
text: feather in his hat. Again it’s the ‘Robin Hood’ movie that
text: didn’t happen, brought to life in Laurel’s imagination.
speaker_heading: ROBIN HOOD
dialog: And what, pray tell, has Robin Hood
dialog: done to inspire such wrath?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well, we’ve heard that he steals
dialog: from the poor to give to the rich,
dialog: isn’t that right Stanley?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Isn’t that stupid? That’s just
dialog: robbing Peter to pay Paul - he’s
dialog: got the whole thing the wrong way
dialog: round.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Exactly. Our idea, you see, is to
dialog: give to the poor by stealing from
dialog: the poor. And thereby cutting out
dialog: the middle man.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: The rich need never be any the
dialog: wiser.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Precisely. So, if you’d please
dialog: stand aside we have important
dialog: business afoot...
text: HARDY steps forward but ROBIN HOOD bars the way with his
text: staff, jabbing him in the belly with it. They look at each
text: other, sizing things up.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 11.04.17 90A
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)

text: behind HARDY and taps him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Watch he doesn’t hit you on the
dialog: leg.
text: Then ROBIN HOOD brings his staff crashing down on HARDY’S
text: head, snapping it in half. HARDY howls in pain, drops his
text: staff, gingerly touching his skull. LAUREL, standing behind
text: HARDY, starts to laugh. HARDY gets really annoyed with him
text: because of this and punches him in the throat - making his
text: tongue come out. LAUREL retaliates by punching HARDY on the
text: nose; HARDY howls with pain, they get into a shoving match
text: and HARDY ends up in the river.
text: He sits in the water, spits some out of his mouth, wipes his
text: eyes. There’s some heavy flapping from inside his cassock and
text: he wriggles around until he pulls out a huge salmon and
text: throws it away. He LOOKS TO CAMERA, full of utter frustration
text: with what he has to put up with, then he looks up at LAUREL,
text: on the log, staring at him blankly.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Well, here’s another nice mess
dialog: you’ve gotten me into.
text: LAUREL spreads his hands, guilty face, beginnings of a ‘cry’.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM, PALLADIUM THEATRE, LONDON - NIGHT 96

text: through a crack in a curtain to check the size of the

text: hospital bed and having his foot encased in the comedy
dialog: plaster cast.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 91A

scene_heading: INT. PALLADIUM THEATRE, LONDON - NIGHT 100
dialog: 
text: DELFONT and IDA wait patiently for curtain up. And they

text: stage into a spotlight.
speaker_heading: THEATRE MANAGER
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I’m afraid

text: She kisses him on the forehead and leaves. HARDY, lost in his
text: thoughts, doesn’t say a word.
scene_heading: INT. LAUREL’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 104
text: LAUREL sits in a chair, three packed suitcases nearby, ready
text: to go downstairs. He concentrates gloomily on the door as IDA
text: flits about picking up the last few bits from the room. Soon,
text: when the Bell Boy comes through that door, it’1l all be over.
speaker_heading: IDA
dialog: You have money for Bell Boy?
text: LAUREL nods. He looks at the door. There’s a knock.
speaker_heading: IDA (cont'd)
dialog: Answer please I need bathroom. You
dialog: give him five shillings only. No
dialog: more.
text: As IDA disappears into the bathroom LAUREL hauls himself up
text: with a sigh, fumbles through his pockets for change and opens
text: the door... to find a fully dressed HARDY standing outside.
text: He’s pale and a little unsteady on his feet, but his eyes are
text: clear and his expression determined. LAUREL looks at him,
text: speechless.
scene_heading: INT. HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 105
dialog: 
text: LUCILLE lets herself in.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: One of the Bell Boys down there,
dialog: Raymond I think his name was, said
dialog: to tell you he had a good tip for
dialog: you on a horse...
text: She walks through to the bedroom.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (cont'd)
dialog: Have you been gambling Oliver
dialog: Hardy?
text: She sees the empty bed, Hardy’s crumpled pyjamas on it. And
text: instantly, she knows what has happened.
scene_heading: INT. LAUREL’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 106
dialog: 
text: LAUREL and HARDY face each other over the doorstep. Finally,
speaker_heading: HARDY speaks:
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 94a
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Come Stanley, I believe we have
text: some engagements to fulfil.
dialog: 107
dialog: 108
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 22.02.17 95
text: On LAUREL, a long beat. Then, he understands what this means.
text: He and HARDY don’t need to say any more, they just look at
dialog: each other.
scene_heading: INT. HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 107
text: LUCILLE sits on the bed, upset but not angry. Deep down she
dialog: knew this was inevitable.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK, STEAMER - DAY 108
text: The sun shines in a clear, bright sky but it’s bracing up on
text: deck. HARDY is lying on a deck lounger wrapped in a blanket,
text: LUCILLE next to him. IDA and LAUREL (wearing his beret) walk
text: back to them from a trip around deck.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: I think we should all get below
dialog: now, out of this wind.
speaker_heading: IDA
dialog: Dahling I agree.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Oliver? Will you at least listen to
dialog: me about this? Or are you
dialog: determined to catch pneumonia?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I’m enjoying the fresh air honey.
dialog: Stan come and sit with me - you
dialog: girls go ahead.
text: LUCILLE hesitates for a moment, not happy.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I‘1l bring him down.
text: She nods, gives LAUREL a smile. Then she and IDA depart.
text: LAUREL takes a beret from his pocket and hands it to HARDY.
speaker_heading: LAUREL (cont'd)
dialog: Here. Thought you might want this
dialog: back.
text: HARDY looks at him, smiles, takes back the beret he threw at
text: Laurel during their big argument and pulls it on his head.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Thanks.
text: LAUREL sits down next to him, takes a pair of gloves from his
text: pocket and pulls them on, finger by finger, carefully making
text: sure each one is pulled on tight. HARDY watches with
text: increasing exasperation. Then, finally:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Babe... I lied to you.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 96
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Stern expression)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
text: There is no movie.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Miffin told me a couple of weeks
dialog: ago it had fallen through. I
dialog: guess... nobody wants a Laurel &
dialog: Hardy picture any more.
dialog: (A few moments as this
dialog: sinks in)
dialog: But if I’d told you straight
dialog: away... well maybe we could have
dialog: finished the tour early and you
dialog: wouldn't have got sick.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You knew two weeks ago that there
dialog: was no movie?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yes. And I been feelin’ terrible
dialog: about it.
text: On HARDY, a long beat. Then...
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Stan, I knew.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I knew.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me you knew?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I thought you already knew I knew.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: How could I know that you knew I
dialog: already knew.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (Flounders for a moment)
dialog: What’s the next line?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: ‘I thought you already knew I knew,
dialog: but you were pretending you didn’t
dialog: know I knew’.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 96A
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: So if you knew, why did you let me
dialog: keep rehearsing the movie with you?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What else are we gonna do?
dialog: 109
dialog: 110
dialog: 111
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 97
text: They exchange a smile. HARDY pulls his coat up around his
text: neck against the cold.
scene_heading: EXT. COBH HARBOUR - DAY 109
dialog: Caption
dialog: Cobh harbour, Ireland
text: The steamer heads into Cobh harbour, an old seaport on the
text: southern coast of Ireland dominated by St. Coleman’s
text: Cathedral, towering over the quay from its hillside perch.
text: We see feet, small feet - some with no socks, just in clogs -
text: running. We see CHILDREN emerging from street corners to make
text: their way down to the quayside - where a crowd is gathering.
scene_heading: EXT. STEAMER, DECK - DAY 110
text: The LAURELS and HARDYS make their way up out of the ship’s
text: interior on to the gangplank, LAUREL with two big cases and
dialog: HARDY just a small valise (their old trick whenever they
text: arrive somewhere). But they stop as they look out at the
dialog: quayside. We now...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: -what they see: a huge crowd of people of all ages has
text: gathered to greet them, standing patiently, silently. IDA and
text: LUCILLE drop back so that LAUREL and HARDY can walk down the
text: gangplank together. Once the crowd sees them, the big guy and
text: the little guy from the movies, a great cheer erupts. As they
text: descend the gangplank hats are thrown in the air and the
text: crowd surges forward to greet them. Then, just as they reach
text: the bottom of the gangplank, something extraordinary happens.
text: From the cathedral bells at the top of the hill, ‘The Dance
text: Of The Cuckoos’ - the boys’ theme tune - is rung out from the
text: bell tower. LAUREL and HARDY look at each other, unable to
text: quite believe what is happening. They both weep openly,
text: amazed at the reception, at the warmth and love which engulfs
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 111

scene_heading: INT. OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 112
text: A full house, all ages; the audience impatient to see their
text: heroes. We see LUCILLE and IDA in the front row, DELFONT next
text: to them, beaming with pride. His hands are clasped firmly
text: together, a small sign of how nervous he is. Of how much,
dialog: deep down, he really does care about the boys.
scene_heading: INT. WINGS OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 113
text: HARDY is having his leg hoisted up in ‘traction’, LAUREL
text: checks his cuffs and heels. Their eyes meet, and they
dialog: exchange that nod.
scene_heading: INT. OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 114
dialog: 
text: The house lights go down, an expectant hush. ‘The Dance Of
text: The Cuckoos’ begins, curtain goes up and there is the
text: hospital room set, HARDY in bed, leg in plaster. Applause.
text: LAUREL enters stage left with the bunch of flowers and paper
text: bag and at the sight of the two men together there is renewed
text: applause, whistles and even cheers. LAUREL waits for it to
dialog: die down.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Hi Ollie, how are you?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Never mind how I am - what took you
dialog: so long to get here?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well they said no visitors so I
dialog: said I was your son and it worked
text: like a charm.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: My son! You have a lot of nerve
dialog: telling them I was your father.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I couldn’t tell them you were my
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Of course you couldn’t. I’ve never
dialog: even been married...
text: Big laughs - the audience are loving it.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What have you got there?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I brought you some hard boiled eggs
dialog: and some nuts.
text: HARDY looks to the audience, exasperated, and they laugh.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 98a
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Now you know I can't eat hard
dialog: boiled eggs and nuts! If you wanted
dialog: to bring me something why didn't
dialog: you bring me a box of candy?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Well, they cost too much.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: What has that got to do with it?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: And you didn't pay me for the last
dialog: box I brought you.
text: Laughter. LAUREL offers HARDY the bag:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Have one?
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: No. I’d rather not.
dialog: (To the audience, with
dialog: disgust)
dialog: Hard boiled eggs and nuts...
text: LAUREL ignores him, takes an egg out and starts to peel it
text: and eat it. HARDY watches, incredulous, as Laurel pulls a
text: salt cellar from his pocket and sprinkles some on.
text: We see DELFONT smiling at what he sees on stage but, as ever,
text: twisting his head round to make a quick mental calculation on
dialog: the size of the house. Business is business...
dialog: 115
dialog: 116
dialog: 117
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 99
text: We see LUCILLE, next to IDA. LUCILLE is worried, but trying
text: to smile through it. IDA seems calm.
speaker_heading: DELETED 115
scene_heading: INT. OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 116
dialog: 
text: The double door routine. HARDY sweaty, but still on his feet,
text: his and LAUREL’S timing slick as ever as one goes in one
text: door, the other emerges through another.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE, OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 117
dialog: 
text: LAUREL and HARDY, helped by their DRESSERS, hurriedly change
text: into their battered suits and Bowlers for the finale. Outside
text: there is clapping, cheering and whistling. As they wait in
text: the wings, ready to go on, LAUREL is concerned with how
text: exhausted HARDY looks - drenched in sweat, breathless from
text: the effort he’s put in already, struggling to even get on his
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You look tired out Babe - why don’t
dialog: we just go out and say goodnight
dialog: and finish it there? We don’t have
dialog: to do the song...
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: I’m fine...
dialog: (Sudden thought)
dialog: Listen, I had this idea for the
dialog: picture. How about I grab Robin
dialog: Hood's staff and go to hit you with
dialog: that, but instead I knock down this
dialog: bees’ nest and it lands on my head?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: That’s a swell idea. That’1l go
dialog: big.
text: The ‘Dance Of The Cuckoos’ strikes up out front, and the
text: curtain starts to open.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: It was fun while it lasted, wasn’t
dialog: it Stan.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 17.03.17 99R
text: LAUREL smiles, then waits for his cue. On that same note he
text: walks out - only to be hooked back by HARDY-
speaker_heading: HARDY (cont'd)
dialog: I‘1l miss us when we're gone.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: So will you.
text: Now HARDY walks out on stage, and LAUREL kicks him up the ass
text: as he goes.
dialog: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 100
scene_heading: 118 INT. OLYMPIA THEATRE, DUBLIN - NIGHT 118
text: HARDY and then LAUREL walk on together to a storm of clapping
text: and cheering; they wait patiently for it to die down.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen we hope you've
dialog: enjoyed our bit of fun tonight,
dialog: we've sure enjoyed ourselves
dialog: haven't we Stanley?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: We certainly have.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We'll never forget the warm welcome
dialog: we've received here in Dublin.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Not just Dublin, but the whole of
dialog: Scotland.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: Dublin isn’t in Scotland.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: I was wondering why we got on that
dialog: boat.
text: (realising, whispering to
speaker_heading: HARDY)
dialog: We must be in Ireland.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: We must be in Ireland!
text: Another burst of applause.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: We'd like to finish tonight with a
dialog: little dance...
text: HARDY and LAUREL share a look.
speaker_heading: HARDY
dialog: From our film ‘Way Out West’.
dialog: Maestro... Stanley.
text: Then, just as LUCILLE looks like she’s about to pass out with
text: worry, she feels IDA’S hand reaching for hers. She’s shocked.
text: She turns to her, and IDA smiles. LUCILLE smiles back, and
text: squeezes IDA’S hand warmly, grateful that she’s there to
text: support her at this moment. They both turn back to the stage,
text: still holding hands.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 31.03.17 100aaA
text: On stage HARDY, in that very proper way of his, extends a
text: hand which is taken by LAUREL - and now they are also holding
text: hands. They bow to the audience then wait for the music cue.
scene_heading: Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 24.03.17 100aAa
text: As the orchestra starts ‘At The Ball, That’s All’, the BOYS
text: tap their feet, then begin their dance routine once again -
text: and we are transported back to the magic of ‘Way Out West’.
text: In spite of HARDY’S physical problems and illness, his light
text: footedness is as exquisite as ever. And although both men are
text: now looking old, their grace and elegance defies their years.
text: LAUREL matches HARDY every step of the way, the two dancing
text: together like the loving couple they most surely are.
text: We finish behind LAUREL and HARDY, silhouetted against the
text: lights, looking out at the audience. As they come together
dialog: and hold each other’s hands, we FREEZE...
