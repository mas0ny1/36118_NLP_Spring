dialog: She would say things like: “Isn't
dialog: every story a story of betrayal?”
dialog: No, that’s not true, I thought.
dialog: But I could never say that, I could
dialog: only agree with her. It was too
text: much fun to agree with her.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM. DAY
text: A dark room. We hear movement from outside. A key in the
text: lock. The door opens, light from the hallway silhouettes

dialog: ..-Right a TRACKING DEVICE for
dialog: Tracy and a...LIGHTER for me,
dialog: Laura.
text: She passes the flashlight.

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Aren’t you coming to convocation?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You're going to that shit?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah... isn’t everyone?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t think anyone is going.
dialog: Except rapists.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What? Why rapists?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Or Christians and home-schooled
dialog: kids. Nobody really goes.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I think it’s just a candle lighting

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS/INT. JERSEY HOUSE. NIGHT INTERCUT
text: Tracy sits on steps. She’s on the phone with her Mom.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I could be anywhere. It doesn’t
dialog: even feel like New York. And by
dialog: trying to participate I’m somehow
text: fitting in even less.
text: Her Mom moves through the kitchen, cleaning, putting things
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Aren’t you meeting friends in
dialog: classes?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Mom, nobody meets friends in
dialog: classes.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, okay. I didn’t know.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You know the feeling of being at a
dialog: party where you don’t know anybody?
dialog: It’s like that the whole time.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That sounds uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: And I can’t go to bars.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Don’t go to bars. Oh, did you get
dialog: my email with the reading - do you
dialog: like it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I liked it. I think there is a
dialog: darker element to what Shakespeare
dialog: was saying but I liked it.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Good. Your brother is going to be
dialog: playing guitar with you while you
dialog: do it - is that okay?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I like David’s guitar playing.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (happily)
dialog: He’s gotten good, right? I’m so

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: She's going to make a fig and
dialog: there’s a fish...and it’s on
dialog: cracker. That’s one thing.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: We're going to move all the
text: furniture out of the living room
dialog: and we changed the lyrics to
dialog: Finiculi Finicula. We did the same
dialog: thing at Izzy’s 60th but Izzy won't
dialog: be there so it’1l feel fresh.
dialog: (exhaling, playful)
dialog: Oh, Trace...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (playful back)
dialog: Oh, Stevie.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You know, I was very unhappy for a
dialog: very long time. But I’m so glad
dialog: your Dad and I stayed together
dialog: until you and your brother were out
dialog: of school.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I was NOT out of school. You broke
dialog: up when I was a junior in high
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: On your way out of the home...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I love you Mom, don’t be worried.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I know, honey. So after you do
dialog: that, Brooke will read a poem she’s
dialog: written. I don’t think her brother
dialog: is doing anything - which hurts my
dialog: feelings, but I’m trying to be okay
dialog: with it.
dialog: (has an idea)
dialog: You should call Brooke. She’s in
dialog: New York, you know.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m so bad at calling people I
dialog: don’t know.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I hear she’s fun.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: She's like thirty living in New
dialog: York with a life, she doesn’t need
dialog: to hear from an eighteen year old
dialog: she’s tenuously connected to. I'd
dialog: be like why do I want to hang out
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: She's going to be your sister, that
dialog: doesn’t sound tenuous to me. And
dialog: you have plenty to talk about -
dialog: you're both doing readings at our
dialog: wedding.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Aces.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You aren’t sarcastic don’t pretend
dialog: to be.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
text: We hear a student, Nicolette, making a point:
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Nothing is higher than the law.
dialog: That’s the whole point - Antigone
dialog: thinks she’s above the law but
dialog: she’s not - like a celebrity ina
dialog: car crash or something.
text: Tracy is asleep at the seminar table. Her head hangs heavily
text: to one side.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Psst. Hey.
text: Tracy's head jerks up and she opens her sleepy eyes. A boy,

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You were asleep.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (wiping drool from her
dialog: chin)
dialog: Oh...thanks.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. AFTER CLASS
text: Tony carries a briefcase. Tracy, deciding to make her fate
text: better, walks up to him.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That was really nice of you...

speaker_heading: TONY

dialog: It takes a lot of moxie to fall

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Thanks. I like moxie.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I get it. It’s like I’m so
dialog: grateful to be here, but why are my

dialog: listen to that 18-year-old asshole
dialog: talk?
text: Tracy laughs.
speaker_heading: TRACY
text: Loans everywhere.
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Um, it’s embarrassing.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m submitting a story to the
dialog: Mobius Literary Society. I have to
dialog: print it.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: TRACY (CONT'D)
dialog: They only take hard copies which is
dialog: a kind of pretension I can get
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: GET OUT OF TOWN SISTER! I already
dialog: gave mine! Do you know how you
dialog: find out if you’re in it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: They said they’d post a list -
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No. The only people who check the
dialog: list are people who didn’t get in -
dialog: they come wake us up at night in
dialog: our rooms and put pie in our face
dialog: and then bring us out into the quad
dialog: and make us sing and stuff.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (smiling at the thought)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. SOME HALLWAY. DAY
text: Tracy walks down to a door with Mobius on the glass. There’s

text: puts a story in the box. She hurries away.
scene_heading: INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. NIGHT
text: Tracy lies awake in bed. We hear yelling in the hallway

text: The footsteps and chatter continue down the hall.
text: Tracy gets up and opens her door.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: The hall is empty. Bits of pie and crust on the floor.
text: Another door opens at the end of the hall. A Tiny Girl looks

text: She and Tracy meet eyes.
speaker_heading: TINY GIRL
speaker_heading: FUCK.
text: The Tiny Girl retreats into her room. Tracy does the same.
scene_heading: INT. TONY’S ROOM. DAY
text: Tony sits on his bed and Tracy sits on the floor.
text: drink screwdrivers.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: They’re self-elected douche bags.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I know, but I wanted to be one of
dialog: them. I could die then.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah, me too. Both I wanted to be
dialog: in and I could also then die.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I heard they serve wine and cheese
text: and they all carry breifcases.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know, when I had my tour here,
dialog: the guide was one of them and
dialog: that’s why I wanted to come here.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I heard the pie stuff all night.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: They got the guy next door. He
text: doesn’t even look like a writer.
dialog: 10.
dialog: They both
text: Tony indicates a breifcase from the floor. Tracy sees this.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do you want to trade stories?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT

speaker_heading: TIME CUT
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I liked it!
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Thanks - I liked yours too.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So do you want notes?
speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s just my impression.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I‘’1l work on that.
speaker_heading: TONY

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
text: Tracy raises her hand.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I think the way Aristotle writes
dialog: about ethics and morality is much
dialog: closer to how most people think
dialog: about it. Less like math, more
text: like a story.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM. DAY
text: Tracy, feeling better about herself, cleans the room and
text: talks to her roommate.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I think we should set up a
dialog: recycling system for our trash. A
dialog: lot of what we’re throwing out can
dialog: be recycled.
text: She trips over something on the floor but recovers quickly.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: And Ruth, I think that fan can go

scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE. NIGHT
text: Tracy crosses the crowded street.
text: Brooke is at the top of the TKTS steps. She attempts to walk
text: elegantly down the steps. It’s an entrance.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (awkwardly grand)
dialog: Welcome to the Great White Way.
text: She still hasn’t finished walking the steps. It takes a

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Times Square is so crazy.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Isn't it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I don’t know anyone who lives here.
speaker_heading: BROOKE

dialog: actually. But there are boys in my
dialog: classes and stuff. From Columbia.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You gay?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No. The Columbia girls do their
dialog: best to make us feel inferior.
dialog: Which it’s like “I already do.”
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That’s stupid. Don’t feel
dialog: inferior.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You're right, that is stupid.

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: She took this T-shirt idea that I
dialog: had, started a company fucking sold
dialog: it to J. Crew so there is that.
dialog: She’s one of those people who

dialog: own life so she just steals all of

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What are you selling?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: So many things. I don’t tweet all

dialog: Would you sing them in a higher
dialog: pitch?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No, it wouldn’t be about - it’s
dialog: about principles, those kinds of
dialog: high standards - like one of those
dialog: “string of pearls that’s why I’ma
dialog: single gal” kind of show.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That’s clever.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: The second idea is a television
dialog: show, which I’ve read is the new
text: novel, about a woman who is a
text: government worker by day and a self-
dialog: invented super hero by night, but
text: like the essence of AMERICA. It’1l
dialog: be it’s own mythology. I think
dialog: maybe it’1ll be called Mistress
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That sounds like she’s America’s
text: girl on the side.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Hey, I don’t know, okay, I’m not
dialog: positive, these are just some
dialog: ideas.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Me too! I’m sorry, I don’t know
dialog: anything, I was just throwing
dialog: something out there.
dialog: 21.
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (an idea)
dialog: We need a sleep-over party.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Books piled on the floor. Lots of drawings pinned to the
text: wall. One framed piece of real art.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: This apartment is technically zoned
dialog: commercial but that’s fake.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s so stylish.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Fuck, I know, I freelance as an
dialog: interior decorator. You know the
dialog: Bowery Hotel?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh my God, yeah.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Well, if you walk about a block
dialog: south. There’s a laser hair
dialog: removal center that’s very hip. I
dialog: did the waiting room.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’m leaving here in January anyway,
dialog: moving to the East side if you can
dialog: believe it. That’s where Stavros
dialog: lives. I’m going to redo his place
dialog: too.
text: Brooke flops on her bed. Tracy lies on the couch.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I want to write short stories.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh, me too! Not short stories,
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: But I got rejected by the Lit
dialog: Society. I’m so suggestible, like
dialog: because I got rejected I think I
dialog: can’t be a writer.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Why don’t you make your own Lit
dialog: Society?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I wish. Mobius is a big deal at
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You've got other stories.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Maybe I’1l write something else and
dialog: resubmit.
dialog: (falling asleep, eyes
dialog: closed)
dialog: That was really funny when we were
dialog: doctors.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah, I need to cut all the
dialog: negative people out of my life. I
dialog: just wasn’t brought up that way.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Thank you Brooke.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You’re welcome Baby Tracy.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. NEXT MORNING
text: Brooke is on the phone with Stavros:
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: My sweetheart I miss you so much -
dialog: I can’t wait for you to see the
dialog: chairs I’ve picked out - we start
dialog: renovation Monday! It’s so
dialog: exciting. I’ve been going there
dialog: just to sit in the mess I love it
dialog: so much.
text: Tracy wakes up a little with the noise.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Right. Did you see the lease it
dialog: was 400 pages! I wish you would
dialog: just come home already so I can
dialog: suck your dick in our new
dialog: restaurant!
text: She pads into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (to Tracy)
dialog: Can you start the coffee, please?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (looking at the coffee
dialog: maker)
dialog: I don’t know how...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (a little sharply)
dialog: Yes, you do. Don’t be incompetent.
dialog: If you spent two seconds with a
dialog: coffee maker you'd figure it out.
dialog: You just aren’t trying hard enough.
text: Brooke retreats into the hall, still talking to her
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Um, where are you going.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: DUH COMMUNAL BATHROOM DO YOU WANT
dialog: TO WATCH?
dialog: (to the phone)
dialog: Are you still there?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sorry. Are you... mad at me?
speaker_heading: BROOKE (0.S.)
dialog: NO!
text: CUT TO: Tracy and Brooke drink coffee at her table/desk.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: We have four investors including
dialog: me. I’m what you call a principal
dialog: investor. Stavros is putting in my
dialog: share - but I insisted that it be
dialog: my assets on the line because I
dialog: want him to know I have skin in the
dialog: game. I’11 pay him back of course
dialog: once we start making a profit.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: We never went to restaurants
dialog: growing up - it wasn’t part of our
dialog: lives.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (immediately offended)
dialog: That’s a shitty thing to say to me.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I didn’t mean - I know people will
dialog: come to yours.
dialog: (trying to contextualize)
dialog: It’s so weird to think that every
dialog: restaurant I see is the result of
dialog: some person going “I think I want
dialog: to start a restaurant.”
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That’s not weird. That’s
dialog: everything.
text: Tracy starts to write something down in a notebook. Brooke
dialog: is curious:
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m actually... it’s embarrassing.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m writing down what I said.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You are noting yourself?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah... I guess so.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’ve noticed something about myself
dialog: that would make a good character in
dialog: a story.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: But I’m going to save it in case I
dialog: want to use it in something I
dialog: write.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE. MORNING
dialog: The commercial streets have that peculiar weekend morning
text: vibe. Tracy is in her outfit from the night before. Brooke
text: is in full workout clothes.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: High five, sister. That was an
text: AMAZING night.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah, it was...
dialog: (blurts it out)
dialog: The best of my life.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (looking at her phone)
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Brooke abruptly hugs her and leaves. Tracy watches her go
text: for one second and then also turns to go. She’s disappointed
text: but she doesn’t know why.
scene_heading: INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. MORNING
text: Tracy enters and goes right to her computer.
text: Tracy is typing very quickly, still in her jacket, her bag
text: still on her shoulder.
text: She hesitates, trying to remember something.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What did she...say?
text: Talking while she types.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Right! “He’s one of those people
dialog: that I hate except I’m in love with
dialog: him.”
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (still sleeping)
dialog: Shut up please.
text: CUT TO: Brooke Cardinas being typed into a Google search.

dialog: young woman should live who wants
dialog: to spend her youth well.
text: CUT TO: Brooke’s Twitter page.
dialog: Random photos of Brooke.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: She did everything and nothing and
dialog: spent time like I always mean to -
text: purposefully.
text: CLOSE on Tracy’s short story.
text: CLOSE on a Society page photo.
text: CLOSE on Brooke’s Soul Cycle Teacher bio.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. PIZZA PARLOR. NIGHT
text: Tracy tries to go to the secret bar, can’t get in.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: Her beauty was that rare kind that
dialog: made you want to look more like
dialog: yourself not like her.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MUSIC CLUB. NIGHT
text: Tracy gets in, but it’s not a good band and there aren’t a
dialog: lot of people there.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: She sang with the band and knew
dialog: everyone and didn't owe anyone
dialog: anything and couldn't pay up even
dialog: if she did.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET. NIGHT
text: Tracy sees a blonde in red pants. She brightens. As she
text: gets closer, it’s not Brooke.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: Being around Meadow was like being
dialog: in New York City - it made you want
dialog: to find life, not hide from it.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: WOMAN IN RED PANTS
dialog: That’s OK.
scene_heading: INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY. DAY
text: Tony and Nicolette and Tracy sit at a study table.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Where were you last night, did you
dialog: get my texts?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: You text her? You texted her?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: About work.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I went to check out this downtown
dialog: band at this downtown bar.
text: Two freshmen girls approach.
speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: Do you guys know how long you’1l
dialog: need this table?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: A long time, dude.
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Fine.
text: They leave.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who were you with?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Myself.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (to Tony)
dialog: When you said you were checking the
dialog: scores, were you texting her? Are
dialog: you sexting?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s a place my sister showed me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You don’t have a sister.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I do. Or I will. When my mom gets
text: married at Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Why don’t you just text her a
dialog: picture of your balls.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nicolette!
text: Tracy smooths over some stapled pages from her bag. We see
dialog: the title: Mistress America.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It's a new story I wrote. I’m
dialog: going to resubmit to the Lit
dialog: Society.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Wait, you wrote another one
dialog: already? You printed it on onion
dialog: skin?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You can read it if you want. Here--
text: She hands him a copy - he looks at it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (to Nicolette)
dialog: Tracy writes about fighter pilots.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m past that stuff now. This one
dialog: is more autobiographical
dialog: documentary.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: OK. I'd totally give you notes.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, I don’t want notes -- but I
dialog: thought about it and I actually do
dialog: have notes for you.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh...sure.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You write like you are imitating
dialog: someone who is free and wild and it
dialog: is so WEIRD because you aren’t at
dialog: all and it made me uncomfortable
dialog: and I think it would make EVERYONE
dialog: uncomfortable. And also, stop
dialog: trying to be funny because you
dialog: aren’t funny so it just adds to the
dialog: awkwardness. And it could be 30%
dialog: shorter, easy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: OK. Thanks.
text: Tracy gets up and leaves. Passes the freshmen girls.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s open, bitches. They don’t
dialog: need it anymore.
scene_heading: INT. SOME HALLWAY. DAY
text: Tracy returns to the door with Mobius on the glass. The same
text: guy in a sweater vest is whittling a piece of wood. He blows
text: on it as he whittles. Tracy places her story in the
text: Submissions box. She hurries away.
scene_heading: INT. SOUL CYCLE STUDIO. DAY
text: Brooke is in the front of the classroom, on a bike with a
text: headphone and a bandana.
text: Tracy enters, wearing jeans and a button down. Brooke
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (too loudly)
dialog: Hey Baby Tracy!
text: Brooke indicates a bike with a nod of her head. Tracy shakes

text: CUT TO: Tracy is on a bike sweating an uncomfortable amount.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (to her cycling class)
dialog: HOW YOU DO ANYTHING IS HOW YOU DO
dialog: EVERYTHING AM I RIGHT?!
dialog: (and now in a low voice)
dialog: I know not enough people have told
dialog: you that you’re amazing. I know
dialog: that that’s true.
dialog: 30.
dialog: Everyone loves her, she’s sort of great as a cycling
dialog: instructor.
scene_heading: INT. CYCLING STUDIO. AFTERWARDS
text: Tracy is really sweaty, still.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You did great!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I feel like I just went swimming in
dialog: my clothes.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’m glad you came.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You are?!
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Shit, I have to shower and change,
dialog: I’m late for an appointment.
scene_heading: INT. SALON. DAY
text: Brooke gets her hair blown out - Tracy sits beside her and
text: looks at Brooke in the mirror.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: This air conditioning is making me
dialog: freezing.
scene_heading: EXT. MIDTOWN STREET. DAY
text: Brooke, in a conservative blouse and suit, pearl earrings,
text: heels, holding a briefcase walks with Tracy in her jeans.
text: She towers over her. (Midnight Cowboy shot.)
scene_heading: EXT/INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY
text: They stop outside the restaurant. Brooke is suddenly very
text: nervous. She smooths down her blouse, her hair.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: (pulling down the sides of
dialog: her skirt)
dialog: God, I’m packed into this pencil
dialog: skirt. How do I look?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You look beautiful.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: But do I look professional?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I get really nervous with the
dialog: investors. I’m usually fine with
dialog: wealthy people, it’s just when I
dialog: need something from them.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, it’s the opposite - they need
dialog: you and your restaurant.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Stavros usually does this stuff.
dialog: Maybe I shouldn’t do it. I’m not
dialog: good at it.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: I think you can do anything.
dialog: Everything.
text: Brooke nods.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Right. Kind and fearless.
text: She goes inside.
text: CUT TO: Tracy watches through the window. Brooke sits
text: amongst three men in suits and another powerful looking woman
text: in a suit. She makes them laugh.
text: CUT TO: Brooke meets Tracy outside. Brooke looks relieved.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s amazing how much of business
dialog: is just stating the same things
text: over and over again.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Your body language looked very self-
dialog: confident.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Thanks. You make me feel really...
dialog: Smart.
text: Tracy beams.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Wanna see it?
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY RESTAURANT SPACE, BROOKLYN. DAY
text: Brooke shows Tracy the space. During the scene, Brooke is
text: changing out of her “lawyer outfit” into her “tutoring
text: outfit” - skinny jeans, T-shirt and Converse.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: The front part would be like a shop
dialog: during the day - like a general
dialog: store or a really nice bodega -
dialog: candy from Europe - on Monday we
dialog: start demo and we open in April.
text: She knocks her head for “wood.” She leads Tracy through the
dialog: back -
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: We'd also have cooking classes.
dialog: Maybe cut hair. It would be like a
dialog: community center and restaurant and
dialog: store all in one. It would be the
dialog: place that you would, like, LOVE to
dialog: be. I wish I had something like
dialog: this when I was growing up.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah, suburban New Jersey isn’t
dialog: great with this kind of stuff.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Each plate would be different. Let
dialog: me show you.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Can I be a waitress here?
text: Brooke opens a box.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: See! Look at all these plates!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (taking in the whole
dialog: thing)
dialog: Holy shit you have a lot of plates.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I started collecting them so long
dialog: ago - I didn’t know why and now I
dialog: have a why!
text: Tracy's been touching all of them.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: This is going to be a great
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I know!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Are you going to cook, too?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: I‘1l help create the menu and pitch
dialog: in when needed. I’m not trained,
dialog: but I’m an enthusiastic home cook.
dialog: I always used to cook with my Mom.
dialog: That’s the name of the restaurant.
dialog: Mom's. Possessive.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (trying it out)
dialog: “Let’s go to Mom’s for dinner.”
dialog: Yeah, it totally works.
dialog: (tries again)
dialog: Can I be a waitress here?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I want the whole deal - I want the
dialog: dead-on-my-feet-wake-up-and-I 'm-
dialog: forty. I’ve spent my whole life
text: chasing after things and knocking
dialog: at doors and I’m tired of running
dialog: towards people. I want to be the
dialog: place that people COME to. I want
dialog: to make a home for all the knockers
dialog: and runners - I’m good at that.
dialog: I'm happy with that. I keep the
dialog: hearth. That’s a word, right?
dialog: Hearth?
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT. LATER
text: Brooke is going in to tutor. The final thing she does is put
text: on her fake glasses.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Don’t I look like a cute smart
dialog: graduate student?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I tutor junior high because I
dialog: didn’t get high enough SAT scores
dialog: to do SAT tutoring, but you make
dialog: way more money doing SAT. So, I’m
dialog: taking the SAT’s AGAIN so I can
dialog: make inroads into that racket.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’ve always been a good test taker.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: None of this will be necessary when
text: the restaurant is up and running,
dialog: but I’m good that way, curating my
dialog: employment.
text: Brooke is rifling through her purse.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: So, um, should I - just wait here
dialog: or...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh! I thought you had to go back
dialog: to school.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Right. I should....
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Do you want to stay?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I mean, if you don’t mind...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah, I’d invite you in but Peggy's
dialog: Mom just got institutionalized for
dialog: bi-polar disorder and shit’s pretty
dialog: real upstairs. Tutoring is like
dialog: 60% middle school math and 40% I
dialog: know too much about them.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That’s okay, then, I’1ll just go -
text: Brooke hands her keys, not listening to her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You remember where my apartment is,
dialog: go there.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: And pick up some pasta, I’11 cook.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What kind of--
text: But Brooke is ringing the bell.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY. DAY
text: Tracy excitedly looks at the keys in her hand, smiles.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: (into answering machine)
dialog: Mom - hey - are you there? SHIT.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE. DAY
text: Tracy stands in the pasta aisle, looking at all the different
text: brands of pastas. She picks one up and then another. She’s
text: on the phone.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (leaving message)
dialog: I just wanted to know - what kind
dialog: of pasta would you buy if you
dialog: wanted to buy a nice pasta? - Like
dialog: the brand? If you get this can you
dialog: call me back right away?
text: She hangs ups.
text: CUT TO: Tracy is on the phone with Tony, scanning the brands.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: This one is like bowties? Get
dialog: that?
text: CUT TO: Tony and Nicolette together in his bed. Nicolette is
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Do they have regular spaghetti?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Is that pasta the same way as the
dialog: others?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (to Tony)
dialog: Is this some sex game?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (covering the phone)
dialog: No! We're actually talking about
dialog: pasta.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (sullen)
dialog: Why don’t you just put pasta up her
dialog: pussy?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nicolette! Seriously!
text: CUT TO: Tracy still in the store.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’1l get that and I'll get the

text: Brooke is sitting with a thirteen year old girl, working on a
dialog: set of pre-algebra problems.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: X can be anything, any number, that
dialog: is what’s CRAZY about X.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Then why isn’t it just a number.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Because X doesn’t roll like that,
dialog: because X can’t be pinned down! It
dialog: can be ANYTHING and we have to
dialog: figure out what it is - crazy
dialog: bastard.
text: Peggy giggles and starts writing.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Maybe you could spend the night?
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh, honey, I’m sorry. I’m math
dialog: only.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON
text: Tracy unpacks an enormous amount of pasta onto the counter.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.0O.)
dialog: I remembered looking across the
text: river at the unblinking lights of
dialog: Manhattan apartments, wondering who
dialog: lived there.
text: She touches items, looks at things, takes notes. Takes a
text: tiny airplane and puts it in her pocket. Flips through some
dialog: SAT prep books.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: I was part of it now, on the fifth
text: floor, in a temporary commercial
dialog: apartment. There was our castle.
dialog: Our fortress. Yes! This is how I
dialog: imagined it would be: college, New
dialog: York, my whole entire life.
text: Brooke cooks while Tracy watches her and hands her things.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.0O.)
dialog: But outside the windows I could
text: hear the hot sound of jackhammers
text: taking the city apart.
text: Brooke and Tracy eat spaghetti carbonara.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: In New York neighborhoods change as
text: quickly as the weather.
dialog: Or maybe it’s the other way around.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE. NIGHT
text: Tracy and Brooke walk together arm and arm.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: But I couldn’t warn Meadow. By the
dialog: time I noticed it, it was already
dialog: too late.
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. NIGHT
text: It’s a bar bar, they’re there to get drunk. Or at least
text: Brooke is. Brooke looks at something on her phone. Laughs.
text: Holds it out for Tracy.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: Nate dropped a gram on Instagram.
dialog: That means a picture.
text: Tracy smiles but less assuredly.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s you guys kissing.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s already got eighty likes. All
dialog: his other recent pictures have like
dialog: fifty likes. The extra thirty must
dialog: be because of me.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It looks like a really stylish
text: breathmint ad.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I know! Bob’s a real shutterbug.
dialog: He made his own app.
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Put it on...
dialog: (very considered)
dialog: ...this card.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Did these two drinks earn me
dialog: another free hot dog?
text: The Bartender nods, hands her a hotdog.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (ve: the drinks)
text: Drop it in the glass and chug it.
dialog: I'd love to get into the app
dialog: business. I think my Dad met your
dialog: Mom on the internet.
speaker_heading: TRACY
text: Yeah, on a free dating website.
dialog: They didn’t even pay.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Gross. But also I guess it’s pro
dialog: forma now?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BROOKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Tracy nods)
dialog: My Dad’s so strange. I’m sure he’s
dialog: making her convert to Catholicism,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah! What’s that about?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: He’s real Catholic now. It’s so
dialog: boring, but it happened when my mom
dialog: got sick. She was never that into
dialog: it. He’s a geologist.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I know. I had never met a
dialog: geologist before.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s weird that someone who studies
dialog: rocks can be really into Jesus.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What did your Mom do?
speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That’s so nice.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: She was really good at it. I still

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Holy SHIT! Yeah! What are you
dialog: doing in the city? You live here?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, I’m in Tenafly. My fiance and
dialog: I went to go see a show.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Other Desert Cities.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh, that’s a piece of shit. And
text: the girl who replaced the lead is
speaker_heading: AWFUL.
dialog: (to Tracy)
dialog: I used to run around with her.
dialog: Well, she was older, is older.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We loved it.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Let me buy you guys a drink what
dialog: are you drinking?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You know, that’s okay -
dialog: (gathering herself)
dialog: I just wanted to tell you because I
dialog: never had the courage to do it when
dialog: I was actually in high school - you
dialog: really hurt my feelings.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You don’t remember?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No! What did I do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That thing: “yep, bitter”?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (still genial)
dialog: I don’t know what the FUCK you’re
dialog: talking about! I always liked you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You and your friend Abe -
speaker_heading: BROOKE
speaker_heading: ABE!
text: Tracy horks her hot dog.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You guys used to do this thing
dialog: where you’d walk up to me and touch
dialog: my skin and then like taste it and
dialog: think for a minute and then say
text: “yep, bitter.” And then laugh.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Right! We did do that, didn’t we?
dialog: We were weird.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was standing right there, every
dialog: single time you did it. It was
dialog: really mean, and I just wanted to
dialog: say - fuck you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Whoa. WHOA.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The way you treated me really
dialog: messed me up for a long time.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Everyone is an asshole in high
dialog: school!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You made a lot of people feel bad.
dialog: Not just me.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I feel sorry for the thirteen year
dialog: old girl that was you but I’m not
dialog: sorry for you now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We were seventeen.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: If I was thirteen I'd apologize to
dialog: you but seeing as both of us
dialog: are...in our twenties. I don’t see
dialog: the need.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I just turned thirty.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Happy birthday.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You’re welcome.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're a bitch.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Why?! You’re the one who hung onto
dialog: a grudge for this fucking long! Do
dialog: you know I didn’t even recognize
dialog: you? I don’t say that to be mean,
dialog: that’s the way it should be.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: You are the same. Malevolent.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You WERE bitter. That’s probably
dialog: why it hurt you so much. Because
dialog: it was true.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (now crying)
dialog: I wish all bad things on you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: I don’t on you because I don’t
dialog: CARE! And neither should you!

dialog: not enough.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That’s so dramatic! What a drama
dialog: queen.
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: I can’t believe she lives in
dialog: fucking Tenafly. What is she rich
dialog: now? How dare she talk to me that
dialog: way and be rich?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: When I was in junior high, this
dialog: girl Tara Podwoski used to pull my
dialog: hair and call me a cunt hunter.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I didn’t do what that girl said. I
dialog: just wasn’t brought up that way. I
dialog: should call Abe and see if he
dialog: remembers.
text: Brooke pulls out her phone.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Maybe do it later?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (nods, puts the phone
dialog: away )
dialog: Yeah. I was so popular in high
dialog: school but I didn’t try AT ALL.
dialog: People just wanted to be friends
dialog: with me. I didn’t even care about
dialog: that stuff. When someone told me I
dialog: was popular I was like “Really?
dialog: Weird.”
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That’s why you were popular. The
dialog: popular kids never care. I cared
dialog: too much. Like if you want to know
dialog: all the popular kids’ business, ask
dialog: an unpopular kid. They always know
dialog: everything. Because they are the
dialog: ones who really pay attention.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’m going to shorten that, punch it
text: up, and turn it into a tweet.
text: Tracy throws up. Brooke immediately holds her hair back and
text: comforts her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh no! Did I feed you too much
dialog: liquor?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’1l be okay.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: We should get you a cab.
speaker_heading: TRACY

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. LATER
text: Tracy leans against the door-jam while Brooke tries to open

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Damn it...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m kind of attractive.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Argh...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I might be up for another drink.
dialog: Is that crazy?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Fuck ME!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
speaker_heading: GOD DAMN IT.
speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: I FUCKING DON’T BELIEVE THIS SHIT

speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Hey, Kareem, can we use your fire
dialog: escape?
scene_heading: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. NIGHT
text: Brooke climbs up to her apartment window in bare-feet. Tracy
text: looks up from below, holding Brooke’s shoes.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Shit. I thought I left this window
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I might have closed it.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Why?!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I didn’t want you to get robbed.
scene_heading: INT. KAREEM’S APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Tracy and Kareem sit on a couch waiting. Outside on the fire

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Stavros saw a picture of her
text: kissing a musician.
dialog: (pause)
text: Stavros is her boyfriend. He told
dialog: the super that Brooke was living in
dialog: a commercial space. Is your place
dialog: zoned commercial?
speaker_heading: KAREEM
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I hope he doesn’t rat on you.
text: They hear louder shouting from the fire escape. The window

speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: He’s pulling out of the restaurant.
scene_heading: INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. NIGHT

text: bed. Tracy’s roommate, Ruth, looks annoyed and impressed.
text: It’s dark.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I hope Stavros doesn’t rat out
dialog: Kareem.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: If I don’t have this money...my
dialog: partners will bail, they’re in
dialog: because Stavros was in. And they
dialog: can go after my savings,
dialog: everything... Rich people will
dialog: take any excuse not to spend money -
dialog: you can just see it in their eyes
dialog: that they don’t really want to
dialog: share life with you.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Rich people always give out bad
dialog: Halloween candy.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: The contractors need 20 thousand on
dialog: Monday. And then there’s the key
dialog: fee, that’s fifty - and then there
dialog: are all these industrial
text: refrigerators coming for another
dialog: fifteen... I need whatever that
dialog: equals by Monday. He was in for
dialog: 200 thousand. Oh my fucking god.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Isn’t there someone else you can
dialog: ask to invest?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I already hit up every rich person
dialog: I knew the first time around. This
dialog: was well thought through, Tracy.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I don’t know, it’s such a good
dialog: investment. I’d put money in if I
dialog: had it.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Do you secretly have money?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No. My mom never worked and I
dialog: think my Dad was always kind of mad
dialog: at her for that... but my parents
dialog: divorce was way easier than this.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (viciously)
dialog: That's because they stopped caring
dialog: about life just entirely, it’s not
dialog: the same thing. My Mom died so
dialog: don’t even fucking start with me
dialog: about your pain.
dialog: Ruth pipes up:
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My uncle died.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Shut up, RUTH.

speaker_heading: BROOKE

scene_heading: INT. WAITING AREA. NIGHT
text: Brooke and Tracy are waiting on a couch in an apartment.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’m going to be worse off now than
dialog: I was before I started trying to
dialog: achieve stuff.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I know what it is to want things.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No, you don’t. You can’t really
dialog: know what it is to want things
dialog: until you're at least thirty. And
dialog: then with each passing year it gets
dialog: more because the want is bigger and
dialog: the possibility is less. Like how
dialog: each passing year of your life
dialog: feels faster because it is a
dialog: smaller portion of your total life.
dialog: Like that but in reverse.
dialog: Everything becomes pure want.

speaker_heading: PSYCHIC (0.S.)

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: Someone who hurt you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Just tell me exactly what to do.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: Spirit says something about fabric.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: It’s your friend - Mamie-Claire?
dialog: The fabric is the T-shirts!
text: Brooke shoots Tracy a look.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: And, I see flowers.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hard looking flowers!
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Please, Tracy.

dialog: Mamie-Claire is my enemy.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: Yes, Spirit says you have
dialog: unfinished business with this
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No, no, it’s finished. Tell Spirit
dialog: it’s finished.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: What happened with Mamie-Claire?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: She totally screwed Brooke over.
dialog: She married her fiance and stole
dialog: her idea.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: TRACY! Shut up.
dialog: (to the Psychic)
dialog: I never looked back.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: I am seeing this, yes. I am
dialog: seeing... trees...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You said she lives in Connecticut!
text: There are trees in Connecticut.
text: The Psychic looks at Brooke for affirmation.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Well, to be fair, there are trees
dialog: pretty much everywhere.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You have to listen to Spirit!
dialog: Mamie-Claire can give you the
dialog: money! Hi-ho Greenwich!
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (to the Psychic)
dialog: Really? Can we get confirmation?
dialog: Is Spirit sure of this?
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: The young one is right.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (re: Tracy)
dialog: She’s not that young. Ten...ten to
dialog: twelve years younger, we are
dialog: contemporaries, okay?
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: You must seek out Mamie-Claire.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’m so annoyed with Spirit.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: The path isn’t against you it’s
dialog: just the path.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Right. I don’t want to be petty...
dialog: I just wasn’t brought up that way.
dialog: She's my nemesis, but she does owe
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: This has been a heavy weight on
dialog: you. Sometimes you have to go back
dialog: to go front.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Fuck this parade. I’m going to
dialog: Greenwich.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: We're going.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You ready for this, squirt? It’s
dialog: going to get ugly.
speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Great. How are we going to get

scene_heading: INT. TONY’S CAR. DAY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I really don’t like to leave
dialog: Manhattan.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (to Tony)
dialog: You're going to want to take the
dialog: Merrit Parkway.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I‘1l bet Dylan is still in love
dialog: with me. Marrying Mamie-Claire is
dialog: like buying a cashmere sweater from
dialog: Old Navy.
text: Tony looks confused.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Even if he’s not, this is a great
dialog: investment. And don’t forget she
dialog: still owes you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s win win. Because I’m sure he
dialog: still loves me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I’m not driving you to Connecticut
dialog: to break up a marriage. I should
dialog: be in my room reading Nichomachean
dialog: Ethics.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Calm down rich boy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m not rich.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yes you are you have a car.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, I’m not - my dad is a mechanic.
dialog: He and my uncle have a body shop.
dialog: I have this car because it was
dialog: something that he could give me.
speaker_heading: BROOKE

dialog: Sorry, I think I offended your

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: He’s not her boyfriend, he’s mine.”
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (to Nicolette)
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Because Tracy made Tony drive you.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: But why did you come?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: I... I had a bad experience with
dialog: adultery before. My last boyfriend
dialog: committed adultery while we were
dialog: together and I just don’t like to
dialog: let my boyfriends get too far.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: ADULTERY? Why the fuck does it
dialog: matter? You are all eighteen!
dialog: Where is this old-person morality
dialog: coming from? There is no
dialog: “cheating” when you’re eighteen.
dialog: You should all be touching each
dialog: other all the time.
text: CUT TO: Tracy zones out.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Do you ever get that feeling when
dialog: you are on a car trip that you
dialog: never want to get where you’re
dialog: going. That you never want it to
dialog: end.
text: Everyone is silent, thinking about it. Nicolette reaches out
text: to playfully touch Tony’s hair. Tony freaks.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nicolette! You SCARED THE FUCKING
dialog: SHIT OUT OF ME!
text: Nicolette sits back, pissed.
speaker_heading: TONY

dialog: goth housewife.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, he knew me, he chose her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Only because you let him. You have
dialog: to chase down the things you want.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I was just going to let it go.
speaker_heading: BROOKE

dialog: Sometimes I don’t know if you are a

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m just normal!

speaker_heading: BROOKE

text: the bottom, fixing her makeup.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: But the very things that had worked
dialog: so well for Meadow up until then
text: had started turning and fading.
dialog: She had no other skills, no other
dialog: way of dealing with the world. In
dialog: one instant her behaviors turned
dialog: from charming to borderline
text: hysteric. People could feel her
dialog: failure coming. She smelled of
text: something rotten. Her youth had
text: died and she was dragging around
text: the decaying carcass.
text: CUT TO: Entering Greenwich, Connecticut. The houses flying
dialog: by become bigger and bigger. More elegant. This is the
dialog: wealthy.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)

text: pallbearer.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m trying to find Mamie-Claire’s

dialog: last name?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I have a visual memory of it. It’s
dialog: kind of photographic.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh you’ve been here?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Well, I kind of stalked them once.
dialog: I was so pissed.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH, CT. DAY

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yep, this is it.
text: She starts to walk up to the house. Everyone follows her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh we're all going? Okay, we look
dialog: crazy, but maybe that’s good.

text: Wait. A man answers, forties.
speaker_heading: 40'S MAN
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Hi, yes, I was wondering - is Mamie-

speaker_heading: 40'S MAN
dialog: Wrong house.
speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE

speaker_heading: 40'S MAN

dialog: night?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t know Harold, watching
dialog: kiddie porn?
speaker_heading: 40'S MAN
dialog: NO! Listening to you and your
text: husband shouting and not sleeping.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: So sorry we interfered with your
dialog: kiddie-porn.
speaker_heading: 40'S MAN
dialog: I am a PEDIATRICIAN.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Obviously!
speaker_heading: 40'S MAN
dialog: Next time I hear decibel levels
dialog: like I did I’m calling the cops.
dialog: That is a promise.
text: He stalks off.
speaker_heading: 40'S MAN
dialog: (annoyed, to Brooke)
dialog: This is the house.
text: Brooke jumps out.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: What - what are you doing here?
dialog: Who are these people?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (presenting everyone one
dialog: by one)
dialog: Tracy's Mom is marrying my Dad.
text: Tony drove. Nicolette is jealous.
text: Then a lot of unnecessary hand shaking takes place.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hi, I’m Tracy.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I’m Mamie-Claire.
text: They shake.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Nicolette.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Mamie-Claire.
text: They shake.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Tony - and wait, no don’t tell me -
dialog: Mamie-Claire?
text: Mamie-Claire ignores the joke, turns back to Brooke.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I thought we weren’t speaking.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Right, I want to change that... And
dialog: I have something I really need to
dialog: talk to you and Dylan about...
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Dylan isn’t here.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: He volunteers at a retirement
dialog: community. I’m in the middle of...
dialog: (hesitates again)
dialog: It’s a thing we do. It’s like a
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That’s okay.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No... it’s not...
text: (getting flustered, then
dialog: clarifying firmly)
dialog: It’s not for you to say okay, it’s
dialog: for me to say okay.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: We'll wait in the car.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No, that’s weird.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
text: People wait in cars.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE

dialog: You and your... “posse” can hang
text: out in the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: Mamie-Claire leads them past pregnant and just-pregnant women
text: who discuss Faulkner’s “The Hamlet.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMAN #1
dialog: I think the way Faulkner uses
dialog: language is akin to the way the
dialog: modernist painters were using paint
dialog: - exploring the reality of words or
dialog: paint itself -
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMAN #2
dialog: Only Faulkner was interested in how
dialog: that happens while characters are
text: ACTUALLY trying to communicate, not
dialog: just drawing attention to the
dialog: constructedness of the novel.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Holy shit those pregnant women are
dialog: super-smart.
text: Everyone is impressed.
scene_heading: INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE'’S KITCHEN. DAY
text: Mamie-Claire puts down snacks for the “posse.”
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE

dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: This place is amazing.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Brooke frowns, looking around.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s really fucking nice.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Would it be OK if we sat in on your
dialog: discussion?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Yeah, I guess. This week’s book is
dialog: Faulkner's “The Hamlet.” Followed
dialog: by a kind of junky biography of
dialog: Derrida, but it’s fun.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Tight.
text: He and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire back into the living
dialog: room.
text: Tracy looks at a picture of Mamie-Claire on a boat, Brooke
text: leans down and whispers to her:
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Apparently, she got recruited by
dialog: Tufts for crew and went but then
dialog: NEVER did it. I mean, that’s the
dialog: kind of person she is, just sly and
dialog: shitty.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I would do that if I could. I
dialog: wasn’t good at sports.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah, I would too, but it wouldn’t
dialog: be like my CHARACTER. It would
dialog: just be something I did.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: When does that become the same
dialog: thing?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I don’t know!
text: CUT TO: Brooke and Tracy wait in the kitchen. They’ve eaten
text: all the snacks. They’re bored. Brooke looks at her phone.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I didn’t know you could change the
dialog: font setting - I hate Helvetica.
text: Mamie-Claire enters and places plates in the sink. Brooke
text: stands immediately.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You look amazing.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Why are all these kids with you?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: They aren't “kids.” If they’re
dialog: kids, we are.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (piping up, to Mamie-
dialog: Claire)
dialog: I’m an associate and her almost-
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I really need to talk to you...
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, how long do you think you'll
dialog: need with me, because -
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: How long will Dylan be “giving
dialog: back” at the old folks home? I’d
dialog: also like to talk to him.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: We're both very busy, I have an
dialog: appointment after this...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh, come on, Mamie-Claire, that’s
dialog: stupid, you aren’t REALLY busy.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Yes! I am!
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (to Tracy)
dialog: Remember this truth: It’s only
dialog: people who don’t have jobs and
dialog: don’t have anything to do that are
dialog: always fucking BUSY. Like what are
dialog: you DOING?!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: We started a community farm. We
dialog: have goats.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (wandering in)
dialog: Goats are more sustainable.
dialog: They’re smaller.
text: Tony behind her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Than what?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Cows.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMAN #2
text: (pokes her head into the
dialog: kitchen)
dialog: Um, Mamie-Claire?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me, I have to see my guests
dialog: out.
dialog: 60.
text: Tony and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire to the kitchen door:
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I want to say goodbye to Karen.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Do you have a crush on Karen now?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She’s seven months pregnant!
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Why do you know that?
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Nicolette and Tony are looking at a chess set.
text: women are leaving. Mamie-Claire is seeing her
dialog: Pregnant
text: guests out.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (to Mamie-Claire)
dialog: Mamie-Claire, can me and Nicolette
dialog: play with your chess set?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (confused by who he even
dialog: is)
dialog: Yes.
text: A pregnant woman sits by the door with her bag in her lap.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Everything OK, Karen?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yes, I’m just waiting for my
dialog: husband. He’s late to pick me up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You want to play chess with us?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (to Tony, wanting
dialog: attention)
dialog: You have to teach me.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, he’ll be here any minute.
text: She checks her phone. Clearly nothing.
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Mamie-Claire comes back into the kitchen cleaning up.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Sorry, I got started on the wrong
dialog: foot there - I meant to say, I’ve
dialog: been missing you as a friend and...
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: She has a very exciting business
dialog: opportunity for you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: And I wanted to bring it to you and
text: Dylan as a peace offering.
dialog: I really think you’re going to want
dialog: to hear about this...
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: The last time I saw you you were
dialog: hiding in the bushes and then you
dialog: started incoherently yelling at me
dialog: and my husband about how we had
dialog: ruined your life and the time
dialog: before that you were throwing up at
dialog: my wedding.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Which is why I am bringing you this
dialog: exciting business opportunity!
text: Mamie-Claire goes into the dining room. Tracy nods at her,
text: like “keep going!” They follow Mamie-Claire.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I would like to offer you a share
dialog: in a restaurant I’m starting.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Because it is all set up and ready
dialog: to go and I already have the
dialog: ability to draw a crowd and it'll
dialog: just be... perfect. You'll love
dialog: it. So will Dylan.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: There are lots of other investors.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: But not so many that it would
dialog: dilute your investment.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: So why are you here?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Well, there was a slight snafu with
dialog: one of our people which allowed a
dialog: very coveted spot to open up, which
dialog: I am offering only to you guys...
dialog: Mamie-Claire considers.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: It’s not really a good time for me
dialog: to get involved with a business...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: We're trying to have a baby...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You'll never regret it.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Thanks, Karen.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s just money, you don’t have to
dialog: do any of the work, you just get
dialog: the glory and the profit and the
dialog: satisfaction of being involved with
dialog: something awesome.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t think Dylan would buy into
dialog: it. We recently lost money
text: purchasing taxi cab medallions.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I don’t want to overstep my bounds
dialog: here but I think you might be wrong
dialog: - when is he coming back?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I really need to focus on having
dialog: children - this isn’t part of what
dialog: I need to focus on. No, just...
dialog: Can I just say no?
text: Brooke gets furious.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No, you cannot “just say no.” Why
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t need a why.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: The money means NOTHING to you!
dialog: Look at all this shit, this house
dialog: that patio furniture. You can
dialog: spare it, you wouldn’t even miss
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: And it really would make a profit!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No. You can’t make me.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yes, I can because you OWE me.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (trying to stop her)
dialog: Um, Brooke...
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (evenly)
dialog: I don’t owe you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: For Dylan because that was just
dialog: skanky but really for the T-shirts -
dialog: you stole my T-shirt idea and you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I did not steal your idea. It was
dialog: my idea and you were there when I
dialog: had it.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No! That’s so wrong - I remember
dialog: like the minute I said “what if
dialog: this flower was, like, TOUGH.” And
dialog: then we started riffing but I SAID
text: IT FIRST.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: No, you didn’t.
text: Brooke screams.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You are so annoying when you get
dialog: calm voice!
text: Brooke storms off into the backyard. Stops short when she
text: sees two cats.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Are these my fucking cats?!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: They're mine. I paid for their cat
dialog: surgery so they’re mine.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Did my cats die and you didn’t tell
dialog: me? Are these replacement cats?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No! They are the same goddamn
dialog: cats!
text: Brooke stares at the cats hard and then stomps outside.
text: Tracy wants to go after her but follows Mamie-Claire into the
dialog: living room.
text: Tony and Nicolette play chess. The pregnant woman still sits
text: by the door checking her phone periodically. Tony thinks
text: hard before a move. He moves his rook--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If you do that, your knight is
dialog: vulnerable.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What? Oh...thanks.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: You took your finger off it, you
dialog: made the move.
text: Mamie-Claire enters. Tracy behind her.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: “I took my finger off it?” Who am
dialog: I playing here Deep Blue?
text: He looks at Karen for a laugh. Doesn’t get it.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Karen, come inside, have a glass of
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh, no, I’m fine. He’1l be here.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (indignant to Mamie-
dialog: Claire)
dialog: So you deny it? That you profited
dialog: from her idea that you stole?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No, I don’t deny it. She’s right.
dialog: The T-shirts were her idea.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Then why did you just say that?!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I like making her mad. It’s so
dialog: easy.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You took her idea. That’s not
dialog: just, Mamie-Claire.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No, I tried to include her. I set
dialog: up a meeting with people and she
dialog: never showed up. And then she
dialog: stopped speaking to me when me and
dialog: Dylan got married so I figured I
dialog: could just go do it.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: So it’s her fault.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: No... She is right that I stole a
dialog: lot of her life ideas. I really am
dialog: not as creative as she is. But she
dialog: never would have used them. She
dialog: has no follow through.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: So it’s... no one’s fault.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Obviously. That’s always true.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You know the restaurant is going to
dialog: be really great. She’s following
dialog: through with that. If she’s
dialog: allowed to.
text: Tracy leaves to go find Brooke. At the chess table:
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Wait, what? No it isn’t.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Check.
text: Tony stands, pretends he’s being rational.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t want to play anymore.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: Oh come on!
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t feel like playing right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: You can’t quit right before I’m
dialog: going to win--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m just not in the mood. People
dialog: can be not in the mood.
text: Mamie-Claire stares at them.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I couldn’t be your mother, thank
dialog: god.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What are you, thirty? We’re
dialog: eighteen. You could. Twelve year
dialog: olds can have kids.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Mamie-Claire!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Sorry, Karen.

speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Brooke...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I‘1l1 call you tomorrow, I’m in the

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: -- I care about things!
dialog: Tears run

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: But I’m not getting married.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: No... We called it off last night.
dialog: It’s for the best. I don’t really
dialog: know her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: She wasn’t committed to the church,
dialog: either. I think that was all
dialog: forced.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Sure, sure.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yes, I just... You’re really not
dialog: doing it? I thought you guys were
dialog: really symbiotic. Wasn’t it a web
dialog: algorithm that got you together?
dialog: She seems amazing.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You never even met Stevie.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Through you, I met her. I don’t
dialog: know, Dad. Come on...
text: down Brooke's face.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Don’t just bail. That’s what the
dialog: Cardinases always do, move on to
dialog: something else. Hang in there.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Frankly I’m surprised you’re so
dialog: invested in this. Believe me, it’s
dialog: for the best.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (wiping her face)
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: BROOKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a really important business
dialog: meeting. I love you.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We can do Thanksgiving at my house
dialog: if you want - since there won’t be
dialog: a wedding.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Nah, I'll probably just end up
dialog: doing something depressing but
dialog: young.
speaker_heading: DAD
text: Home is only a bus ride away.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Is it? Just kidding, it is.
text: There is a silence between them for a second.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: So what does this make me and
dialog: Tracy?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Who’s Tracy?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Never mind.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh, oh, right, her daughter -
dialog: nothing, I guess.
scene_heading: INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S DEN. DAY

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (startles)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t mean to sneak.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (saucily)
dialog: Are you stalking me?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I left my backpack in here. I need
dialog: my migrane pills.
dialog: 70.
text: He goes to his backpack and gets out an pill bottle. He
text: fixes himself a scotch and then downs a pill.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Let me have a sip.
text: She takes the glass from him. He looks at her.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: How much longer do you think we’1l
dialog: be here?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I don’t know, however long it
text: takes. After Dylan comes home
dialog: maybe.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What are you really trying to
dialog: accomplish here?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (looking around the room)
dialog: I’m enjoying this really stylish
dialog: house. When you live in suburbia
dialog: you have to really like being in
dialog: your house.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That’s not what I - what are you
dialog: doing with this whole thing?
text: Nicolette appears in the doorway for a second and then
text: retreats, listening.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I want Brooke to get her
dialog: restaurant. I’m helping out.
text: Tony goes to his backpack, which was thrown on the couch.
text: Opens it and retrieves the pages she had given him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I read your story, by the way.
text: (he holds up the pages)
dialog: Brooke is the woman in your piece.
dialog: You're collecting material.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Did you like it?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (evasive)
dialog: That’s not what we’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: You needed a ride. You forced me.
text: Tracy quickly walks over to Tony.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: How does it feel to be forced?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It feels...uncomfortable.
text: Tracy puts her face close to his. She removes his glasses.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: And how do you feel now?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Still uncomfortable.
text: Tracy kisses Tony passionately on the mouth. Nicolette
dialog: reacts.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (pushing her off)
dialog: That’s not what I want!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It is what you want, but it makes
dialog: you feel like a bad person to want
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (wiping his mouth)
dialog: You're acting really crazy. I
dialog: don’t like this.
text: He puts the story back into his backpack.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (upset)
dialog: I don’t know! I’m jealous! It’s

text: He opens the freezer.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I have some frozen weed. MC,
dialog: where’s that weed Jason gave us?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: You've just said “weed” like
dialog: fifteen times.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (head in the freezer)
dialog: MC??? Did that kid take my weed!?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: NO! No one has touched it. It
dialog: should be next to the Chipwiches.
text: CUT TO: Tony knocks on the upstairs bathroom door. He’s
text: eating a Chipwich.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Are you sick?
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (0.S.)
dialog: No, I’m healthy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Don’t shut me out! You know how
dialog: hard that is for me!
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (0.S.)
dialog: You sound like you’re eating
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have a Chipwich for you.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE (0.S.)
dialog: (softening)
dialog: You brought me a Chipwich?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I can get you another one.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: LEAVE ME ALONE!
text: Nicolette reads the story on the sink counter.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: It was clear that the thing that
dialog: Meadow wanted most in the world -
dialog: the thing that she wanted to define
dialog: her, to absolve her from the
dialog: struggle of explaining herself,
dialog: to give her a place to put her time
dialog: and talents - her everything - the
dialog: restaurant.
text: Tony pounds on the door.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: It was clear that it would never
dialog: happen. The most surprising thing
dialog: was that Meadow was actually
text: surprised by it. She could see the
dialog: whole world with painful accuracy
dialog: but couldn’t see herself or her
dialog: fate.
speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.)
dialog: Baby, come out!
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Brooke finds herself standing next to Karen.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: The most surprising thing was that
dialog: Meadow was actually surprised by
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And because I was in love with her,
dialog: I decided I couldn’t see it either.
text: The conversations overlap.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I'm starting a restaurant.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh...I’m an attorney.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That’s awesome for you. I never
dialog: went to college.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That doesn’t have to be a permanent
dialog: state. You aren’t an amputee.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You can still go to college.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (head still in the
dialog: freezer)
dialog: We'll get lifted and you'll tell us
dialog: about this venture.
text: Dylan reemerges holding a Chipwich.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Do any of you kids know how to make
dialog: an apple bong?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (nearly apoplectic)
dialog: Nobody knows how to make an apple
dialog: bong!
dialog: Tony comes back:
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Did you take my herb?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I’1l get you an apple.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Why don’t we all sit down somewhere
dialog: comfortable and listen to what
dialog: Brooke has to say...
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Yes. You'll pitch us.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: That’s what you do. If someone
dialog: wants something. They pitch. Come
dialog: pitch us on our media stage!
text: Dylan, Tracy, Tony and Brooke all troupe down the hall.
text: Mamie-Claire hurries behind:
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: We just ran Apocalypto on Blu Ray.
dialog: Stunning. Stunning. I’ve gotten
text: very into vinyl.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m into compressed MP3’s. Just
dialog: joking.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I have a great early Mother Love
dialog: Bone EP that would be perfect for
dialog: this occasion.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Records are so warm.
text: Brooke is suddenly yanked out of the line of people, by Mamie-
text: Claire who stands in the dark in the guest bathroom:
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (intense whisper)
dialog: I want you to know that I really
dialog: love Dylan. I love his blonde hair
dialog: and his beard. I know you only
dialog: loved him for his money but I love
dialog: him as a person and I also love him
dialog: for his money but not in that
dialog: order. I’m committed to being a
dialog: happier person. Do you understand?
text: She releases Brooke back out into the hallway.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Tony, Karen and Tracy sit on the couch
text: in front of an elevated stage which is usually used to
dialog: project movies.
text: Brooke stands behind a curtain. Tracy presses a button and
text: the curtain slowly opens.
text: Brooke appears before them. Brooke backs up and kind of gets
dialog: a little presentational about the whole thing.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Umm, well...it’s a restaurant, but
dialog: also like where you cut hair...
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Can I start over?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Of course. We’re old friends.
dialog: Murmurs of “yes, of course.”
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Okay, great.
text: She does a weird “rewinding” type action. Everyone stares.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I was, that was pretend rewind.
dialog: Like...
text: Then she does it again.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (breath)
dialog: So...it would have big heavy wooden
dialog: tables and chairs and...
text: Suddenly a projection of the red FBI warning from a DVD
text: appears across Brooke’s body. She hesitates.
text: Dylan pulls the remote control from under his body.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: He shuts off the image.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Umm... It would feel like the home
dialog: everyone wishes they had been
dialog: raised in. It...it...it...it.
dialog: 83.
text: Brooke is struggling. Tracy can’t help but pipe in from the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No one who comes there will want to
dialog: take out their cell phones because
dialog: it won't feel that way. It would
dialog: be like taking out your cell phone
dialog: in the woods - totally wrong.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: It’s so rude. I concur.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah. It will always feel like
dialog: fall inside - even on hot summer
text: nights with all the windows open.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Loaves of bread that people tear
dialog: off pieces. It would be the kind
dialog: of place where at 2AM the chef and
dialog: the wait-staff would come out and
dialog: eat something simple they fixed
dialog: themselves with the remaining
text: guests and open a bottle of good
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: It would be the best of capitalism.
dialog: What politicians pretend they mean
dialog: when they say “small business.”
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: We would resist doing too many
dialog: pieces in the Times and stuff
dialog: because we'd want it to stay
dialog: honest. They would want us to
dialog: expand and open another one and
dialog: Maybe we eventually would but we
dialog: wouldn't try to re-create the first
dialog: one, it would be a totally new
dialog: thing. And if I ever had kids they
dialog: would walk there after school and
dialog: do their homework in a corner
dialog: table. They’d grow up around all
dialog: these wonderful adults -
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Chefs and actors who are waiters -
dialog: it would be a big funny family and
dialog: they’d never be lonely.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: This could all be something you
dialog: guys share in - you'd be their
dialog: auntie and uncle - part of the life
dialog: and food. And eventually I'd train
dialog: someone younger than myself to run
dialog: the day to day so I could go up to
dialog: Maine with my family in the summers
dialog: and have the kids dive for lobsters
dialog: and everyone would be so warm and
dialog: happy inside knowing that in their
dialog: life they had participated in
dialog: something that was only good.
text: Tracy is kind of emotional. Everyone applauds.
text: Karen is sobbing.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Wow.
text: Dylan walks up to Brooke, kissing her on each cheek,
text: pretending to be speechless.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: You know, I lived in the City for
dialog: Many years. Before I started at
dialog: Goldman, I was teaching at Baruch
dialog: and I lived in an East Village walk-
dialog: up. I was the people people make
dialog: television shows about.
dialog: (to Tracy)
dialog: I was quite beautiful.
text: He takes Brooke’s hand. Mamie-Claire reacts. Takes his
text: other hand. They are all holding hands.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: This is very fucking interesting.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (re: Tracy and Brooke)
dialog: So, are you both doing it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, but we’re sisters and I’m--
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Tracy is spiritual guidance and
dialog: waitress.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Really? I wasn’t sure you had
dialog: heard me those times.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I hear everything.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: How much do you need?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s 200 total but I calculated we
dialog: need forty-two point five on
dialog: Monday.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: For refrigeration.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Forty-two point five stacks, huh?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What are stacks?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: A thousand?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I thought “stacks” meant a hundred.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I’m pretty sure a stack is a
dialog: thousand.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I think a dime is a thousand.
dialog: (cutting to the chase)
dialog: Nevermind, you'd do that?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I want to help you.
text: The door bell rings. Karen springs off her stool.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That’s Ted! Bye everyone.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (to Brooke)
dialog: Good luck with your restaurant!
dialog: 86.
text: She hurries out.
dialog: He starts
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Dylan, this is really something for
dialog: us to talk about privately.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: We need fresh drinks.
text: for the kitchen. Brooke follows.
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.)
dialog: Umm, Mamie-Claire! Can you come
dialog: here please?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Can it wait, Karen?
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.)
dialog: No!
text: Mamie-Claire hesitates, torn between keeping and eye of Dylan
text: and going to Karen, and then runs to Karen.
text: CUT TO: Harold is at the door. Karen stands there, confused.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It’s not Ted.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Harold--
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I am calling the cops. You were
dialog: warned.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (0.S.)
dialog: Could the weed be in the garage
dialog: freezer?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t know!
speaker_heading: DYLAN (0.S.)
dialog: Can you check?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I’m blowing Harold so he doesn’t
dialog: call the cops. JK. I’m probably
dialog: just going to have to go look at
dialog: his boat collection.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (stepping inside)
dialog: I can’t remember the last time I
dialog: was over here.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t think you’ve ever been over
dialog: here, Harold.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No, when you first moved here, I
text: came for a stilted barbecue.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: That’s when we made an effort.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, invite me in now. I want a
dialog: house tour.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Tony is working on the apple bong with his all-purpose tool,
text: Tracy watches him.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You are such a Swiss Army knife
dialog: kind of guy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have to be a better loser. I
dialog: really love Nicolette.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: She’s angry about the chess game?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah, I think so. I’m mostly in
dialog: touch with my feminine side but
dialog: then I guess not though because I
dialog: don’t understand her right now.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Did you... did you want to be with
dialog: me ever?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t want to get into this...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, I’m not going to kiss you.
dialog: Just a question.
dialog: Tony considers:
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah, I liked you, but I love
dialog: Nicolette and honestly... I just
dialog: never saw you that way.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You seemed... I need someone I can
dialog: love, not keep up with.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Sometimes I really think I’m just
dialog: smarter and better than everyone
dialog: else. Not necessarily with math or
dialog: science or whether something is
dialog: east or west but pretty much with
dialog: everything else. And if I could
dialog: just figure out my look I'd be the
dialog: most beautiful woman in the world
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sometimes I think I’m a genius and
dialog: I wish I could just fast-forward my
dialog: life to the part where everyone
dialog: knows it.
text: Tony holds up the completed apple bong. It’s beautiful.
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Brooke has followed Dylan into the kitchen, he’s fixing a
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I have to say, I’m impressed
dialog: Brooke. It takes a lot of moxie to
dialog: start a restaurant.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: You're doing it, babe. You’re out
dialog: there, doing something besides
text: amassing and hoarding money.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: If I could figure out how to amass
dialog: and hoard money, I'd do it.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: You could have married me or a
dialog: dozen other guys but you wanted to
dialog: be your own person.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah, no, I’m over that now.
text: Dylan laughs. He moves toward her. She moves in.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: You’re funny because you don’t know
dialog: you’re funny.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I know I’m funny. There’s nothing
dialog: I don’t know about myself. That’s
dialog: why I can’t do therapy.
text: They’re close now. He pushes a strand out of her face and
text: behind her ear. Brooke is going with it.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: MC and I see a woman in New Haven.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh...you guys see a therapist?
dialog: Like a tune up?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: More like a death watch. She’s
dialog: totally on my side. She basically
dialog: thinks Mamie-Claire is holding me
dialog: back and I should just leave her.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Your couple’s therapist said that?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: In so many words. Yeah, we're
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Mamie-Claire said you were trying
dialog: to have kids.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: We've talked about it but we’ve
dialog: also talked about breaking up.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh no, I’m sorry--
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: No, it’s liberating. I feel great.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (freaked out)
dialog: Yay...
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I miss New York, man. I miss you.
dialog: I look you up periodically on the
dialog: internet. You look hot as hell in
dialog: those party pictures.
text: Brooke takes a step back.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh...do I? Which party? Sometimes
dialog: I look like I have fat arms.
text: He takes another step forward.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I like fat arms. I’m going to help
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (tearful)
dialog: Thank you.
text: She hugs him. He holds the hug too long. She has to yank
dialog: herself free.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Here's what I’m going to do for
dialog: you. We’ll take my forty-three
dialog: stacks or dimes and pay back the
dialog: other investors, whatever they’re
dialog: in for thus far. You got a space
dialog: already? A lease?
text: Brooke, realizing, nods.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: We'll put it up for rent
dialog: immediately, cool neighborhood?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (almost inaudible)
dialog: Williamsburg.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Oh, come on! The coolest. Yeah,
dialog: we'll turn it over no problem.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Because let’s face it having a
dialog: restaurant is like having a kid
dialog: with a drug problem.
dialog: It’s...just...it’s really draining.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (crushed)
dialog: You're giving me money to not start
dialog: a restaurant?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: First of all - I’m saving you. If
dialog: you started the restaurant, you’d
dialog: be back here in a year asking for
dialog: five times this.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Not if it was successful --
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: What are the odds?
text: He pushes a hair away from her face. He’s close to her now.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: You’re as beautiful as ever.
dialog: Whatever you're doing it’s working.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No. No, it isn’t.
text: Brooke hesitates. Dylan grins.
text: Tracy enters.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Did you ever find the pot? Tony
text: just made a beautiful apple bong.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: We'll have to, because some
dialog: celebrating is in order.
text: (putting his arm around
dialog: Brooke )
dialog: I think we may have reached a deal.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (shaking off her
dialog: disappointment )
dialog: Yes... Dylan made a proposition.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I’m going to give her money
dialog: immediately.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yay!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE (0.S.)
dialog: You're giving her money?
text: Mamie-Claire enters. Dylan takes his arm off of Brooke.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Who was at the door?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Harold. He’s giving himself a tour
dialog: of the house.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Where’s Karen?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t fucking know. You're
dialog: giving her money??? This is our
dialog: decision. Not yours.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I’m not giving her 200 grand, don’t
dialog: worry, I'm just bailing her out of
dialog: her current situation.
text: Tracy looks at Brooke.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: And then for the whole restaurant?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (trying to be brave)
dialog: No... I won’t do the restaurant
dialog: now. It’s just gotten too crazy.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (to Tracy)
dialog: You believe in her, don’t you?
text: Tracy nods. Brooke watches her.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: This is a good result, this is even
dialog: better than getting the restaurant.
dialog: Less financial uncertainty.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: He’s right. I think I even feel a
dialog: little relieved.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: “Mom's” wasn’t about money.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Well, I don’t think anyone starts
dialog: anything with the dream of NOT
dialog: making money.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Do they not?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Why would you give her money?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: It’s my money. I make it. I can
dialog: do what I want with it. Just like,
dialog: you have your T-shirt money, you
dialog: can do what you want with that.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: But I... we’re married. This is
dialog: our life.
text: Brooke looks at Tracy.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You know what, I appreciate it,
dialog: Dylan, Mamie-Claire, but I’m not
dialog: going to take the money. I/’11
dialog: figure something else out.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Why?
text: Brooke looks at Mamie-Claire.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I just wasn’t brought up that way.
text: Mamie-Claire smiles at her. An unspoken “Thanks.” Tracy
text: comes over to Brooke.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What will you do?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I'll figure it out. I always do.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m so impressed by you and worried
dialog: for you at the same time.
text: She hugs Brooke.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m so glad you're my sister.

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (to Brooke)
dialog: It’s not you... It’s just inspired.
dialog: You make me want to write.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: This is so nerdy.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Who wouldn’t want to write a story
dialog: about Brooke?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: (vaising her hand)
dialog: Me. I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: TONY

dialog: They keep handing me alcohol.
speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: BROOKE

speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE

speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (to Brooke)
dialog: Oh, it’s not really you, but it’s
dialog: very funny, the character that
text: Nicolette and Tony misconstrued as
dialog: you is a very funny character.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (not thrilled with this)
dialog: Funny? What does it say?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s not funny. It’s just...it’s

speaker_heading: NICOLETTE

speaker_heading: BROOKE

dialog: didn’t mean to hurt you, Brooke.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (shaking with fury)
dialog: You don’t get to decide what’s
text: hurtful and not hurtful.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I can only tell you my intention.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You wrote this after ONE night with
dialog: me? ONE?!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I guess so, yeah, it felt longer.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You think I’m a rotting carcass?
dialog: That I’m doomed to failure???
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No! It’s fiction that’s why it’s
dialog: fiction...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: So much of this “fiction” did NOT
dialog: happen this way. Karen, you’re a
dialog: lawyer. I’m going to sue you until
dialog: you have NOTHING.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm just writing from my life...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No, this isn’t your life!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: But I was there that night.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: NO! I was going to have that night
dialog: anyway, you never were!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: But I did have it though.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You joined my life - you needed a
dialog: place to go and I invited you in
dialog: and then you stole my life. You’re
text: a LEECH. A BLOODSUCKER.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You loved being admired by me, you
dialog: loved it, you loved having lessons
dialog: to impart...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I DIDN’T ASK FOR YOU.
text: Tracy looks for support from Tony and Nicolette.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Brooke, you know great plays,
dialog: right? - how would it have been if
dialog: Tennessee Williams hadn’t used
dialog: people he knew, there wouldn’t be
dialog: any plays, there wouldn’t -
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I DON’T GIVE A SHIT BECAUSE I AM
text: NOT A FRIEND OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You took something I said and made
dialog: a tweet about it! What about that?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: That's different! You were right
dialog: there! You knew I was Twittering,
dialog: it wasn’t some sneaky shitty thing -
dialog: do you want me to credit you? Or
dialog: no I‘ll just delete it.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: That’s not the point I’m asking you
dialog: to empathize.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: It’s my least popular tweet anyway!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Stop talking about Twitter, it’s so
dialog: awkward!
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You are much more of an asshole
dialog: than you initially appear.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (looking again at the
dialog: story)
dialog: And...you think I haven't dealt
dialog: with the pain of my mother’s death?
dialog: I deal with it all the time, I talk
dialog: about it all the time.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You talk about it all the time, but
dialog: you never talk about HER. You just
dialog: throw out that she died and that
text: shuts everyone up.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: TRACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your tragedy is your armor in which
dialog: nothing is ever your fault.
text: Brooke looks around, desperately wild eyed, looking for
dialog: support.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
scene_heading: PLEASE! PLEASE FRIENDS! SOMEONE
text: DEFEND ME AGAINST THIS MONSTER!
text: Everyone jumps on Tracy, agreeing with Brooke, says she’s a
dialog: dick.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It’s like your whole generation,
dialog: it’s all pastiche.
text: Mamie-Claire has been writing. She finishes and calmly joins
dialog: the discussion.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: The emotional betrayal I can’t
dialog: speak to -
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I didn’t “betray” her -
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: But I can say that you portray
dialog: women terribly. And because of
dialog: that.
text: Mamie-Claire refers to her piece of neatly folded paper.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: I’ve prepared some questions I'd
dialog: like you to think about.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: And I want you to answer these
dialog: questions, not for our
dialog: satisfaction, but for your own.
dialog: (gazing at her paper)
dialog: One: Do you believe in the women’s
dialog: right to choose?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yes, what does that -
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me, I’m not done.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: She’s not done, bitch!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Brooke, please. Two: What do you
dialog: think someone who bombs abortion
dialog: clinics would think of your story?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: There isn’t even an abortion in
dialog: this story!
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: No you just portray women as crazy
dialog: desperate gold diggers!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (to Brooke)
dialog: You seemed so cool so totally
dialog: amazing I didn’t think it would be
dialog: possible to hurt you...
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Of COURSE it’s possible, I am the
dialog: MOST sensitive person...
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: To your own feelings.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: (wailing)
dialog: Mamie-Claire!
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Sorry, I don’t really think that,
dialog: it’s just something I would have
dialog: said at one time.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I have to say, what you did to
text: Brooke is f-ed up.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Karen, you don’t see my side?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You don’t have a side you’re just
dialog: wrong.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: You must call the Lit Society and
dialog: tell them you’re withdrawing your
dialog: essay--
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s not an essay, it’s a short
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: This cannot appear in print or
dialog: online. Karen, will you represent
dialog: Brooke?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I’m a tax attorney, but OK.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: Will you draw up a contract,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yes, and in the meantime, I’m going
dialog: to ask you to rewrite the story and
text: give Brooke the rewritten story.
dialog: I‘1l give you my email and you can
dialog: BCC me.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE
dialog: She could just CC you.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nic’s right, because we'd already
dialog: know that you’re getting it...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Sure, CC me.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (sympathetically)
dialog: Technology can be complicated.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I know! I just learned what “case
dialog: sensitive” meant seriously
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m not going to do any of this
dialog: stuff. You’re my sister and I love
dialog: you but I stand by what I did.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Guess what, bitch? My dad isn’t
dialog: going to marry your slutty atheist
dialog: mother so we’re not sisters. We
dialog: never will be. We’re nothing to
dialog: each other.
text: Mamie-Claire tucks her folded paper into Tracy’s pocket.
speaker_heading: MAMIE-CLAIRE
dialog: There are ten questions there. All
dialog: equally important for you to
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Brooke...

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, honey! Ruth signed me in.
text: CUT TO: Tracy’s Mom is crying. Tracy sits next to her on the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: The Catholicism thing has been kind
dialog: of crazy and he kind of -- I just
dialog: saw a side of him that I didn’t
dialog: know before. It’s strange to not
dialog: really know someone...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh...
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I’m sorry, I know you liked Brooke.
dialog: He told me that she worships you,
dialog: she kept talking about how smart
dialog: you are, how interesting...
text: Tracy starts crying.
dialog: She cries
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, honey, don’t cry, you can still
dialog: be friends...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I went -- I went through a breakup
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You didn’t tell me you were dating
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I know.
dialog: harder.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh my sweet girl. Do you want to
dialog: talk about it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, it’s too late now anyway.
text: Mom rubs Tracy’s back.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I know this is crappy timing, but I
dialog: need to take a vacation, and I got
dialog: the deposit back for the flowers
dialog: and Colleen told me to come with
dialog: her family to the Caribbean over
dialog: Thanksgiving, and Trace, I need it.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah, that sounds nice, Stevie.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: So you're okay, for Thanksgiving,
dialog: not coming home? I’m sure your
dialog: father would love to have you...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh, I didn’t put that together -
dialog: yes, I’m fine. I'll be fine. Are
dialog: you okay?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I’m sad. I’m very sad. But I’1l
dialog: be okay.

dialog: didn’t really know him.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Me too, Baby Tracy.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT

dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: Spirit says that you need to find
dialog: your home in yourself.
text: The Psychic suddenly takes her hand:
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC
dialog: Spirit says that you haven't
dialog: dropped into your body yet.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: If I’m not in my body, where am I?
speaker_heading: PSYCHIC

speaker_heading: ADVISOR
dialog: Well, I think it’s pretty much done
dialog: for this semester, but you could
dialog: put in an application for funding

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey, can I come in?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: OK.

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You going home for Thanksgiving?
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh...nice.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Her dad fries a turkey apparently.
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Nah.
text: She hands Tony a couple of pieces of paper.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s an application. Two.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t want to join Mobius. I've
dialog: had enough rejection.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s not for Mobius. I quit the
dialog: briefcase club. You were right,
text: they're self-appointed douche bags.
dialog: I’m starting my own zine and I’m
dialog: not saying you’re in, but I am
dialog: saying I'd be very interested in
dialog: getting your and Nicolette’s

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hi - I’m sorry to bother you on
dialog: Thanksgiving, but I met you once -
dialog: I went through your window? It was
dialog: in the middle of the night...
speaker_heading: KAREEM
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I was with Brooke.
speaker_heading: KAREEM
dialog: You're her sister, right?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Well, I was going to be. Do you
dialog: have a number for her? The old one
dialog: isn’t working...
speaker_heading: KAREEM
dialog: I don’t--
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Anyway - I was going to ask you: do
dialog: you know where she went?
text: Kareem indicates for Tracy to follow him. She passes through
text: a cozy apartment. The table is set for the holiday. A
text: couple of kids run through.
speaker_heading: KAREEM
text: Her front door is still bolted
dialog: shut.
text: They reach the window. Kareem opens it.

text: suitcases.
text: Brooke walks into the room and places some books into a box.
text: She wears her red pants. Tracy knocks. Brooke looks up and
text: comes to the window.
text: She and Tracy stare at each other through the glass.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (through the glass)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Can I come in?
text: CUT TO: Tracy sits on some boxes watching Brooke move around
dialog: packing.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You're leaving?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: In a couple of hours. I’m going to
dialog: try my luck out west.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You're going today? On
dialog: Thanksgiving?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: New York isn’t the New York I used
dialog: to know. There’s too much
dialog: construction. Maybe LA is my lady.
dialog: In LA I qualify as well-read.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I wanted to say--
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I know you’re sorry.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I’m not really that sorry.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: You're not?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh then fuck this.
text: Brooke opens the window again.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, no wait...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I looked for you.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I’ve been around.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Are you OK? Like, financially?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah. Mamie-Claire gave me what
dialog: would have been my share of our T-
dialog: shirt profits. It was just enough
dialog: to pay off my debts and get out of
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What will you do in LA?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I don’t know. I think I’m sick.
dialog: And I don’t know if my ailment has
dialog: a name - it’s just me sitting and
text: staring at the internet or the
dialog: television for long periods of time
text: interspersed by trying to not do
dialog: that and then lying about what I’ve
dialog: been doing. Then I’1l get so
dialog: excited about something that the
dialog: excitement overwhelms me and I
dialog: can’t sleep or do anything - and
dialog: then I just am in love with
dialog: everything but can’t figure out how
dialog: to make myself work in the world.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I think I have that too.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I wish we lived in feudal times
dialog: when your position in the world
dialog: couldn’t change. If you were a
dialog: king or a peasant you had to just
dialog: be happy with who you were.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But...wait!
text: Brooke looks inside an open box. She finds a piece of paper
text: and hands it to Tracy.
scene_heading: CLOSE: SAT results. 2200.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You can tutor SAT’s now.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Well, I thought I might actually go
dialog: to college. I’m not an amputee.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: I filled out a couple of
dialog: applications. I wrote my college
dialog: essay all about you.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (apprehensive)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Oh snap! No. It’s about my mom.
dialog: But I had you there.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Brooke goes into the other room to retrieve more books.
speaker_heading: BROOKE (0.S.)
dialog: I let Mamie-Claire and Dylan keep
dialog: the cats. It’s like, I gave thema
dialog: chance for a better life, better
dialog: than I could have provided for
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: The cats went from stolen to given
dialog: because you changed your mind.
speaker_heading: BROOKE (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t put that in a story. Not
dialog: because I care but because it’s not
dialog: a very good observation.
text: Tracy sees the Mobius Literary Journal (the one with her
text: story) inside an open box. She’s about to say something, but
text: thinks better of it. Brooke reenters and tosses books into
dialog: the box.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You know what’s funny... I’m not
dialog: even done with my first semester of
dialog: college.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: This won’t even be your big
dialog: “college story.”
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I think it’1ll always be pretty big.
text: Brooke hesitates, emotional for a second. She musses Tracy’s
text: hair like a kid.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Well, thanks for stopping by, but I
dialog: have more packing to do before
dialog: Kareem and I break down the front
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’ll be hard for me not to look at
dialog: New York and think of you somewhere
dialog: in it.
text: Brooke shrugs.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Tracy moves toward the window. She looks back at her friend.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey Brooke...
text: Brooke turns around.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s not going to be as great as
dialog: what my mom and your dad were
dialog: planning, but... Do you want to
dialog: have Thanksgiving with me?
scene_heading: EXT/INT. VESELKA. DAY
text: We watch Brooke and Tracy through the window eating pierogis
dialog: for Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.0O.)
dialog: Meadow had made rich fat women less
dialog: fat and rich stupid kids less
dialog: stupid and lame rich men less lame.
dialog: And she wanted so badly to be on
dialog: the other side - to be fat and
dialog: stupid and lame and rich.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But what she couldn't see most of
dialog: all, more than she couldn't see
dialog: that she was never going to get the
dialog: restaurant, was that those people
dialog: were nothing compared to her. They
text: were matches to her bonfire. She
dialog: was the last cowboy - all romance
dialog: and failure. The world was
dialog: changing and her kind didn’t have
dialog: anywhere to go. Being a beacon of
dialog: hope for lesser people is a lonely
dialog: business.
text: And as Brooke and Tracy talk and reminisce and laugh, we CUT
text: TO BLACK.
dialog:
