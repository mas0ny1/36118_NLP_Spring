speaker_heading: NIXON

speaker_heading: BRENNAN

text: FROST stops. An incredulous smile..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: What I want to achieve?
text: FROST exchanges looks with JOHN BIRT..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Jim, I‘ve secured 12 taping days,
dialog: close to thirty hours with the most
dialog: compelling and controversial
dialog: politician of our times. Isn’t that
dialog: enough?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Not for me. I‘d be giving up a year of
dialog: my life - leaving my family - to work
dialog: on a subject matter that means more
dialog: than you can probably imagine. And the
dialog: idea of doing all that without
dialog: achieving what I want to personally -
dialog: would be unthinkable to me..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: What is it that you want to achieve?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: I'd like to give Richard Nixon the
dialog: trial he never had.
speaker_heading: PROST
dialog: Well...of course we will be asking

speaker_heading: 65A
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: “Difficult questions”? The man lost
dialog: fifteen thousand Americans and a
dialog: million Indo-Chinese during his
dialog: administration. He only escaped jail
dialog: because of Ford's pardon..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Yes, but equally, going after him in
text: some knee-jerk way, assuming he’s a
dialog: terrible guy..wouldn’t that only
dialog: create more sympathy than anything
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Right now, I submit it’s impossible to
dialog: feel anything close to sympathy for
dialog: Richard Nixon. He devalued the
dialog: Presidency and left the country that
dialog: elected him in trauma. The American
dialog: people need a conviction. Pure and
dialog: simple. The integrity of our political
dialog: system, of democracy as an idea
dialog: entirely depends on it. And if in
dialog: years to come people look back and say
dialog: it was in this interview that Richard
dialog: Wixon exonerated himself, that would
dialog: be the worst crime of all. Did you
dialog: know that Mike Wallace is doing a
dialog: piece on this, and that in the bars
dialog: around Capitol Hill and Georgetown
dialog: this entire project is a joke?

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me?
speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: It isn’t relevant.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: What's the angle? “British talk show
dialog: host. Good with actresses. Not so good
dialog: with stonewalling Presidents?”
speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: That‘s the general idea.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Right. Well, it’s hard not to feel a

speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: You know what I mean. For the
dialog: interviews. We want to propose that
dialog: “Watergate” is an umbrella term for
dialog: everything negative.
text: FROST walks out onto the balcony....
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: What..so all the other domestic
dialog: charges against him..the Brookings
dialog: Institute, the Plumbers Unit, the
dialog: Enemies List..you’re saying that all
dialog: goes into ‘Watergate’?
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: That’s absurd. And a clear breach of
dialog: the terms of our agreement.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: Okay, how would you define Watergate?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: That it covers just that. The
dialog: Watergate break-in of June 17th and
dialog: the subsequent cover-up and
dialog: investigations.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: Fine, in which case the deal is off.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Fine - in which case you can expect a
dialog: lawsuit for something in excess of $20
dialog: million in damages and lost earnings.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: The terms of the contract stipulate
dialog: quite clearly that Watergate take up
dialog: no more than 25% of the time!
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Yes - but nowhere does it say that for
dialog: the rest of the 75% he gets to drone
dialog: on and sound Presidential.
text: BRENNAN almost chokes..
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 SOA.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: “Drone on?” Jesus Christ! Where’s your
dialog: respect? Remember who you’re talking
dialog: about. You media people, you’re so
dialog: goddammed smug and self-righteous. You
dialog: know as well as I do, that sixty per
dialog: cent of what Nixon did in office was
dialog: right, and thirty per cent might have
dialog: ended up wrong, but he thought it was
dialog: right at the time.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: That still leaves ten percent where he
dialog: was doing the wrong thing, and knew
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: I guarantee you, if you screw us on
dialog: the sixty per cent, I’m going to ruin
dialog: you if it takes the rest of my life.

speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Fine, David. Fine.
text: FROST and CAROLINE go.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Why the monkey suit?
speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: David has a film premier he needs to
dialog: attend,
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: What? The night before we start
dialog: taping? What‘s the movie?
speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: ‘The Slipper and the Rose’.
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: The Cinderella movie?
speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: David is the executive producer!
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: The one with Richard Chamberlain
dialog: singing “Ding, diddy, ding ding?”
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: You don’t think it might be an idea
dialog: for our interviewer to be rested and
dialog: focused on the job in hand?
speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: Don't worry. David is a performer of
dialog: the highest calibre who has been in

speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: That was the word he used?
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: Yes. He said “performer”.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Not ‘journalist’? or ‘interviewer’?
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: No, he said ‘performer’.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Out of interest...where are you at
dialog: this moment. Psychically?
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: I am imagining the dust, the darkness,
dialog: the agony and the unimaginable

speaker_heading: REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: Some people in the media have
dialog: suggested you‘re not the right man for
dialog: the job. That you'll be too soft on
dialog: the President. What will you do if he
dialog: stonewalls you?
speaker_heading: FROST (ON TV)
dialog: I shall say so. Again and again..but I
dialog: should say now, I’m not expecting his
dialog: approach to be to stonewall. I’m
dialog: hoping it will that of a cascade of
dialog: candor,
speaker_heading: REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: “BR cascade of candor”? From Richard
dialog: Nixon? You think that’s what you‘1l
dialog: get?
speaker_heading: FROST (ON TV)
dialog: No. It was just a phrase I thought

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: And for the record, I’m going to be
dialog: starting with John’s idea - “Why
dialog: didn‘t you burn the tapes?”
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: No, please God, no. That would be a
dialog: disaster and open up the whole

scene_heading: EXT. CASA PACIFICA ~ SAN CLEMENTE ~ DAY - (1977) 82
text: SECRET SERVICEMEN wait patiently. A series of cars with

text: GANNON, SAWYER, KHACHIGIAN and BRENNAN all climb into cars.
text: Finally, NIXON, dressed in a dark, blue suit, emerges from

text: He is about to climb into his car, when a VOICE calls out..
speaker_heading: PAT NIXON
dialog: Wait! Dick?
text: NIXON turns to see his wife, PAT NIXON come up the path
text: towards him.
text: She comes up close. Their eyes meet. An intensity in her

text: handkerchief in his top pocket.
text: Another look between them. She straightens his lapel. Then
text: she turns around, and walks back into the house.
scene_heading: EXT. SMITH HOUSE - MONARCH BAY - DAY - (1977) 83
text: FROST‘s car pulls up outside the location. Large trucks are

dialog: generators, cables.
text: FROST is immediately besieged by PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS
text: that have gathered outside. (RESTON and ZELNICK go into the
dialog: house).
text: Suddenly a ripple of excitement from outside. Shouts of "He's

text: sedans. Darkened windows.
dialog: 84
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 56.
text: Doors open. SECRET SERVICE get out. Ear-pieces. Walkie-

dialog: entrance.
text: Finally, a car door opens and a pair of classic black shoes,

text: greeted by FROST. They shake hands.
scene_heading: INT. SMITH HOUSE - MONARCH BAY - DAY - (1977) 84
text: Watching from inside the house: RESTON stares. Seeing NIXON
text: in person for the first time.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: ¥’know, I've written four books about

speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: He‘s taller than I imagined. And
dialog: tanned..
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: You going to shake his hand?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: You kidding me? After everything that

text: FROST and NIXON walk into the house, followed by NIXON’s
text: entourage. FROST turns to face RESTON..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: May I present Jim Reston, one of my
dialog: researchers,
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
text: NIXON extends his hand. RESTON stares, then inexplicably, his
text: hand slowly, involuntarily rises up..
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Mr. President.
text: RESTON and NIXON’s hands shake. NIXON and his retinue move

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 57.

speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: Fuck off.
text: ZELNICK, RESTON and BIRT smile, then walk towards the Frost

text: MANOLO SANCHEZ brings NIXON a cup of tea on the Presidential

speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Well, thank you. It’s true, she’s much
dialog: better now, and is getting round to
dialog: the business of replying to all the
dialog: cards. Have a guess how many she
dialog: received?
text: From FROST’s blank look..
speaker_heading: NIXON
text: A hundred thousand.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Goodness.
speaker_heading: NIXON

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07
speaker_heading: NIXON (cont'd)
dialog: And from our point of view - I'd just
dialog: like to say how pleased we are you got
dialog: this all together.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: I understand it’s been quite a
dialog: struggle.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Well...I...
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: How much has it cost? Do you mind me
dialog: asking? C'mon. Between us.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Very well...two million.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Two million? I didn’t realize we were
dialog: making Ben Hur, But you've raised it
dialog: all now?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Not quite. But getting there. Everyone
dialog: has been kind. And deferred fees.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Not quite everyone.
text: NIXON smiles icily. Then takes out a handkerchief...
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: I'd like to put a handkerchief here,
dialog: if I may. Is that out of shot?
dialog: Contractually..I think..we made a
dialog: provision that during each question I
dialog: might dab my upper lip. Which you
dialog: won't show when you cut it together..
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: You're probably aware of my history

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: They say that moisture on my upper lip
dialog: cost me the Presidency. People who
dialog: listened on the radio thought I’d won.
dialog: Television and the close-up. So now
dialog: they insist I bring my handkerchief
dialog: and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
dialog: A silence..
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Do you trim yours?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Of course not. You’re light skinned
dialog: and have blue eyes. And have no
dialog: problems with perspiration, I imagine?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Not that I'm aware.

speaker_heading: FROST

speaker_heading: NIXON

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Mr. President, we are going to be
dialog: covering a lot of subjects in a great
dialog: deal of detail over the course of
dialog: these interviews, but I'd like to
dialog: begin completely out of context, by
dialog: asking you one question, more than any

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) — 8/24/07 él.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Mr. Frost, I’m surprised by your
dialog: question, since we have an agreement,
dialog: a contractual agreement, I believe,
dialog: that we would cover Watergate in our
dialog: last taping session. But if your
dialog: “viewers” really do have a “major
dialog: concern”, then perhaps I should
text: briefly respond to it now..
text: NIXON crosses his legs. Sits back.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: What probably very few people realize
dialog: is that the taping system in the White
dialog: House was set up by my predecessor
dialog: President Johnson - partly to avoid
dialog: the necessity of having a secretary in
dialog: every meeting, and partly to ensure
dialog: there was a record kept of every
dialog: verbal agreement - no matter how off-
dialog: the-cuff or casual. Initially, on
dialog: coming into the White House, I
dialog: insisted on dismantling the system..
scene_heading: 89 INT. BRENNAN’S OFFICE - SAN CLEMENTE - DAY - (1982) 89
text: JACK BRENNAN smiles in satisfaction..
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: In boxing, there‘s always that moment,
dialog: you see it in challengers’ faces. The
dialog: instant they feel the power of the
text: champ‘s first jab. A sickening moment,
text: when they realize all the pep-talks,
dialog: and the hype and the months of
dialog: psyching themselves up has been
dialog: delusional all along. You could see it
text: in Frost’s face. If he hadn't known
dialog: the calibre of the man he was up

text: ZELNICK’s heart sinks, watching the monitors..
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: So much for our “ballsy” opening..
speaker_heading: NIXON (ON TV)
dialog: You see, since the best advice is
dialog: almost always of the confidential
dialog: variety, now the tapes have been made
dialog: public, people are unlikely ever to
dialog: feel comfortable speaking in
dialog: confidence at the White House..they
dialog: are less likely to offer that advice
dialog: so in the end it’s the whole political
dialog: system..and by implication the country

text: Miraculously, as if FROST had heard him...

speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: What are you doing, David? You've got

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: It‘s all right - these are just

speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: But this session only lasts two hours -
dialog: nearly half of it’s gone. And you’re

speaker_heading: GANNON
dialog: The best start imaginable.
speaker_heading: NIXON

dialog: betrayed the people that had elected

dialog: You know, Mr. Frost, I’m an even—
dialog: tempered man, but nothing upsets me
dialog: more than when I hear blame for
dialog: Vietnam being laid at my door.
dialog: Vietnam was not my fault. It was my
dialog: inheritance. Of course, I could have
dialog: ‘bugged out,’ blamed it on my
dialog: predecessors, and pulled the troops
dialog: out early, and very possibly won some
dialog: Scandinavian peace prize into the
dialog: bargain, but this was an important
dialog: test of American credibility. The
dialog: whole world was watching to see if we
dialog: have the “character” to see it
dialog: through. But I believed in the cause.
dialog: And sometimes what you believe in is
dialog: the harder path. It could be said I
dialog: was the last casualty of Vietnam...

dialog: 
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 75.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: An invasion which everyone advised you
dialog: against. All the Pentagon and CIA
dialog: intelligence suggested it would fail.
dialog: So why did you do it?
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Well, first of all, as a result of our
dialog: incursion into Cambodia, we picked up
dialog: 22,000 rifles, 15 million rounds of
dialog: ammunition, 150,000 rockets and
dialog: mortars belonging to the North
dialog: Vietnamese, which would only otherwise
dialog: have been directed onto American
dialog: soldiers or innocent South Vietnamese
dialog: civilians. Now, I can’t put a finger
dialog: on the amount of lives that saved. I
dialog: just know that as a result, our
dialog: casualties went down and we were able
dialog: to step up our withdrawal.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: But one of the principal
dialog: justifications you gave for the
dialog: incursion was the supposed existence
dialog: of the “Headquarters of the entire
dialog: Communist military operation in South
text: Vietnam”, a sort of “Bamboo Pentagon”
dialog: which proved not to exist at all.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Now, just a minute....
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: And by sending B52‘s to carpet bomb a
dialog: country, wiping out whole civilian
dialog: areas, you end up radicalizing a once
dialog: moderate people, uniting them in Anti-
dialog: American sentiment, and creating a
dialog: monster in the Khmer Rouge which would

dialog: civilians, That’s the enemy's way. And
dialog: if you’re asking the question, do I
dialog: regret the casualties on both sides in
dialog: the war? Of course, I do. I
dialog: experienced real difficulties at home,
dialog: as you know, as a result. With the
dialog: universities and so forth. I attended
dialog: a judicial conference in Williamsburg,
dialog: Virginia, late in 1970 and as I walked
text: into the hall to make a speech a
dialog: little girl, I don’t think she was
text: more than 16, broke through the line
dialog: of people there, and ah...she just
text: spat in my face, just covered my face
dialog: with spit, and she said, “You are a
dialog: murderer.” Of course I wiped the spit
dialog: eff, went in and made the speech. And
dialog: I was thinking, she was such a pretty
dialog: girl, but at that moment she was so
dialog: ugly, and it was the war that had made
dialog: her so. I lost a great deal of sleep
dialog: ever that particular incident. And the
dialog: worry, the responsibility, let me tell
dialog: you, it can wear you down. But
dialog: whenever I had doubts, I remembered
dialog: the construction worker in
dialog: Philadelphia who came up to me and
dialog: said, “Sir, I have only one criticism
dialog: of that Cambodia thing. If you had
dialog: gone in earlier, you might have
dialog: captured the gun that killed my boy
dialog: three months ago. So, in answer to
dialog: your question, do I regret going into
dialog: Cambodia? No. I wish I’d gone in

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: No one? Right. Good. Now I suggest
text: instead of festering around the hotel
dialog: for the next five days, we all go our
dialog: separate ways over Easter. But before
dialog: we go..Caroline and I would like you
dialog: to join us for a little celebratory
text: dinner at Patrick Terrail’s new place.
text: FROST walks back towards the house. ZELNICK holds his head,
dialog: can’t help laughing...
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: To celebrate what, David? The fact the
dialog: project is going down the pan? And
dialog: we're all going to be working at
dialog: Burger King?
text: FROST turns, a flash of anger..

scene_heading: INT. MA MAISON - NIGHT - (1977) 125
dialog: We‘re in the legendary Beverly Hills restaurant. In it’s
text: heyday. A packed party.
text: Squashed in a booth between two beautiful Hollywood types,
text: like out-of-place schoolteachers, are RESTON and ZELNICK. A
text: blur of naked flesh, as skimpily dressed WOMEN walk past..
speaker_heading: ZELNICK
dialog: Was that Hugh Hefner?
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: I believe it was. With Michael York.
dialog: And over there. On the piano, is that
dialog: Neil Diamond and Sammy Kahn.
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER CORNER:
text: The two famous entertainers pay a duet with lyrics composed
dialog: for the occasion...
speaker_heading: DIAMOND / KAHN
dialog: (to the tune of “Love and

speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: +-just putting it all together, David -

speaker_heading: BIRT
dialog: +-and the interviews will always exist
dialog: as a valuable resource for future
dialog: generations of academics, political

speaker_heading: FROST

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 83.

speaker_heading: PAT NIXON
dialog: My, what a festive atmosphere.

text: The MEN jump to their feet.
speaker_heading: PAT NIXON
dialog: Please, don’t get up. I take it from
dialog: this the interviews have gone well?
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: Better than that, Ma’am. It's a

speaker_heading: PAT NIXON
dialog: Really?

scene_heading: INT. FROST’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT - (1977) 127

speaker_heading: FROST (ON PHONE)
dialog: I see. Is there nothing we can do?
text: Listens. A silence.
speaker_heading: FROST (ON PHONE)
dialog: Really?
text: FROST’s face becomes ashen..
speaker_heading: FROST (ON PHONE)
dialog: Right. Well....thanks for letting me know.
text: FROST hangs up. Badly shaken.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: It’s true. They’ve dropped the Australian show.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Oh, David..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: They felt I needed to ‘re-evaluate my
dialog: priorities’. Now my producer is
dialog: worried the London show will follow.
dialog: I’m in this for everything I‘ve got.
dialog: And there’s STILL no guarantee it will
dialog: ever see the light of day. What have I
dialog: done? What was I thinking? Why didn‘t
dialog: anyone stop me? They should have
dialog: physically stopped me.
text: CAROLINE looks at him. Moved. Yet not sure what to do. How to
text: help. She goes to hug him, but he freezes, does not respond...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Look, let’s stay in tonight. I‘'1l go
dialog: down to Trader Vic‘s and bring
dialog: something back. Fish or steak, Which?

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 85.

speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: I’ll call from the restaurant.
text: CAROLINE takes a last look at him, and goes. Leaving FROST
dialog: alone..
text: He continues to pace up and down restlessly. He stands in the
text: middle of the room. Visibly deflates..
text: It‘s an intensely private moment. His face is long. His eyes
text: baggy and tired. For the first time his spirit seems broken.
text: Presently, the phone rings.
text: FROST stares at it for a while. Cannot face it. Finally he
text: goes to answer it. When he speaks, it’s with a quiet,
dialog: defeated voice.,
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I'll have a cheeseburger.
text: But the slurring voice at the other end does not belong to
speaker_heading: CAROLINE.
speaker_heading: VOICE (ON PHONE)
dialog: Mmm. Sounds good. I used to love
dialog: cheeseburgers. But Doctor Lundgren
dialog: made me give them up. Switched me to
text: cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
dialog: He calls them my Hawaian Burgers. But
text: they don’t taste like burgers at all.
dialog: They taste like styrofoam,

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Then what are you doing?
text: NIXON is flicking through a file on his desk. We notice it is
text: full of pictures of FROST.
speaker_heading: NIXON
text: A handsome young fellow. An eligible
text: young, bachelor, alone on a Friday
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: If you must know..I’m preparing for
dialog: our final session.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Ah, the all-important final session.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: ‘Watergate’.
text: NIXON continues to scan the file. We see newspaper headlines
dialog: about FROST's early career..
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: It's a small consolation to me that
dialog: for the next couple of days, that word
dialog: will be as much of a millstone around
dialog: your neck as it has been around mine.
dialog: Because I guess, the way you handle
dialog: Watergate will determine whether these
dialog: interviews are a success or failure.
dialog: Should I be nervous?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Well, I’m going to give it my best

speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Did the snobs there look down on you,
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I..I..

dialog: look down at us..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I..really..don’t know what you're
dialog: talking about..
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Yes, you do. C’mon. You know exactly.
dialog: No matter how many awards - or how
dialog: many column inches are written about
dialog: you - or how high the elected office
dialog: is for me - it still isn’t enough, am
dialog: I right? We still feel like the little
dialog: man? The loser they told us we were? A
dialog: hundred times. The smart-asses at
dialog: college. The high-ups. The well-born.
dialog: The people who’s respect we really

speaker_heading: NIXON

dialog: here now...? The two of us? Looking
dialog: for a way back? Into the sun? Into the

dialog: podium? Because we could feel it
dialog: slipping away? We were headed, both of
dialog: us, for the dirt. The place the snobs
dialog: always told us we'd end up. Face in

dialog: Various constitutional papers, the Statute with regard to the
dialog: Obstruction of Justice.
text: FROST’s eyes skim across the writing. Close on his PEN‘s nib

text: FROST listens to tapes. The President’s voice as he talks to

text: Suddenly FROST’s eyes come to rest on a name. CHARLES COLSON.
text: FROST drinks coffee. Stares at the name, ‘Colson’ and the

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 93.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Looking back over your final year in
dialog: office, do you feel you ever
dialog: obstructed justice or were part of a
dialog: conspiracy to cover-up or obstruct
dialog: justice?
text: NIXON gathers himself.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: No, I don‘t. And I’m interested...you
dialog: use the term ‘obstruction of justice’.
dialog: You perhaps have not read the statute
dialog: with regard to the obstruction of
dialog: justice.
speaker_heading: PROST
dialog: As it happens, I have.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: You have, you say? Well, then you‘ll
dialog: know it doesn’t just require an act.
dialog: It requires a specific, corrupt
dialog: motive. And in this case I didn’t have
dialog: a corrupt motive. What I was doing was
dialog: in the interests of political
dialog: containment.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Be that as it may, the direct
dialog: consequences of your actions would
dialog: have been that two convicted burglars
dialog: would have escaped criminal
dialog: prosecution. How can that NOT be a
dialog: cover-up or obstruction of justice?
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: I think the record shows, Mr. Frost,
dialog: that far from obstructing justice - I
dialog: was actively facilitating it. When Pat
dialog: Grey of the FBI called me on July 6th,
dialog: I said, “Pat, go right ahead with your
dialog: investigation.” Hardly what you'd call
text: obstructing justice.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: That may be. But for two weeks prior
dialog: to July 6th we now know, you were
text: desperately trying to contain or block
dialog: the investigation.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07 93A.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Now, hang on...
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) - 8/24/07
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Obstruction of justice is obstruction
dialog: of justice - if it’s for a minute or
dialog: five minutes. And it’s no defence to
dialog: say that your plan failed. I mean, if
dialog: I try to rob a bank and fail, that’s
dialog: no defence. I still tried to rob that
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Now, wait a minute, Mr. Frost...there
dialog: is no evidence of any kind..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: -».the reason there is no evidence is
dialog: because eighteen and a half minutes of
dialog: the conversation with Bob Haldeman
dialog: from this June period have
text: mysteriously been erased.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: An unfortunate oversight. But Bob
dialog: Haldeman is a rigorous and
dialog: conscientious note taker. And his
dialog: notes are there for all to see.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Well, we found something rather better
dialog: than his notes.
text: FROST produces RESTON‘'s notes..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: There’s one conversation with Charles
dialog: Colson in particular, which I don’t
dialog: think has ever been published..
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Hasn‘t been published you say?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: No, but one of my researchers found it

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: More than seen it, Mr. President, you
dialog: spoke the actual words.
text: face visibly jolts..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You've always claimed you first
dialog: learned of the break-in on June 23rd.
dialog: But this tape, made three days
dialog: earlier, clearly shows that to be a
dialog: falsehood. In it, you say to Colson,
dialog: "This whole investigation rests unless
text: one of the seven begins to talk.
dialog: That's the problem.”
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: What do we mean by “one of the seven
dialog: begins to talk"?
text: NIXON is clearly rattled now. He reaches for the handkerchief
text: beside the table..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Then moving onto a conversation you
dialog: had with John Dean on March 21st, the
dialog: following year, in one transcript
dialog: alone, in black and white, I picked
dialog: out, One, “You could get a million
dialog: dollars and you could get it in cash.
dialog: I know where it could be gotten”. Two,
dialog: “Your major guy to keep under control
dialog: is Hunt”. Three, “Don’t we have to
dialog: handle the Hunt situation?” Four, “Get
dialog: the million bucks. It would seem to me
dialog: that would be worthwhile.” Five,
dialog: “Don't you agree that you'd better get
dialog: the Hunt thing going?” Six, "First
dialog: you’ve got the Hunt problem. That
dialog: ought to be handled.” Seven, “The
dialog: money can be provided. Ehrlichman
dialog: could provide the way to deliver it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) — 8/24/07 96.
speaker_heading: FROST (cont'd)
dialog: That could be done.” Eight, “We've no
dialog: choice with Hunt but the $120,000, or
dialog: whatever it is, right?” Nine, “Christ,
dialog: turn over any cash we’ve got.”
text: FROST looks up at NIXON..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Now, it seems to me, that someone
dialog: running a cover-up couldn’t have
dialog: expressed it more clearly than that.
dialog: Could they?
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Look! Let me stop you right there.
dialog: You're doing something here which I am
dialog: not doing, and I will not do
dialog: throughout these broadcasts. You‘re
dialog: quoting me out of context, out of
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You have always maintained that you
dialog: knew nothing about any of this until
dialog: March 21st. But in February your
dialog: personal lawyer came to Washington to
dialog: start the raising of $219,000 of hush
dialog: money to be paid to the burglars. You
dialog: seriously expect us to believe you had
dialog: no knowledge of that?
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: None. I believed the money was for
dialog: humanitarian purposes to help
dialog: disadvantaged people with their
dialog: defences,
speaker_heading: FROST
text: Tt was being delivered on the tops of
text: phone booths with aliases and at
text: airports by people with gloves on.
dialog: That's not normally the way lawyers’

scene_heading: FROST/NIXON (Yellow Revs) — 8/24/07 97.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: All right, if Haldeman and Ehrlichman
dialog: were really the ones responsible, when

dialog: why didn’t you call the police and

speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Maybe I should’ve done. Maybe I
dialog: should’ve called the Feds into my
dialog: office and said, “Here are the two
text: men. Haul them down to the dock,
text: fingerprint them and throw them into
dialog: the can”. But I‘m just not made that
dialog: way. These men, Haldeman and
dialog: Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
dialog: Known them since they were just kids.
dialog: And I’ve always maintained - what they
dialog: were doing - what we were ALL doing
dialog: was not criminal. When you're in
dialog: office, you have to do a lot of things
dialog: that are not, in the strictest sense
dialog: of the law, legal. But you do them
dialog: because they’re in the greater
dialog: interests of the nation.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Wait a minute...did I hear right? Are
dialog: you really saying that there are
dialog: certain situations where the President
dialog: can decide whether it’s in the best
dialog: interests of the nation and do
dialog: something illegal?
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: I'm saying that when the President

dialog: About the mistakes you'd made and so
dialog: on. I’m wondering...would you go
dialog: further than mistakes? The word that
dialog: seems not enough for people to
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: Well, what word would you express?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: All right. Since you’ve asked me..
text: FROST throws down his clip-board..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: ..there are three things the American
dialog: People would like to hear you say.
dialog: One, there was probably more than
dialog: mistakes. There was wrongdoing - yes,
dialog: it might have been a crime too.
dialog: Secondly, I did abuse the power I had
dialog: as President. And thirdly, I put the
dialog: American people through two years of
dialog: agony and I apologize for that. And I
dialog: know how difficult it is for anyone to
dialog: admit that - most of all you. But I
dialog: just feel if you don’t, you’d regret
dialog: it the rest of your life.

speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: It‘s true, I made mistakes. Horrendous
dialog: ones - ones that were not worthy of a
dialog: President. Ones that did not meet the
dialog: standards of excellence that I always
dialog: dreamed of as a young boy. But if you
dialog: remember, it was a difficult time. I'd
dialog: been caught up in a “five front war”,
dialog: against a partisan media, a partisan
dialog: House of Congress, a partisan Ervin
dialog: Committee...
text: But NIXON tails off, as he catches himself...
speaker_heading: NIXON
dialog: But yes, I'd have to admit there were
dialog: times I did not fully meet that
dialog: responsibility, and...was involved in
dialog: a ‘cover up’ as you call it. And for
dialog: all those mistakes, I have a very deep
dialog: regret. I still insist they were
dialog: mistakes of the head, not mistakes of
dialog: the heart...but they were my mistakes
dialog: and I don‘t blame anyone else. I
dialog: brought myself down. I gave them a
dialog: sword. And they stuck it in...and they
dialog: twisted it with relish..and I guess,
dialog: if I'd been in their position, I’d
dialog: have done the same..
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: And the American People?
speaker_heading: NIXON
text: I let them down. I let down my
dialog: friends. I let down the country. Worst
dialog: of all, I let down our system of
dialog: government and the dreams of all those
dialog: young people that ought to get into
dialog: government but now think it’s too
dialog: corrupt. I let the American people
dialog: down, and I have to carry that burden
