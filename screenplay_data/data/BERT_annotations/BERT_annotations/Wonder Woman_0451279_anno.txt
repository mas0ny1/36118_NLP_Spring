speaker_heading: ANTIOPE
dialog: Yes, the blow was strong, but
dialog: Eliana's footwork betrayed her! A
dialog: battle is like a river-crossing,

speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA
dialog: Diana... You are the most precious

dialog: Long ago, when time was new, and
dialog: all of history was still a
dialog: dream... the gods ruled the Earth,
dialog: Zeus king among them.
text: PUSH IN as the painting seems to come alive, subtly
text: animates. Lightning and thunder herald the arrival of
text: ZEUS atop Olympus, surrounded by the PANTHEON OF GODS.
speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (O.S.)
dialog: Zeus created beings over which the
dialog: gods would rule -- beings born in
dialog: his image -- fair and good, strong
dialog: and passionate. Zeus called his
dialog: creation... man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And mankind was good.
text: Another flash of lightning REVEALS MANKIND.
speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (O.S.)
dialog: But one grew envious of Zeus' love
dialog: for mankind -- and sought to
dialog: corrupt his creation.
text: The painting seems to come alive again -- ARES, features
text: hidden in shadow beneath a fearsome, HORNED HELMET.
speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (O.S.)
dialog: This was Ares. The God of War.
text: The sky splits open and fire rains from the heavens. Men
text: take up arms, falling in line around Ares and becoming
speaker_heading: his ARMY.
speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (O.S.)
dialog: Ares poisoned men's hearts with
dialog: jealousy and suspicion, vengeance
dialog: and rage. He turned them against

text: From out of the sea rises: HIPPOLYTA, ANTIOPE, and
text: countless other figures -- WARRIOR WOMEN.
speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (V.O.)
dialog: So the gods made us, the Amazons,
dialog: to influence men's hearts with
dialog: love and to restore peace to the
dialog: world.
text: Standing behind Aphrodite on the shore, MEN watch the
text: women approach in awe, lowering their weapons.
speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (V.O.)
dialog: For a brief time, there was peace,
dialog: even a unity among the world, as
dialog: the gods and man fought side-by-
dialog: side against a great evil.
text: An ancient war is subtly depicted, but not lingered on.
dialog: If one looks close you'll see: THREE ARMIES -- The gods,
text: Amazons, and Atlanteans battling JACOB. Each army in
text: possession of a LOTUS.
text: ARES cleaves Jacob, then he looks to the LOTUS the humans
text: have discarded. He reaches for it --
speaker_heading: ANTIOPE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ANTIOPE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ANTIOPE (V.O.)
dialog: .... until only Zeus himself

speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA (V.O.)
dialog: ... striking him such a blow, the

text: Antiope attacks! Young Diana (8) tries to keep up -- and
dialog: to Antiope's surprise and satisfaction -- she does!
speaker_heading: ANTIOPE (V.O.)
dialog: But in the event he did, Zeus left
dialog: us a weapon, one powerful enough
dialog: to kill a God... to destroy Ares
dialog: before he could destroy mankind...
dialog: and us... with an endless war.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK (THEMYSCIRA) - DAY 17

speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA
dialog: We give thanks to the gods for

speaker_heading: YOUNG DIANA (8)
dialog: And the Godkiller?

speaker_heading: HIPPOLYTA

dialog: gifts the gods have given us.

speaker_heading: YOUNG DIANA (8)

text: A loud CREEEEAAAK pierces the water. The PILOT looks up

text: free and the engine and cockpit sink like stones.
text: As he sinks, he loses breath, the light fading.
text: Suddenly, out of nowhere, DIANA APPEARS ON THE PLANE'S
text: TAIL, above the surface. The sun blazes, framing her, an
text: epic vision -- like an angel.
text: The PILOT blinks into the light one last time. The DARK

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE

text: Out of earshot, Steve watches as Maru shows Ludendorff

text: Maru closes the notebook and sets it down, then releases

scene_heading: 39 EXT. ARMORY (THEMYSCIRA) - NIGHT 39
text: On this still, MOONLIT night, the armory stands
text: monolithic amongst the other buildings of Themyscira.
text: Diana surveys from an opposing hillside. The building's
text: face an impenetrable mountainside, accessible by only one
text: main entrance, completely blocked by SEVERAL GUARDS who
dialog: stand watch -- and even if she could take them all on,
text: Diana doesn't want to hurt them.
text: Studying the building further, she focuses on the SINGLE
text: WINDOW in the HIGH TOWER.
text: Diana's face darkens with fixed focus. She looks down at
text: her feet, back at the space -- calculating it all. She
text: turns to the hillside behind her, spots a distant branch
text: twisting from a tree. It looks relatively equidistant to
dialog: the armory.
text: She takes a step towards it, then another -- and another --
text: and Diana leaps into the air, locked on the branch -- but
text: she lands far before reaching it!
text: As Diana jogs to a stop, her frown fades: I know that I
dialog: can do this.
text: Diana sets off in a dead sprint towards the cliffside --
text: she LEAPS over the abyss below. Her face calm as she
dialog: SOARS through the night --
text: THE BUILDING BARRELS TOWARDS HER, her eyes widen.
text: Thinking fast she GRASPS a SPUR and --
text: She SLAMS into the side, holding on. She revels in the
text: moment briefly and then sobers: Now what?
text: The window is at least 30 feet above her -- below, the
text: abyss. The wind MOANS.
text: Diana's GRIP TIGHTENS on the spur.
text: Suddenly, the SPUR CRACKS! Diana falls --
text: She scrambles against the wall, her hands grasping at the
text: stone face. SHARDS FLYING around her, she realizes she's

scene_heading: 41 INT. ARMORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 41
text: In the moonlit darkness of the deserted armory, Diana
text: moves towards the GODKILLER SWORD. She takes it from its
text: SCABBARD, awed by its weight, its sheer power in her
text: hands. She holds it tight. It feels right.
text: As she leaves, she passes a suit of ancient armor and
text: SNATCHES ITS SHIELD.
text: Then the LASSO OF HESTIA disappears from its hook.
text: Diana, now half-dressed in GREEK ARMOR, admires a glowing
text: GOLDEN BELT-LIKE GIRDLE, then looks ahead to something
text: that really catches her eye.
text: BLURRY in our f.g., the silhouette of a woman's form

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: How long until we reach the war?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: The war? Well, which part? The

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Look, Princess, I like your

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hopefully nothing.
text: Steve leads Diana down a less-populated street.
text: Diana sees SM #1 and SM #2 tracking them on opposite

text: Steve, distracted, bumps right into SUITED MAN #3 and
text: looks down to find a GUN aimed at his gut.
speaker_heading: SUITED MAN #3
dialog: Captain Trevor, I believe you

scene_heading: 58 EXT. ALLEYWAY (LONDON) - CONTINUOUS ACTION 58

text: THREE of them have their GUNS out on Diana and Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Quite a reception.
speaker_heading: SUITED MAN #3

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Where did I put that thing?
text: At which point -- Steve KICKS THE GUN OUT OF SM #3's
text: HANDS, HITTING HIM INTO THE TWO OTHERS HOLDING GUNS.
text: Steve holds his arm up, "protecting" Diana --
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to Diana)
dialog: Stay behind me!
speaker_heading: SM #2 FIRES!
text: Steve pushes Diana out of the bullet's path, but Diana
text: reaches out -- THE BULLET BOUNCES OFF HER BRACELET!
text: EVERYONE FREEZES WITH ASTONISHMENT as Diana realizes her
dialog: bracelets may be more than just symbolic.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Or not.
dialog: SM #2 and SM #3 FIRE!
text: Diana RAISES BOTH BRACELETS, deflecting their bullets.
text: Her technique is clumsy at first as she gets used to the
text: torque, impact and SOUND.
text: Steve takes out SM #1 while Diana grabs SM #3 as his LAST
text: SHOT fires -- and lays him out with a blow.
text: Diana deflects the last of SM #2's bullets as his gun
text: runs EMPTY. Everyone is amazed, especially Steve --
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How'd you do that?
dialog: She smiles as if to say, you ain't seen nothing yet --
text: The remaining THREE SUITED MEN rush Steve and Diana.
text: Diana slams her fist into SM #2 while Steve takes on SM
dialog: #4.
text: Diana grabs the dazed SM #2 -- swings him around,
text: crashing him into SM #5 hard -- and they're both down. A
text: spilt second later, Steve finishes taking out SM #4.
text: The suited men run off, leaving only SM #1 behind. SM #1
text: stirs. Diana and Steve turn to see him make a run for it --
speaker_heading: ETTA (O.S.)
dialog: I thought you looked suspicious.
text: SM #1 is stopped in his tracks by Etta, wielding the

speaker_heading: ETTA
dialog: Where do you think you're going?

text: off his feet, onto his back.
text: As the lasso glows, Diana kneels at his side,
text: compassionately placing her hand on his chest. In her
dialog: mind, his actions are not his fault.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I am sorry. You are clearly under
dialog: his control. Let me help you get
dialog: free. Tell me where he is...
dialog: Where will I find Ares?

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: SIR PATRICK
dialog: Gentlemen! Germany is a proud

text: looks up at Sir Patrick.
speaker_heading: SIR PATRICK
dialog: (distracted by Diana)
dialog: Our only aim at this moment --
dialog: must be to achieve peace at any
dialog: cost.
text: The crowd GRUMBLES again, about a woman's presence there

speaker_heading: SIR PATRICK
dialog: Gentlemen, I beg you, please, if

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: SIR PATRICK

text: TIGHT ON: a GAS CANISTER. Maru turns a valve on it,
dialog: adjusting the pressure.
text: She screws the canister onto the side of a small GLASS
text: CHAMBER containing a GAS MASK. She locks the canister in

text: Ludendorff and Maru watch as the NEW GAS hisses in,
text: creeping towards the gas mask, enveloping it.
text: The mask begins to disintegrate -- thin cracks in the
text: glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the metal. It's
dialog: just as it was before.
text: Maru, filled with anticipation, wonders: Will it work
text: this time? It does. The gas continues, eating away at
text: the mask -- the glass cracks apart, the straps sever, the
text: metal breaks. A sign of the pain and horror it will soon

speaker_heading: 60A CONTINUED: 60A

speaker_heading: DARNELL

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Pull the troops out. Send me in.

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'll take you to the front, but I

speaker_heading: 66 CONTINUED: 66

text: FACTORY WORKERS board the train, solemnly and
text: purposefully.
text: Diana takes in an array of HUMAN EMOTION. Mothers
text: CRYING, fathers PROUD, sons COMMITTED and BRAVE, going

text: BOYFRIEND'S ARMS. DOGS are scooped up and hugged
dialog: goodbye.
text: Diana's eyes well as Steve checks his WATCH.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Train leaves in a few minutes.

text: Diana watches a MAN and his DAUGHTER walk away from an

text: her eyeing the girl eating, curious.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hungry?
text: Diana nods, smiling. Steve buys TWO ICE CREAM CONES.
text: Hands her one. She examines it, delighted.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's cold.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It's ice cream.

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's wonderful.
dialog: (to the ice cream

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Chief?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Smuggler. Very reputable.

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Careful, I might get offended.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I wasn't referring to you.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I went undercover and pretended to

dialog: firm.
text: Steve looks at her, still thinking she's a bit crazy --
dialog: but right now, she's absolutely right. He doesn't know

speaker_heading: THE CHIEF
dialog: Who is this?

scene_heading: NATIVE TONGUE --
speaker_heading: THE CHIEF
dialog: Niitangio, Napi.
dialog: And Diana understands.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I am Diana.
text: Chief does not let go, still looking intensely in Diana's

text: one foot. To stay on balance, she does so with the
text: opposite. Suddenly, Chief and Diana are arm wrestling,

speaker_heading: THE CHIEF
dialog: Where did you find her?
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DIANA

text: Moments later, Diana walks with Sameer. They look back
text: at Charlie, head hung low, shaken. Charlie fumbles with
text: his flask, dropping it.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: For all his talk of murdering
dialog: people from afar, your shooter
dialog: can't shoot.
speaker_heading: SAMEER
dialog: Not everyone gets to be who they
dialog: want to be all the time. Me, I
dialog: wanted to be an actor, not a
dialog: soldier. But I'm the wrong color.
text: Diana considers this, then she turns, sees The Chief with
text: a small group of BELGIANS from the trench, including
text: Marie and her family. All of them ragged, sleep-
text: deprived, and starving, but hopeful. The Chief dispenses
text: bread and cheese. Diana notices that no money changes

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: SAMEER

speaker_heading: ETTA
dialog: Not yet, but we've located him.

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (to Steve)
dialog: You shouldn't be worried about

text: Steve motions her to please stop talking about "Ares."
text: Then Diana, a terrible realization.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Of course... It makes complete
dialog: sense. Ares developed a weapon,
dialog: the worst ever devised.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
text: She turns and look at Trevor.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No. I mean Ares. Ludendorff is

speaker_heading: SIR PATRICK
dialog: Steve?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sir, this is our chance to find

speaker_heading: SAMEER

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's bitter.
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You're not going to the gala.
speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (re: the other

speaker_heading: STEVE
text: It's a snowfall.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's magical.

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No idea.

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Maybe... once I defeat Ares and

text: she's unsure of what she's feeling.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Perhaps you could show me what
dialog: you're working on. I hear it's
dialog: extraordinary.
text: Steve's about to get the answers he needs when -- DIANA,
text: in Fausta's gown, MAKES HER ENTRANCE, at the top of the
text: stairs -- her uniform underneath, the GODKILLER peeking
text: out from the back of her dress, the hilt looking like a
text: piece of JEWELRY. Heads turn at the stunning Amazon.
text: Steve's completely torn, does he stay and gets his
dialog: answers from Maru -- or stop Diana from getting to
dialog: Ludendorff? Maru makes the decision for him --
speaker_heading: MARU
dialog: I appreciate your interest in my
dialog: work, but I am loyal to General
dialog: Ludendorff. Besides, I see now
dialog: your attention is elsewhere.
scene_heading: DIANA AND LUDENDORFF'S EYES MEET. It is an INTENSE

speaker_heading: LUDENDORFF
dialog: (happily surprised)
dialog: You know your Ancient Greeks.
dialog: They understood that war is a god.
dialog: One that requires human sacrifice.
text: Her heart pounds.
speaker_heading: LUDENDORFF
dialog: And in exchange, war gives man
dialog: purpose. A chance to rise above
dialog: his petty, mortal little life and
dialog: be better than he is.
speaker_heading: ON DIANA
dialog: There's no question now: This is Ares.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Only one of the many gods believed

speaker_heading: LUDENDORFF
dialog: My apologies. You'll excuse me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Enjoy the fireworks.
text: Just as he turns his back on Diana, she reaches for her

text: them, facing her! He pulls Diana away from Ludendorff,
text: taking her hand -- dancing with her as cover.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: The dancing is anything but what it was in last time.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You agreed to wait.
speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: DIANA

text: They trade blows.
text: He grabs a BAYONETTED RIFLE mounted on the wall.
text: Ludendorff uses the rifle as A GUN, A SPEAR, and A SWORD.
text: He HITS Diana again and again -- but Diana strikes back
