text: As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
text: open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
text: near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind

speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
dialog: What are you looking at?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: The wind, Mother... They say a

dialog: see you...
scene_heading: 1 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT 1
text: Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
text: enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
text: An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
text: turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
text: blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
text: connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
text: drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
text: Southern lilt.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: If it wasn't for hurricanes we
dialog: wouldn't have a hurricane season.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: I've forgotten what the weather
dialog: can be like here. I've lived with
dialog: four seasons so many years now.
text: We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER,
text: in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
dialog: window...
scene_heading: DOROTHY BAKER
dialog: I saw on the news they're
dialog: predicting trouble...
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: 1928 they stacked people like

speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: Can I do anything for you, Mother?
dialog: Make anything easier?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
dialog: Caroline. This is what it is...
dialog: I'm finding it harder to keep my
text: eyes open... my mouth all filled
dialog: with cotton...
text: And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
text: nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
text: it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.
scene_heading: DOROTHY BAKER
dialog: There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
dialog: scratch yourself to ribbons...
dialog: (to Caroline)
dialog: It's their way of letting go...
dialog: (the finality)
dialog: ...prob'ly today.
text: Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
text: admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
dialog: everything even more present...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Do you want more medication,
dialog: Mother? The doctor said you can
dialog: have all you want.
text: Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
text: seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
text: cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
text: comforting her.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (CONT'D)
dialog: A friend told me she never had a
dialog: chance to say goodbye to her
dialog: mother.
dialog: (grateful to have the
dialog: chance)

text: They hold each other for some time... They separate...
text: And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
dialog: about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
text: their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
dialog: question...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you afraid?
speaker_heading: DAISY
text: Curious. What comes next...
text: She winces at some physical pain.
scene_heading: DOROTHY BAKER
text: The pain's coming more steadily...
dialog: Her breathing will falter soon...
dialog: No need for her to suffer..
text: She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
text: drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
text: sound, crosses her mind... and she says...
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: They built that train station in
dialog: 1918. Your father was there the

speaker_heading: THE DOCTOR
dialog: Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going

speaker_heading: THOMAS BUTTON
dialog: That's enough...! All of you!

text: not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor,
dialog: or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a
text: deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all
text: turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY
text: continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to

speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Mr. Button...!
text: He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has

dialog: Mercy, I'll be right there.
text: And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser
text: drawer... with her unmentionables... and shuts it...
text: leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe...
text: Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost,
text: looking in the room...
scene_heading: MRS. HOLLISTER
dialog: My sister gave those pearls to

scene_heading: 27 INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918 27
text: We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has
dialog: done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing

scene_heading: 28 INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT, 1918 28

speaker_heading: DOCTOR ROSE
text: ... He's nearly blind from
dialog: cataracts... I'm not sure he can
dialog: hear... His bones indicate severe

dialog: deterioration, the infirmities,
dialog: not of a newborn, but of a man
text: well in his eighties on the way to
dialog: his grave...
speaker_heading: QUEENIE
dialog: You mean to say he's dying?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR ROSE
text: Of old age. His body is failing

speaker_heading: DOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where did he come from?
speaker_heading: QUEENIE
dialog: (after a beat)

speaker_heading: DOCTOR ROSE
dialog: There are places for 'unwanted'

scene_heading: 29 INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1918 29

speaker_heading: QUEENIE (CONT'D)

dialog: Benjamin... He's not a well

speaker_heading: ONE OF THE WOMEN
dialog: I had ten children... there's not
dialog: a baby I can't care for... let me

speaker_heading: TIZZY

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: 33 CONTINUED: 33
dialog: The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a
text: six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small,
text: shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with
dialog: arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a
text: hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one
dialog: ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are
text: sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the
dialog: last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we
text: watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might,
dialog: banging it just for the hell of it making noise...
speaker_heading: QUEENIE
dialog: Stop bangin' that fork...
dialog: (fixing it in his
dialog: arthritic hand)
dialog: It's for eating, not for playin'
dialog: with... And use your napkin,
dialog: please Mr. Benjamin...
text: And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of

text: having dinner with his contemporaries.
scene_heading: 34 EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925 34
dialog: A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-
text: year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between
text: them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,
text: sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making

text: other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...
text: Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children
dialog: playing... people talking...
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN BUTTON
dialog: What's there?
text: Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally
text: curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself
text: precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
text: is lower and he just sees the street... children running
text: on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off
text: for a party... He leans forward to get an even better
text: view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...
speaker_heading: QUEENIE
dialog: Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come
dialog: back here...!

speaker_heading: BENJAMIN BUTTON
dialog: Somedays I feel like I'm different
dialog: from the day before...
speaker_heading: QUEENIE

dialog: Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN BUTTON
dialog: How much longer do I have to live,
dialog: Mother?
speaker_heading: QUEENIE
dialog: Just be thankful you got what
dialog: you're given. You already here
dialog: longer than you supposed to be.
text: We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
dialog: Some nights, I would have to sleep
dialog: alone.
text: He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying
text: him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy
text: going back down into the room to be with Queenie...
text: shutting the door...
scene_heading: 36 INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925 36
