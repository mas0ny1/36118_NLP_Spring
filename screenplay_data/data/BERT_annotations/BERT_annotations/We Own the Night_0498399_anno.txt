speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: 
text: A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY...
text: THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the
text: foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF
text: MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems
text: to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER
scene_heading: LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.
dialog: 
text: MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS
scene_heading: BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS
scene_heading: FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:
dialog: 
dialog: New York, New York. 1988.
dialog: 
text: A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing
text: with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in
dialog: recent memory.
dialog: 
text: The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic
dialog: groups rise up to seize control without respect for
dialog: traditional rules of engagement.
dialog: 
text: Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and
text: scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their
dialog: own at the rate of twice a month...
dialog: 
text: The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER
text: THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to
text: ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING
text: POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"...
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital
text: and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are
text: stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM
dialog: 
text: The camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties,
text: dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the
text: wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: ...you're so fuckin' beautiful, you
dialog: know that...?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She beams. They kiss, PASSIONATELY. SUPERIMPOSE:
text: "BROOKLYN". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as
dialog: they DEVOUR each other:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: I love you, baby...
dialog: 
text: Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFLED VOICE
dialog: Bobby! You in there?
dialog: 
text: No ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE
text: BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFLED VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bobby! [If] you two could just
dialog: keep your hands off each other for
dialog: a second--I, I think we got a
dialog: situation brewin' out front!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: It's Jumbo... We gotta go anyway...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: (beat; to the door)
dialog: I'll be out in a second, Louis!
dialog: 
text: She grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again.
text: She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
dialog: 
text: A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,
text: pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,
text: straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,
text: fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.
text: Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he
text: appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his
text: name. He is having a blast.
dialog: 
text: Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of
text: Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.
scene_heading: He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS."
text: Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a
text: pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a
text: swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,
text: claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES
text: every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.
scene_heading: WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table,
text: surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne-
text: scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men,
text: PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: NEAR THE COAT CHECK
dialog: 
text: Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we
text: SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats,
text: slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their
text: coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets.
text: Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian
text: with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of
dialog: it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the
speaker_heading: DRUG TRADE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY
dialog: 
text: A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons
text: and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO
text: moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI,
text: forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around
text: him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says "SECURITY" on it.
text: He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby
text: arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: What the fuck's goin' on in here?
dialog: 
text: Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON,
text: puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE
text: TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend,
text: watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly
text: detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He
text: balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding
text: spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing
dialog: his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got
dialog: everything under control here--so
dialog: uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take
dialog: my break!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Yeah--just keep that wide load of
dialog: yours outta trouble, arright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Yes, your fuckin' majesty!
dialog: 
text: The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from
text: Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: What're you doing?!? You gotta
dialog: behave yourself here!
dialog: 
text: Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS
text: saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen
text: drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap.
text: Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE
text: helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is
text: flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON
text: HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who
text: hurls his guy out of frame):
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLOODIED PATRON
dialog: C'mon, Mr. Green! I didn't do
dialog: nothing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Well now you're gonna do nothing
dialog: someplace else!
dialog: (louder, to all
dialog: fighters; pointing:)
dialog: Now listen--one of these days I'm
dialog: gonna run this whole block, and I
dialog: see any you in here again--any you--
dialog: I'll bust your fuckin' hole!
dialog: (to Freddie)
dialog: Throw `em out on their ass. I
dialog: gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys
dialog: with the old man.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: An ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors
text: with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them.
text: Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in.
dialog: 
dialog: We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played
text: downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits
text: MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old,
text: kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife,
text: KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with
text: the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARAT BUZHAYEV
dialog: Bobby! Come here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Mr. Buzhayev, how are you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. The two EMBRACE
text: WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev
text: touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs
text: BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly,
text: amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)
dialog: So beautiful! Beautiful!
dialog: 
text: Bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention.
text: Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do
dialog: something right now. But don't
dialog: worry--everything's in good shape
dialog: downstairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARAT BUZHAYEV
dialog: (warm, gentle)
dialog: Yes, good. You take care of things
dialog: good for us...
dialog: 
text: Marat smiles. Then, as Bobby stands:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Next week, you come by--we talk.
dialog: Okay? We talk about plans for you.
dialog: 
text: Bobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries
text: to give him a small care package of food. He politely
text: refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in
dialog: Russian ("He said he didn't want any food, and you keep
text: trying to give it to him!") breaks out between the old
text: husband and his wife. As Bobby exits:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KALINA BUZHAYEV
dialog: (broken English)
dialog: Bobby! Where you run off to?!?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - SUMMER EVENING
dialog: 
text: A modern church. A big crowd in front, made up of POLICE.
text: We HEAR MUSIC. CLOSE SHOT of a black outdoor sign, behind
text: glass. "OUR LADY, QUEEN OF MARTYRS CHURCH, QUEENS, NY".
scene_heading: TILT DOWN: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling out
scene_heading: "NYPD PULASKI SOCIETY MTG. - 7 PM". SUPERIMPOSE: "QUEENS".
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: The MUSIC explodes down here. A large room with columns.
text: Streamers, balloons everywhere. Old cops, young cops, men,
text: women, are here. Skinny, portly, giddy, drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: Many are IN UNIFORM, loosened up a bit, like they've just
dialog: gotten off work and it's time to relax. Children run
text: about. American, New York State flags. Pictures on the
text: walls: people with plaques, portraits. ARCHIE BUNKER'S NEW
text: YORK. A SIGN READS: "CONGRATULATIONS! TO `CAPTAIN JOSEPH
text: GRUSINSKY'". Cases filled with trophies. Food tables,
text: piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.
dialog: 
text: Many COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making
text: sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT,
text: GAB, MAKE OUT. FLASH! Pictures taken constantly. A mass
text: of people surround TWO PEOPLE as a PHOTO is taken:
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER
text: BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically
text: so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is
text: SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and
text: holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next
text: to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their
text: older infant, TEDDY.
dialog: 
text: NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we
dialog: will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex-
text: military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.
dialog: 
text: Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates:
text: MICHAEL SOLO ("G.Q."), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK
text: SHAPIRO ("Pudge"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge
text: hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured
text: son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Here, take another one! Get
dialog: another!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Pop, they got enough! What're you
dialog: doin'?!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: (in Joseph's ear)
dialog: You want your face out there--it's
dialog: good exposure. The PC's gonna see
dialog: this.
dialog: (to the Photographer)
dialog: C'mon. With both kids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Thanks, Chief!

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Yeah, you tol' me a thousand times.

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: We MOVE past partygoers. THEN, APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

dialog: 
text: Burt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with
dialog: subdued "hellos." She is not exactly, well, PROPER-

text: to act as though she doesn't care. Burt turns to Bobby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: We gotta talk to you. Alone.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON BOBBY. This gives him pause, but Rosario gives

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - UPSTAIRS
dialog: 
text: Jack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty
dialog: main hall of the church. Looking for anyone who may be
text: hanging out, ducking in and around. They spot a COUPLE,
text: making out in one of the pews. The man is shirtless, the
text: woman in her bra. Caught, they let out an embarrassed
text: CHUCKLE. With offense, but also humor:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: In a house of God, no less? C'mon,
dialog: get up...
dialog: 
text: The couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their
text: clothes. As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph
text: coming up the stairs. Joseph pulls up the rear, standing
text: behind his father. Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated
text: several rows back. BEAT, then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got on.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Bobby looks behind him. He's SURROUNDED. Interrogation-

text: Vadim--he's eating off six different plates. Bobby is
text: really only focused on Rosario. When Rosario sees him
dialog: (she'd been counting bills) she brightens, virtually
dialog: getting out of her seat:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Hi, honey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: Bobby--c'mon, join us! I wanna
dialog: talk to you!
dialog: 
text: AD-LIB GREETINGS. Bobby sits between Rosario and
text: Nezhinski. Rosario kisses him, grabs onto his arm; Vadim
text: puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder. Turns to his people:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the fuckin' guy right here.
text: Practically owns the place.
dialog: 
text: MUMBLED AGREEMENT. The men surrounding Vadim are "yes"
text: men, and they seem to take their cue from him. To Bobby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything all right with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: (nods; then, coolly:)
dialog: Things're goin' good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: That's real good... `Cause you
dialog: gotta be happy, you know? All my
dialog: guys, I tell `em, the mind and the
dialog: body, they're connected. That's
dialog: how you stay sharp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY
dialog: This's "Kid Quick" you're talking

dialog: 
text: Bobby looks at Vadim's ample waistline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: He don't look like a middleweight
dialog: no more.

speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: You know Bobby, my uncle upstairs,

dialog: thinks you're one of his kids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Your uncle's a great man. Smart
dialog: man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: Yeah... Smart smart stupid. Got
dialog: his head buried in books all day,
dialog: `stead of the real world...
dialog: 
text: AD-LIB amusement from the "yes" men. Vadim moves closer:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen uh, I come to you, I tell
dialog: you I got some friends bringin' a
dialog: load in here, maybe something big--
dialog: I'm just talking now--they bring it
dialog: in, how do you feel about that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Your uncle loses his license, he
dialog: ain't gonna be too happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: Well, upstairs don't gotta know
dialog: everything, am I right? Place gets
dialog: packed every night, everybody wins.
dialog: 
text: Bobby does not respond, instead nodding to some patrons who
text: shout out hellos. Vadim shakes Bobby's shoulder with
dialog: affection. Intimate:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, you should think about
dialog: comin' in with us. You're popular--
dialog: you could help us...expand a
dialog: little. A lotta money in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Yeah...I'll think about that.

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

dialog: 
dialog: These words hit Rosario, and we SEE that she's troubled by
text: her own behavior because she stares at her shoes,
text: momentarily speechless. He grabs her:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear what I said?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Yeah, I heard. But I need the
dialog: money right now, Bobby. And I'm

scene_heading: EVERYTHING--
dialog: 
text: Bobby purses his lips, frustrated. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Just hold off then, for a little
dialog: while. Okay? I got my reasons.
dialog: 
text: Momentarily confused, she mutters a "'kay," then kisses
text: him. Bobby moves the hair from Rosario's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: I love you...
dialog: 
text: BOBBY'S ABOUT TO RESPOND IN KIND WHEN... All of a SUDDEN:
scene_heading: BOOM! PANIC. SCREAMING. LIGHTS.
dialog: 
text: The DOORS at the club's entrance have burst open. LOUD,
text: like a gunshot. COPS enter. Plainclothes and uniformed
text: both. JOSEPH comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs
text: around his neck. WITH COMMAND:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Everybody! Get your hands on your
dialog: head and don't fuckin' move!
dialog: (to a woman)
dialog: Turn off that music. Right now!
dialog: 
text: FOUR UNIFORMED COPS BOLT straight to the COAT CHECK AREA.
text: ALL KINDS OF DRUGS and WEAPONS start falling to the FLOOR.

scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN'S ROOM
dialog: 
text: Some girls rush in, others are already inside. Two PRETTY
text: YOUNG WOMEN are in the corner, FREEBASING, when COPS BURST
text: IN. One of the Pretty Girls, out of surprise, starts to
text: shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it. The opposite
text: occurs, and the flame IGNITES THE ETHER. THE TWO GIRLS
text: BURST INTO FLAMES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COPS
dialog: Holy shit! Get the extinguishers--
dialog: call paramedics!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM
dialog: 
text: The cops pin EVERYONE up against the wall or on the ground.
text: EVERYONE IS LINED UP, SEARCHED. I.D.s are checked. Bobby
dialog: turns to Rosario:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Gimme your shit!
dialog: 
text: Troubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his
text: palm. Bobby quickly SWALLOWS them. A UNIFORMED COP
dialog: approaches Bobby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED COP
dialog: Hey! I saw that! Get your hands
dialog: on your fuckin' head!
dialog: 
text: Bobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched; Rosario
text: is tossed aside. The Uniformed Cop, to someone else:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED COP (CONT'D)
dialog: Jessie! This one just ingested!
dialog: 
dialog: All patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly
text: lined up, HANDS CLASPED on the backs of their heads.
text: PARAMEDICS SPEED to the LADIES' ROOM. JESSIE THE COP takes
text: out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and
text: forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal:

speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Arright, open up--a little

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

text: confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is
text: uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Give everybody a toss. G.Q.--
dialog: 
text: This gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to
text: him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to
text: LOUIS, pokes his gut:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Too much pizza, right there.
dialog: 
text: Several COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice
text: versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness
text: muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has
text: his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart.
text: (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on
dialog: Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn around... Turn around!
dialog: 
text: Vadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him. He pulls
text: a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Want me to double your money? Huh?
dialog: 
text: Vadim doesn't answer. Joseph takes out a HUGE SWISS ARMY
text: KNIFE he's got on his keychain. He cuts the wad in half.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. It's doubled now, how's
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: Michael and Jack search the other members of Vadim's party.
text: They rip out pockets. Michael points to a WOMAN'S FUR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: You got anything in there?
dialog: 
text: He motions for the MINK. She hands it over. HE PATS IT
scene_heading: DOWN CAREFULLY. NOTHING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
dialog: 
text: The Uniformed Cop puts handcuffs on Bobby and others.
text: Rosario watches, upset but powerless. Louis is down, next

text: AND THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN (in cuffs) from behind
text: the coat check. Bobby is pulled up, on his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACK TO
dialog: 
text: Joseph interrogating Vadim. As he looks through I.D.:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (SUBTITLE)
dialog: You got a cross AND a Jewish star
dialog: on you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
dialog: The cross is for good luck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: What's the star for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: That one's for God.
dialog: 
text: Just then, MICHAEL SOLO interjects. In Joseph's ear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Coupla dimes on `em--cocaine, a
dialog: little PCP.
dialog: 
text: Joseph nods, acknowledging this news. He EYES Vadim, then
dialog: turns to the TWO MEN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Okay, let's go. You. And you--
dialog: (to the Young Man)
dialog: You're under arrest, possession and
dialog: sale of narcotics--
dialog: 
text: Michael reads two other men, one of whom is a TALL MAN from
text: near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their Miranda rights
text: in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them.
dialog: 
text: PARAMEDICS exit the WOMEN'S ROOM. Girls are on STRETCHERS.
dialog: 
text: MARAT BUZHAYEV enters the main room of the club. He is
text: ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously
text: NOT ARRESTING HIM. They are asking him questions and
text: writing down his comments. He TURNS TO SEE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A HUMILIATED BOBBY, who eyes him back. Bobby is then
text: quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat
text: watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left
text: behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM.
text: Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the
dialog: Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your boy's gonna turn. And then
dialog: we'll come back for you.
dialog: 
text: JOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE
text: BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE
text: YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back
text: to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is
text: hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HOLDING CELLS
dialog: 
dialog: The station: 1980's-era, very unlike ones seen on T.V. The
text: walls are tan brick, peppered with fallout shelter signs.
text: Archaic, Robert Moses era-like. Lit entirely by large
text: fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and
dialog: typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies.
text: A big sign above a bulletin board reads, "WE OWN THE
text: NIGHT." Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse.
text: There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTLY COP
dialog: Jesus Christ, what the hell's goin'
dialog: on in here?
dialog:

text: Cops huddle around him as he kicks and screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED COP
dialog: Russian guy fuckin' slashed
dialog: himself!

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STATION - DAWN
dialog:

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, you and your

dialog: 
text: Bobby looks around. Nobody's listening. He opens up.
text: With quiet but real fury, and total sarcasm:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Okay, I'll go thank him too then.
dialog: He comes in, raids the fuckin'

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM

text: left. A MAN WITH A HOOD OVER HIS HEAD. Looks almost like
text: an old-time Klansman, with two holes cut into the hood for
text: his eyes. He's pointing a GUN RIGHT AT JOSEPH. Joseph's
text: eyes pop, and he lets out a quick gasp--but he has no real
text: time to react. The man pulls the trigger.
text: A THUNDERCLAP slaps the silence in the neighborhood: THE
text: GUN HAS FIRED. A FLASH OF LIGHT.
dialog: 
text: A MIST OF BLOOD plumes around Joseph's head. The bullet
text: hits Joseph in the face, through the CHEEK. HE snaps back
dialog: spasmodically.
dialog: 
text: AN AUTOMOBILE, a MONTE CARLO, pulls up to the scene of the
text: crime. Another HOODED MAN in the back seat throws what
text: looks like a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL into Joseph's CAR. The AUTO
text: starts to BURN. Joseph lies on the sidewalk, bullet in the
text: head, his blood everywhere. He seems pretty dead to us.
text: The Monte Carlo SPEEDS OFF.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MONTE CARLO
dialog: 
text: The Shooter slumps into his seat, ducking out of sight of
text: the street. He pulls the hood off, over his head. It is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Get us onto the expressway... Move!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET

text: Joseph, on the ground. The car burns in relative silence.
text: Dogs barking in the neighborhood. A beat.

scene_heading: INT. POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE BOXING GYM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The PAL gym, filled with off-duty cops boxing, jumping

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog:

dialog: with fellow cops:

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: You gotta keep your hands up! Keep
dialog: your hands up!
dialog: 
text: Then he SEES, in a LARGE MIRROR: TWO UNIFORMED COPS and the
text: POLICE CHAPLAIN EDWIN O'CONNOR, standing near the doorway.
text: He stops his exercise. They approach him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED COP
dialog: Chief...?
dialog: 
text: After a long beat, Burt's expression changes, and he senses
text: something bad. A long look at the men. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Which kid is it?
dialog: 
text: The cops turn to each other. Burt tries to prep himself,
dialog: but it's impossible; we SEE the cracks in his sangfroid:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE CHAPLAIN
dialog: It's Joseph. He's at St. John's
dialog: Hospital.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It don't look good right now.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED COP
dialog: You want us to contact your other
dialog: son--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: No. Go on, I'll be right out...
dialog: 
text: Hesitantly, they leave. He crouches near his gymbag.
text: Closes his eyes. The color drains from his face. Then,
text: seeing other cops eyeing him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you lookin' at?!?
speaker_heading: (SOFTER)

scene_heading: INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: SMOKE AND DRINK everywhere. MADONNA'S "DRESS YOU UP" plays
text: in the background. CROWDED. Bobby, Rosario, and Louis are
text: at the center of a poker game. Lou sits next to Bobby,
text: partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear
text: from time to time. Rosario sits next to Bobby and watches
text: the game intently.
dialog: 
text: The poker pot seems exceptionally large. A STOCKY LATINO
text: MAN is the main one competing with Bobby. Bobby's a mess,
dialog: maybe worse than we've yet seen him. But he is HAPPILY
text: DRUNK, his eyes BLOODSHOT. He and Louis look at their
text: cards. Rosario turns, looks at Bobby for a BEAT. She sees
text: a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Baby, you got a little bruise here--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: That ain't nothing.
dialog: 
text: He starts rubbing her between the legs, under the table.
text: She kisses his bruise again. Louis pokes her. Smiling and
text: pointing to his crotch:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: I got a bruise too, you know--right
dialog: here!
dialog: 
text: Rosario lets out a loud laugh. Louis whispers pearls of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
dialog: So Bob, I think we fold.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We fold, right?
dialog: 
text: Bobby ignores him. Instead, aloud, to the Latino man:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: We'll see you and bump you two C's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: (whispered too loud)
dialog: We will?
dialog: 
text: Bobby turns to him, winks. The PHONE IS RINGING. A LOT.
text: ROSARIO gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and
text: picks up with a soft "hello". Meanwhile, Bobby puts a
text: whole lot of cash in the middle. The Latino Man looks at
text: him like he's crazy. Finally:

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOCKY LATINO MAN
dialog: Goddamnit!

speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Bobkes, I love you!
dialog:

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby--it's for you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head as if to say, "I don't know." Slightly
text: peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the
text: table. As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: I was the one told him to keep
dialog: goin'!
dialog: 
text: Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the
text: phone, several feet away from the ruckus. He covers his
dialog: free ear with his hand to hear better:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO (PHONE FILTER)
dialog: Bobby, it's Michael Solo--I got
dialog: some bad news.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Your brother's been shot. He's at

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bobby, of course, is stunned. The poker table in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Is--is he gonna be all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Listen, your father's coming--I
dialog: gotta go. But he's at St. John's.
dialog: 
text: HANG UP. Bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same.
text: Rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: My brother was shot...they're

dialog: 
text: Rosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is. She
text: pulls him to her:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: You gotta go see him--be there for
dialog: him and your father.
dialog: 
text: Bobby eyes her, walks to the table. A CLOSE SHOT on him.

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: STOCKY LATINO MAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STOCKY LATINO MAN
dialog: Fuck you, man! We're in deep here!
dialog:

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Louis, lock up and take her home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: (confused, he nods)
dialog: Sure, Bob. Everything cool?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta
dialog: do something, that's all--
dialog: 
text: Pats Louis' arm as if to reassure him. Then the Latino Man
text: tries to grab some of the pot. OTHER PLAYERS REVOLT:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER PLAYERS
dialog: Hey--HEY! What the fuck?!?
dialog: 
text: A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. Louis moves over to the WOMEN, holding
dialog: them back (odd--they weren't going anywhere to begin with):
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Take it easy, TAKE IT EASY! Calm
dialog: down and everything'll be, uh, non
dialog: compos mentis!
dialog: 
text: PUSHING, SHOVING. PUNCHING. Bobby exits his place,
text: leaving behind Rosario and Louis and chaos...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bobby walks briskly to the entrance. MEDIA are all around,
text: but they aren't paying attention to him. They are
text: elsewhere, with members of the police, each other, etc....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. E.R. WAITING ROOM
dialog:

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: Most of the cops don't seem to recognize Bobby at all. All
text: the NEWS MEDIA are outside, banned from the hospital's
dialog: interior.
dialog: 
text: BURT emerges from the hallway. He sees Bobby, at first
text: comforted by the sight of his son. But quickly he darkens,
text: and starts to walk right past him. Sotto:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Pop?
dialog: 
text: Burt keeps walking. Bobby follows:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pop, he all right?
dialog: 
text: Bobby touches his father's arm, and Burt spins around:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: What do you want? You stayed out
dialog: of it--you got what you wanted.
dialog: Why don't you go somewhere and pick
dialog: a fight--you're good at that!
dialog: 
text: Bobby is speechless for a moment. Burt pulls his arm away
text: and walks on. A MUSTACHIOED COP approaches Burt:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUSTACHIOED COP
dialog: Chief, the union sent a shrink over

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Nah, I don't want that crap.

text: ENTER: someone we recognize as the MAYOR storms in with his
scene_heading: ENTOURAGE. The COMMISSIONER (WILLIAM RUDDY--we'll see him

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, your honor. Commissioner.
dialog: Thank you for coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR
text: Chief Grusinsky, an attack on an

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)
dialog: He was real lucky--considering.

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Bobby--that ain't a good idea.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I probably should've told you not
dialog: to come down here--there're a lotta
text: things going on right now.
dialog: 
dialog: A beat, then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: You guys blaming me for this? Is
dialog: that it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Listen, I ain't judging you--I
dialog: called you `cause I thought you had
dialog: a right to know. But we're gonna
dialog: be going hard after Nezhinski--and
dialog: maybe some other people you're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: That's bullshit--she's clean. You

text: Bobby storms out of the room to:
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: He turns toward Intensive Care. SEES a CROWD DOWN THE
text: HALL. Two GUARDS block the doors to the ward. Determined,
text: Bobby decides to walk over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sorry. Nobody's allowed in except
dialog: immediate family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Yeah. That's me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: You got some I.D.?
dialog: 
text: Bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet. As he does, we HEAR
text: a SOFT CHIME. A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDS on the P.A.:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Good evening. As a friendly
dialog: reminder, visiting hours will be
dialog: over in five minutes. Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Says here your name is "Green."

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: GUARD

text: Charges past the Guard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: The Guards stop him, and a messy struggle ensues.
dialog: 
text: All of a sudden, Joseph's wife SANDRA emerges from the
text: ward. She looks devastated. The struggle stops. All fall
text: silent, out of respect. Bobby steps back. Sandra turns to
dialog: look at Bobby. To the Guards:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA GRUSINSKY
dialog: It's okay.
dialog: 
text: Bobby walks toward the entrance. Stops. Sandra seems to

text: aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WARD
dialog: 
text: Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face
text: is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the
text: CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is
text: completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages
text: that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion
text: surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN.
dialog: 
dialog: It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't
text: expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open
text: slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at
text: Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm
text: gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand.
text: Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Sir...?
dialog: 
text: Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The
text: connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs
text: them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking
text: OUTPOURING of FEELING from him.
dialog: 
text: He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting
dialog: hours are over.
dialog: 
text: He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He

dialog: CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on
text: the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE.

text: Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught.
text: He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino
text: teens smoking CRACK.
dialog:

text: barely audible, his voice cracking:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: ...Feels like it was my fault...
dialog: 
text: He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach.
text: She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head.

dialog: "no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT

text: Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses
text: Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She
text: looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine.
text: Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and
dialog: is busy putting on a show--as usual:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Where'd you run off to, like a Jew?

speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI

speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI

speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI

text: The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk. Bobby stands in the
text: cold, waiting, holding his bag of money. Alone. Takes out
text: the LIGHTER, the LISTENING DEVICE. He fires it--it works.
text: Looks at his watch. In rummaging through his pockets for a
text: smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number
text: on it. He APPROACHES a nearby PHONE BOOTH. Bobby holds
text: the paper in his hand, dials the number. A voice answers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
dialog: Hello?

scene_heading: INT. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL - INTERCUT

speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (PHONE FILTER)
dialog: Hello...?
dialog: 
text: Bobby SEES Pavel's CAR DRIVE UP. Bobby hangs up the phone.
dialog: Takes a deep breath. We HEAR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Dude! Hey, dude!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDWALK STREET
dialog: 
text: Bobby approaches the car. Pavel is in the back seat,
text: calling to him with the window open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY
dialog: Get in!
dialog: 
text: Bobby approaches the automobile. Pavel is in the back
text: seat, calling to him with the window open. Another
text: American sedan behind them. Bobby enters Pavel's.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVERY CAR
dialog: 
text: Bobby takes the front passenger seat. Pavel is behind him.
dialog: Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car
text: pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel
text: over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE.
text: Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay
dialog: calm...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY
dialog: Put your hands out, where I could
dialog: see `em.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: You know me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY
dialog: Shut your fuckin' mouth and do it!
dialog: 
text: Bobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear
text: view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel
text: then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything
dialog: incriminating. To the driver:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn at the light...
dialog: 
text: The CAR makes A SHARP LEFT. In Russian, subtitled:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go left. Again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
dialog: 
text: The Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVERY CAR
dialog: 
dialog: Pavel again:
dialog: 
scene_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE
dialog: Let's go. No one's on us.
dialog: 
text: The camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
dialog: 
text: The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange
text: residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere.
text: Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways
text: up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns
text: and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN
text: IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car.
dialog: They pull Bobby out:
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps.
text: He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM
dialog: 
text: Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The
text: room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of
text: money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL
text: MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby
dialog: surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask
text: on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present,
dialog: through the sequence.
dialog: 
dialog: It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows
text: are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is
text: VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms
text: are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES
text: ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING
text: MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov
text: rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head
text: to Bobby. "FOLLOW ME," he seems to be saying.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a
text: dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set
text: up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them.
text: There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic
text: musical program silently unfolding.
dialog: 
text: There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and
text: two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly
dialog: line for the preparation of narcotics.
dialog: 
text: The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts
text: counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown-
text: Haired Man, puts up two fingers.
dialog: 
text: On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then
text: takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk,
text: Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages
text: of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall.
dialog: 
text: This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man
text: pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk
text: blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING:
text: TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the
text: SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo.
dialog: 
text: He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop
text: the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps
dialog: from the package.
dialog: 
text: Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and
text: pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses
text: two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY
scene_heading: LETTER OPENER...
dialog: 
text: The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another
text: powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He
text: continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move
text: with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef
dialog: on a cooking show.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot.
text: He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls
text: down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY
text: OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI'S VOICE
dialog: You needed to come here tonight...?
dialog: 
text: Bobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN
text: A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a
text: surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him
text: with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: What's the matter, ain't Pavel good
dialog: enough for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: That's all the money I got. And I

speaker_heading: SLAVIC YOUTH

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: With the crack on the street, it's
dialog: worth two hundred k. Maybe more.
dialog: 
text: Vadim walks over to a stack of green packages:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: All the shit I get here is at least
dialog: eighty-six percent pure. And we
dialog: got a lot more comin' in--a LOT
dialog: more. In a way nobody could ever
dialog: trace.
dialog: 
text: Vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards Bobby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: The whole city'll be sucking our
dialog: glass soon--you'll see. We push
dialog: the Guineas out, the Domos'll work
dialog: for us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Sounds good.
dialog: 
text: Vadim looks at that money again, takes a step forward.
text: Bobby's forehead has beads of sweat. Vadim walks up close.
text: Looks Bobby in the eye for a BEAT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: You're breathing heavy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I took a little taste.
dialog: 
text: Vadim puts his hand on Bobby's chest, checking his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: You know, I seen fighters--they
dialog: breathe like that, means they get
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You nervous?
dialog: 
text: Bobby shakes his head. He is wired, out of it, but he
text: pulls himself together. His jaw clenches. With fire, an

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I'm clean.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna search me again, you go

dialog: and go home.
dialog: 
text: Vadim violently pulls out Bobby's pockets. Out falls: a
scene_heading: WALLET, SOME CHANGE, KEYS, A CIGARETTE LIGHTER, MATCHES.
text: He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. It
text: fires. Bobby gets slightly edgy. Notices that the others
text: congregate around the objects from his pocket--all except
text: for Pavel, who holds an AK-47 trained on Bobby.
dialog: 
text: Bobby inches ever closer to the rusted LETTER OPENER that
text: the Brown-Haired Man had used to open a package of cocaine.
text: Vadim puts down the lighter. And it occurs to him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI
dialog: You got both matches and a lighter.
dialog: 
text: Bobby realizes instantly that Vadim is right. Bobby
text: shrugs, feigning innocence. He braces himself and decides
dialog: to give the signal:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I'm gonna get pussy from this...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAVEL LUBYARSKY
speaker_heading: (BEFUDDLED)
dialog: What you say...?

dialog: tries again:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: [When] this deal goes down, I'm,
dialog: I'm gonna get a lotta pussy...
dialog: 
text: Still NOTHING. PAVEL'S attention turns to VADIM. He moves
dialog: toward NEZHINSKI, who:
dialog: 
text: Starts FRANTICALLY POUNDING THE LIGHTER against the DESK.
text: Trying break it open. Bobby scans the joint... The MEN
dialog: are trained on that lighter, and this is his chance. He
text: slips the LETTER OPENER into his hand.
dialog: 
text: SEEMS LIKE WE CAN LITERALLY HEAR THE BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH
text: BOBBY'S HEAD NOW. Setting himself, Bobby looks around the
text: room--where's that backup???--and: the camera SPEEDS PAST
text: Pavel's and Vadim's faces, to the other side of the room.
text: It MOVES toward the WINDOW:
dialog: 
text: VADIM HITS THE LIGHTER AGAIN. This time, it BREAKS OPEN.
text: REVEALING A BEVY OF WIRES. It is CLEARLY NOT JUST A

text: CHARGES TOWARD BOBBY--ABOUT TO FIRE, when--
dialog: 
text: THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. COPS EVERYWHERE. Mike and Jack lead
text: the way, but there are what seems like tens of EMERGENCY
text: SERVICES UNIT OFFICERS with them:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Hands on your heads! On the floor!
dialog: 
scene_heading: NO ONE FREEZES. CHAOS. GUNFIRE. PAVEL SWINGS BACK TO
text: BOBBY, a TERRIFYING LOOK ON HIS FACE. But Bobby is ready,
text: and SHOVES THE LETTER OPENER INTO PAVEL'S NECK. BLOOD
text: CASCADES DOWN THE MAN'S CHEST. Pavel collapses on Bobby,
text: still very much alive. His eyes are popping, and he throws
text: his hands around Bobby's THROAT. VADIM CHARGES INTO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM
dialog: 
text: Where he pulls up a SECTION OF LINOLEUM, REVEALING a TRAP

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I'm with you! I'm with YOU!
dialog: 
text: This is INAUDIBLE, with all the ammo being dispensed, and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AND CLOSER.
dialog:

dialog:

text: he leans closer. Sotto, tender:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: A lotta kids here, lotta family...
dialog: It's nice, ain't it...?
dialog: 
text: She nods. Whispered:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know how happy I am you're with
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Yes...
dialog: 
text: He leans over, kisses her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
dialog: 
text: A RANDOM WOMAN, who'd been looking out the window, turns
text: back toward the house. With a huge smile on her face:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDOM WOMAN
dialog: Here they are!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Bobby brightens, begins to stand with only a little
text: difficulty as he anticipates Joseph's entrance. As this
text: happens, Rosario slips out from under his grasp:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: `Be right back...
dialog: 
text: And she walks off. Bobby watches as she enters:
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
dialog: 
text: Rosario closes the door on Bobby, turns on the running
text: water. Then begins to rummage through her purse. Finds a
text: small vial of cocaine inside. Takes it out, opens it, but
text: DROPS IT IN THE SINK. The drug spills into the water,
text: washing it down the drain. Frantically, she tries to
dialog: finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
dialog: 
text: ENTERING THE HOUSE: JOSEPH and Sandra, his wife. Joe holds
text: two bags--one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other
text: with clothes. What seems like a ZILLION PEOPLE are here
text: when he walks in. Everyone CHEERS. BURT moves right
text: behind him, all smiles. Joseph is thrilled--but somehow
text: not the same. His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a
dialog: different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive
text: surgery on his jaw. There is, of course, a scar, and he's
dialog: lost a lot of weight.
dialog: 
text: Behind him, Burt waves everyone closer. Jack and Mike and
text: other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand
text: back, all smiles. AD-LIB HELLOS. An elderly NEIGHBOR
text: comes forward, giddy:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Wow, fella! You look great!
dialog: (pointing to his own
speaker_heading: EYE)
dialog: Your eye--does it hurt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Only when I look at you!
dialog: 
text: LAUGHTER. Then Joseph FREEZES. He NOTICES: BOBBY, next to
text: the ARMED MEN who haven't left his side.
dialog: 
text: The two brothers make eye contact. The crowd quiets a bit.
text: Bobby smiles at the sight of his brother. Joseph gets
dialog: emotional, too:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Bobby...
dialog: 
text: Without a word, Bobby nods, moves to his brother. As Burt
text: looks on, pleased, Bobby takes his hand and grips the back
text: of Joseph's neck. Joseph pulls his brother to him by his
text: neck. A real embrace. Joseph pats Bobby's back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I'm real glad you're home...
dialog: 
text: The two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA GRUSINSKY
dialog: Everyone, let's, let's move inside--
dialog: there's plenty to eat!
dialog: 
text: Soft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates,
text: moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Joseph--we got some things we need
dialog: to discuss, when you get the
dialog: chance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: We could do it now if you want,
text: Pop. In the den.
dialog: 
text: Burt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den--
text: except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She
text: approaches him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the
dialog: motel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: What're you talking about? They
dialog: got a lot of food over there--why
dialog: don't you go eat something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: N--I'm gonna go back.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks
text: into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
speaker_heading: (WHISPERED)
dialog: You fucked up?
dialog: 
text: A muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial.
text: Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his
dialog: head out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Bobby--you should hear this too,
dialog: for the trial.
dialog: 
text: Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den. Back to Rosario:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: We gotta straighten this out later.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN
dialog: 
text: Burt and Joseph and Jack and Mike. Bobby enters the room.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Nezhinski's cache was huge, about
dialog: 40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: We're gonna try and turn him, get
dialog: him to tell us how they're bringing
dialog: it in. But don't worry--we'll make
dialog: sure he does plenty of time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop.
dialog: 
text: Bobby closes the door behind him softly. Joseph sees
dialog: Bobby, is surprised he's here...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Well, you marry an ape, you don't
dialog: complain about the stench of
dialog: bananas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK SHAPIRO
dialog: He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice
dialog: and comfy. We're taking him to the
text: A.D.A. next week, for a meeting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: I wanna go with you on that. See
dialog: his fuckin' face.
dialog: 
text: Jack nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: I'll tell you, though--streets're
dialog: dead. Junkies're waitin' out there
dialog: for something big, no question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: That's `cause we got their number
text: one. Dried it up at the source.
dialog: 
text: All of a sudden, a VOICE from behind:

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: What's that, Bobby?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: There's a whole network full of
dialog: suppliers. The organization goes
dialog: deep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: Bobby--you done a lot for us
dialog: already. You don't gotta get
dialog: involved in this anymore. Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: I asked him to come in, Joe. If
dialog: he's gonna have to testify, he
dialog: should know all this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: This's police business, Pop--you
dialog: gonna make him an honorary member
dialog: of the Force now?
dialog: 
text: An ugly beat. Then:

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I'll be outside if you need me.
dialog: 
text: Bobby exits, and Burt watches him depart.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
speaker_heading: BOBBY--
speaker_heading: (SOTTO)
dialog: What was said in there, he--he
dialog: didn't mean it.
dialog: 
text: Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)

dialog: A lotta people been talking. About

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What I did, I did for you guys,

dialog:

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: Wait--Don't go yet--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: (to the Guard)
dialog: Take me back to the motel.
dialog: 
text: With that, Bobby leaves with his bodyguard. Burt stands

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

scene_heading: INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

text: ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing
text: up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many
text: would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and
text: stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free.
text: As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All,
text: of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with
text: two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful.
dialog: 
text: ALL OF A SUDDEN: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY. When

speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Bobkes!!!
dialog: 
text: Bobby GLARES at Rosario. He takes her arm, starts to walk

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Wait! Lemme get my coat at least!
dialog:

text: he does, Louis walks with him:

speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE EL CARIBE

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: No! I was just dancing! I didn't

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby, what do you want from me? I

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY

dialog: 
text: Rosario is right behind them, listening. When Burt stares

speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I'm just trying to keep us
dialog: together here, that's all. That's
dialog: all I want.

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: (relents a bit; nods)
dialog: I know, Pop.
dialog: 
text: Burt warms slightly, too. A beat, then the CARS PULL UP.
text: Bobby looks at his father with real feeling. Burt eyes
text: him, then touches Bobby's cheek, a truly loving gesture:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT GRUSINSKY
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: Okay...
dialog: (to an officer)
dialog: We'll move `em to Corona. I'll

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT
dialog: 
text: THREE CARS: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind him is
text: Bobby and Rosario's car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel
text: and the two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO
text: OFFICERS in it. That vehicle trails the other two. The
text: CARS DRIVE OFF.
dialog: 
text: NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY
text: SUBJECTIVE WAY, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION
scene_heading: AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD.

scene_heading: INT. BOBBY'S CAR
dialog: 
text: Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through
text: her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view
text: through the windshield of his father's car.
dialog: 
text: Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN
text: is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the
text: windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water
text: on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible.
dialog: 
text: The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic
dialog: is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP
dialog: of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR
text: the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the
text: wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around
dialog: Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: It's really coming down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby--I think I left my watch at
dialog: the hotel--
dialog:

speaker_heading: VITT THE GUARD
speaker_heading: (TURNING)
dialog: Huh--?
dialog: 
dialog: A FLASH!
dialog: 
text: CRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't
text: HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of
text: nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle...
text: VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing
text: cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes
text: her head down, into the back seat.
dialog: 
text: THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to
text: the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt
dialog: to the side. To Rosario:

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

dialog:

text: Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves.
text: THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes
dialog: up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that
text: protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred
text: feet below.
dialog: 
text: Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR--
text: behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting
dialog: Bobby's car...
dialog: 
text: THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR. BOBBY SEES the
text: barrel of the gun swing to Burt.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The
text: water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's

dialog: 
text: Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping
speaker_heading: open. He CAN SEE:
dialog: 
text: HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS.
text: We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER)
dialog: They got a hit on! Get support,
dialog: now!
dialog: 
text: Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries
text: to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the
dialog: car, one driving and one doing the shooting--
dialog: 
text: BOOM! And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear
text: door. Rosario is JOLTED--screams again...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Rosario! You hurt?
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl.
text: She's hysterical--but physically unharmed.
dialog: 
text: The traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible,

dialog: the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous.
dialog: 
text: A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it
text: before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's
text: car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering
text: and keeping up the pursuit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: POLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT...
dialog: 
text: The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT
text: JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's
text: slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND.
dialog: 
text: BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific
text: accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is
speaker_heading: TERRIBLE:
dialog: 
text: The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping
text: over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
text: The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway
text: toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and
text: the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt.
dialog: Into the radio:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pop, lay back!
dialog: 
text: But Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man
text: in the back seat. HE FIRES.
dialog: 
text: A HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile.
text: The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER)
dialog: I got him! I got the sonofabitch!
dialog: 
scene_heading: AND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND
text: CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG
text: SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear
text: passenger's seat area.
dialog: 
text: His eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP. THE BARREL OF THE
dialog: SHOTGUN turns:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
dialog: 
text: Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school
text: children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner.
dialog: 
text: Bobby's car peels off, away from danger. Burt's car IS
text: HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. In what seems like his dazed last
text: gasp, he SLAMS on the BRAKES. The car skids out, spins.
dialog: The motion is DIZZYING...
dialog: 
text: THE OLDS is uncontrolled. The vehicle moves through a
text: traffic light, HITTING another car.
dialog: 
text: STARTS TUMBLING, NOT ON ITS SIDE, BUT HEAD OVER TAIL.
dialog: 
text: It is one intense image. The car is upside down now. It
text: slides for tens of feet before stopping. Smoldering...
dialog: 
text: The rain falls, making an oddly serene sound. We HEAR
text: SIRENS. The Police are approaching.
dialog: 
text: Burt's car stops slowly. He gets out of the car, his face
text: a mess. He stumbles for a few feet in the rain. BOBBY'S
text: CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE...
dialog: 
text: BURT'S EYES ARE RED, filling with blood. His JAW is open.
text: He gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. His body
text: spasms. Then he collapses, on his knees. FALLS. FACE
text: DOWN. IN A POOL OF BLOOD. The Police are in the
dialog: background...
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER, WHO IS
text: LYING ON THE STREET. Bobby bends down, turning his father
text: over. His father's blood is all over his hands now.
dialog: 
text: Burt is dead.
dialog: 
text: Other cops surround them. Bobby looks up at all of them,
text: they at him. Broken, he pushes the others away. As water

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby? Could I call my mother...?

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: (SOTTO)

dialog: enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Joseph?
dialog: 
text: Joseph eyes him, seems heartened by the sight of his

speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: ...I'll catch `em, Bobby. Don't

text: for words. Before he can speak:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: They're gonna need us to identify
dialog: the body...
dialog: 
text: Then, as emotional as we've yet seen him, Bobby strains to

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: I don't know if I can do that. I
speaker_heading: MEAN--
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I saw him die...

text: A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE.

text: BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
dialog: 
text: People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize
dialog: from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of

dialog: 
text: The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.
dialog:

text: Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds
dialog: of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT:
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVESITE

text: the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby.
dialog: 
text: A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied.

dialog: 
text: She looks at him for a moment, then stares at the floor.
text: Shakes her head. She gets emotional:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby, I don't know if I can be
dialog: here no more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: What're you talking about? I just
dialog: got through telling you--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: No, I think maybe it's time I leave
dialog: then--go down to Miami on my own,
dialog: with my mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: (struggling to stay
speaker_heading: CALM)

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It'd be a big change for us.
dialog: 
text: She is still shaking her head, still staring at the floor:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
speaker_heading: BOBBY--
dialog: 
text: Bobby gets up, walks over to the desk. Rubs his fingers on
text: its surface, not looking at her but resolutely:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: But we could make a life here.
dialog: This'd be something we could build
dialog: on. We could raise a family,
dialog: and...
dialog: 
text: This seems to focus Rosario who stares at him. He moves
dialog: closer to her:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pretty soon you'd fit in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: No I wouldn't...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: They know what I was--what I was
speaker_heading: DOING--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: They'll accept you if we're
speaker_heading: TOGETHER--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: Bobby!
dialog: 
text: She halts him, opens up. Tearful:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I gave it all up for you and you
dialog: changed everything!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Gave it up? Gave up what?

dialog: And you were clean, Bobby? We were
speaker_heading: TOGETHER--

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Well, maybe I was a piece of shit
dialog: too! Wasting my goddamned time!
dialog: 
text: She is momentarily speechless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: How could you say that...? We had
speaker_heading: PLANS--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Wake up! All that was nothing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ
dialog: No! Now is nothing! Look at
dialog: what's happened to your family,
dialog: Bobby--your father, he's dead--look
dialog: at your brother! It could all
dialog: happen to you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: My brother's gonna be all right--

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Get off me--I don't want it! It's
dialog: not what I want!
dialog: 
text: She breaks free. Panting, tears streaming down her cheeks.
text: After a beat, Bobby seeks to calm her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: All right. Why don't you just calm
dialog: down and think about it a little.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him, frozen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You think about it, you'll feel
dialog: different. You'll understand. And
dialog: in time, we'll look back on all
dialog: this and you'll see I was right.
dialog: Look--I love you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Why don't you go get some rest?
dialog: 
text: Without a word, she turns and walks back into the bedroom.
text: Closes the door. Bobby sinks to the couch, picks up his
dialog: drink. After a beat, we HEAR a:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: We appreciate your patience, Bobby.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE FACE OF SPIRO GIAVANNIS
dialog:

speaker_heading: SPIRO GIAVANNIS
dialog: The Commissioner is here now, and
text: he's ready to go.
dialog: 
text: We PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward,

scene_heading: INT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: COMMISSIONER RUDDY
dialog: Good. Raise your right hand.
dialog: 
text: Ruddy leads him to the corner of the office. Bobby is

text: holds a manual, off which he reads an oath:

speaker_heading: COMMISSIONER RUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: "I hereby pledge and declare..."

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - MUSTER ROOM
dialog: 
text: Many cops, mug shots and files strewn all over. A

text: "WELCOME TO THE FORCE." Bobby thanks them, then moves to
text: stand behind his brother. Michael testily grills Jack on
dialog: the investigative progress:

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: ...But we got our guys out there,
dialog: working the street all over? I

speaker_heading: JACK SHAPIRO

dialog: 
text: As Michael says the following dialog, a UNIFORMED OFFICER
text: comes up to Bobby. Sotto, in his ear, he speaks to him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICER
dialog: Bobby, a Rosario Diaz's been
dialog: callin' for you. She says she
dialog: needs to talk to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO (SIMULTANEOUS)
dialog: Well, you tell Narcotics Queens we

speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: It's comin' up quick, we don't know
dialog: anything... We're gonna lose it...

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Joe--this is still new territory

dialog: 
text: Michael points to Bobby, who up until now had been focused

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: I know that. And my family takes
dialog: the hit--my family...
dialog: 
text: An awkward silence. Everyone's pained. Bobby stiffens:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Could you guys go outside for a
dialog: minute? I wanna talk to my
dialog: brother.
dialog: 
text: Michael hesitates, then nods. Everyone wheels around and

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're trying to do everything--

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: A deal this big, something's gonna

dialog: 
text: Joseph ponders for a beat, then comes out with it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: It's not that. It's just... You
dialog: give up what you wanted to do to be
dialog: here, Bobby. And part of me feels
dialog: a little responsible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's
dialog: meant to be. You can't fuckin'
dialog: control it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: (slight laugh)
dialog: You know, I remember when Pop was
dialog: mad at you, he always used to say
dialog: you didn't believe in our family.
dialog: And Mom, she'd protect you. She'd
dialog: give you those little caramels...
dialog: Anyway, I knew he was wrong too,

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM
dialog:

text: Bobby scans the room, and quickly notices EVERYTHING OF

scene_heading: INTENSE EXPRESSION.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: What happened--where'd she go?!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: She left about an hour ago. She
dialog: said to give you this--
dialog: 
text: The GUARD hands Bobby a NOTE. BOBBY SEES IT, GRABS IT
text: WITHOUT READING IT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: We gotta go find her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: She asked us not to, Bobby. She's--
dialog: Bobby--we can't do that legally!
dialog: 
text: Bobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain
text: him delicately ("C'mon, calm down"), but Bobby is in no
text: mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of
dialog: energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue
text: him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything
dialog: else, and it is messy, tough:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
scene_heading: DON'T--FUCKIN'--
dialog: 
text: Bobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards
text: rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM
text: for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in
text: a rage. Then, sarcastic:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN

dialog: 
text: Still in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR
text: REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the
text: wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Where he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck.
text: BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He
text: throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the
text: realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over
text: him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs.
dialog: 
dialog: It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their
text: outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining
text: feeling drain from him until he has nothing left.
dialog: 
text: After this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing
text: heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head...
dialog: 
text: We PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH
dialog: 
text: A noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching
text: boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of
text: those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door.
text: Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a
text: GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an
text: answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)

speaker_heading: MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: We also have an old friend who's
dialog: come back to us--I want him to
dialog: stand--Bobby? Ladies and
dialog: gentlemen, Bobby Green, who used to

dialog: 
text: MORE APPLAUSE. THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands

speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Florida?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI
dialog: Ah, don't worry, Bob. I have no

speaker_heading: LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, between you and me, that
dialog: place they had you in was drivin'
dialog: her crazy. The Kew Motor Inn--we
dialog: used to call that the SCREW Motor
dialog: Inn, with all the hookers...
dialog: (back to Hazel)

scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

dialog: Bobby, I... I told `em where you

dialog: 
text: Bobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit. He

scene_heading: EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD - LATE NIGHT/DAWN
dialog: 
dialog: SERIES OF SHOTS of:
dialog: 
text: 1. WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed
dialog: growth that is extremely dense.
dialog: 
text: 2. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An
text: old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA
text: project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom,
text: probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned.
dialog: 
text: 3. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from
text: high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL
text: WEEDS AROUND IT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving.
text: Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed
text: with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET:
dialog: 
scene_heading: AN ARRIVING LIVERY CAR.
dialog: 
text: Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases--
text: presumably filled with money.
dialog: 
text: THEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR. And yet ANOTHER.
dialog: 
dialog: The men all congregate like it's a legal business
text: transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES.
dialog: 
text: We PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE:
text: Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The
text: camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and
text: other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS.
text: One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and
dialog: our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES...

speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: We're gonna get all of `em today.
dialog: 
text: JUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out.
text: They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number
text: of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the
dialog: shack...
dialog: 
text: ALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this?
text: ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto.
text: Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's
dialog: the EMPEROR...
dialog: 
text: EMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli,
text: helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other.
text: They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the
text: devastation. Almost to himself:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lookit the two of them...they're so
dialog: fuckin' close...
dialog: 
text: Then the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the
text: back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless.
dialog: 
text: STANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed
text: with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions
text: closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN.
dialog: 
text: BUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by
text: NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many
text: other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL SOLO
dialog: Okay--when they complete the sale,
dialog: that's when we move. ESU'll grab
dialog: the kids.

dialog: 
text: The Man places a FUR on a distressed countertop. Rips it

speaker_heading: VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
dialog: The rest of the product is in the
dialog: van--total weight, 75 kilos.
dialog: 
text: Places one of the lengths of fur into: A BASIN filled with
text: fluid... The CAMERA ZOOMS into A CLOSE SHOT on the FUR in
dialog: that basin...
dialog: 
text: The FUR IS POKED a COUPLE OF TIMES. A beat. Then: WHITE
text: PLUMES RISE from the coat's fabric to the top of the
text: liquid, and Eli begins to skim the substance off the
dialog: surface.
dialog: 
text: DUMPING OUT some of the substance (now in crystalline form)
text: onto a pad, MARAT BUZHAYEV hands it to a BUSINESSMAN, who
text: TASTES it. THE BUSINESSMAN nods, pleased with his
text: product... He reaches for a SUITCASE. It is OPENED.
text: Filled with MONEY.

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD

text: Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near
text: Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH
text: CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING... He cannot bear reliving
dialog: the terror of his moment...
dialog: 
text: As the COPS move in: Bobby spins around to look for his
text: brother. He finds him still on the ground. Joseph seems
text: unable to move, holding onto his shotgun for dear life:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Joe?!
dialog: 
text: Joseph looks at his brother, shakes his head. Completely
text: shattered in the moment. STILL. SHOTS RING OUT. Bobby
text: pushes his brother down on the ground. In his ear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Arright, just stay down!
dialog: 
text: Chaos begins. All of the men inside the small building
text: have aimed their guns into the WEEDS. But instead of
dialog: stopping because of the shooting, Bobby progresses
text: inexorably toward the structure, his shotgun poised to
dialog: fire.
dialog: 
text: NOW MICHAEL and JACK and OTHER MEMBERS of the NARCOTICS
text: TEAMS come out of the WEEDS. THEY FIRE their WEAPONS.

speaker_heading: FIFTY YARDS AWAY

dialog: 
text: SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit--

scene_heading: EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD
dialog:

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. FIERY WEEDS
dialog:

dialog: 
text: CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND...
text: BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping

dialog: 
text: Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARAT BUZHAYEV
dialog: Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be

dialog: 
text: BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression

dialog: emotions are a CAULDRON:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: Get down! On the ground!
dialog: 
text: Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's

text: DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS...
dialog: 
text: The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face
text: and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby
text: turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him,

dialog: of them and none of them in particular:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Put him in the fuckin' van...
dialog: Don't touch him...
dialog:

text: As the man speaks, Bobby SCANS the room. HE SEES ROSARIO,
text: standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face
text: is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF
text: EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon
text: catching a glimpse of her.
dialog: 
text: But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears
text: when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that
text: IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a
text: faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
dialog: I love you, Bobby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY GREEN
dialog: (back to reality)
dialog: Love you too, Joe.
dialog: 
text: Police line up on the stage. Everyone's seated, Bobby and

text: Bobby straightens up, raises his hand--along with the sea
text: of blue--in a SALUTE as the flag is carried to the front.
