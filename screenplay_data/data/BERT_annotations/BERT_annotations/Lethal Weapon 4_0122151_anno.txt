speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

speaker_heading: RIGGS

speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Okay. I'll draw his fire. You
dialog: run for cover.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: No, no, no. I'1l draw the fire,

speaker_heading: RIGGS

dialog: You can't go first, Rog.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: RIGGS

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: What the hell for?
speaker_heading: RIGGS

dialog: shoot.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Shoot what?
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: The one place he's vulnerable --
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: You mean gonna shoot him in the --
speaker_heading: RIGGS

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Trust you?
text: Beat. Murtaugh starts stripping.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: I gotta be crazy.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: A second ago, you didn't care if
dialog: you lived.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: That was before the prospect of
dialog: ending up dead in my underwear.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Just hurry, Rog. It's getting a

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: C'mon, c'mon...
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: What's --
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Not now.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Are those pink --
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Not now. Just hit the damn tank.
text: Riggs drops it. They get set to move.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Also, flap your arms and make
text: noises like a bird.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: It'll distract him more. I need
dialog: him to turn. Ready? On two.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: On two? We always go on three.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Change of pace, okay? One, two --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5) 5
text: Murtaugh bolts from behind the car, flapping his arms and
text: making noises like Riggs told him. The guy turns... and
text: the sight does make him pause. Just long enough for
text: Riggs to stand and SHOOT.
text: Riggs' slug tears off the stem of the flamethrower tank,
text: releasing napalm in a high-pressure, burning jet that
text: rockets the human tank off the ground and through the air
text: toward a nearby gas station. He impacts a gas pump.
text: Fuel ignites. The STATION EXPLODES. A tanker TRUCK
text: offloading gas is BLOWN upward OUT OF FRAME.
text: Riggs and Murtaugh watch the inferno. Beat.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: I'm too young to be a grandfather.
speaker_heading: RIGGS

dialog: dad.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: «+. Think that bird thing really

speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Nah, I just wanted to see if
dialog: you'd do it.
text: Something catches their eye. They look up.
speaker_heading: RIGGS /MURTAUGH
dialog: Oh, shit!
text: They start running. A moment later, the tanker drops
text: from the sky behind them. A few tons of metal falling at
text: 9.81 meters/second/second. Right onto their car... Riggs
dialog: and Murtaugh get to safety. Look back. Beat.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Never a dull moment, huh, Rog?
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

text: A detail of Red Chinese soldiers waits outside the gates.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: NINE MONTHS LATER
text: The gates open. More PRC soldiers escort out four
text: Chinese men wearing prisoners' shock belts. The oldest
text: of the four is in his 70s, dignified. The youngest is
text: 50ish and menacing, eye like a pit viper... They're led
text: toward a vehicle in a waiting convoy. A young PRC
text: soldier touches the older man's arm to help him in. Ina
text: flash, the pit viper strikes the soldier dead for the
text: offense. Executes a gravity-defying flying double kick
text: that snaps the soldier's neck. Another soldier quickly
text: jabs a button on a remote control unit. 50,000 volts
text: from the shock belts jolt the prisoner's bodies. Three
text: of them drop instantly to the ground in agony... Not the
text: pit viper... Incredibly, he stays on his feet. Teeth
text: gritted. Muscles quivering from the punishing electric
text: current. Staring back at his tormenter. A full ten
text: seconds... The soldier releases the button. The flow of
text: electricity stops... As the pit viper moves to help the
dialog: old man up --

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

speaker_heading: LEO

speaker_heading: RIGGS

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Fun-ny.
speaker_heading: RIGGS

speaker_heading: RIGGS

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: That was a terrible thing. But

dialog: the problem.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: The problem... The problem is,
dialog: maybe I don't wear the wedding
dialog: ring anymore, Rog, but I look
text: down, and it's still there.
text: The two men share a long look. Leo pops up again.
speaker_heading: LEO

scene_heading: A-f-t. Aft.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: And that's a fucking word?
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
text: Back of the cabin, right side.
speaker_heading: LEO

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH

speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: You're an ugly situation, period.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: It's illegal to carry a weapon
dialog: without a permit.
text: Riggs tosses the gun in the sea. Blam! A GUNSHOT.
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Was that Leo's gun?
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! From the other direction. They

text: leaps to the helm. Jams the throttle ahead full. The
text: boat jumps forward... and the freighter rushes by, inches

text: And then it's gone.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: My boat... Thank God...
speaker_heading: RIGGS

text: can't hit him and can't run... when he sees the ship's
text: metal gunwale converging behind the gunman. Quickly
text: eyeballs the angles involved. Aims the laser down the
text: gunwale. FIRES. Banks a slug off the steel. Takes out
text: the gunman with a ricochet... whereupon the ship runs
text: aground. The abrupt stop topples cranes, everything not

text: The plastic begins tearing away... Rips loose.
text: Both men tumble out and --
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY Dg92

text: HONKS. Trying to get him to pull over. No luck.
text: And Riggs isn't just ski-boarding behind the mobile
text: home, either. The remaining thug has now dropped back

text: about to crush him. Breaks a leg off the table. Hurls
dialog: it backward and --
text: -- THROUGH the thug's WINDSHIELD, where it stops, inches
text: from the guy's nose. He yanks it through. Goes after
text: Riggs again... Closes in... He's about to run Riggs

dialog: Riggs.
text: Murtaugh tries to maneuver the cop car close enough to the

text: who gets his feet up just in time to fend the car off.
text: The thug pulls his PISTOL, FIRES at Murtaugh, who ducks
dialog: just in time... And then the thug has a choice: keep
text: firing or worry about the CHERRY-TOPS approaching fast
text: from behind. He FIRES one last SHOT, then opts for
text: saving his ass. Punches it.
text: Murtaugh maneuvers close to Riggs. Riggs reaches. This
dialog: is bad. But the plastic's ripping. Bad's better than

text: his foot over his own shoulder and stuns Riggs. And the
text: two men tumble off the pier...
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER A132

text: The odds shift back into Ku's favor again. He's nailed
text: Riggs with the kick and now begins to punish him underwater,
text: not caring if he himself dies, as long as Riggs dies,
text: too... when Riggs' hand finds an AK-47 inside the car
text: with Chu. He pulls it out. Sticks it in Ku's belly...
text: Ku tries to shove the barrel away... And Riggs OPENS UP
text: on FULL AUTO. GUN flashes light silt-stirred water.
text: Shell casings eject in SLO-MO through fluid resistance.
text: And a magazine of AK SLUGS RIP UP Ku's guts... Blood fills
text: the water. Ku's eyes meet Riggs'. Then his hand releases
text: the gun barrel. And Ku drifts to the harbor floor...
text: Riggs doesn't see him hit, though. He's heading topside
dialog: for oxygen.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER B132
text: Riggs breaks the surface. Gasping for air. He's won.
dialog: To Ku, somewhere below him!--
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: No tomorrow for you, asshole.
text: He swims to a ladder fixed to a piling. Grabs a rung.
text: Starts to hoist himself out... when Ku explodes up out of
text: the water. Whips the garrote in his Buddhist prayer
text: beads over Riggs' head and draws it tight.
text: The wire bites into Riggs' neck. The weight of Ku's bloody
text: body pulls on him. Riggs white-knuckles the rung with one
text: hand, tries to fight Ku off with the other... We see a
text: ladder begin to pull away from the rotting wood and
text: concrete of the pier... when Riggs finds the rebar still
text: sticking through Ku's side and yanks it out... The searing
text: pain causes Ku to loosen the garrote slightly. Enough for
text: Riggs to get the rebar wedged inside it. To slide the
text: rebar up alongside his face and begin to lever the garrote
text: away from his neck... Slowly, he manages to slide the wire
text: noose up over his head. And then, in a sudden reversal,
text: whips the loop off his own head and back over Ku's... The
text: ladder's hanging by a bolt now... Riggs tightens the
text: garrote around Ku's neck... As the last bolt holding the
text: ladder lets go, Riggs whips the garrote around a steel
text: hook protruding from the ladder's side, and the ladder,
text: still connected to a large chunk of concrete, drops into
dialog: the depths, carrying Ku with it... He won't be coming
text: back from that one... Whereupon Riggs reaches up for a
text: piece of concrete and rebar hanging off the pier. Grabs
text: it... And it breaks away on top of him. And Riggs, too,
text: is gone. Plunged to the bottom... Not coming up.
text: On the pier, Murtaugh comes to. Looks around. No one.

text: When the waves disappear, it's just still black water.
text: Murtaugh screams now, looking down into the water.
speaker_heading: MURTAUGH
dialog: Where are you, Riggs?!
text: Nothing. Moving along the edge of the dry dock now,

dialog: Tell me where you are, Riggs!...
dialog: Will it to me! Will it to me,
dialog: Riggs!... Tell me where you are,

dialog: it to me!
text: Beat. Beat. Murtaugh's eyes suddenly swing to a spot in
text: the water. Like he's heard something. He runs. A few
text: strides along the edge. Then dives to the spot.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER 132
text: Murtaugh swims down... Deeper and deeper... and...
text: there, next to Ku's dead body and the ladder, is Riggs...
text: Pinned under the large chunk of concrete and steel.
text: Breath running out. Desperate eyes bugged, pleading with
dialog: Murtaugh... It's hopeless for Murtaugh to try and shift
dialog: such an enormous weight. Except that Murtaugh's gonna
text: try. Gets his hands under the concrete. Plants his feet
text: on the bottom of the dry dock. Lifts. Strains. Maxes
text: every fiber in his body. Muscles burning from oxygen
text: debt... until... the mass slowly begins to move ... More
text: and more... And then Riggs is free. Murtaugh hauls his
text: friend up toward the dim moonlight shimmering above them.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER 133

dialog: was still my best friend, and
dialog: one day I was carrying his
dialog: box in my bike basket, and he
text: jumped out. My back wheel ran
