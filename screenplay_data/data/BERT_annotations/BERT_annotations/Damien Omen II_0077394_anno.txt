text: MUSIC GROWS, THE FEELING OF DOOM IS OVERWHELMING,

scene_heading: INT, BELVOIR CASTLE (ACRE) - TUNNEL 7
text: Lamps flash along the tunnel. On the floor, duckboards have

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Is there another way out?
speaker_heading: BUGENHAGEN
dialog: No.

dialog: rubble,
text: Suddenly, there's another ear-splitting crack and rumble,

text: silence, Morgan looks at Bugenhagen in horror. The old
text: man's eyes are closed, resigned, preparing for death, ‘Then
text: the silence is broken by the quietest but most sinister
text: sound -- running sand! A steady stream of 1t falls before

text: Further glances up and down the road. No cars in sight.
text: The billboard opposite again takes her attention. She gets
text: out of the car and leans across to the backseat for her
text: coat. There's an abrupt fluttering sound followed by strange
text: seratching on metal. She jumps back. There, by her face,
text: a crow settles its enormous wings and eyes her from the
text: ear roof. Joan gasps and moves instinctively away. The
text: crow's nasty little eyes never leave her. She waves her
text: coat ineffectually to frighten it away but the bird doesn't
text: move, Joan kicks the car door shut and moves off, watching
text: the crow as she pulls on her coat. Even with the gap widen-
text: ing between her and the car, she looks nervously back, The
text: crow just sits there, Twenty yards, Thirty. Forty. She
text: takes a final look -- the crow has gone. Disquieted, she
text: looks all around, The bird has disappeared, and with it go
text: her anxieties. She settles down to cover the three miles
text: without again looking back, CAMERA FOLLOWS her. ‘There's
text: an awful screech and the crow descends from behind, It
text: crash-lands on her head and WE SEE it lean forward, yellow
text: beak open. Joan lets out a piercing scream and flails at
text: the bird with her arms, But the claws embedded in her hair
text: won't be dislodged and the crow continues to pivot and peck
text: at her face. Its beak is now saturated in blood. When
text: the poor, demented woman finally turns, WE SEE her eyes
text: are gone from the bloody sockets. ‘The crow's wings open
text: wide and, like an avenged angel, it lifts off into the sky.
text: CAMERA RISES ABOVE the blinded woman reeling about the
text: tarmac and finally slipping down the shoulder into a field.
text: Her screams and sobs float up unheeded. A new and distant
text: sound begins to intrude. The high-floating CAMERA SWINGS
text: To INCLUDE more of the highway. WE SEE a massive articulated
text: lorry speeding along, too fast.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON JOAN 50
text: Her blood-spattered hands claw at her face as if trying to
text: replace her eyes. Suddenly, she stops sobbing and hears
text: the approaching lorry. She gets to her feet and tries
text: vainly to find the highway, holding out her arms as if
text: playing "Blindman's Buff." CAMERA ABOVE COLDLY WATCHES
text: as she bumps into a tree beside the highway. She struggles
text: up the embankment, clawing and calling out. She rushes out
text: from behind the tree as the lorry bears down. ‘There is
text: nothing the Driver can do. He tries to brake. Screaming
text: tires and a sickening thud heralds the demise of Joan Hart.
text: Her body bounds into the air and lies still when it lands
text: on the roof of the slithering truck. The silence would de
