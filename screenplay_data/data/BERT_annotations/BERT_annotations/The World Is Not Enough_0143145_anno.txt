scene_heading: GUN BARREL LOGO OPENS ON
text: GENEVA SWITZERLAND, an unnaturally clean city that melds old
dialog: Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private
dialog: banking institute" within.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY
text: JAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by
text: three THUGS in Armani suits. They remove A GUN from inside
text: his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them
text: on the desk that separates Bond and...
text: LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him,
text: three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond,
dialog: but you understand, a man in my
dialog: position..
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Which is neutral, no doubt.
text: Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped. Gestures for
dialog: Bond to sit.
text: A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped
text: suit. She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of
text: EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the
dialog: money. No doubt Sir Robert will be
dialog: pleased to see it again.
text: The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond,
text: setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good
dialog: deal of CASH in pound sterling.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: In the current exchange rate, minus the
dialog: fees, of course, and certain
dialog: unforeseeable expenses. Here is the
dialog: receipt...
text: The CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT...
speaker_heading: CIGAR GIRL
dialog: Would you like to check my figures?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Perhaps later.
text: She steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the
dialog: desk...the THUGS TENSE...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: My glasses.
text: Lachaise nods. Bond can have his glasses.
text: He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd
dialog: number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:
dialog: 3,030,303.03.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: It's all there.
text: Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he
text: removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I didn't come for the money. The report
dialog: you sold him was stolen from an MI-6
dialog: agent, who was killed for it.
text: He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: I did not get the report from an MI-6
dialog: agent.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Who did you get it from?
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: I am just a middle man. I am doing the
dialog: honourable thing and returning the money
dialog: to its rightful owner...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: And we know how difficult that can be for
dialog: the Swiss.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: (controlled fury)
dialog: Your last chance. Take the money.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Your last chance. Give me the name.
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: Stripped of all your weaponry, you still
dialog: threaten me?
text: He nods. An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Perhaps you failed to take into account
dialog: my...hidden assets.
text: Bond's mouth edges into a smile. A flicker of doubt on
text: Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the
text: tiny arm of his glasses and...
text: KABOOM! The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those
text: around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief
dialog: effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his
dialog: opening...
text: He KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun.
text: Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW
text: just as they're getting their bearings. Now he nestles the
text: barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The name?
speaker_heading: LACHAISE
dialog: I can't tell you...
dialog: (Bond cocks the gun)
dialog: Alright, alright! But you must protect
dialog: me!
text: And he freezes. The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking
text: out of his neck. Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR
text: GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF.
text: Bond rushes to the window...
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY
text: She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly
text: disappearing into shadows.
text: Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to...
text: THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door,
text: casually slipping that cigar into his pocket...
text: Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in
text: hand. He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT
text: appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet
text: zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart.
text: Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY
text: Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by
text: the elevator. Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the
text: stairs. Hears the elevator cage start from below.
text: Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into
text: the lift shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it
text: comes down. Almost nonchalant, he steps out...
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY
text: As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the
text: counterweight, DESCENDING.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - GENEVA
text: Lunchtime. Faceless business crowds heading for their brief
dialog: moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,
text: with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,
dialog: troubled.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - GENEVA - DAY
text: The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she
text: approaches a BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the
text: city. Propped against the doorframe, an assassin's RIFLE
text: with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod,
text: trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining
dialog: the shattered office windows.
text: The man turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut.
text: There is a raised, red scar of an ENTRY WOUND at his temple.
text: It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,
text: like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems
text: slightly drooping, deadened. The other eye is sharp and black
text: as anthracite. It is a frightening face. This is RENARD.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: What's his name? Our friend from MI-6?
speaker_heading: CIGAR GIRL
dialog: James Bond.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: One of M's more accomplished tin
dialog: soldiers.
speaker_heading: CIGAR GIRL
dialog: He could identify me.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: If it concerns you...kill him.
text: He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two
dialog: glasses of wine.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Let's toast this James Bond. We're in
dialog: his hands now...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER THAMES - LONDON - DAY
text: A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome, banks along the
text: snaking river.
scene_heading: EXT. MI-6 - LONDON - DAY
text: Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the
text: vast stepped cake that is MI-6. Bond exits with the
dialog: suitcase.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - DAY
text: CAMERA MOVES with Bond as he enters this secret, hi-tech
text: world. He passes through countless security procedures,
text: watched by an attentive staff.
text: Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase. Three million
text: sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight. He
text: flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it down
text: wistfully. A blue light scans it on three axis.
text: The money is bundled into a clear plastic bag, put on a tray
text: and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the
text: SECURE ROOM. Bond hands the suitcase to a STAFF MEMBER.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Have this checked, see what you can get
dialog: off it.
scene_heading: INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY
text: Bond appears, hiding something behind his back. Moneypenny
dialog: brightens.
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: James. Brought me a souvenir from
dialog: Geneva?
text: He produces the cigar, now in a large phallic TUBE. Stands
text: it end up on the desk.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Thought you might want one of these.
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: (beat, deadpan)
dialog: I gave up a long time ago.
dialog: (nods to M's door)
dialog: She's in with Sir Robert.
scene_heading: INT. M'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY
text: Bond enters. SIR ROBERT KING is perched on the edge of M's
text: desk. Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Sir Robert King, James Bond.
text: King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile. Bond
text: notes a TINY BADGE in his lapel -- like the glass eye of a
dialog: stuffed snake.
speaker_heading: SIR ROBERT
dialog: Thanks for getting my money back --never
dialog: expected to see it again. You're the
dialog: kind of man I could use. Though I won't
dialog: offend certain parties by asking you to
dialog: join King Industries.
text: King looks to M, smiling.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Construction's not exactly my line.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Quite the opposite, in fact.
text: She couldn't resist. King smiles at Bond. As he goes, he
text: gives M a respectful kiss on the cheek. The door closes. M
dialog: turns.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Old friend?
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Since Oxford. I knew him when he had
dialog: nothing but a brilliant mind and enough
dialog: guts to conquer the world. He's a man of
dialog: great integrity.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Who buys classified reports for three
dialog: million pounds.
text: M picks up the report from her desk. Bond notices it is in
text: Russian, with a SEAL from a Russian military agency in the
dialog: corner: MIRATOM.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: It's a report on weapons security in the
dialog: former Soviet Union, which, as you know,
dialog: is shaky at best. He's had several
dialog: instances of sabotage at the pipeline,
text: and he's understandably concerned. He
dialog: called me the moment he realized its
dialog: sensitive nature.
text: She pours a scotch for Bond. He drops some ice in,
dialog: thoughtful.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Someone was watching over me in Geneva.
text: A guardian angel with a laser sight.
text: He stops, rubs his thumb and forefinger together -- a strange
text: SIZZLING where he touched the ice. Realization sinks in.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: King.
text: M sees the seriousness in his eyes -- stabs at the intercom:
scene_heading: INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: Moneypenny's eyes shoot to the intercom console:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Moneypenny, stop King leaving.

scene_heading: INT. Q DIVISION, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: Q and his men are working on a strange half-built BOAT
text: suspended over a water tank.
dialog: Q
dialog: ..the hydro boat can operate in three
dialog: inches of water...
text: He looks up as Bond runs through...
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: THE MONEY lies on the tray, wrapped in plastic.
text: Sir Robert approaches, two rows of security bars between him
text: and the cash. An official produces a bag and moves toward
dialog: it:
speaker_heading: SIR ROBERT
dialog: Thanks, but I'll count it myself.
dialog: (apologetic, smiles)
dialog: Lifetime habit. I'm Scottish.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond shoots around the corner just in time to see Sir Robert
text: disappearing past the THICK STEEL DOOR of the secure room.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Stop! King!
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: The shout is muffled, Sir Robert's more interested in the
dialog: money.
text: He continues toward camera, that PIN on his lapel emits a
dialog: serene HUM and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON THE METAL STRIP IN ONE NOTE AS IT CRACKLES AND --
text: KABOOM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: MAYHEM. FIRE blasts out of the open doorway just as Bond
text: reaches it. The STEEL DOOR flies toward him. He dives --
scene_heading: EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS
text: The building rocks. SMOKE is pouring from a HOLE that's
text: appeared in a lower tier. A wall and a section of roof gone.
scene_heading: EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS
text: A figure staggers out, shaken. Catching his breath. BOND.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ECU CIGAR GIRL
text: Lining up Bond with her infra-red telescopic sight.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BOND
text: In the swirling dust and smoke, he suddenly sees a wand of
text: red light, pointing at his chest.
text: All instinct, he dives for cover. Powerful, high velocity
text: bullet hits blanket the area. Bond prepares to return fire,
text: scanning around for the source. Through the debris he spots
text: an unusual, hi-tech BOAT on the river -- long and narrow and
text: low. A figure on board. THE CIGAR GIRL.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CIGAR GIRL
text: She FIRES OFF A ROUND OF SHOTS, forcing Bond back into cover.
text: Then she guns the engines and SPEEDS OFF down the Thames.
scene_heading: EXT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: Determined, Bond races back into the wreckage...
scene_heading: INT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond races through the chaos that is MI-6 and into...
speaker_heading: Q DIVISION
text: Where he leaps into the prototype BOAT. Q protests...
dialog: Q
dialog: It's not finished!
text: Bond looks at the mystifying number of buttons and gadgets

dialog: ROARING...
scene_heading: EXT. SLIPWAY - RIVER - DAY
text: THE 007 THEME KICKS IN AS:
text: JAMES BOND, in the Q boat, SHOOTS OUT of the MI-6 rubble and
dialog: onto the Thames.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY
text: Bond can see the Cigar Girl up ahead...he is closing the
text: distance. She catches sight of him in pursuit...
scene_heading: EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY
text: She pushes the boat to its limit, it roars to a new level of
text: speed...the chase is on.
scene_heading: EXT. THAMES - DAY
text: Police speedboats, alerted by the commotion, trail Bond.
speaker_heading: ON THE EMBANKMENT
text: Police cars scream alongside, sirens wailing.
speaker_heading: ON THE THAMES
text: Bond is losing ground as he and the Cigar Girl weave through
text: traffic on the Thames. In a gutsy bid to keep pace, he
text: corrals the Q boat into a hair-raising SHORT-CUT, shooting
dialog: off...
speaker_heading: UNDERNEATH A PIER
text: He maneuvers the boat under the low pier and emerges EVEN
dialog: CLOSER to his prey...
scene_heading: EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY
text: The Cigar Girl stops her boat, moving to the back, manning
text: her large, rear-mountain MACHINE GUN and taking aim at
dialog: Bond...
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY
text: Bond continues at full speed, fearless in the hail of bullets
text: ricocheting off the vessel.
text: THE CIGAR GIRL Remains calm and cool, shooting with
dialog: precision.
text: BOND closes in...
text: CIGAR GIRL'S eyes widen as...
text: BOND STEERS HIS BOAT RIGHT OVER THE MACHINE GUN AND TURRET...
text: Cigar Girl dives out of the way, as her boat becomes a RAMP,
text: LAUNCHING the Q boat INTO THE AIR before it dives, nose-
dialog: first, into the Thames.
scene_heading: EXT. - CIGAR GIRL BOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: CIGAR GIRL gets up from the deck and sees BOND, turning his
dialog: boat to close in for the kill...
text: She scrambles to the helm and SPEEDS OFF, seeing ahead of
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: TOWER BRIDGE
text: Just beginning to open, to allow for passage of a small
dialog: tanker.
scene_heading: EXT. CIGAR GIRL BOAT
text: She streaks toward the bridge, Bond lagging behind...
speaker_heading: ON BOND
text: As he looses her boat in the distance, he makes a DESPERATE
text: MOVE...he cranks the wheel of his boat and veers off, UP A
dialog: SLIPWAY and into...
scene_heading: EXT. FISH MARKET
text: Where the boat hydroplanes on masses of surface water and
text: propels him into
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET
text: The hurtling boat causes mayhem and panic as he wrestles with
text: the controls, jetting off the street and straight toward...
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE RESTAURANT
text: Bond's boat crashes right through it, sending diners LEAPING
text: in every direction. The Q boat SHOOTS OUT over the balcony
text: and splashes down once more into...
scene_heading: EXT. THAMES - DAY
text: Cigar Girl is now clearly in his sights. She is amazed to
text: see that Bond has managed to overtake her.
text: The racing boats dice through an armada of lazy, over-loaded
text: BARGES, nearly crashing into the much larger vessels.
text: AT EVEN PACE NOW...Cigar Girl attempts to force her way past
text: him, but Bond, punching buttons on the console of the Q-boat,
text: releases a set of catapulting FLAME CANNISTERS which create a
text: massive WALL OF FIRE ahead of them...
text: CIGAR GIRL is forced toward the very edge of the river...the
text: jig is almost up, and then...
text: HER P.O.V. She spots the launching of a HOT AIR BALLOON from
text: the base of the massive MILLENNIUM DOME.
text: She skids her vessel to a stop at a nearby pier and quickly
text: scrambles out of her boat.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY
text: ...A crowd around a RICHARD BRANSON-like figure about to
text: climb into his HOT AIR BALLOON.
text: The Cigar Girl, brandishing her gun, forces her way through
text: the crowd and LEAPS INTO THE BALLOON CARRIAGE, just ready to
text: lift off. She cranks open the gas nozzles and the balloon
text: rises with surprising speed.
scene_heading: EXT. BOND'S BOAT - DAY
text: Bond steers his craft toward a slipway adjacent to the pier
text: and SHOOTS UP INTO THE AIR...
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME
text: An amazing sight...Bond's boat sailing through the air just
text: beneath the balloon. With split second precision he reaches
text: up and GRABS ONE OF THE ROPES dangling down from the balloon.
text: Bond finds himself being CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR as his boat
text: falls away from him, hitting the ground and ERUPTING into a
text: ball of flame.
scene_heading: EXT. HOT AIR BALLOON - CONTINUOUS
text: As Bond is carried higher and higher, the Cigar Girl begins
text: FIRING AT HIM over the edge of the carriage.
text: Bond, with ONE HAND, returns fire.
text: CIGAR GIRL then leans over the edge of the carriage and
text: begins to SLICE THE ROPE that Bond is hanging from.
text: The fibers split and fray away from each other as...
text: BOND FALLS, heading straight toward...
text: THE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over.
text: AS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still
text: FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas
dialog: tank...
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON - DAY
text: The BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar
dialog: Girl with it...
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY
text: Bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of
text: the Millennium Dome breaking his fall.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME ROOF - DAY
text: He slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps
text: of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF
text: THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON...
speaker_heading: THE GROUND BELOW
text: He struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to
text: his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky
dialog: as we zero in on the iris of...
speaker_heading: HIS EYE
text: reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the
dialog: screen transforms into...
speaker_heading: THE MAIN TITLES
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE, LOCH LOMOND - DAY
text: BAGPIPES. A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters
dialog: of Loch Lomond.
text: A long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial
text: service. They mill about on the lawn, among them, M, grim-
text: faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in
text: a black sling.
text: Bond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd...
dialog: HIS P.O.V. It's like a state funeral. Rich and powerful
dialog: people, government ministers, chief executives from around
dialog: the world...and then...
text: FAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the
text: mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing
text: sunglasses and a military haircut.
text: The man seems to see Bond looking at him...
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Bond, we'll meet you inside.
text: Bond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back,
text: the man is gone, like an APPARITION.
text: Bond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY
text: Bond stands on the hill, looking below. He sees nothing but
text: a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind.
text: He hears a crunch of leaves...turns...
text: HIS P.O.V. A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill.
text: Her china doll face is both fragile and proud.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Beautiful, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes.
text: She steps up to the ridge with him. A breeze blows her hair.
text: They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and
dialog: strafe the valley.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Today, of all days, the sun decides to
dialog: shine.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the
dialog: Man Upstairs.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a
dialog: hostile takeover.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You knew him well?
text: The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: He was my father.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: He died before he could complete his
dialog: lifelong dream.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I intend to finish it for him.
text: A voice interrupts them, calling from the estate...
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: Elektra!
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her
text: delicate figure. She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks
text: back toward her father's grand house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY
text: M, Bond and Tanner in the rear of a limousine. The vehicle
text: swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish
dialog: Highlands.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Elektra? Running King Industries?
dialog: (she broods)
dialog: I've known that girl all her life. I'm
dialog: not sure she knows what she's walking
dialog: into.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: She's not a girl anymore.
text: M looks at Bond. Eyes his sling.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: I've scheduled a medical for you.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It's barely a scratch. The Dome broke my
dialog: fall.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Well, at least it turned out to have some
dialog: purpose.
text: Bond gives her a look.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: No-one goes into the field on this unless
text: they're 100%. Dr. Greatrex is waiting.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE THANE - HIGHLANDS - DAY
text: The limousine swoops under the portcullis, into a courtyard.
text: ADJUST ANGLE to reveal huge antennae and satellite dishes
dialog: within.
scene_heading: SUPER: MI-6 REMOTE OPERATIONS CENTRE, SCOTLAND
scene_heading: EXT. CORRIDOR - CASTLE THANE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond walks through the corridors. Just before he enters the
text: medical room, he removes his sling and casually drapes it on
text: a suit of armor.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL ROOM - CASTLE THANE - DAY
text: Bond sits on the couch, shirt off, awaits the results of his
dialog: medical.
text: The very attractive DOCTOR GREATREX looks at her notes.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GREATREX
dialog: Dislocated collar bone. If any more
dialog: tendons snap...
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: It won't just be two weeks out of action.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
text: She moves to him, touches the scarred and bruised bone.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It's just a scratch.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GREATREX
dialog: James. It wouldn't really be...
text: His hand comes up, rests on her waist.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Ethical? Can't we just skirt the issue?
text: And he pulls down the zip on her skirt. Flicks the clasp and
text: it drops to the floor. She shakes her head -- as he starts
text: undoing the buttons on her shirt. She's very business-like,
dialog: despite what's happening.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GREATREX
dialog: ...if you showed sufficient...willpower.
dialog: Promised to slow down. Cut out running,
dialog: jumping...shooting. All kinds of...
text: And he pulls her toward him, they kiss.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Strenuous activity?
text: Her shirt drops to the floor. She pushes him back, lies on
text: him. Just wearing knickers now. Between kisses:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GREATREX
dialog: Then maybe I'd be... open to that.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Perhaps after this ... test?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GREATREX
dialog: ...yes?...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I could come for a second opinion?
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- LATER
text: A huge chandelier dominates the vast stone room. SEVERAL
text: AGENTS listen to the debriefing. ROBINSON and M watch TANNER
text: explain things; he holds a FIFTY POUND NOTE and KING'S LAPEL
text: PIN (now blackened, fused, melted to expose electronics
dialog: beneath).
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: ...The money was dipped in urea, dried,
dialog: and packed tight. In one note the metal
dialog: strip had been replaced with a
dialog: combustible magnesium circuit -- in
dialog: effect a tiny detonator. King always wore
text: a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called
dialog: 'the Eye of the Glens'; but someone
dialog: switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro-
text: circuit emitting an electronic signature.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: on BOND as he enters the room. He hangs back in the shadows,
text: watches Tanner mime the pin moving to the note:
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: When he came within range of the money --
dialog: boom. Ingenious.
text: M steps forward. Her fury controlled.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: We've been pawns in someone's game. They
dialog: tricked us into bringing the money to
dialog: King. Not just elaborate. Cock-sure.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: And expensive. Cost three million plus.
text: Suddenly the chandelier darkens, the floor brightens into a
text: VAST SCREEN, showing a satellite image of Central Asia and
text: the Mediterranean. M and Robinson walk onto the screen.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Cheap, if it achieves your aim of de-
dialog: stabilizing the Western World.
text: She causes the desired stir. Bond steps forward from the
text: shadows to get a better view. M sees the sling has gone.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Caviar capital of the world. Matchless

speaker_heading: M

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: So Sir Robert's goes through Turkey,

speaker_heading: ROBINSON
dialog: A huge project. The most expensive of the
dialog: pipelines, but the one supported by every
dialog: Western leader. None of the American oil
dialog: companies were willing to take it on.
dialog: But King has connections to the region.
dialog: He married into the Vavra family, rich

scene_heading: INT. SCREEN

speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: He shouted. He shouted all the time --
text: Bond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears.
text: His eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand:
text: $5,000,000. A thought forms. He takes out his wallet,
dialog: opening it and removing:
text: THE RECEIPT FROM LACHAISE.
dialog: E.C.U. The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303.03.
text: Bond taps some keys. The words EXCHANGE RATE appear on the
dialog: screen...pounds to dollars.
text: He enters '3,030,303.03 POUNDS STERLING' and through
dialog: multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes:

speaker_heading: M

speaker_heading: BOND

speaker_heading: M
dialog: I'm well aware of your stake in this,

dialog: If you have a point, get to it.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The amount of money that killed Robert
dialog: King is the same amount as the ransom

text: He hands her a slip of paper.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man

dialog: first. When Elektra's ear was delivered
dialog: to him in the post, he came to me.
dialog: (measured)
dialog: I advised against paying the ransom. I

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sacrifice the girl to take out the

speaker_heading: M

speaker_heading: M
dialog: We sent 009 down to kill him. Before he

text: INSIDE HIS SKULL.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He survived?
speaker_heading: M
dialog: The doctor who saved him couldn't get it

text: She presses a button, the hologram turns...
speaker_heading: M
text: The bullet is moving through the medulla

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: 'That which does not kill me makes me

speaker_heading: M
text: Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
speaker_heading: BOND
text: He's not through yet. Renard doesn't blow
dialog: up five million dollars unless he knows
dialog: there's more coming in. He's working for
dialog: someone. Someone who wants to stop the

speaker_heading: M
dialog: Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Are you trying to break my heart? Or is

speaker_heading: BOND

text: Darkness. The RUMBLING CEASES...
text: Light emanates from Bond's watch. In the shadows he pulls a
text: knife, punctures the air bag. It deflates, leaving them
text: cocooned in an icy tomb. Elektra looks around, staring,
text: unbelieving.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Oh my God...we're buried alive...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We're alright.
text: But her breath is coming in short, irregular bursts.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I can't stay here.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You're not going to.
text: Bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle. Flicks
text: open the small blade. He starts to cut a hole in the snow
text: above their heads. She stops him.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: No! It will cave in!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It's the only way out...
text: The snow CREAKS eerily, she gasps, terror mounting.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I can't breathe, I can't breathe...
text: Bond grabs her, holds her tight. She resists, bucks.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!
dialog: (she does)
dialog: You're alright. Everything will be
dialog: alright. Trust me.
text: Finally, arrested by the strength in his eyes, she calms...
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER
text: A beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow. All is quiet.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Bond's fist PUNCHES through the white. He pulls the snow
text: away, climbs out. Leans in, lifts Elektra out.
text: Bond and Elektra stand, lone figures in the perfect white.
text: They hear a sound...HELICOPTER ROTORS. Rescue on its way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY
text: An establishing shot of Bond's BMW parked outside the ornate
text: villa on the shore of the golden Caspian.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY
text: Palatial. Hallway dominated by a LARGE PAINTING of a bearded
text: man in traditional Turkish garb, sitting proudly on a horse.
text: Davidov, Gabor, waiting, pacing.
text: Bond is sits in a chair, ON EDGE, writing something over and
text: over on a small pad of paper...THE CYRILLIC LETTERS on the
dialog: parachute fragment.
text: A DOCTOR comes down the grand staircase. The men stand.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: She's fine. Contusions. A slight strain
dialog: to her ankle, but otherwise, fine.
dialog: (to Bond)
dialog: She wants to see you.
scene_heading: INT. ELEKTRA'S BEDROOM - SUNSET
text: Bond enters. Elektra is standing by the window watching the
text: golden ball of the sun sink into the sea. She wears nothing
text: but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it,
text: outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Are you alright?
text: He nods. He is wound tight, she senses it.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I can't stay.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I know.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I need to ask you something. And I need
dialog: you to tell me the truth.
dialog: He waits.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Who is it? Who is trying to kill me?
text: Bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong.
dialog: He cannot tell her the truth.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I don't know. But I will find him.
text: She stares at him, sensing he is withholding something. She
text: turns back to the window.
text: He approaches behind her.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: After the kidnapping...I was afraid to go
dialog: outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd,
dialog: to do anything at all, until I
dialog: realized...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There's no point in living if you
dialog: can't...feel alive.
text: She looks out at the fading sun.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I can't huddle in the shadows. I can't
dialog: let fear run my life. I won't.
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: The way I acted, in the snow...you must
dialog: think I'm a coward.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I think you're one of the bravest people
dialog: I've ever met.
text: She looks up at him, into his eyes; they are so close. All
text: she has to do is tilt her mouth upward...she kisses him. His
text: hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her
text: body melting into his, and then...
text: He pulls back. Has to physically step away from her.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...you should rest.
dialog: That was exactly the wrong thing to say. He sees the
text: rebellion flair in her eyes.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: James...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Then take me with you.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: No. You'll be safe here.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I don't want to be safe!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I have to go to work.
text: He starts toward the door.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Now who's the coward?
text: He stops, his back up...then heads out the door.
speaker_heading: IN THE HALLWAY
text: He passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EST. SHOT - EXT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT
text: Elegant, mysterious. A modern day Casablanca.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT
text: Bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino. He takes out
text: the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room --
speaker_heading: HIS X-RAY POV
text: He can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players. All sizes
text: of pistol, even the odd grenade. The obvious side-effect of
text: this view -- he can see through clothes.
text: His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him. One of
text: them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display. She
text: returns Bond's smile. Her friend turns to look. Bond's
text: smile grows: she has a small pistol concealed over one
dialog: breast.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT
text: He looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes.
text: His old adversary, ex-KGB, VALENTIN ZUKOVSKY, talking to some
text: suspicious types. Zukovsky looks across. Bond walks toward
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Valentin Zukovsky.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You, of course. I need some information.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place.
dialog: Used to be the royal family's, now it's
dialog: mine. I run my little business, I stay
dialog: out of trouble...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (looking about)
dialog: Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies,
dialog: consortiums from every country in the
dialog: world. A nice little rat's nest.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: (offering hors d'ouevres)
dialog: Have some of the rat's nest caviar. From
dialog: my own fishery. They buy my caviar,
dialog: drink my champagne, lose to my House.
text: He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Let me introduce you to a former
dialog: colleague of mine at the KGB. Dmitri
dialog: Palov, you may know him as...the Boa.
text: The Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands.
speaker_heading: BOA
dialog: The great 007. For years I have dreamed
dialog: of closing my hands around your neck.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Boa. Have you had any therapy since
dialog: Perestroika?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Why am I suddenly worried I'm not
dialog: carrying enough insurance?
text: The Boa leaves, glaring all the while.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: See? You're upsetting my customers.
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How does a terrorist like Renard supply
dialog: his men with state-of-the-art Russian
dialog: Army weapons?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: What? This is not possible.
text: Bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the PARACHUTE.
text: Zukovsky examines the letters.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st
dialog: airborne division.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Where did you get this?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Off a high-powered Paraski that was
dialog: trying to kill me.
text: Zukovsky shakes his head. Sighs.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: The Russian Army, they spend millions on
dialog: flying skis, but they cannot afford to
dialog: pay the soldiers. The men, they do what
dialog: they have to do to feed their families.
dialog: In this country, for the right price and
dialog: a pack of cigarettes, you can get
dialog: anything you want.
text: He notices Bond watching THE HOSTESS BAR...a dark alcove of
text: the casino, where slinky HOOKERS flatter the guests.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: That too. Everyone does what they can to
dialog: survive.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How high up does this...arms dealing go?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is
dialog: Renard. Our government has nothing to
dialog: gain by killing you.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: But you would have something to gain by
dialog: killing Robert King. And stopping his
dialog: pipeline.
text: This hits Zukovsky. He closes down. A chill between them.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Poor Bond. The cold war is over. What
dialog: have you got left? Economic espionage.
text: Murder in the boardroom. So dull.
text: Bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino.
dialog: HIS POV: ELEKTRA...more vibrant than we have ever seen her,
text: living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a
text: sparkling dress that fits like second skin. Her hair is full
text: and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Oh, you'd be surprised.
text: Bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and
text: turns away, making her way to the Roulette tables.
text: Bond follows her across the casino. They are like two cats,
dialog: moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and
text: sexy, all eyes on them. He takes note as she passes...MINIMUM
dialog: $100, then $500, $1000...
text: She finally stops at the 'No limit' table. Crowded with the
dialog: nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks,
dialog: South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian
text: industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink.
text: ZUKOVSKY is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the
dialog: center.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: We've kept your father's chair free.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: And his account?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: You have a credit line of a million and a
dialog: half.
text: He gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of
text: CHIPS toward her. A WAITRESS is right there to take her
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Vodka martini.
speaker_heading: BOND
text: Two. Shaken not stirred.
text: He leans in, smiling his charming smile as he says:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (smiling right back)
dialog: Someone wants to kill me, I'd rather die
text: looking him straight in the eye.
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: What are you doing here? Looking for a
dialog: woman a little more your type? How about
dialog: that one?
text: She points to a SHOW GIRL in a feather headdress and pasties.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: If this little show is for my benefit,
dialog: I'll take you home right now.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You had your chance, James. Now I'm
dialog: looking for a bigger thrill.
text: She pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them
text: stand on her bet. The whole table exhales. Then, it starts:
text: bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival.
text: Bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous...
text: HIS P.O.V. He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from
text: the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this
dialog: way and that...he looks suspicious as hell.
text: Bond watches, his blood running, and then...
text: Davidov slips into the HOSTESS BAR. A HOOKER is soon
text: wrapping herself around him. After a few words, she leads him
text: off toward the back.
text: Bond returns to the game, shaking his head. He watches as
text: THE DEALER DEALS FROM THE SHOE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SALON PRIV - NIGHT
text: A small room. Lit by sconces that sport LIVE FLAMES. Tacky-
text: luxurious, a refracted Eastern reflection on an old west
dialog: whore house.
text: Davidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove. He faces a
text: small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see THE
text: HOOKER behind him, on the bed.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: You want to be...on top, or not on top?
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV
dialog: On top.
text: She slowly pulls a pair of SILK ROPES out from her bra and
speaker_heading: DANGLES THEM.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Tied up, or not tied up?
text: Davidov smiles, struggling with his belt. He looks down,
dialog: gets it, looks up...his heart stops...it is not the hooker in
dialog: the mirror but...
scene_heading: RENARD'S FRIGHTENING FACE.
dialog: Davidov spins.
text: HIS P.O.V. Renard's henchman stands by the door, an
text: automatic rifle cocked at Davidov.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Dead, or not dead?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE
text: Elektra with black king showing. A seven beneath.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I understand it's normally good practice
dialog: to get the feel of the cards before going
dialog: off the deep end.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Really?
text: And with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a
text: hit. The Dealer gives her an eight. She reveals her cards.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Bust.
text: He rakes in her chips. But Elektra is undeterred. She pushes
text: another pile forward as the next deal commences.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I like the deep end, James.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SALON PRIVE
text: The HENCHMAN holds Davidov against the wall with his huge
text: fist around his neck. Near his head, the live flame of a
text: SCONCE hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel
text: from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it.
text: The HOOKER, obviously one of Renard's gang, has finished
text: donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun
text: onto her shoulder.
text: Renard looks distastefully at the room.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Is this how you spend the money I pay
dialog: you? And with the rest you hire fools who
dialog: shoot like blind men?
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV
dialog: (croaks out)
dialog: Bond...
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Should be dead as well. Your failure
text: today is astonishing. It is a disgrace.
text: He approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming SCONCE
text: near his head.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Do you know why the color is blue at the
dialog: wick?
text: Davidov starts to sweat.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Because that is where the flame is the
dialog: hottest.
text: Renard touches the glass well of oil.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: The temperature is close to five hundred
dialog: degrees.
text: Renard uses his knife and POPS the seal from the lamp,
dialog: removing the well of oil...a DROP of the hot oil FALLS ON HIS
text: HAND and SINGES IT BLACK in an instant...
text: Renard does not even flinch. Davidov starts talking, trying
dialog: to placate...
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV
dialog: The plane...it's all been arranged...
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Then you are completely unnecessary...
text: Renard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head:
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV
dialog: I have the documents, the landing
dialog: authorizations, the security passes...
text: Renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour...
dialog: His dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw
text: him?...seems to glitter in the light...
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner,
dialog: tonight. We understand each other?
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV
dialog: Yes...yes...
text: Renard lets a TRICKLE OF OIL drop onto Davidov's head...
text: HE SCREAMS as his hair smokes and singes...
text: Renard makes a motion, the THUG releases Davidov, who falls
text: to the floor, clutching his head.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE
text: Another deal. ZUKOVSKY and others watch, as Elektra stakes
text: even more. People move closer for a view. The Dealer shows
text: a five. Elektra shows Bond her cards.
text: Elektra is holding two eights. Dealer's up-card is a six.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Stand or split them.
text: She smiles. He holds her gaze.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Surely you believe in living dangerously.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Not at that price. Time to surrender.
text: They eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air.
text: She smiles. She moves ALL HER CHIPS forward.
text: Bond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky:
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: The House has no limit.
text: General kerfuffle. Bond looks back toward THE HOSTESS
text: BAR...no sign of Davidov's return...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (to Dealer)
dialog: Hit me.
text: The Dealer scoops a card from the shoe. Tension. Everyone
text: holds their breath...as he turns over... -- a six. Bust.
text: The audience inhale as one AS THE DEALER TAKES ALL HER CHIPS
speaker_heading: AWAY.
text: Elektra stands. She has dignity in defeat. She turns to
text: Bond, holding out a hand.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Time to surrender.
scene_heading: EXT. CASINO - NIGHT
text: Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them,
text: trying to look like he hasn't been through hell. Bond
text: notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self-
dialog: consciously.
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV
dialog: A little accident.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: A night of burning passion?
text: Davidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE.
text: Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW.
speaker_heading: HENCHMAN (V.O.)
dialog: What about Bond?
speaker_heading: EXT. CASINO ROOF
text: RENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by
text: the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back,
text: their easy sensuality as they both get into the car.
speaker_heading: HENCHMAN
dialog: Sir? Sir?
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (seething)
dialog: I will take care of Mister Bond.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT
text: Bond and Elektra emerge from the BMW. Behind them, Gabor and
text: Davidov get out of her car. Bond watches as Davidov slams his
text: door and marches off, angry, toward the SECURITY QUARTERS at
text: the side of the house.
text: Bond and Elektra walk to the front door, anticipation thick
text: in the air. Gabor opens the door. Elektra sweeps through...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT
text: Bond pauses just inside the open doorway.
text: HIS P.O.V. Two figures in the cavernous entrance hall,
text: Elektra having a brief word with Gabor, before he turns and
dialog: exits, leaving only...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA AND BOND.
text: She starts upstairs, Bond's eyes locked on her body, and
dialog: then:
text: SHE LOOKS BACK...just once. But it says everything. She
dialog: continues upward.
text: Bond taps the front door closed with his foot.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT
text: Half-light. They're entwined between the sheets. This is
dialog: something slow, languorous, not to be rushed. We can't make
text: out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat.
text: Her fingers trace the contours of his torso. Linger on his
text: bruised collar-bone.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You knew when you first saw me. You knew
dialog: it would be like this.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Shush.
text: Her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed. She rubs a
text: slither of ice down her chest, shudders with pleasure. It's
text: a move Bond hasn't seen before.
text: Now she brings the ice to his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Poor shoulder. Looks painful...
text: She kisses his purple flesh. Licks.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...needs constant attention...
text: She slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above
text: the tendon. And he pulls the ice from her hand:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Enough ice for one day.
text: Tosses it across the room as passion takes over...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - LATER
text: A puddle of water where the ice fell.
text: Post-sex on the bed. He traces a hand down her naked back.
text: The sweat glistens off the curve of her spine. She turns.
text: The light glints off her jewelled earlobe...he touches it.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You never take this off?
text: Elektra looks at him.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Why do men always want to undress the one
dialog: part of a woman's body she doesn't want
dialog: to reveal?
text: She reaches to the large, diamond-encrusted earring and
text: gently plucks it away. Pulls her lush hair back...
text: The lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen
text: clump of scar tissue. It is the only mark on her perfect
text: body. A physical reminder of her ordeal. It breaks his heart.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How did you survive?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I used my body on the guards. It gave me
dialog: control. I got to a gun and I took my
dialog: chance.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've never told anyone that.
text: They are looking at each other, both suddenly feeling
text: something dangerously close to real connection. It is not
dialog: what Bond expected.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Do you ever stop, James? Do you ever
dialog: think about...another kind of life?
text: He holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I can't afford to.
text: She frowns, slightly. Settles into his chest.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Don't worry. I know who you are.
text: He holds her, eyes full of conflict, staring into the dark.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLA - NIGHT - LATER
text: The lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the
dialog: perimeter wall of the property.
scene_heading: EXT. SECURITY QUARTERS - SAME
text: Bond's car, several of Elektra's vehicles, all parked around
dialog: the security office. They have been joined by:
text: A WHITE ECONOMY CAR, a Russian make, with a familiar SEAL
dialog: painted on the door...we've seen it before, the seal on top
dialog: of the stolen report at the beginning...Miratom.
text: Out of the driver's seat steps...DAVIDOV. He carries a
text: briefcase from the car to the front door of the security
text: office. He looks around furtively before he disappears
dialog: inside.
text: The parking area is dark and silent and then:
text: JAMES BOND sits up in the driver's seat of his BMW.
scene_heading: INT. BMW - SAME
text: Bond sticks his key in the ignition and activates the car's
dialog: various systems.
text: HIS P.O.V. Davidov is a shadow in the office window.
text: Bond flicks a switch. A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from
text: the BMW to the window of the office. He can HEAR a synthesis
dialog: of Davidov's voice...
speaker_heading: DAVIDOV (V.O.)
dialog: I'm running late...no, no, I'll make
dialog: it...how will they know I'm your
dialog: man?...romashka...romashka...alright.
text: Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up. He flicks
text: another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system
text: activates in his WINDSCREEN...
text: He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the
text: security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE
text: BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK.
text: He goes back inside.
text: BOND gets out of the BMW. He moves stealthily to the Russian
text: vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the
text: lock on the trunk. It pops open.
text: Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING
text: ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside:
text: A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped
text: forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet
text: ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD
speaker_heading: EYES.
text: Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket.
text: It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and
text: Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR. On the corner of
dialog: the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the
text: report. Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it.
speaker_heading: AT THE OFFICE
dialog: Davidov is coming out...
text: Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car.
speaker_heading: AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE
text: Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian
text: car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then...
text: HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks
text: AROUND the entire car. When he gets to the rear...
dialog: THE TRUNK IS CLOSED. Bond is not there. No evidence he ever
dialog: was.
text: Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT
text: The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted
text: AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared
dialog: airstrip.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded
dialog: area.
speaker_heading: EXT. CAR
text: Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and
text: opens the trunk.
text: He removes the briefcase. Then the duffle bag. He looks
text: down at the dead body, head slumped forward, as before...but
dialog: something is different, the clothes not quite right and then:
text: THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps...
dialog: It IS JAMES BOND.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Problem, comrade?
text: Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is
text: quicker. With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the
text: head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes
text: go wide and he crumbles, dead.
text: Bond climbs out of the trunk. Crouches to examine Davidov.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Old habits die hard.
text: He straightens. Picks up the briefcase. It is locked. He
text: searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket. He
text: opens the lock.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE: FOUR STACKS OF MONEY. Documents
text: headed with the official crest of Miratom. A new security
text: tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's
dialog: name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags --
text: and a polaroid-type camera.
text: He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the
text: camera. Points at himself, takes a shot. Punches in
dialog: 'Davidov' on the KEYPAD. Out comes a brand new pass.
text: Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but...
text: A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP.
text: HIS P.O.V. A Russian military jet appears over the trees,
text: flying low, its red landing lights blinking.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
text: A door opens on the sinister-looking plane. A hydraulic step
text: unit folds out of it. A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits
text: in the doorway.
text: BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge
text: and picks up the briefcase. He has NO IDEA what he's walking
dialog: into.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Here goes nothing.
text: He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to
text: the plane. He starts up the steps:
text: THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him
speaker_heading: IN RUSSIAN.
text: Bond pauses. And then, thinking, says:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Romashka.
text: The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon.
speaker_heading: INT. PLANE
text: Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two
text: young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a
text: big, thick-necked tough.
text: They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or
text: do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the
text: briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY.
text: The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still
text: stare at him. The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that
dialog: sounds like..."where's the rest?"
text: Bond swallows. Thinks, without showing it. He decides to
text: OPEN THE DUFFLE BAG. He looks inside. Pauses, then reaches
text: in and takes out...A BOX OF NIKE SHOES.
text: The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out
dialog: shoes to the rest of the guys.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN
text: A red dawn. Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly-
text: shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip. The plane
dialog: approaching.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - LANDING
text: The three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat
dialog: amongst themselves.
text: Bond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by
text: heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly
text: cargo. There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he
text: clearly recognizes: DANGER - RADIOACTIVE.
text: Bond looks out of the window. Beneath a huge MESA, a huddle
dialog: of low buildings.
text: They come to a stop near the end of the runway. A SMALL JEEP
text: is driving out to them.
text: One of the soldiers throws something to Bond. An ORANGE
text: JUMPSUIT that says Miratom on the breast. He catches it.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (subtitles)
dialog: You have fifteen minutes.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP/VALLEY/TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN
text: Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is
text: driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley -
dialog: -
speaker_heading: KABOOM!
text: A cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side
dialog: of the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY
text: They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several
text: Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around,
speaker_heading: IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and
text: personnel quietly going about their business. A vast
text: protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building.
scene_heading: INT. 'BUBBLE' - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY
speaker_heading: (CHRISTMAS JONES') POV:
text: The sound of breathing LOUD, we're looking from inside the
dialog: visor of a protective suit. It's hard to tell what's going
text: on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue
text: plutonium from inside a corroding WARHEAD...
scene_heading: EXT. FACILITY - SAME
text: An officer eyes Bond's pass.
speaker_heading: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
dialog: (subtitles)
dialog: You are late. The transport documents?
text: Bond shows him the case. Akakievich examines the documents.
speaker_heading: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
dialog: (subtitles)
dialog: They are waiting for you below. It
dialog: should be ready. Check with the IDA
dialog: physicist.
text: He points toward the "bubble."
text: Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE
text: finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box.
text: As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE
text: steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit.
text: Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL
text: AMERICAN GIRL. CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish
text: hair, hot right now. In one movement she unzips and steps
text: out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off
text: shorts, heavy duty boots. A nasty-looking hunting knife
text: strapped around her hips. She has a deep tan and an
dialog: incredible figure.
text: She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles.
text: Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly,
text: also unable to take his eyes off her. He spits on the floor
text: and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.
speaker_heading: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
dialog: Not interested in men. Take my word for
dialog: it.
dialog: Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker. Bond
text: offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away.
text: Christmas approaches. He notices her IDA tag -- and an
text: incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking
dialog: him out as well.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: You new?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (Russian accent)
dialog: Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones.
dialog: No jokes, I've heard them all.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Don't know any doctor jokes.
dialog: She is wary. It's been a long time since a man this
text: attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What happened to Len Tashka?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Couldn't make it. Splitting headache.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: The soldiers may give you a hard time.
dialog: Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd
dialog: have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by
text: the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
text: Bond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Will I need protection?
text: She squints at him, taken aback.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: There's no radiation danger down there.
text: Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped. Christmas then
text: speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (subtitles)
dialog: Where is this stockpile going?
text: Bond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (subtitles)
dialog: To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.
text: She nods. Watches him disappear into the building.
scene_heading: INT. TEST CHAMBER MAIN ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bond descends, going down deep.
scene_heading: INT. TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER
text: The elevator creaks to a halt. He slides the elevator doors
dialog: OPEN revealing...
text: TWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator. Bond shows them his
dialog: ID.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (subtitles)
text: See the corporal, at the end of the
dialog: chamber.
text: The soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving
dialog: Bond completely ALONE.
text: Dead silence in the shadows. Bond's in his element, that
text: alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings.
text: HIS P.O.V. A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more
text: open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming
dialog: there.
text: Bond starts down the passageway.
scene_heading: INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a
text: NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit.
dialog: Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring
dialog: equipment.
text: Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes
text: to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the
text: opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in
dialog: Russian Army fatigues.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Corporal?
dialog: The man turns...
speaker_heading: IT IS RENARD.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: I see my friend Davidov ran into some
dialog: difficulty.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Indeed.
text: Renard starts toward him. Bond draws his gun.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Don't come any closer.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You can't kill me. I'm already dead.
text: He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a
text: ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Go ahead. Shoot. My men will still
dialog: steal the bomb, and the shot will bring
dialog: them directly to you.
text: Renard gestures into the pit.
text: BOND'S P.O.V. TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of
text: what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One
dialog: of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN
text: REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner.
text: Bond aims his gun at Renard's head.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?
text: Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the
text: pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: To die by a man who can't even grasp what
dialog: he's caught up in...
text: Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove
text: a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb. It is the size and
text: shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on
text: it...the man slips it into his pocket.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's
dialog: clever is getting someone else to pay for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Not many people in this world have that
dialog: kind of fortune.
text: Bond cocks the pistol.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: You think I fear death? I welcome it. I
dialog: get on my knees and pray for it. You, on
dialog: the other hand, you have something to
dialog: live for, no?
dialog: (closer now)
dialog: She's beautiful isn't she? You should
dialog: have seen her before. Flawless, and still
dialog: so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
text: Bond's eyes flare in fury. He shoves Renard into the wall
text: and presses the gun to his temple.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You will never touch her. You will never
dialog: get near her.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Have you forgotten who saved your life in
dialog: Geneva?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Consider me ungrateful.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: It's I who should thank you -- for taking
dialog: that money back to MI-6. So distressing
text: for M. An explosion inside her lair.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: She'll get over it.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: You even brought the plane for us. We
dialog: really couldn't have done it without you.
text: Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol. Renard
text: drops to his knees. He touches his temple, looks at the
text: blood curiously, feeling no pain.
speaker_heading: RENARD
text: A man tires of being executed.
text: As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun:
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: But then again...There is no point in
dialog: living if you can't...feel alive.
dialog: Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES
dialog: HIM, just a beat, but it is enough...
text: SUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with
text: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers.
text: We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and
text: see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard --
dialog: classic execution stance:
speaker_heading: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
dialog: (to Bond)
dialog: Drop your gun.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Keep away, Colonel.
text: The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: He is an impostor.
dialog: (clutching a printout)
dialog: There's no Davidov at Miratom.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Here's your imposter. He's paid off the
dialog: men on the plane outside. They're not
dialog: taking the bomb to any Russian facility,
text: they're flying it wherever he tells them.
text: Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle.
speaker_heading: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
dialog: (to Bond)
dialog: I said drop it.
dialog: And he means business. Bond delays ... but has no choice.
text: He pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (to Christmas)
dialog: Well done -- he would have killed us all.
dialog: I suppose you
dialog: (to Akakievich)
dialog: were you the one who allowed him down?
text: Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung. But Renard is
text: looking past him now, as with a quiet WHIRR, the BOMB raises
text: into view on a trolley. Renard's team is ready to move.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (to Akakievich)
dialog: Take him away, I don't want him around as
dialog: we move the bomb.
dialog: (whispered, to Bond)
dialog: You had me. I knew you couldn't shoulder
dialog: the responsibility...
text: And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his
text: collar-bone hard... Pain jolts through Bond, he drops to his
text: knees in agony. He shoves Bond down. Bond's hand goes to his
dialog: shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him
dialog: there?
text: Renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving
dialog: passageway. It's all too much for Colonel Akakievich:
speaker_heading: COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
dialog: No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until
dialog: I am satisfied. All of you to the
dialog: surface, now...
text: Renard stops and turns. Bond sees him nod to two of his men:
text: one quietly slopes off down the tunnel. The other innocently
text: opens a container...
scene_heading: INT. CONTAINER
text: Camera shows the INSIDE of the container's lid; the man
text: releases a false lining to reveal several MACHINE GUNS...
scene_heading: INT. TEST CHAMBER - DAY
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (urgent now)
dialog: Very well, Colonel. We will all go up.
text: One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that
dialog: Bond should get up. Knowing it's now or never, Bond PUSHES
text: him away, yanks a PISTOL from his holster, GRABS Christmas,
text: LEAPS down into the bomb PIT just as
text: RENARD'S MEN open fire... Akakievich dies straight away. So
text: do two of his men. The gunfire RICOCHETS around the chamber
dialog: and ceases.
text: Renard hangs back. His radio crackles a message:
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (nods, into radio)
dialog: Shut them.
text: THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE RADIO
text: Right next to the ELEVATOR. He turns a switch that activates
text: two sets of red buttons and two sets of green.
text: He punches one green button...
speaker_heading: INSIDE TEST CHAMBER
text: Heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT
text: Bond and Christmas know they are being sealed in.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Melt-down doors. If he gets them closed,
dialog: they won't be opened again for forty-
dialog: eight years.
text: Bond peers over the edge -- sees Renard and his men working
text: the nuclear device into THE PASSAGEWAY.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT
dialog: If Bond doesn't get through now, they're trapped forever. He
text: points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses
text: a button...THE TINY GRAPPLING HOOK shoots out, Q's super
dialog: filament wire that can hold up to 800 pounds is
text: attached...Bond uses the rope to RAPPEL UP THE SIDES OF THE
speaker_heading: PIT and into
scene_heading: INT. TEST CHAMBER
text: Where he LEAPS ON TOP OF Renard's last man. They fall
text: THROUGH THE IRIS, it SHUTS behind them. The man swings his
text: machine gun at Bond -- it hits the wall next to him, breaks
text: apart. Bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one
dialog: strike.
text: He pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket,
text: retrieving...THE CARD-LIKE DEVICE.
speaker_heading: INT. PIT
text: Christmas looks around, desperate to help. Using Bond's
text: wire, she climbs up to the CLOSED IRIS DOOR. She pries open
text: a panel next to it and reveals complex WIRING...
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY
text: Up ahead of Bond, the bomb disappears down the passageway. He
text: can see it is attached to A PULLEY above, helping the men to
text: move quickly, Renard, pulling, the two men pushing
text: Renard signals one of them to drop back to cut off Bond...
text: Machine-gun fire turns the wall next to Bond to dust -- Bond
text: dives to a recess. An overhead LIGHT SHATTERS. His section
text: of the tunnel darkens.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY - BOND'S END
text: Bond looks up at the broken LIGHT. Takes careful aim at the
text: next one along. BLAM. It disintegrates. Again...
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY - RENARD'S END
text: The other guy answers with another spray of bullets. Watches
text: uneasily as Bond takes out light after light. A funnel of
text: darkness coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach.
text: Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the
text: void. To keep it lit, he keeps firing...
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY
text: WITH BOND as the bullets cease with a loud CLICK... What
text: Bond was waiting for. He moves. The gunman frozen in the
text: light, grappling to fit another clip --
text: BLAM! He goes down. Bond not wasting bullets.
scene_heading: INT. OTHER END OF PASSAGEWAY
text: Renard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a
text: switch on the panel by the elevator. The IRIS starts closing
dialog: on Bond...
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY
text: Bond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he
text: shot lunges. Clings to him.
text: Bond hits him away, he LEAPS for the cart blocking his way
text: and SHOVES IT INTO THE IRIS DOOR just as it almost closes...
text: Bond squeezes through...
scene_heading: INT. OTHER SIDE OF IRIS
text: Renard is getting in the ELEVATOR. Sees Bond made it, fires.
text: Bond rolls into a corner.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: We have our fireworks. Now you can have
dialog: yours.
text: And he machine-guns some barrels. Rocket fuel spills out.
text: He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the
text: metal so more fuel cascades out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CATWALK ABOVE PIT
text: Christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her IRIS
speaker_heading: DOOR OPENS...
speaker_heading: AT THE ELEVATOR
text: Bond fires at Renard, hitting his shin...
speaker_heading: WITH RENARD
text: looking down at his shin, noticing the blood. Inconvenienced
text: but not in pain. He shuts the cage doors. Pauses only to
text: fire off half a clip at the SWITCH PANEL. Shreds it.
text: Bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the
text: elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile. He POINTS
text: DOWN...underneath him...
text: Bond looks down.
text: HIS P.O.V. BENEATH THE ELEVATOR...A makeshift explosive
text: device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set
dialog: to explode
text: Eyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch
text: panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires.
scene_heading: INT. LIFT SHAFT
dialog: The pipe bomb ticking...
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY BY ELEVATOR
text: Bond is trapped. He looks up...
text: THE PULLEY HOOK HANGS DOWN...
text: He jumps up, grabbing it, just as...
speaker_heading: KABOOM!
text: The bomb ignites the spilled oil, A FIREBALL shoots along,
text: scorching after Bond, who is SAILING THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY,
text: the force of the blast sending him hurling down the
text: passageway ON THE PULLEY...heading straight for:
text: A CLOSED IRIS DOOR which miraculously begins to OPEN as he
text: SHOOTS THROUGH...
text: Ahead, the next door is OPEN as well. He sees CHRISTMAS on
dialog: the other side...
text: HER P.O.V. Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a MASSIVE
dialog: FIREBALL...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Close the door! Close the door!
text: But before she can, two of the FUEL BARRELS HURTLE through
text: the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire
dialog: below.
text: Flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them.
text: Bond looks up, sees the ARM OF THE ROBOT LIFTER, stretching
text: upward toward an old SHAFT t the top of the ceiling...
text: He and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the
dialog: spider-like web that supported the bomb and find...
text: AN OLD ELEVATOR...powered by a hydraulic system...
text: They get in...hear the rumbling of the fire below...the old
text: elevator moves slowly...the rumbling grows louder...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Shame you had to spot I wasn't the real
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: So who are you?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Bond --
text: Bond FIRES HIS GUN at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and...
text: THE ELEVATOR shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as
text: BELOW THEM...THE PIT EXPLODES...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR
text: Fire shoots up. Bond lunges to cover Christmas. As the smoke
dialog: clears:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (finishing)
dialog: James Bond.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MESA - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - CONTINUOUS
text: Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct. Through a cloud of
text: dust he can see people running about, panicked. There's been
text: some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground.
text: Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way. The plane.
text: It roars past, level with them. He follows it with his eyes,
dialog: helpless as it gets smaller and smaller...
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: They won't get far. Every warhead has a
text: locator card. A Miratom device. Emits a
text: high-pitched signal on Russian emergency
dialog: frequencies. We can track the bomb.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: With this?
text: Bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to
text: her. It flashes in the sun.
text: Christmas shakes her head, disgusted.
speaker_heading: OMITTED 170 - 172

text: The face of ELEKTRA materializes on a large WALL MONITOR.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I'm sorry. I would never call you
dialog: except...Bond's disappeared. He...he left
dialog: my villa, some time in the middle of the

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: My head of security has been found near a

text: M leans on the console in front of her.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: I'll send someone out.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Could...could you come?
text: M looks up.
text: ELEKTRA, on the monitor, looks about as lost as she ever has.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I just can't help thinking...I'm next.
text: M stares at the girl's face, her whole sordid history written
text: there. M turns away from the screen and says to Tanner...
speaker_heading: M

scene_heading: INT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - BAKU - DAY
text: Elektra works in her father's STUDY, illuminated by a halo of
text: light from a single desk lamp. Pictures of her grandfather
text: and father stare down at her from the walls. The wind BLOWS A
text: WINDOW open.
text: She gets up, crosses the room, shutting the window. She
text: stands there, listening to the silence and then...
text: SHE HEARS A THUD. A strange, unsettling thud.
text: She listens, a long time, to the silence.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Gabor...?
text: She goes to the door, opens it...it whines on its hinges.
text: She steps into...
speaker_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: A big room lined with books. Three french doors lead out to a

text: THE DOOR SHUTS BEHIND HER, she whirls...
text: GABOR, propped up behind the door, stares, wide-eyed, before
text: he FALLS TO THE FLOOR.
text: Elektra gasps, she turns again...
text: A DARK FIGURE LOOMS, a shadow against the windows. He moves
text: forward, his face becoming visible...IT'S BOND.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: James!
text: She stares at him, shocked, hesitant.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You look surprised.
text: She moves to Gabor, gets down to help him. He stirs, he is
text: alive, but unconscious. Elektra looks up at Bond.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: A little. Does it matter? After all,
dialog: what's the point of living if you can't
dialog: feel alive? Isn't that right, Elektra?
dialog: Isn't that your motto?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Or did you steal it from your old friend
dialog: Renard?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: ...what?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about
dialog: us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew
dialog: exactly where to hurt me...
text: Elektra stands...she begins to tremble.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Are you saying...Renard is the man who's
dialog: trying to kill me?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You can drop the act, it's over.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I think you do.
text: He walks toward her, threatening...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome.
dialog: It's common in kidnappings. A young
dialog: impressionable victim. Sheltered,
text: sexually inexperienced. A powerful
dialog: kidnapper skilled in torture, in
dialog: manipulation. Something snaps in the
text: victim's mind. The captive falls in love
dialog: with her captor.
text: At the word "love," Elektra explodes. She SLAPS an
text: unsuspecting Bond hard across the face.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: How dare you! How dare you! That
dialog: animal!? That monster!? He disgusts me!
dialog: You disgust me! So he knew where to hurt
dialog: you, is that it? You had a sling on your
dialog: arm at the funeral! I didn't have to
dialog: sleep with you to find that out.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He used your exact words.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You knew. You knew all the time, that he
dialog: was out there, that he was coming for me,
dialog: and you lied. You used me, you used me as
dialog: bait. You made love to me -- what, to
dialog: pass the time as you waited for him to
dialog: strike?
text: He has no answer. He can't deny what she says.
text: The phone rings, cuts through the tension. Bond and Elektra
text: staring at one another. She lets it ring... Then picks up.
text: Listens, looks to Bond.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
text: He's struck again.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'm coming with you.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You do what you have to do, but I've
dialog: called in M. She's en route from London
dialog: even now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - DAY
text: The MI-6 chopper lands. We can see M through the window.
text: Face set hard.
scene_heading: EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - MOMENTS LATER
scene_heading: SCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked
text: around a medium-sized industrial plant.
text: Bond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices.
text: All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (to Bond)
dialog: Glad to see you've turned up.
text: He is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a
dialog: scientist here from the International
dialog: Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones. She
text: has ten crews combing the area.
text: They step out of the bright sunlight and into
scene_heading: EXT.\INT. CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS
text: FIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers. M surveys
text: the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several
text: men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters.
text: ELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman
text: explain what's happening. She nods acknowledgement to M.
dialog: Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone:
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I'll see how they're coming with the
dialog: power...
text: They watch him go. M turns to Bond:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: You had your hand on the bomb and you let
dialog: Renard get away with it.
text: He draws her away, to a small alcove. Takes something out of
text: his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The report King bought. It's a manual.
dialog: Renard's men used it to remove this radio
text: tracking device from the warhead.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Then Robert was right about a Russian
dialog: connection.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: They're getting their weapons from the
dialog: Russians, but where are they getting the
dialog: money to buy the weapons? I can't help
dialog: thinking...the person close to King, the
dialog: one who switched that pin...
speaker_heading: M
dialog: The inside man?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Is maybe...the inside woman.
text: NOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity
text: of their exchange. The room is lined with MONITORS and a
text: huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: A woman?
text: But before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A
text: DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: That's not right.
text: A Technician comes over. Tanner too, followed by Bond and M.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
text: It's an observation and repair rig.
text: Travels along the pipe, checks for broken
dialog: seals. But it's not supposed to be
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Stop it.
text: The Technician flicks two switches. The light continues to
text: flash. Confused, he tries others. No change.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I don't understand...
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Where is the rig?
text: Harried, the Technician activates the wall schematic of the
text: pipeline. A pulse of light travels along the line. And with
text: it, a sense of horror descends...
speaker_heading: M
text: The parcel's in the post.
speaker_heading: TANNER
text: It's heading for the oil terminal.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Where it can do the most damage.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: My God.
dialog: (to one of her men)
dialog: Have the terminal evacuated.
text: The man gets on the phone...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (to Tech)
dialog: Speed?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Full on. Seventy miles an hour.
text: He punches buttons. Christmas has come, stands next to Bond.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: One hundred and six miles from the
dialog: terminal.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (quick)
dialog: It'll reach the other end in seventy-
dialog: eight minutes.
dialog: (to Tech)
dialog: Any more of these rigs?
text: The Technician checks his records, looks up, nods.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: There's one parked in the passageway
dialog: ahead of it.
text: Decisive, Christmas heads for the door, turns to her team:
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: I'll need some help...
text: Her IDA colleagues look sheepish. Bond moves to her.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Come on.
text: For just a moment, Christmas looks wary:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Unless you'd like to see my ID first.
text: She almost smiles.
text: M nods to Tanner to follow them. Bond doesn't look at
text: Elektra. But she watches him go...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY
text: The MI-6 helicopter swoops along the pipeline...
text: Tanner is beside the pilot. Bond and Christmas in the back.
text: They look at one another, the danger ahead melting the frost
dialog: between them.
scene_heading: INT. PIPELINE - LATER
text: Bond and Christmas climb through an access hatch down onto
text: the electric RIG. Its lights blaze fifty yards into the
text: tunnel. Then darkness.
text: Christmas takes the driver's spot, Bond the rear, nearest to
text: the approaching BOMB. Tanner leans in:
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (sealing them in)
dialog: Good luck.
text: Bonds nods, checks his watch. Christmas looks nervously down
dialog: the pipe.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Be one along any minute.
text: And she starts the machine off...
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING)
text: It quickly picks up speed, its lights flooding the seemingly
text: endless pipe before them.
text: Christmas looks behind, apprehensive. Waiting for the lights
dialog: of the explosive rig.
text: It's tense. They travel along, expectant...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: When this is over we should bury the
dialog: hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: When this is over our bodies may be blown
text: to smithereens.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Alright then, brunch.
text: His lightness relaxes her, she appreciates it.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS
text: Elektra, M, and others. The room is crowded with concerned
text: personnel. M watches the two blips on the schematic getting
text: closer together. One of her MEN approaches, a radio in his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: RADIO MAN
text: Tanner reports Bond is headed for the
dialog: rendezvous.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Excellent. Evacuate Miss King and the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You can evacuate my workers, but I'm not
dialog: going anywhere.
text: M looks at her, then nods, impressed by her courage.
scene_heading: INT. PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY
text: Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly. Tense silence.
text: Finally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER. Lights appear
text: behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig
text: tearing through the pipe.
text: Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas'
dialog: speedometer...she's only at fifty...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Faster! Get our speed up!
text: Christmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward
text: the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer...
text: Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact. He cushions the
text: blow with his feet. Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS
text: ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across.
text: The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Tactical fission device. Low yield.
text: They look at one another, then set straight to work.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS
text: The room is quiet, tense. M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor,
text: the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the
text: doors. They are the only ones left. Going down with the
text: ship...if it goes. M and Elektra watch the two lights now
text: together on the console. A tense silence. Everyone's edgy.
text: Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest. She exchanges a
dialog: glance with Gabor.
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY
text: CLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB: the timer. 1:45 MINUTES.
text: Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're
text: attempting. The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29...
speaker_heading: OMITTED 217-218
scene_heading: INT. PIPELINE - DAY
text: The rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see. But
text: WHOOSH! As the rigs hurtle past...
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY
text: The pipe suddenly dips. They cling on as the machine bucks
text: like a rollercoaster. Back on a straight...
text: Her brow furrows.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: The plutonium is missing. They've taken
dialog: the core!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Then it's no longer a bomb?
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (back to work, urgent)
dialog: It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if
text: the trigger charge goes off...
text: Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel.
text: He stares at the timer: 0:44, 0:43... Makes a decision.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Let it blow.
text: Christmas shoots a look, astonished.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: But we can stop it.
dialog: Taking her arm...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Let it blow.
text: She can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an
text: INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Trust me. Leave it.
text: He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb.
scene_heading: INT. PIPELINE - DAY
text: The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking
text: her with him. They tumble along the pipe. Agile, Bond
text: springs to his feet, pulls her up. They run like hell for
dialog: the hatch, into the darkness...
scene_heading: EXT. PIPELINE - DAY
text: The pipeline. A long beat, then...
text: KABOOM!! A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in
dialog: every direction.
text: As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has
dialog: been destroyed.
speaker_heading: OMIT 223
scene_heading: INT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME
text: On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from
text: the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP....
text: The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio
text: earpiece in his ear, reports information.
speaker_heading: GABOR
dialog: It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud.
text: The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard
dialog: section of pipeline...
speaker_heading: M
dialog: And Bond?
text: An agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies.
speaker_heading: GABOR
dialog: Nothing.
text: M and Elektra share a look.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Do you think he's dead?
text: M can't answer. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: We just have to wait.
text: M shifts. The hi-tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red
text: lights on every screen, showing the explosion.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (to M)
dialog: I have a gift for you. Something that
dialog: belonged to my father. He would have
dialog: wanted you to have it.
dialog: M feels uneasy.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Perhaps this isn't the time...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Please.
text: She hands M a small box. M unties the ribbon.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: He often spoke of how...compassionately
dialog: you advised him on the best course of
dialog: action during my kidnapping.
text: M opens the box. It is THE EYE OF THE GLENS...the heirloom
dialog: pin, the original.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: It's very valuable, you know. I just
dialog: couldn't let it explode with the rest of
dialog: him.
text: M looks up, horrified, when:
text: GABOR AND ANOTHER SECURITY MAN SHOOT M'S TWO GUARDS IN THE
text: HEAD...point blank, cold blood. The men fall.
text: M looks back at Elektra, a blood-curdling glare.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (to her men)
dialog: Take her to the chopper.
scene_heading: EXT. PIPELINE - DAY
dialog: From on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it
text: disappears in a VAST, SMOULDERING BOMB CRATER. Beyond, the
text: pipeline continues unperturbed.
text: Two TINY FIGURES on the banks of the crater.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON THEM
text: Bond and Christmas, very much alive. She's angry.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What the hell were you doing? You nearly
dialog: killed us!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I did kill us. She thinks we're dead.
dialog: And she thinks she got away with it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It's part of some plan. She dresses it up
dialog: like a terrorist attack. The explosion
dialog: covers up the theft of the plutonium.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Who's she?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Elektra King.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Elektra King? Are you insane? This is
dialog: her pipeline.
speaker_heading: BOND
text: Makes her look even more innocent.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: What would she want with weapons grade
dialog: plutonium?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I was hoping you could tell me.
text: Christmas stares at him. Wheels turning.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: You steal an old bomb, small by today's
dialog: standards, about the size of the one that
dialog: destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium
dialog: core out of it, intending to use it...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: To make a bigger, better bomb.
text: They're both chilled by the thought.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: I have to get after that core. This is
dialog: my ass.
text: She starts fiddling with the radio. Suddenly there's a
speaker_heading: CRACKLE.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Tanner to 007, do you read?
text: Bond grabs the radio.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Loud and clear. I have to speak to M.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She's gone.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She's disappeared. And two of our men
dialog: have been killed.
text: It impacts on Bond. His eyes harden.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: She just upped the stakes. All her chips
dialog: are on the table now. And M's life is
dialog: part of the bet.
text: He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly
dialog: snake with the world for its bed.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I know I promised you champagne, but
dialog: would you settle for caviar?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - ISTANBUL - TWILIGHT
text: A boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast
dialog: body of water (in fact, the Bosphorus).
text: Renard disembarks with several of his retinue, heavily laden
text: with bags and cases. They enter the tower...
scene_heading: INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS
text: A fantastic space: stained glass windows cast myriad
text: patterns over elaborate tile and marble surfaces. Pillars,
text: iron lattices, velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge
dialog: room.
text: As they enter, Elektra swoops across the floor and into
text: Renard's arms. He holds her. She pushes him away.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You're hurting me.
text: He senses something different between them. She tries to
dialog: hide it.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Brought me something?
text: He smiles, grabs a case off one of his men, opens it up,
text: pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal.
text: She looks at it with wary fascination.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Go on. It's safe. Touch your destiny.
text: She traces a finger along the metal. A flicker of wonder:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Warm.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: Is it?
dialog: She's sensitive to his buried frustration:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I've brought something for you as well.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Elektra opens a heavy door, she and Renard past through to...
text: A SMALL ROOM...a window set in the stone on one side. The
text: other side is divided off by a WALL OF BARS, creating a cell
dialog: which now contains: M
text: The cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner. M
text: betrays no fear. A quiet defiance burns in her.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Just as I promised.
text: Renard steps forward. Bars separate him from M.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: My executioner.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Over-praise, I'm afraid. But my people
dialog: will finish the job.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Your people? Your people will leave you
dialog: here to rot just like you left me. You
dialog: and my father. He didn't think my life
dialog: was worth the chump change he spent on a
text: day at the stock market.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Your father...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my
dialog: mother. The kingdom I will rightly take
dialog: back.
text: Elektra leaves. Renard is left alone with M.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: She's insane. Is that what you did to
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: No. I'm afraid it is what you did.
text: He crosses close to the bars.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: When I took her she was...promise itself.
dialog: So clever, so vibrant, so...full of life
dialog: force. And you left her there, at the
dialog: mercy of a man like me. You ruined her.
dialog: For what? To get to me? She is worth
dialog: fifty of me.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: For once, I agree with you.
text: He shakes his head, amused by her pluck.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: So she used all that brilliance to get
dialog: revenge on her father, on me.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: No. I wanted you. I wanted you for
dialog: myself.
text: He takes something out of his pocket. A small TRAVEL CLOCK.
text: He sets it.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Since you sent your man to kill me, I
dialog: have been watching time tick slowly away,
dialog: marching inevitably toward my own death.
dialog: Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow,
dialog: your time is up. And I guarantee you...I
dialog: will not miss. You will die. Along with
dialog: everyone in this city and the future of
dialog: the West.
text: He places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach
text: through her bars. He leaves. We hold on the clock:

scene_heading: EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.175)

scene_heading: INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.176)
text: Nailed on the battered old door, the lid of a caviar jar, a

text: opens the door and finds himself...
text: Staring straight down Bond's pistol. Bond and Christmas are
text: silhouetted by the gold dusk light. At their feet lies one
dialog: of Zukovsky's workers.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress
dialog: this innocent thing?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: She's no innocent. This is my nuclear

speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Ah, I see. A purely...plutonic
dialog: relationship.
text: Hands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening
text: dress decidedly out of place here.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice
dialog: Russian scientist with hair growing out
dialog: of his ears?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What's your business with Elektra King?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: I thought you were the one in her
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: She dropped a million and half dollars to
dialog: the House -- your House. And you didn't
dialog: even bat an eyelid. She was paying you
dialog: off. What for?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: As ever you are the spy who has to see a
dialog: plot wherever he looks.
text: Bond SLAMS Zukovsky hard against a vat of caviar. Wood
text: splits, roe spills onto the floor. Zukovsky is appalled.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You are out of your league. She's
dialog: working with Renard.
text: Christmas moves in, intense but firm:
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: They've stolen a nuclear device.
text: A subtle change in Zukovsky's countenance.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Tell us what you know, Zukovsky. Tell
dialog: us, before its too late.
dialog: But it may be already:
text: The SOUND OF A HELICOPTER. Zukovsky frowns, the SOUND
speaker_heading: GETTING LOUDER --
dialog: Bond is the first to move as --
scene_heading: INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - NIGHT (OLD SC. 177)

scene_heading: tear open behind them - GIANT VERTICALLY-SUSPENDED SAWS RIP

scene_heading: EXT. RAMP TO LOWER WALKWAY (OLD SC. 180)
text: Bond makes for his BMW, running down a flight of steps, onto
text: a lower walkway when...THE SECTION AHEAD OF HIM
text: EXPLODES...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a
text: thrown grenade. Bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the
text: only way out is ALONG THE PIPELINES...he runs along a narrow

dialog: stairway.
scene_heading: INT. CAVIAR FISHERY
text: Zukovsky and Christmas watch in horror as Chopper One blades

scene_heading: EXT. LOWER WALKWAY
text: Bond takes something out of his pocket, a remote control
dialog: device...he presses some buttons...HIS CAR COMES TO
text: LIFE...lights on, it drives toward him.
text: He rushes to meet it. Chopper Two follows behind Bond,
text: slicing up the walkway just behind him. Bond gets to the car
text: and JUMPS IN as the chopper veers away.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Bond activates his missile device as he watches Chopper Two
text: pass behind the factory. Suddenly there's a huge roar behind
text: him as the blades from Chopper One RIP THROUGH THE ROOF,
text: SLICING HIS CAR IN HALF.
text: But Bond is undeterred. He sets off the missile toward the
dialog: disappearing Chopper One.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOPPER
text: A DIRECT HIT. Chopper One explodes and falls onto the walkway
text: setting the scene ablaze.
scene_heading: EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME
text: Zukovsky and Christmas see the explosion, then see Chopper

text: make their way toward the factory, firing at the guards.
text: Zukovsky and Christmas are forced inside.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BOND
text: Who sees the danger to the others and runs off along the

scene_heading: EXT. FACTORY
text: The gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's

scene_heading: INT. FACTORY - NIGHT
text: The chauffeur is shot and killed. The gunmen then turn their

scene_heading: EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME
text: Bond sees Zukovsky and Christmas swimming to safety. The

text: then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it
dialog: approaches Bond for the kill....

speaker_heading: THE GAS EXPLODES!

scene_heading: EXT. WALKWAY

text: The caviar pit is like sinking sand, deep -- he's going

scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF CAVIAR PIT (OLD SC. 199)
speaker_heading: POV ZUKOVSKY:

speaker_heading: BOND

dialog: Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle
dialog: machinery for her. Russian stuff.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: And the payoff on the tables?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: A special job. A...a...a submarine.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is
text: Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Where's the sub going?!
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: No! Get me out!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: This is too big for even you. Where is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: This is a family matter! If my nephew is
dialog: in danger, we do it my way, or nothing!
dialog: Now get me out!
text: But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with
text: the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: No! Bond!
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Bond!
text: Bond fires. Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM.
text: It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the
text: harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him. He clings
text: to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to
dialog: safety.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Commander Bond, you are dangerous,
dialog: unpredictable, and a hothead.
text: He just looks at her.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: But then again, explosive devices are my
dialog: specialty.
text: Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to
text: the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind
text: him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: So. My way. No MI-6, no Interpol. Just

scene_heading: INT. M'S CELL - NIGHT
text: M paces her cell. Looks out, at the clock:
text: It is MIDNIGHT. Twelve hours to go.
text: She crosses her arms. Returns to pacing. Puts her hands in

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: How would you know?

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Of course...

speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: He was a...good lover?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: What do you think?
text: Renard leans against her desk, closing his eyes, squeezing
text: out the images. After a moment, he SMASHES HIS FIST through
text: the hand-painted wood. Elektra looks up.
text: HER P.O.V. A huge splinter of wood juts out of Renard's
dialog: hand.
text: Renard looks at it, curious, unfazed.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Nothing.
text: Elektra comes to him. Leads him to the bed. Sits. Gently
text: removes the splinter. Then, she takes an icecube from the
text: bucket. Runs it along his wound.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: What about this?
text: And she runs the ice down his cheek. He shakes his head.
dialog: Tormented.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Nothing.
text: Now she runs the ice down her neck...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: But surely...
text: ...her fingers becoming wet, she runs the ice down between

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: ...You can feel this?

scene_heading: AN OLD KGB SURVEILLANCE CENTER
text: Pushed to one end of the large room are stacks of radio

text: Once a high-tech surveillance center, it has gone to seed.

speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (to Zukovsky)
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye
dialog: Factory was just a front; now it turns a

text: Bond notices THE BOA in the corner with some others.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Your old friend Dmitri.

text: Zukovsky looks at the map.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: In the good old days, the KGB had three

speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS

dialog: Put weapons grade plutonium inside the

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Made to look just like an accident.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Mother of God.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The right kind of explosion in the right
dialog: spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut

speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: But why? Eight million people would die,
text: the land irradiated for a hundred years.
text: A cloud of radiation the size of
dialog: Europe...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (chilled)
dialog: Because an explosion like that would kill

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA

speaker_heading: RENARD

scene_heading: INT. M'S CELL - SAME

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DYE FACTORY - SAME
text: The Radio Operator touches his earpiece...
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Comrade, it's faint, but I'm getting

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The rest?

speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Forty, forty-three degrees East...

speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: The Maiden's Tower.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How appropriate.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: I'd heard there were some renovations
dialog: there...no one would look for a sub in
dialog: that place in a million years.
text: Suddenly Bond's instinct are aroused. Out of the corner of
text: his eye, he sees THE BOA set something on the ground and move
text: slowly UP THE STAIRS.
text: Bond looks at the pack he left on the ground...
text: He grabs Christmas and HURLS HER TO THE FLOOR.
speaker_heading: KABOOM!
text: A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rips the place apart. In half a second
text: the air is thick with coloured dust and drifting clumps of
dialog: burning silk.
text: Bond stands. Christmas is stunned, but okay. He looks

dialog: them, Zukovsky.
text: Bond heads for the door after the Boa.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Zukovsky...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: If I don't get to the Boa before he gets

dialog: Bond runs out, into
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA
text: climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF.
text: Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the
dialog: top of the roof...
text: Boa has now been joined by THREE THUGS. One attacks Bond as
text: the Boa and the others move away...
text: Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof,
text: gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and
text: THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls...
speaker_heading: EXT. BAZAAR
text: Into the market below.
text: Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body
text: falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond...
text: But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth.
text: She turns and runs...the thug gives chase...
speaker_heading: ON THE ROOFS ABOVE
text: Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from
text: roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of...
scene_heading: EXT. MOVING BUS
text: Motoring rapidly away from him. He makes a spectacular leap
text: to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus,
text: dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the
text: overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks.
speaker_heading: ON THE BUS
text: Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him.
text: They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus
text: speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy
dialog: over...
text: The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS...
text: Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has
text: climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with
dialog: his gun when...
text: THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug
text: Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly
speaker_heading: ELECTROCUTED.
text: Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond
text: time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE
dialog: BUS...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast
text: moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van
text: and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR.
speaker_heading: ON THE BUS
text: Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them.
text: The bus is hissing to a stop.
text: The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck. Bond rushes
text: forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi. The taxi
text: jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to
text: the street. He springs to his feet.
text: Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for
text: traffic. The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY
text: The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water
text: pipes and drink coffee. The Boa is nowhere to be seen.
text: Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his
text: leg so as not to alarm the civilians. He steps into the
dialog: cafe.
scene_heading: EXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY
text: Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the
text: back. He looks inside - just a few children at play. Bond
text: is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which
text: brings him to his knees. He struggles to bring up his gun -
text: but the Boa knocks it out of his hand.
text: The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from
text: behind. Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail.
text: He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach.
text: Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it.
text: Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across
text: the room. He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.
speaker_heading: BOA
dialog: For years I was told I could never take
dialog: the great James Bond and his Walther PPK.
dialog: What good is your gun now, Bond?
text: Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim. He slumps
text: forward, his left hand touches something hot. It's the iron
text: basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite. Bond's
text: fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top. He
dialog: grabs it and with his last reserves -
text: Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side
text: of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT
speaker_heading: SKILLET.
text: The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of
text: his face. Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying
dialog: to clear his head.
text: The Boa runs out the back door. Bond finds his gun, holsters
dialog: it and follows.
scene_heading: EXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY
text: Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND
text: SHOPPERS. Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the
dialog: crowd to...
scene_heading: EXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY
text: RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo. Bond enters square in
dialog: time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian
dialog: steamer.
text: As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to
text: the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo
text: net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom.
scene_heading: EXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY
text: Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck. He lumbers across it
text: but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by
text: Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck
text: house. The Boa goes sprawling. As Bond comes for him he
text: scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and
text: swings at Bond. But Bond is ready for him. He wards off the
text: blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate. He
text: traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks
text: in the solar plexus. He Boa stages back to the railing. A
text: final kick from Bond sends him over the side...
text: THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A
scene_heading: SICKENING THUD.
text: Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his
dialog: neck broken.
text: Bond sighs, turns...
text: GABOR is there. Gun trained on him.
speaker_heading: GABOR
dialog: Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.
text: BOND'S P.O.V. A thug steps into sight below, holding

scene_heading: EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY
text: A magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus.
text: An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it. A tarp is raised
text: and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound. They are

scene_heading: INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY
text: Elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open. Kisses Bond

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
text: James Bond and his amazing resurrection.
dialog: If only you'd kept away, we might have

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (to guards)
dialog: Take her to Renard.
text: Bond and Christmas exchange a look as the guards start her
dialog: towards some steps.
text: Elektra indicates for him to sit. Behind him, the whole of

speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Pretty thing. You had her too?
text: Bond ignores her.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I could have given you the world.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Not interested.
text: This cuts. She casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a
text: wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar. A GAROTTE.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: They were digging near here and they
dialog: found some very pretty vases. They also
dialog: found this...
dialog: (meaning the garotte)
dialog: I think we ignore the old ways at our
dialog: peril, don't you?
text: Bond recoils as she fastens the collar... She steps back.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: Where's M?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Soon she'll be everywhere.
dialog: Bond keeps his cool:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: All this, because you fell for Renard?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Five more turns and your neck will break.
text: She moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw ONE
text: NOTCH. The effect on Bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts
text: into the back of his neck, tilts his head back.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Since I was a child, I've always had a
dialog: power over men. When I realized my father
dialog: wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I
dialog: knew I had to form a new alliance.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: You turned Renard.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Just like you...only you were even
dialog: easier.
text: She pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: I told him he had to hurt me, he had to
dialog: make it look real. When he refused I told
dialog: him I would do it myself.
text: She turns the screw again.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: So you killed your father.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: He killed me! He killed me the day he
dialog: refused to pay my ransom.
text: A flicker of emotion. Bond is getting to her.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Was this all about the oil?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: It is my oil! Mine and my family's!
text: Her eyes are shining. She moves toward the view, gazing out
text: at this spectacular cradle of civilization. Bond works his
text: wristbinds feverishly.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.
dialog: I'm going to redraw the map.
dialog: And when I am through the whole world
dialog: will know my name, my grandfather's name,
dialog: the glory of my people.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: No-one will believe this melt-down was an
dialog: accident.
text: She eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan.
text: Tightens the screw again. Her confidence amazing.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: They will believe. They will all
dialog: believe.
dialog: Tightening the screw again:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You understand? Nobody can resist me.
text: Now she straddles him. She puts the jewel back on her ear.
dialog: All the time, he's working that wristbind.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Know what happens when a man is
dialog: strangled?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Elektra, it's not too late. Eight
dialog: million people needn't die.
text: She smiles, twists the screw again. A nasty, grinding sound.
text: Sweat trickles from his brow. She licks it away.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: You should have killed me when you had
dialog: the chance. But you couldn't. Not me. A
dialog: woman you've loved.
text: She pushes her hips into his. Turns the screw. The bolt is
text: jammed right into the back of his neck. His face is angled
text: upwards. Breathing is difficult. He glares up:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You meant ... nothing ... to me.
text: She fingers the bolt. Prepares to turn it the last
text: time...His hand strains at its binding...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: One... last... screw?
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (kissing his ear)
dialog: Oh James.

text: Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a
text: boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of
text: his men. Two bodies in his trail. He's on course for
text: Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his
text: henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.
scene_heading: INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: Elektra moves to her gun. Just then, Gabor crashes through a
text: stained glass window, neck broken.
text: TWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors
text: burst open. Zukovsky stands there. A bloody giant.
text: They open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky
text: take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder. Right
text: now, he's unstoppable.
text: A shocked silence after the shooting. He eyes Bond in the
dialog: chair. To the room:
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: I'm looking for a submarine. It's big
dialog: and black, and the driver is a friend of
dialog: mine.
text: Then his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from
text: below. He knows at once what it means.
speaker_heading: ZUKOVSKY
dialog: Bring it to me.
text: She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun
text: beneath it). She proffers the hat...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: What a shame. You just missed him.
text: BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat.
text: He staggers back. Stares. Slumps down. Lowers his head to
dialog: the ground.
text: She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down,
text: smiling a half-psychotic smile. The gun is pinned.
dialog: Zukovsky is dying.
text: But he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun
text: a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already
text: pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as
text: Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger: he's going
dialog: to shoot Bond!
text: Bond stares back. Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for
dialog: extreme accuracy...
text: BLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist. Splinters
dialog: the wood there.
text: ELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky. She didn't see where the bullet
text: went, just that it missed Bond. She watches his head slump
text: further, staring at Bond...
text: A look passes between the two men. Comrades in arms. The
text: merest of smiles. Then the light fades from his eyes. Dead.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
text: turns back to Bond. Smiles.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Everything's under control up here. Are
dialog: you ready?
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Yes. Au revoir...
text: Lost for a moment, she breathes heavily. She glances at
text: Zukovsky's corpse. Slightly puzzled, to Bond:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: Zukovsky really hated you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Time to say goodnight.
text: And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer
dialog: twist...
dialog: One super-fast movement:
text: Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight. He holds
text: her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls
text: her backwards, her hand scratching at his face.
text: Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet. Moves
text: to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his
dialog: fingers.
text: Turns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs. A moment's
dialog: dilemma: should he race below to the sub -- or up to
dialog: Elektra?
text: He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY
text: The submarine's engines roar to life.
scene_heading: INT. TOWER - CONTINUOUS
text: ELEKTRA rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading
text: to the various balconies of the minaret tower.
scene_heading: INT. TOWER/M'S CELL - DAY
text: Bond stalks up after her. THEIR VOICES ECHO through the
dialog: intertwined stairs:
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: James. You can't kill me. Not in cold
dialog: blood.
text: But Bond isn't wavering. Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun.
text: He heads up in the semi-darkness -- and suddenly swings to
text: his right, at an unexpected but familiar Voice:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Bond --
text: Bond kicks open a door and enters...
speaker_heading: M'S PRISON ROOM
text: He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her. Turns to
text: go, heading upward, after Elektra.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Go after the submarine, forget the girl.
dialog: Bond!
scene_heading: INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: Elektra has reached a balcony. It affords a spectacular view
text: of Istanbul. Bond appears, has her cornered.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Call him off.
text: He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I won't ask again. Call him off!
text: She looks at him seriously. He's giving her a last chance,
dialog: willing her to save herself and the city.
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: Renard.
dialog: Bond waits...
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (to Bond)
dialog: You wouldn't kill me. You'd miss me.
text: And her face breaks into a perverted grin and --
speaker_heading: ELEKTRA
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: Dive! Bond --
text: BLAM! Bond shoots her.
text: She staggers back, shocked at her own mortality.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I never miss.
dialog: He looks out:
scene_heading: EXT. BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half
text: submerged. The hatch is still open.
scene_heading: INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: He stares at her dead body a beat. And then, he crouches. He
text: touches her cheek, just once, before he goes.
text: Behind him, unbeknownst, M has seen it all.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: He moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and
text: DIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water. Amazing.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: He surfaces close to the exiting sub. Grabs a ladder, pulls
dialog: himself up.
text: The hatch is closing... He splashes through the water
text: flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor
text: shutting the hatch. WHACKS him with the hatch. Gets inside.
text: Closes it. Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the
dialog: water.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond down below. Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub.
text: He creeps through...
text: Approaches one man working some levers, smoking. Bond holds
text: his gun to his head.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How do you want to die?
dialog: (re: cigarette)
dialog: That?
dialog: (re: gun)
dialog: Or this?
scene_heading: INT. CABIN, SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER
text: A few SOLID BANGS on the metal of Christmas' door. It opens
text: and Bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck. That was
text: his head banging.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: James!...
text: He takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of
dialog: the sub.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER
text: A man is operating the tanks. Through the intercom:
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Flood tanks 4 and 5...
text: The man does as told. When he's finished -- Bond knocks him
text: out with the butt of his gun.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Several men occupy the central control room, Renard at their
text: centre. Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the
dialog: reactor.
scene_heading: INT. OTHER END OF CONTROL ROOM - SUBMARINE - DAY
text: From the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas,
dialog: so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor
dialog: because there are so many men in there.
dialog: Keeping behind cover:
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Is there another way?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We go down to the torpedo bay.
scene_heading: INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE LOWER DECK - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bond and Christmas get attacked. A vicious, silent fight...
text: Then the radio set sparks into life --
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Open the tanks.
text: Bond is throttling the man with the cable. Speaks into the
dialog: handset.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (disguising voice)
text: Tanks open.
text: But the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm:
speaker_heading: The KLAXON RESOUNDS.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Renard looks up.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Bond...
text: He flicks a switch;
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: (into mic)
dialog: Bond! You have decided to join me on this
dialog: historic voyage. Welcome to my nuclear
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
scene_heading: BOND ON AN INTERCOM:
text: His voice fills the control room.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You're really going to commit suicide for
dialog: her?
text: Renard responds, into the microphone.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: In case you've forgotten. I'm dead
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Haven't you heard the news? So is she.
text: Renard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he
dialog: could feel in his skin...he SCREAMS...
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE...
text: The scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the
dialog: doomed craft.
text: BACK ON RENARD, gasping, spent.
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: You will die for this.
text: He strides through to the
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER
text: Jams shut the hatch behind him. Now moves through to the
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR
text: Where he picks up the PLUTONIUM. Moves back into the
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER
text: Sealing the other door behind him. And now he opens up the
text: cover of the glaring REACTOR...
scene_heading: INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Christmas sees a panel light up:
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: The cover is off the reactor.
text: Bond reads off more lights...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He's sealed himself in.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: He's going to insert the plutonium.
text: Thinking fast, Bond moves to some controls. Hits switches.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Do you know what you're doing?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Like riding a bike.
scene_heading: INT. AIR TANKS, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: The air tanks immediately filling with water.
scene_heading: INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Christmas and Bond shift to the side. Everything not screwed
text: down starts sliding...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS - LONG SHOT
text: The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose
dialog: dropping down and down...
dialog: Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a
text: submarine hanging vertically, nose down.
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the
dialog: nearest wall.
scene_heading: INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip. He helps her up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What kind of bikes did you ride?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Just wanted to put him on edge...
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Renard is disturbed by the sub's position, but only
dialog: momentarily.
text: He moves to an intercom:
speaker_heading: RENARD
dialog: Open the torpedo tubes.
scene_heading: INT. TORPEDO ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond hears a creak, turns to see the tubes open -- water
text: gushes up toward them at an incredible rate.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Climb!
text: He pulls Christmas up and they ascend to the next level. No
dialog: chance to seal the chamber though, the water is already
dialog: through the hatch.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Keep moving.
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: Renard now struggles back up to the reactor, stares into the
dialog: violet blue heat...
text: He hits a button. A ROD slowly rises out of the reactor.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond and Christmas are ahead of the water. They have reached
dialog: a level where various systems are operated from.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: There's one chance.
text: He punches buttons.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS
text: High up on the sub, a hatch opens. Water floods into an
text: escape hatch. An inner door stops it getting into the
dialog: submarine itself.
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: Renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod. Immediately the
text: light around him becomes a deeper blue, a horrible
text: luminescence. The staccato click of a distant Geiger counter
dialog: intensifies.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: As Bond opens the inner door of an ESCAPE HATCH, he points
text: out a cabinet on the wall to Christmas.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Re-breathers.
text: She opens the box to find the RE-BREATHERS are ripped to
dialog: shreds. No-one was ever meant to get off the sub. She shows
dialog: Bond.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Never liked those things anyway.
text: He climbs into the escape chamber.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Count to twenty. When you get to twenty
text: open the hatch. It can only be opened
dialog: for a few seconds or we'll sink.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: But what if...
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Count to twenty. I'll be there.
text: She moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which
text: immediately floods the chamber with water.
scene_heading: INT. ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Inside the chamber, Bond holds his breath as water seeps in.
dialog: The most claustrophobic thing you've ever seen.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: A green light comes on and Christmas punches a button...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE, ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS
text: The OUTER DOOR opens... Bond burst out and starts the long
text: swim up the OUTSIDE OF THE SUBMARINE...
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - SAME
dialog: Christmas is counting.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: One, one thousand, two, one thousand...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER
dialog: It's dark out here. It would be very easy for Bond to get
text: disoriented.
text: He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast
text: vertical whale he's swimming up.
text: Passes the conning tower.
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one
dialog: thousand...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER
text: Bond is running out of air...
text: And then he sees it -- the open hatch of the rear escape
dialog: door.
text: He gets inside, yanks it closed...
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Christmas, shivering in the rising water.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Twenty.
text: She presses a button...
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water.
text: The hatch closes.
text: The whole world is at a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at
text: the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses.
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor,
text: Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of
dialog: the door...
text: KER-BLAM! A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
text: The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond.
text: Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard,
text: now a crumpled heap in the corner.
text: Bond moves down to the next door, opens it:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Christmas!
text: And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still
dialog: rising...
text: He lowers an arm, pulls her up.
text: They clamber up to the reactor:
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER
text: BOND'S POV: in the intense glow inside -- the overheating
text: rod, protruding slightly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: We have to get the rod out of the
dialog: reactor!
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER
text: Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD.
text: Christmas comes up level with him:
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Melting down. 4000 degrees, the
text: Zirconium casings on the rods crack.
dialog: 5000, the plutonium melts. In ten
dialog: minutes, a hydrogen explosion.
text: THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING...
text: He starts toward the reactor when suddenly
text: RENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM.
text: CHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through
text: the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life.
speaker_heading: THE GAUGE HITS 4700
speaker_heading: BOND AND RENARD
text: struggle... Both slamming into switches and buttons.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OMITTED 314-316
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS
text: THE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900, EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK
text: 5000 MARK. Meltdown imminent...
text: He looks down the sub -- more water racing upward...
text: Back to the pile. Scans the scene, searching for an idea.
text: Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure. Thinks
text: fast. Grabs the hose, snaps it free...
speaker_heading: RENARD
text: is recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him. Raises it to
dialog: Bond...
speaker_heading: BOND'S POV
text: in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from
text: 5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us...
text: BOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air
text: blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past --
text: impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot.
text: Renard stares at Bond in horror. Bond calmly takes the flare
dialog: gun off him.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: She's waiting for you.
text: And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open
text: hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water.
text: Christmas looks down at the floating corpse.
text: Bond watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000.
text: The nuclear disaster looks like it's averted. But suddenly
text: water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's
dialog: shell; it's going to sink.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We're sinking.
text: But she won't come. As water courses over them:
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: Help me. We have to seal it.
text: She moves to the reactor, closing the cover. Bond uses his
text: strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place.
text: Bond climbs upwards, dragging Christmas with him.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We've got to get out.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: We can't.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR - CONTINUOUS
text: They clamber into the next chamber up...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS
text: The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down. Air is escaping
text: from the many seams that are creeping apart. We can hear the
text: metallic GROANS through the water.
scene_heading: INT. TORPEDO ROOM
text: Bond and Christmas crawl into TORPEDO CHAMBERS...
text: Bond reaches out, setting a timer to FIRE...
text: The clock ticks down...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are SHOT OUT
text: INTO THE WATER, streaking through, as behind them...
text: THE SUBMARINE EXPLODES in spectacular fashion.
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE, BOSPHORUS - DAY
text: Bond and Christmas reach the surface... Look around them.
text: No boats coming to the rescue. They wave to a tourist boat
dialog: passing.
text: The boat heads over to pick them up...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: OMIT 324
scene_heading: EST. SHOT - MI-6 - NIGHT
text: The damaged wing is being repaired.
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME
dialog: Tanner overseeing things, and then...
text: M walks in. Efficient and steely as ever. All eyes turn to
text: her. She looks at everyone...makes the briefest of nods.
dialog: That is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes.
dialog: She scans the machines:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Any word from him?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Still no contact yet.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - NIGHT
text: A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.
text: Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger.
text: FIREWORKS explode above. They clink glasses. He looks out at
dialog: the cityscape.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I love Christmas in Turkey.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: So isn't it time you unwrapped your
dialog: present?
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Tanner and Q look at a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE OF ISTANBUL.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That's strange.
text: The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a
text: side street. We can just make out Bond's ASTON MARTIN.
speaker_heading: TANNER
text: He must be nearby.
text: M comes over.
text: The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop.
text: The thermal image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Where?
dialog: Q
dialog: This picks up body heat. Humans should
dialog: be orange.
dialog: (searching)
dialog: There.
text: And he points to ONE orange figure lying on the rooftop.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (to Tanner)
dialog: I thought you said he was with Doctor
dialog: Jones?
text: They all look back to the image. The figure is turning RED,
text: almost glowing.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: It's getting redder.
text: Tanner, Q and M realize as one that this is an image of two
text: people, one atop the other. And getting hotter.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Bond.
text: Q switches the screen off, clears his throat.
dialog: Q
dialog: Could be a premature form of the
dialog: Millennium Bug.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: It's dark, we can't really see them.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: You know James... I think Christmas is
dialog: coming early this year.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
