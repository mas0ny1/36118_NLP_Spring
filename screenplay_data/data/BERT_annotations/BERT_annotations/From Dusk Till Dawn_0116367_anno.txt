scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

scene_heading: 345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER
text: A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
text: a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
text: in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
text: mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.
text: It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
dialog: off duty for the day.
text: The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth
scene_heading: INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY
text: A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
text: stool behind the counter.
text: A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.
text: A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
text: glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
text: bare feet. They look through magazines.
text: Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
text: GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the

dialog: seventeen.
text: MCGRAW enters the store.
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: Hot goddamn day!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
dialog: the air conditioner blastin' all day
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: Not even for lunch?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
dialog: outta the microwave.
text: McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
text: every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
text: joins Pete by the front counter.
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
dialog: will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
dialog: Those burritos are only fit for a
dialog: hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
dialog: bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Whatsamatter?
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
text: Every inch of it hot and miserable.
dialog: First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
dialog: got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
dialog: boy of hers was workin' the grill.
dialog: That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
dialog: from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
dialog: at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
text: blanket like a sick dog by ten
dialog: thirty.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Isn't there a law or something
dialog: against retards serving food to the
dialog: public?
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
dialog: be. Who knows what goes on inside
dialog: Mongoloid's mind?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You could sue the shit out of her, ya
dialog: know. That kid belongs under a circus
dialog: tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
dialog: own that fuckin' place.
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: What the hell would I do with that
dialog: grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
dialog: enough of a cross to bear just taking
dialog: care of that potato head. Then all
dialog: this Abilene shit happened. You
dialog: heard about that bank robbery in
dialog: Abilene, didn't ya?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's all that's been on the box
dialog: all day. They killed some people
dialog: didn't they?
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
text: Four Rangers, three cops, and two
dialog: civilians. And they took a lady bank
text: teller as a hostage.
text: Pete doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: They'll probably make a run for the
dialog: border, which would bring 'em this
dialog: way. And if we get our hands on
dialog: those shit asses, we're talking
dialog: payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
dialog: I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
dialog: commode.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Knock yourself out.
text: McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
text: exits in the bathroom.
text: The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
text: with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
text: We see that the girl is crying.
scene_heading: BLACK SUITED MAN #1
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
dialog: you, asshole?
dialog: (points to the tearful prep
dialog: school girl)
dialog: Do you want this little girl to die?
text: (pointing to the blonde with
dialog: the other guy)
dialog: Or that little girl? Or your
dialog: bosombuddy with the badge? Or
dialog: yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
dialog: I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
dialog: Wild Bunch if I even think you're
dialog: fuckin' with me.
text: The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
text: bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
text: And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
text: is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
dialog: the blonde.
text: Everybody speaks low and fast.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What do you want from me? I did what
dialog: you said.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Letting him use your toilet? No store
dialog: does that.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He comes in here every day and we
dialog: bullshit. He's used my toilet a
dialog: thousand times. If I told him no,
dialog: he'd know something was up.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
text: here, in his car, and down the road or
dialog: you can change the name of this
dialog: place to "Benny's World of Blood."
text: Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
text: leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
dialog: at Pete.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Were you giving that pig signals?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
dialog: anything!
text: Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: He says you were scratching.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I wasn't scratching!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You callin' him a liar?
text: Pete controls himself.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
dialog: simply saying that if I was
dialog: scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
dialog: not because I was signaling the cop,
dialog: it's because I'm fuckin' scared
dialog: shitless.
text: Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
dialog: Seth.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
dialog: I just go in there, blow his head off
dialog: and get outta here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
dialog: act natural, and I'm acting as natural
dialog: -- in fact, under the circumstances, I
dialog: think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
dialog: Award for how natural I'm acting. You
dialog: asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
dialog: my best.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, well, your best better get a
dialog: helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
dialog: gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
dialog: worse.
text: The toilet FLUSHES.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Everybody be cool.
text: Everybody goes back to what they were doing.
text: McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
dialog: of the situation.
speaker_heading: MCGRAW
dialog: Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
dialog: it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
text: in front of the box and just drink
dialog: booze. How much is the bottle?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Six-fifty.
text: Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
text: and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.
text: McGraw goes down screaming.
text: Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.
text: Seth charges forward.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: What the fuck was that about?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (in a low monotone)
dialog: He signaled the Ranger.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: I didn't.
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: You gotta believe me, I didn't.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: When they were talkin', he mouthed
dialog: the words "Help Us."
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!
text: Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.
text: Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you --
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
dialog: cooler with your back turned. I was by
text: the magazines, I could see his face.
dialog: And I saw him mouth:
text: Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."
text: While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
text: from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
text: out a gun from it.
text: Seth releases his brother.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Start the car.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You believe me don't cha?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Shut up and start the car.
text: Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...
text: ...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
dialog: the hand.
text: Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.
text: Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.
text: Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.
text: Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.
text: Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.
text: The two girls have run out screaming.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Richie? You okay?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
dialog: I told you that bastard said, "Help
dialog: us!"
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I never said help us!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Well that don't matter now, 'cause
dialog: you got about two fuckin' seconds
dialog: to live! Richie!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: When I count three, shoot out the
dialog: bottles behind him!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Gotcha!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: One... Two... Three.
text: The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.
text: They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.
text: Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
text: RAIN down on him.
text: Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.
text: Richard keeps FIRING.
text: Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
text: fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.
text: The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.
text: The fireball lands behind the counter.
text: The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
text: screams from behind the counter.
text: Seth smiles to himself and stands.
text: Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.
text: Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
text: still holding his weapon and FIRING.
text: Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.
text: Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
text: Pastry display.
text: Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.
scene_heading: EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY
text: They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
dialog: flames.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What did I tell you? What did I tell
dialog: you? Buy the road map and leave.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What am I supposed to do, Seth?
dialog: He recognized us.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: He didn't recognize shit.
text: Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
dialog: looked at us -- you especially --
dialog: I knew he knew.
text: They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
text: starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
text: hear Seth mumbling under the motor.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Low profile. Do you know what the
dialog: words "low profile" mean?
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.
text: The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
text: the street, and speeds off down the road.
text: We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
text: behind it, as the store burns out of control.
scene_heading: OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.
text: Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY
text: The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
text: OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
text: trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
text: prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
text: his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
text: slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.
text: Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
text: boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.
text: The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
text: and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
text: on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:
text: AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.
text: The rest of the titles play over black as the song
dialog: continues.

scene_heading: EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

dialog: 290.
text: SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':
speaker_heading: FORT STOCKTON
scene_heading: 238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER
scene_heading: INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY
text: Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
text: cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
text: the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.
text: It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
text: FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
dialog: category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
text: JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
text: and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
dialog: possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
text: sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
text: complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
text: Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
text: who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
text: garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
text: of them are wolfing down a late lunch.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We got about two more hours of day
dialog: light left. That'll get us into
text: El Paso, which is right next to the
dialog: border. We'll stop at a motel --
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Stop? We're not going to actually
dialog: stop at a motel, are we?
text: Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
dialog: that Jacob has said about three hundred times.
speaker_heading: SCOTT AND KATE
dialog: We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
dialog: those over priced roach havens. We're
dialog: self contained.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
dialog: overzealous, but give me a break, I
dialog: just bought it.
text: Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Why, just look at all this. You got
dialog: your kitchen --
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: -- you got your microwave --
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: -- you got your sink --
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: -- you got your shower --
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: -- see this, television!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
dialog: real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
dialog: introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
dialog: what say we drop this?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: The truth hurts.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Scott)
dialog: It's the bitterest of pills.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You two ought to start a stand-up
dialog: act, because you're just wasting your
dialog: humor on me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ain't it the truth.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Why do you want to stop?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm exhausted.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
dialog: into Mexico.
text: Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
dialog: new motor home."
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I just bet you would. Don't even thin
dialog: about it. Besides, I want to have one
dialog: night's sleep in an
text: honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
dialog: the home are okay, but they're not
text: like a real bed.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
dialog: swim.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
dialog: the bathroom.
text: Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
dialog: restroom.
text: Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
dialog: silence before...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dad, when I called the machine to
dialog: check our messages there was one from
dialog: Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
dialog: wouldn't permanently replace you until
dialog: we came back. He said when we come
dialog: home, if you still feel the same
dialog: way --
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
dialog: call him tomorrow and tell him not
dialog: to bother waiting.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I didn't want to talk about this in
text: front of Scott because he gets upset.
dialog: But you don't believe in God
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
dialog: know this is hard on you kids. After
dialog: Jenny's death, this is probably the
dialog: last thing you need. But I can't do
dialog: it any longer. My congregation needs
dialog: spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
dialog: get that from me anymore. My faith is
dialog: gone. To answer your question, yes,
dialog: I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
dialog: them? No. After Jenny died, I just
dialog: thought, what's the point?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (pushing him)
dialog: It's just, all our lives you've been
dialog: a pastor. For twenty years you've
dialog: preached trust in the lord. And then
dialog: one day you wake up and say fuck him?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
dialog: connected anymore.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That happens, you'll get it back.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Kate, give your old man a little
dialog: credit. Every person who chooses the
dialog: service of God as their life's work
dialog: has something in common. I don't care
dialog: if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
dialog: a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
dialog: many times during your life you'll
dialog: look at your reflection in the mirror
dialog: and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
dialog: all done it. I'm not going through a
dialog: lapse. What I've experienced is closer
dialog: to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
dialog: your faith. I've just decided not to
dialog: devote my life to God anymore.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do you think Mom would say?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY
text: Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A

speaker_heading: OLD-TIMER

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Do they have cable?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Do they have an X-rated channel?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Do they have a waterbed?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: They don't have anything except four
dialog: walls and a roof, and that's all we
dialog: need.
text: Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
text: trunk close to the door.
text: The two brothers get out of the car.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (tossing Richie the motel keys)
dialog: Open the door. We gotta do this fast.
text: Richie opens the door.
text: Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
text: empty.
text: CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.
text: TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.
text: SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
text: up in the trunk.
text: She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
text: scared and looks an absolute mess.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Don't say a word.
text: The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
text: the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
text: trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
text: see any, slams the door.
scene_heading: INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY
text: Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You. Plant yourself in that chair.
text: She sits down in the chair.
speaker_heading: HOSTAGE
dialog: What are you planning on doing with --
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: -- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
dialog: talk. You wanna get on my good side?
dialog: Just sit still and don't make a peep.
text: She shuts up.
text: Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
dialog: wound.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Let me help you.
text: He helps him get his jacket off.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How's it feel?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How ya think, it hurts like a
dialog: son-of-a-bitch.
text: Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
text: the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
dialog: against.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I got both rooms on either side of us,
dialog: so we don't gotta worry about
dialog: eavesdropping assholes. How's that
dialog: feel? You okay?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Feels good.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm gonna go get the money.
text: He heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY
text: Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY
text: Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
text: the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping

speaker_heading: SETH
text: It's about five o'clock.
dialog: (to hostage)
dialog: What time does it get dark around
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: HOSTAGE
dialog: About seven.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Good. I'm going towards the border to
dialog: check things out while it's still
dialog: daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
dialog: rendezvous.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
dialog: can arrange a better deal than thirty
dialog: percent.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's their standard deal, brother.
dialog: They ain't about to change it for us.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Did you even to try to negotiate?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: These guys ain't spic fire cracker
dialog: salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
dialog: know the meaning of the word "barter".
dialog: You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
dialog: them thirty percent of your loot. It's
dialog: scripture. So it is written, so shall
dialog: it be done. You want sanctuary, you
dialog: pay the price, and the price is thirty
dialog: percent.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: All I'm saying --
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: -- This conversation is over.
text: Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
text: hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Now, we need to have a talk. What's
dialog: your name?
speaker_heading: HOSTAGE
dialog: Gloria.
text: He shakes her hand.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my

dialog: Do you want to live through this?
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Good. Then let me explain the house

dialog: one: No noise, no question. You make a
dialog: noise...
text: (he holds up his .45)
dialog: ...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a

dialog: you absolutely, positively clear about
dialog: rule number one?
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Rule number two: You do what we say,
dialog: when we say it. If you don't, see rule
dialog: number one.
text: Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's

dialog: have all joined forces in forming a

speaker_heading: KELLY HOUGE
dialog: Agent Chase, does it appear that they
dialog: are heading for Mexico.
speaker_heading: STANLEY CHASE
dialog: Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
dialog: alerted the Mexican authorities. They
dialog: intend to cooperate every way possible
dialog: in bringing these fugitives to
dialog: justice.
speaker_heading: KELLY HOUGE
dialog: Are you optimistic about the safety of
dialog: the hostage they took in Abilene,
dialog: Gloria Hill?
speaker_heading: STANLEY CHASE
dialog: We've received no news one way or the
dialog: other. We can only hope for the best.
speaker_heading: KELLY HOUGE
dialog: What about the report from an
text: eyewitness at the liquor store who
dialog: said one of the brothers was shot?
speaker_heading: STANLEY CHASE
dialog: This can't be confirmed at this time,

dialog: have reason to believe it was the
dialog: youngest brother Richard, and he was
text: shot in the vicinity of his neck and
text: shoulders by the store's clerk.
speaker_heading: KELLY HOUGE
dialog: Is it safe to assume that because the

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Cops.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Didya look at the border?
text: Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers

dialog: the TV
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, I saw the border. Through
text: binoculars from on top of a high
dialog: building. That's about as close as I
dialog: risked getting. What's the TV say?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: They're going to apprehend us in
dialog: forty-eight hours.
text: Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I gotta figure a way to get across

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
text: in and wait for things to cool down.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
dialog: worse before it gets any fuckin'
dialog: better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
dialog: killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
dialog: ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
dialog: find us, and when they find us,
dialog: they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
dialog: very personal when ya kill their law
dialog: enforcement officers. The El Paso
dialog: police have already started a motel
dialog: and hotel search for us.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
dialog: our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos

text: Seth stops talking and looks around.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Where's the woman?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What?
text: Seth's out of his chair.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'

dialog: is she, Richard!?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: She's in the other room.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What the fuck is she doin' there?!
text: He goes to the door of the adjoining room.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Seth, before you open the door, let
dialog: me explain what happened.
text: Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
text: He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
text: Then he BURSTS open the door.
text: The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
text: obvious Richard raped her and killed her.
text: Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
text: room with the dead body.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?
text: Richard rises from the bed.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
dialog: just explain what happened.
text: Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.
text: Richard backs up.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
dialog: explanation. What's the matter with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (low and calm)
dialog: There's nothing wrong with me,
dialog: brother. That woman tried to escape
dialog: and I did what I had to do.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That woman wouldn't of said shit if
text: she had a mouthful.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
dialog: wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
dialog: became a whole different person.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (slowly approaching)
dialog: Is it me? Is it my fault?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's not your fault, it's her fault!
text: Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
text: holding tightly to his wrist.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Is this my fault? Do you think this
dialog: is what I am?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: This is not me! I am a professional
dialog: fucking thief. I steal money. You try
dialog: to stop me, god help you. But I don't
dialog: kill people I don't have to, and I
dialog: don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
dialog: how it's done. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Seth, if you were me --
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yes, Seth, I understand.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes, Seth, I understand.
text: Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (whispers in Richie's ear)
dialog: We get into Mexico, it's gonna be

scene_heading: INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I can't believe he's stopping here.
dialog: This place looks totally cruddy.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dad, why are we stopping here?
text: He opens the meter home door and climbs in.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: There's nothing wrong with this

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's a flop house.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's not a flop house. It's basic

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If it doesn't have a pool, we're

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
text: Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
dialog: thinking about how he's going to get over the border

text: Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both

scene_heading: THUD... THUD...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Owww, my head.

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Watch where you're going!
scene_heading: THROUGH WINDSHIELD

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What's this guy's problem?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have no idea.
text: Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
text: move. Not threatening, just looking at them.
speaker_heading: HONK!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Anytime, man.
text: The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
text: on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
text: side to let them pass.
dialog: Pass they do!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Creepy guy.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
dialog: just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
text: unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
text: border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
dialog: room #9.
scene_heading: INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
text: the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
text: beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
text: on the bed.
text: Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
text: electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.
text: KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
text: shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
text: POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
text: He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
text: oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What?
text: From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
dialog: disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.
text: Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
text: the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I hope none of this is disturbing you.
text: Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
text: he smiles.
text: Jacob opens the door and sees...
text: ... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
dialog: nicest guy in the entire world.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
dialog: Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
dialog: Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
dialog: lady friend need some ice and we don't
dialog: seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
dialog: possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
dialog: right back.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (still partially asleep)
dialog: Sure.
text: We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
text: ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
text: couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.
text: He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
text: closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is this?
text: Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: It's called a punch.
text: Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
text: and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sit down.
text: Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Good boy.
text: Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
text: his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Jacob)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jacob.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
text: down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
dialog: I'll shoot you in the face.
text: Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: Okay, move the Jap over there.
text: Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: Upsy daisy.
text: ...guiding him over to the bed by his father.
text: Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
text: to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to his hostages)
dialog: What's the story with you two? You a
dialog: couple of fags?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He's my son.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How does that happen? You don't look
dialog: Japanese.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's this about, money?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: It's about money, all right, but not
dialog: yours. You see, me and my brother here
dialog: are in a little hot water and we need
dialog: your assistance.
text: The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
text: Kate walks in.
text: The brothers spin their guns in her direction.
text: Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
text: and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
text: ready to spit.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Scott and Jacob)
dialog: Stop!
text: Jacob and Scott freeze.
text: Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
text: positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We're having a wet bikini contest,
dialog: and you just won.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: It's okay, honey. Everything's going
dialog: to be all right.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
dialog: do nothin' stupid.
text: (he turns to Jacob and Scott,
dialog: who are still standing)
dialog: You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
text: They slowly sit.
text: Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.
text: Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
dialog: for their own reasons.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Jacob)
dialog: Where are the keys to the motor home?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: On the dresser.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Richie, take the keys. Start that big

speaker_heading: SETH

text: Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (pointing at Kate)
dialog: You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
dialog: put on some clothes.
text: She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the

text: Seth GRABS her wrist.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You got three minutes. One second
dialog: longer, I shoot your father in the

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Do you believe me?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You damn well better. Go.

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Look, if you want the motor home, just
dialog: take it and get out.
text: Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
dialog: hostages.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
dialog: easy.

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not a chance.

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: JACOB

text: (he calms down and looks
dialog: at Scott)
dialog: Go sit over there.
text: Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,

text: conversational tone.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I ain't got time to fuck around with
dialog: you, so I'll make this simple. Take
dialog: your kids and get in the car, or I'll
dialog: execute all three of you right now.
text: (he cocks the gun and puts

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
dialog: ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
dialog: course it is.
dialog: (motioning behind him)
dialog: What are their names?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Scott and Kate.
text: Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
dialog: Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...
text: Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: My wife.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Where is the little lady?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: In heaven.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: She's dead?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes, she is.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How'd she die?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Auto wreck.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Come on, gimme some more details.
dialog: How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
dialog: kill her?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
dialog: on the car weren't great. She had to
text: stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
dialog: she crashed, she died.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Died instantly?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Not quite. She was trapped in the
dialog: wreck for about six hours before she
dialog: passed on.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
dialog: it in and break it off, don't they?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes, they do.
text: Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
dialog: license.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Is this real?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I've seen one of these before. A
dialog: friend of mine had himself declared
dialog: a minister of his own religion. Away
dialog: to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
dialog: doing, or are you the real McCoy?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Real McCoy.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You're a preacher?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I was a minister.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Was? As in not anymore?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Why'd ya quit?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I think I've gotten about as up close
dialog: and personal with you as I'm gonna
dialog: get. Now if you need me like I think
dialog: you need me, you're not gonna kill me
dialog: 'cause I won't answer your stupid,
dialog: prying questions. So, with all due
dialog: respect, mind your own business.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
dialog: be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
dialog: friendly. But you're right, enough
dialog: with the getting to know you shit.
dialog: Now, there's two ways we can play this
dialog: hand. One way is me and you go round
dialog: an' round all fuckin' night. The other
dialog: way, is we reach some sort of an
dialog: understanding. Now, if we go down that
dialog: first path at the end of the day, I'll
dialog: win. But we go down the second, we'll
dialog: both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
dialog: ass about you or your fuckin' family.
dialog: Y'all can live forever or die this
dialog: second and I don't care which. The
dialog: only things I do care about are me
dialog: that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
dialog: our money. And right now I need to get
dialog: those three things into Mexico. Now,
dialog: stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
dialog: you don't give a shit about seeing me
dialog: and my brother receiving justice, or
dialog: the bank getting its money back. Right
dialog: now all you care about is the safety
dialog: of your daughter, your son and
dialog: possibly yourself. Am I correct?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I thought so. You help us get across
dialog: the border without incident, stay with
dialog: us the rest of the night without
dialog: trying anything funny, and in the
dialog: morning we'll let you and your family
dialog: go. That way everybody gets what they
dialog: want. You and your kids get out of
dialog: this alive and we get into Mexico.
dialog: Everybody's happy.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How do I know you'll keep your word?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
dialog: this shit.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You want me to sit here and be
dialog: passive. The only way being passive in
dialog: this situation makes sense is if I
dialog: believe you'll let us go. I'm not
dialog: there yet. You have to convince me
dialog: you're telling the truth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Look, dickhead, the only thing you
dialog: need to be convinced about is that
dialog: you're stuck in a situation with a
dialog: coupla real mean motor scooters. I
dialog: don't wanna hafta worry about you all
dialog: fuckin' night. And I don't think you
dialog: wanna be worrying about my brother's
dialog: intentions toward your daughter all
dialog: night. You notice the way he looked
dialog: at her, didn't ya?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Didn't like it, did ya?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, I didn't.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
dialog: I'm willing to make a deal. You
dialog: behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
dialog: try to escape. I'll keep my brother
dialog: off your daughter and let you all
text: loose in the morning.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You won't let him touch her?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I can handle Richie, don't worry.
text: The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
text: Seth sticks out his hand.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I give you my word.
text: Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
dialog: word.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (hand sticks out)
dialog: My words, my law. Better you not take
dialog: it, and that's just where we are,
dialog: then take it and not mean it.
text: Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
dialog: don't give a fuck how many guns you
dialog: have, nothing will stop me from
dialog: killing him.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
dialog: kill all of you.
dialog: (calling to the back)
dialog: Kate, honey!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You must have a bible in here, don't
dialog: cha?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, we got a bible.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Get it and bring it up here, will
dialog: ya, please?
text: Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
dialog: front.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
dialog: (to Jacob)
dialog: Put your hand on it.
dialog: Jacob does.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
dialog: try to escape and you'll get us across
dialog: the border.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I swear to God I won't try to escape
dialog: and I'll do my best to get you into
dialog: Mexico.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You best better get it done, Pops.
text: Seth places his hand on the Bible.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
dialog: morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
dialog: also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
dialog: I'll slit all your throats.

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't have the slightest idea.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, you just keep thinkin' of that

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
text: The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: If they get over the border, they're
dialog: gonna let us go.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Dad, I watch those reality shows.
dialog: They never let anybody go. Any cop
dialog: will tell you, in a situation like
dialog: this, you get a chance, you go for it.
dialog: This is our chance.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What about Kate?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: They're gonna kill her anyway. At
dialog: least now with all these cops we've
dialog: got a fighting chance.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Son, I have this situation under
dialog: control. I know exactly what I'm
dialog: doing. You're going to have to trust
dialog: me on this.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: If trusting you means trusting those

dialog: you don't tell the cops, I will.
text: Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him

speaker_heading: JACOB

speaker_heading: BORDER GUARD
dialog: How many with you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Just my son and I.
speaker_heading: BORDER GUARD
dialog: What is your purpose in Mexico?
speaker_heading: JACOB

text: BACK TO BATHROOM
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm curious. What was the nuttiest

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: This ain't the time.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, I know, was it possibly when your

text: we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BORDER GUARD

speaker_heading: SETH

text: farther and farther away. No cars following.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: We did it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We're in Mexico.
text: Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.
text: Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
dialog: along with Scott.
text: Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
dialog: the van.
text: Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
text: all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
text: turns to Kate.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (loud and happy)
dialog: Come here, Kate!
text: Kate, nervous, takes a step back.
text: He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
text: and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
text: dizzily onto the bed.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: You were magnificent! You told him to
dialog: shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
dialog: the shower, and I'm thinking to
dialog: myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
dialog: I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
dialog: do -- he shuts the fucking door!
text: Kate kind of half smiles.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd

speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
dialog: Jacob, keep going on this road till
dialog: you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
dialog: When you get to Digayo, turn this big
dialog: bastard left, go on down for a few
dialog: miles, then you see a bar called "The
dialog: Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
dialog: can't miss it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Then?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
dialog: going.

dialog: where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
dialog: don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
dialog: with me" attitude going on. Now, if
dialog: everybody just keeps playin' it cool
dialog: -- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
dialog: -- everybody's gonna get what they
dialog: want. Comprende, amigos?
text: Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
dialog: I'm buyin'.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
text: Fuller family step out into the night.
text: They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
text: It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Shit, I been to bars make this place
dialog: look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
dialog: been to some fucked up places in my
dialog: time, but that place is fucked up.
text: Seth can't believe it.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (in a baby talk voice)
dialog: Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
dialog: baby too afraid to go into the big
dialog: scary bar?
text: The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
dialog: but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
dialog: personal.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's what you think?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's how you're lookin', Richie.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm lookin' scared?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's what you look like.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You know what you look like?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No, Richie, what do I look like?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're lookin' green.
dialog: That's not what Seth expected to hear.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Where are you right now?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm here with you.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, you're not. You're sippin'
dialog: margaritas in El Ray. But we're
dialog: not in El Ray. We're here --
text: getting ready to go in there.
dialog: You're so pleased with yourself
dialog: about getting into Mexico, you
dialog: think the job's down. It ain't.
dialog: Get back on the clock. That's a
dialog: fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
dialog: there for a coupla hours, in all
dialog: likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
dialog: So get your shit together, brother.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: My shit is together.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It don't look together.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
dialog: doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
dialog: just not used to seein' me happy,
dialog: 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
dialog: years since I been happy. But my shit
dialog: is forever together.
text: Richard believes Seth's response.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, just checkin'.
text: They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
text: the microphone.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (yelling into the microphone)
dialog: Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
dialog: Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
dialog: price, you get another piece of pussy,
dialog: of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
dialog: Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
dialog: If you can find cheaper pussy
dialog: anywhere, fuck it!
text: Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (in microphone, towards Kate)
dialog: What's this? A new flavor approaching.
dialog: Apple Pie Pussy.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Step aside, asshole.
text: Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Not so fast, Slick.
text: Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
text: the BONE SNAPS in two.
text: Chet lets out a SCREAM.
text: Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
dialog: NOSE.
text: Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.
text: Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
text: SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.
text: After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
text: to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.
dialog: Chet is OUT.
text: The whole altercation took two seconds.
text: Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Now, is my shit together, or is my
dialog: shit together?
text: Richard and Seth laugh with each other.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (slappin' Seth five)
dialog: Your shit is forever together!
text: They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
text: and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,
scene_heading: INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
dialog: If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
dialog: from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
dialog: ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
text: they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
text: and the beer at closing.
text: In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
text: while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
text: at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
text: BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
text: bikers and truckers.
text: One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
text: name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
text: the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
text: ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
dialog: crowd.
text: Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
dialog: here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
text: but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.
text: Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
text: They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
text: Seth is the first to say something.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Now this is my kinda place! I could
dialog: become a regular.
text: The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
text: as they approach.
dialog: Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
text: populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
text: look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
text: up to the bar.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Whiskey!
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: (in English)
dialog: You can't come in here.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What dya mean?
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: This is a private club. You're not
dialog: welcome.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
dialog: to drink here?
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: This bar is for bikers and truckers
dialog: only.
dialog: (points his finger to Seth)
dialog: You, get out!
text: Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places
text: HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.
speaker_heading: BIG EMILIO
dialog: (to Seth in Spanish)
dialog: Walk, Pendaho.
text: Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (low)
dialog: Take your hand off me.
speaker_heading: BIG EMILIO
dialog: (Spanish)
dialog: I'm going to count to three.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No, I'm going to count to three.
speaker_heading: BIG EMILIO
dialog: Uno...
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Two..
text: Jacob jumps in the middle.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Now wait a minute, there's no reason
dialog: to get ugly. There's just a
dialog: misunderstanding going on here. You
dialog: said this bar is for truckers and
dialog: bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.
text: Everybody looks at Jacob.
text: As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: If you look outside your door, parked
dialog: in your parking lot, you'll see a big
dialog: ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
dialog: In order to drive that legally, you
dialog: need a class two driver's license.
dialog: That is the same license that the
dialog: DMV requires truck drivers to carry
dialog: in order to drive a truck.
dialog: (he takes the license out
text: of his wallet and lays it
dialog: on the bar)
dialog: That is me, and this is my class two
dialog: license. This is a truck driver's bar,
dialog: I am a truck driver, and these are
dialog: my friends.
text: Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.
text: Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
text: everyone in the party and smiles.
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: (to Jacob)
dialog: Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
dialog: can I get you?
text: Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.
text: Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
text: smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
dialog: But instead he just says,
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
text: Coming right up.
text: Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
text: party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
text: buddy punch on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Good job, Pops.
text: Seth's still frying an egg on his head.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
dialog: number one problem with Mexico, it's
dialog: not service oriented. I was feelin'
dialog: so good, and those fuckin' spies
dialog: brought me down.
text: Richard puts his arm around Seth.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Fuck 'em, shake it off.
text: Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
text: at the guy, still pissed.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You serve food, Jose?
text: Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
text: but he just smiles and says,
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: Best in Mexico.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
text: table, send over a waitress to take
dialog: our order.
text: Seth walks away, and the group follows him.
text: We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
text: Charlie's head.
text: The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
text: walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
text: from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.
text: The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
text: wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.
text: Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Anytime you want a lap dance with that
dialog: broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.
text: He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
text: surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
text: words about the party in Spanish.
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: They're not the normal road trash we
dialog: normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
dialog: No one knows they're here.
text: The five of them find a table and sit down.
text: Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
text: bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Who else?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Pass.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (picking a fight)
dialog: Why not, against your religion?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (won't be baited)
dialog: No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Suit yourself, more for me.
dialog: (to Scott)
dialog: Scotty?
text: Scott shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: How 'bout you?
dialog: (pointing at Scott and Kate)
dialog: are safer in here with us than
text: wandering around a Mexican border town
dialog: all night long. Just don't do nothin'
dialog: stupid and we'll all get along fine.
dialog: (to Scott)
dialog: Scotty, you sure you don't want a
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Okay, I'll have one.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No you won't.
text: Seth pours Scott a shot.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
dialog: don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
dialog: up, boy.
text: Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
text: on-drinker's tremor.
text: Seth turns to Kate.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
dialog: round two?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay.
text: Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
text: knocks it back.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
dialog: just created a monster.
text: Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why are you so agitated?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm still stewing about that ape
dialog: laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
dialog: bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He backed down.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: He's smilin' at us. But behind his
dialog: smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
text: I hear that loud and clear.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (picking up the whiskey bottle)
dialog: I'm gonna just sit here and drain
dialog: this bottle. And when I've drunk the
dialog: last drop, if I still feel then, the
dialog: way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
text: bottle and break it over his melon
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Before we stepped in here, you told
dialog: all of us to be cool. That means you,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (tossing it off)
dialog: I never said do what I do, I said do
dialog: what I say.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Are you so much a fucking loser, you
dialog: can't tell when you've won?
text: Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
dialog: believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
text: down his drinking glass.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What did you call me?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
dialog: asked a question. Would you like me to
dialog: ask it again? Very well. Are you such
dialog: a loser you can't tell when you've
dialog: won?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The entire state of Texas, along with
dialog: the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
dialog: find you? No. They couldn't. They had
text: every entrance to the border covered.
dialog: There's no way you could get across.
dialog: Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
dialog: Seth, enjoy it.
text: Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
dialog: me. I insist.
text: Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
text: in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: To your family.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: To yours.
text: They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Now, is your shit together?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Forever together.
text: Seth turns to Scott.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
dialog: it that's yours.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah, it's mine.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
text: songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
text: around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
text: song. Everybody applauds.
text: Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
text: that he uses to announce dancers.
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: (announcer voice in Spanish)
dialog: And now for your viewing pleasure. The
dialog: Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
text: of Evil. The most sinister woman to
text: dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
dialog: dogs, get on your knees, bow your
text: heads and worship at the feet of
scene_heading: SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!
text: The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
text: notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.
text: The crowd hushes up.
text: And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.
dialog: This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
dialog: Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
text: the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.
text: She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
dialog: stage, but like she owned the world.
dialog: And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
dialog: world is proud to be her possession.
text: All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
text: Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
text: Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
text: accompanies from the table with the guitar.
text: When the music builds to its explosive section.
text: Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
dialog: room.
text: She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
text: the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
text: looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
text: and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.
text: As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
text: from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.
text: Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.
text: Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
text: She STANDS OVER him.
text: While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
text: bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.
text: She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
text: toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.
speaker_heading: SANTANICO
dialog: (to Richard in Spanish)
dialog: Drink up.
text: Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
text: CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
dialog: surveys.
text: Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.
text: Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
text: this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.
text: Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
text: the beat with his guitar.
text: Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
text: over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
dialog: Seth and company did to Chet.
text: Richard continues to suck her toes.
text: The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
text: mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
text: down at the seated Richard.
text: She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
text: mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
dialog: OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
text: from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
text: applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
text: and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
text: none louder than Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
dialog: I call a fuckin' show!
text: One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
text: which she puts on.
text: Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (snapping his fingers)
dialog: Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
dialog: your new friend to join us?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (looking up at Santanico)
dialog: Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
dialog: join us?
speaker_heading: SANTANICO
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: Muy bien, gracias.
text: Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Richie, you lucky bastard!
dialog: (to Santanico)
dialog: Now, little lady, you could of just as
dialog: easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
dialog: You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
dialog: arithmetic.
text: The table laughs.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
text: Riding Hood is walking through the
text: forest and she comes across Little Bo
dialog: Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
dialog: "Little Red Riding Hood, are you
dialog: crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
dialog: is walking these woods and if he finds
dialog: you he's gonna pull down your dress
dialog: and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
text: Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
text: and taps a .357 Magnum she has
text: holstered on her thigh and says: "No
dialog: he won't."
text: As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
text: Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh, shit.
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: Seth --
text: Seth waves him away.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: Not now. So finally she comes across
dialog: the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
text: Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
dialog: Riding Hood, you know better than to
dialog: be walking around these woods alone.
dialog: You know I'm just gonna have to pull
dialog: down your dress and squeeze your
dialog: titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
text: whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
text: it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
dialog: says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
dialog: me, just like the story says."
text: Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
text: Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
dialog: anything --
text: The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.
speaker_heading: RAZOR CHARLIE
dialog: (to Chet in Spanish)
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (pointing at Seth)
dialog: This piece of shit broke my finger
dialog: and my nose...
dialog: (pointing at Richard)
dialog: then this fag kicked me in the ribs
dialog: while I was down.
dialog: That's all Big Emilio has to hear.
speaker_heading: BIG EMILIO
dialog: (to The Gecko Brothers)
dialog: Up!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Fuck off, ape man!
text: Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
text: the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
text: his wounded shoulder.
text: Santanico steps back from the table.
text: Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
text: Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
text: Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
text: and SLASHES Seth across the face.
text: Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
text: his laid open cheek.
text: Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
text: brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.
text: Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
text: before he hits the floor.
text: Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
text: out of gunfire.
text: The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
dialog: they were doing.
text: The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
dialog: dancing.
text: Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
dialog: something.
text: Her NOSTRILS FLARE.
text: Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
text: and puts it to his face.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Scarred for life, that's how I am!
text: Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You thought it was pretty funny,
dialog: didn't you?
text: Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
text: left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
dialog: the crowd.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
dialog: as dead as these fucks!
text: SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.
text: SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.
text: The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
text: waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.
text: SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
text: to the floor, splattering.
text: WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
text: her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
dialog: could easily be read as intense sexual desire.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR
text: Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
dialog: transformation.
text: Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
text: of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
text: her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Richie, look out!
text: Before Richie can turn around.
text: SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
text: SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.
text: Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.
text: Seth turns to his brother's cry.
text: He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
text: a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
text: deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
text: about, trying to knock her off.
dialog: Richard screams to Seth:
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!
text: Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
dialog: can't get a clear shot.
text: Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.
text: Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
text: rides him down to the floor.
text: Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
text: vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.
text: Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
text: half way before he stops, saying:
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (with his dying breath)
dialog: Fucking Bitch!
text: He tumbles over, a corpse.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Richie.
text: Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
text: Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
dialog: their faces.
text: The patrons scream.
text: A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
text: with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
dialog: and yells:
speaker_heading: WHORE
dialog: Dinner is served!
text: The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
text: the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
text: and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
text: turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
speaker_heading: VAMPIRES.
text: The vamps attack.
text: What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
text: sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
dialog: necks.
text: Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
text: Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
text: The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
text: monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
dialog: anything.
text: Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
text: They hide and watch.
text: Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
text: too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
text: motionless, watching what he can't believe.
text: Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
text: eyes POP OPEN.
text: She RISES in her snake/dance way.
text: Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.
speaker_heading: SANTANICO
dialog: Let's see if you taste as good as your
dialog: brother.
text: She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
text: CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
text: hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.
text: Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
text: JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
text: FLOOR and INTO the WALL.
text: A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
text: side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
text: pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.
text: Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
text: switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
dialog: bar to the other.
text: The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
text: goes head to head with a stripper.
text: The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
text: close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
dialog: vamp bitch blow for blow.
text: Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
text: and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
text: on the wooden leg.
text: FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
text: appears, straight razor in hand.
text: Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
text: Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
text: cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
text: UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
text: Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
text: the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.
text: Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
text: vampire's death scream.
text: Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
text: tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
text: chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
text: the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
text: placed on his chest.
speaker_heading: SANTANICO
dialog: I'm not gonna drain you completely.
dialog: You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
dialog: my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
dialog: eat bugs because I order it. Because
dialog: I don't think you're worthy of human
dialog: blood, you'll feed on the blood of
dialog: stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
dialog: And at my command, you'll lick the dog
dialog: shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
dialog: be my dog, your new name will be
dialog: "Spot". Welcome to slavery.
text: SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
dialog: end over end.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP SANTANICO
text: looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
text: the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.
text: We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.
text: Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
text: momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.
text: Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.
text: Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
text: the liquor-soaked robe ignite.
text: Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.
text: Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.
speaker_heading: BIG EMILIO
dialog: Noooooo!
text: He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.
text: Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
text: see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
dialog: Jacob.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: We may be in trouble.
text: Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
text: walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
text: vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
text: out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
text: him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
text: aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.
text: Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
dialog: Seth and Jacob.
text: Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
text: weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.
text: Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
text: wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
text: look like a huge walking shark.
text: Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, you, monkey man!
text: Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Anything you gotta say to them, say
dialog: to me first.
text: Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
text: effortlessly knocks them away.
text: They both hit the ground.
text: Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
dialog: ahead."
text: Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
dialog: locomotive.
text: Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
text: huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
text: Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
text: buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
dialog: who HITS the floor.
text: Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
text: BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
text: vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
text: savage beating.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: That's enough.
text: Jacob and Seth stop.
text: Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
text: end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
text: big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
text: dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
dialog: vamp.
text: Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
text: breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
text: around his mouth.
text: Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
text: over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
text: protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
text: trouble. Chet dives at Kate.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: You know what everybody says about me?
dialog: I suck!
text: Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
text: her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
text: his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
text: off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
text: his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
text: up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.
speaker_heading: GULP.
text: Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
text: moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
text: mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
text: jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
text: He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
dialog: all the while.
text: Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
dialog: their faces.
text: Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
text: of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.
speaker_heading: CHET
scene_heading: I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!
text: Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
dialog: pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...
text: He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
text: vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
text: staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.
text: By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
text: vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
text: customers have been butchered or drained.
text: All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
text: and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
text: kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
text: are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
dialog: wooden stakes.
text: The four human men group together. The four female vampires
text: charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
text: Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
text: slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
text: staked bodies hit the floor.
text: Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
dialog: side.
text: They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
text: taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Ain't they supposed to burn up or
dialog: something?
text: At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
text: everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
text: the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
text: light, which lasts only a split second.
text: It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
text: that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
dialog: once lay.
text: They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
text: for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
text: useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.
text: Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
text: to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.
text: He takes his dead hand.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
dialog: You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
dialog: find peace there. I love you little
dialog: brother, I'll miss ya bad.
text: Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
text: POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
dialog: love you, too.
text: Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
text: down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
text: He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
text: to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
text: bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
text: from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
text: surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
text: head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
text: wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
text: where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
text: wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
text: whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Touch my brother with that stake,
dialog: biker, and vampires won't need to
dialog: suck your blood, they'll be able to
text: lick it up off the floor.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: He ain't your brother no more.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's a matter of opinion, and I
dialog: don't give a fuck about your's.
text: Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!
text: Seth aims his gun at the group.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Shut up!
text: Richard's giggling.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah, shut up.
text: Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
text: out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: Hold him down.
text: The smile evaporates from Richard's face.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Richie, here's the peace in death I
dialog: could never give you in life.
text: Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
text: his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
text: heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
text: body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
text: Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
text: He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
text: of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
dialog: world's my oyster, except for the
dialog: fact that I just rammed a wooden
dialog: stake in my brother's heart because
dialog: he turned into a vampire, even
dialog: though I don't believe in vampires.
dialog: Aside from that unfortunate business,
dialog: everything's hunky-dory.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm really sorry.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
dialog: a chance you'd feed us to them!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Then why didn't I?
text: Jacob walks over to Seth.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I saved your life. I didn't have to,
dialog: but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
dialog: brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
dialog: sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
dialog: gonna get out of this we need each
dialog: other. And we need you sober and
dialog: thinking, not drunk and...
text: As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
text: grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
dialog: identify it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: At first I just thought it was birds.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
text: No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
text: Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
dialog: gnaw.
text: Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: It's bats.
scene_heading: EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
text: The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
text: hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
text: Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
text: along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
dialog: scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
text: do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
text: claws poke their way through.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Give me a hand!
text: Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
text: the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
text: items to help secure and barricade the door.
text: As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
text: the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
text: open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
text: activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
text: friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
text: putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
text: POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
text: room in her direction.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Watch out, girly!
text: The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
text: scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
text: she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
text: others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
text: Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
text: As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
text: of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
text: vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
text: and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
text: SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
text: the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
text: vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
text: of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
text: heart. He dies and bursts into flames.
text: At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
text: position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
text: ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: (mumbling to himself)
dialog: Goddamn fuckin' vampires.
text: The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
text: Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
text: feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
text: flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
text: SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
text: a loop.
text: As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
text: on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
text: stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
text: by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
text: lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
text: raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
text: vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
text: which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Fire!
text: Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: (to Sex Machine)
dialog: We'll put this out. You stake the rest
dialog: of these fuckers.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Way ahead of ya.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: What's your name, girly?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Kate, what's yours?
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
dialog: Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
dialog: fuckers.
text: Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
text: work STAKING the dead bodies.
text: Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
text: whatever else is at hand.
text: A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
text: over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
text: in front of the window.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: We got a problem!
text: Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
text: direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
text: a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
text: SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
text: body through the newly formed hole.
text: Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
text: point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.
text: The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
text: his head back through the hole.
text: Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
dialog: when...
speaker_heading: WHAM !
text: The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
text: cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
text: LANDING HARD on his back.
text: Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
text: of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
text: RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
text: bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
text: its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
text: inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Get this bastard off of me!
text: Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
text: GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.
text: Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
text: preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
text: dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
text: body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
text: squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
text: down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
text: Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
text: his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
dialog: get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.
text: Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
text: front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
dialog: while, then...
text: BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
text: fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
text: against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
text: bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
text: cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
text: heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
text: FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.
text: Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
text: window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
dialog: the bat-thing.
text: Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
text: exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
text: to try and claw their way in.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Is everybody okay?
text: Everyone mutters "yeah."
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay, does anybody here know what's
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
dialog: a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
dialog: trying to get inside and suck our
dialog: fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
dialog: simple. And I don't wanna hear any
dialog: bullshit about "I don't believe in
dialog: vampires" because I don't fuckin'
dialog: believe in vampires either. But I do
dialog: believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
dialog: and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
dialog: vampires! Now, does everybody agree
dialog: we're dealin' with vampires.
dialog: Everybody agrees.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You too, preacher?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm like you. I don't believe in
dialog: vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Good for you. Now, since we all
dialog: believe we're dealing with vampires,
dialog: what do we know about vampires?
dialog: Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
dialog: cross?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: In the Winnebago.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: In other words, no.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What are you talking about? We got
dialog: crosses all over the place. All you
dialog: gotta do is put two sticks together
dialog: and you got a cross.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: He's right. Peter Cushing does that
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I don't know about that. In order for
dialog: it to have any power, I think it's
dialog: gotta be an official crucifix.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's an official cross? Some piece
dialog: of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
dialog: official? If a cross works against
dialog: vampires, it's not the cross itself,
dialog: it's what the cross represents. The
dialog: cross is a symbol of holiness.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
text: covered, moving right along, what
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: FROST
text: Wooden stakes in the heart been
dialog: workin' pretty good so far.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
dialog: forget, does silver do anything to a
dialog: vampire?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: That's werewolves.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: I know silver bullets are werewolves.
dialog: But I'm pretty sure silver has some
dialog: sort of effect on vampires.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Does anybody have any silver?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Then who cares?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: When's sunrise?
text: Jacob looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: About two hours from now.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So all we have to do is get by for a
dialog: few more hours and then we can walk
text: right out the front door.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
dialog: barricades, that door, those plastered
dialog: windows and these walls will last two
dialog: more hours with those bat fucks
dialog: fuckin' with 'em.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Has anybody here read a real book
dialog: about vampires, or are we just
dialog: remembering what a movie said? I mean
dialog: a real book.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: You mean like a Time-Life book?
text: Everybody laughs.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: (in a cowboy voice)
dialog: John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
text: shot a man for snorin'.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
dialog: what do we know about these vampires?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Aside from they're thirsty.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Well, one thing, they might got super
dialog: human strength, but you can hurt 'em.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
dialog: Santanico didn't kill her, but it
dialog: didn't feel too good either.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: Another thing, you try and ram a
dialog: broken chair leg in a human, you
dialog: better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
text: The human body is one rough-tough
dialog: machine. But these vamps got soft
text: bodies. The texture of their skin is
dialog: softer, mushier. You can push shit
dialog: right through 'em. Conceivably, if
dialog: you hit one hard enough, you could
dialog: take their fuckin' head off.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You could take their head off.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Actually, our best weapon against
dialog: these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
dialog: (he points at Jacob)
dialog: He's a preacher.
text: Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: As far as God's concerned, we might
dialog: just as well be a piece of fuckin'
dialog: shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
dialog: one problem, his faith ain't what it
dialog: used to be.
text: Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
text: Jacob stands over him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I've had enough of your taunts.
text: Seth looks up from the floor.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
dialog: faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
dialog: to us. But a man who's a servant of
dialog: God can grab a cross, shove it in
dialog: these monsters' asses. A servant of
dialog: God can bless the tap water and turn
text: it into a weapon.
text: Seth rises.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I know why you lost your faith. How
dialog: could true holiness exist if your wife
dialog: can be taken away from you and your
dialog: children? Now, I always said God can
dialog: kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
dialog: my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
dialog: ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
dialog: what's out there trying to get in
dialog: here is pure evil straight from hell.
dialog: And if there is a hell, and those
dialog: monsters are from it, there's got to
dialog: be a heaven. Now which are you, a
dialog: faithless preacher or a mean,
dialog: mother fuckin' servant of God?
text: Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
text: sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
dialog: God.
text: The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
text: sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
text: It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
dialog: they're in.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know if I can take two hours
dialog: of that noise.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
dialog: no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
text: hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
dialog: with only the rotting corpses of your
dialog: friends to keep you company?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
text: behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
dialog: with my entire squad dead. They
dialog: thought they killed everybody, and
dialog: except for me, they were right. But it
dialog: wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
dialog: blew up right next to me, that's why
dialog: I'm so pretty.
dialog: They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
text: the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
text: possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
text: listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
dialog: hour...
text: As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
text: the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
text: can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
text: doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
dialog: say:
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Thirst.
text: "Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
text: around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
text: hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Thirst.
text: We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
dialog: Stop fucking saying that!
speaker_heading: TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: Thirst!
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
dialog: That bite weren't nothin'. It just
dialog: hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
text: all. It barely punched the skin.
text: Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
text: biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
text: all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
text: many voices, male, female, children saying:
speaker_heading: VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...
text: Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
text: in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
text: and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
text: actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
text: has turned into a vampire.
text: The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: ...and then when I came back to my
dialog: senses, I realized I had killed the
text: entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
dialog: My bayonet had blood and chunks of
text: yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
dialog: shish kabob. And to this day I don't
dialog: have the slightest idea how I --
text: Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
speaker_heading: THIRST!
text: Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
text: into his neck.
text: The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.
text: Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
dialog: pulling.
text: Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
text: SINKS them in Jacob's arm.
text: Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.
text: Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.
text: Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
text: bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.
text: Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
text: bleeding neck.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!
text: Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
dialog: sack of potatoes.
text: He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
dialog: table.
text: Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
text: leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: (to Sex Machine)
dialog: You're dead, mother fucker! You're
dialog: gonna bite me! You just turned me
dialog: into a vampire, asshole!
speaker_heading: SEX MACHINE
dialog: What are you gonna do about it?
text: Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
text: straight at Sex Machine.
text: Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
text: pulls it back, so he can really haul off.
text: Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
text: loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
text: floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
text: COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
text: hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
text: through the air.
text: Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Jacob sees.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Good lord!
text: Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
text: and CRASHES through it.
text: Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
text: bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
text: hand and runs for the backroom.
text: Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
dialog: ground.
text: Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
text: who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
text: back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
text: ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
text: door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
text: as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
text: howls and snaps in fury.
text: Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
text: .45 in its big mouth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You wanna suck something, suck on
dialog: this!
text: He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
dialog: the wall.
dialog: Kate yells:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We have to go back for Daddy!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Daddy's dead.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Noooo!
text: She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
text: and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
text: against the wall.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
dialog: too far away. If flinging that door
dialog: and filling this room with those
dialog: bat-things would save him, I'd fling
dialog: it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
text: into one of them.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: He needs our help!
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: He's beyond our help. You saw him get
dialog: bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
dialog: You can't help him. I've got no one
dialog: left to lose but you. I can't be alone
dialog: again. We're sticking together.
text: Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.
scene_heading: INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
text: appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
dialog: bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
text: restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
text: his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
text: the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.
text: The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
text: holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
text: whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
text: in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
text: god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
text: stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
text: in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
text: As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
text: lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
text: candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
text: repugnant sight trip him up.
text: Jacob has backed himself up by the door.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Open the door.
text: The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
dialog: shut.
text: Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
dialog: bloody arm.
text: When he releases them, they can't help but notice.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Did he...?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yep.
text: Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
text: over tables and cussing a blue streak.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
dialog: vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
dialog: Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!
text: Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
text: creatures on the other side.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
dialog: gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
dialog: you godless pieces of shit!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: You bet your sweet ass you are, and
dialog: I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
dialog: got much time.
text: Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
dialog: daddy?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
dialog: I'm already dead.
text: Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
text: dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
dialog: kids will never have the courage for what they must do.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (to his children)
dialog: Children, listen to me. I love you two
dialog: more than anybody. And I just want you
dialog: to know you've made me proud all your
dialog: lives. But never more so than tonight.
dialog: And I wish we could sit here and cry
dialog: till I pass on, but we can't. Because
dialog: I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
dialog: turn into a monster. And when I do,
dialog: I'm going to be dangerous. But before
dialog: that happens, just know I love you.
dialog: (to Seth and the kids)
dialog: Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
dialog: thirty minutes our friends outside
dialog: will bust in this door. And I'll
dialog: probably turn into a vampire within
dialog: the hour. Now, you have two choices.
dialog: You can wait for me to turn, then deal
dialog: with me, then wait for them to burst
dialog: inside here and the three of you will
dialog: deal with them. Or, we can kick open
dialog: that door and the four of us can hit
dialog: 'em with everything we have, and carve
dialog: a path right through 'em to front
dialog: entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
dialog: we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
dialog: them, I scared them, I took them off
dialog: guard. But they're going to get
dialog: unconfused, they're going to get
dialog: unscared, they're going to get
dialog: together and they're going to hit that
dialog: door like a ton of bricks. And when
dialog: that moment arrives, we gotta be
dialog: ready.
text: Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
text: with boxes and crates.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's this stuff?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: My guess is that this little dive's
text: been feeding on nomad road waifs like
text: bikers and truckers for a longtime.
dialog: This is probably some of the
text: shipments they stole off the trucks.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well, I say lets tear this place apart
dialog: for weapons. So when they burst
dialog: through that door, we'll make 'em wish
dialog: they never did.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I don't give a shit about living or
dialog: dying anymore. I just want to send as
dialog: many of these devils back to hell as
dialog: I can.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Amen.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
dialog: lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
dialog: teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
text: doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
text: a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
text: are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
text: balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
text: shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.
text: Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.
text: Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
text: backroom sink.
text: Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
text: in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.
text: Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
dialog: getting their courage back.
text: Kate makes water balloons.
text: Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
text: attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.
text: Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
dialog: turning it into holy water.
text: Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
text: The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
text: begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
text: The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
text: pounding, squeaking and screaming.
text: Finally they're ready.
text: Jacob turns to his kids.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Before we go any further, I need you
dialog: three to promise me something. I'll
dialog: fight with you to the bitter end,
dialog: but when I turn into one of them, I
dialog: won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
dialog: lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
dialog: promise you'll take me down, no
dialog: different from the rest.
text: The kids can't say the words.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Kate, Scott?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Scott?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah, I promise.
text: Jacob doesn't believe them.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why don't I believe you?
dialog: (he picks up the .45)
dialog: I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
dialog: want you to swear to God that you'll
dialog: kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
dialog: just kill myself right now. Now,
dialog: since you need me I think you better
dialog: swear. Kate, do you swear to God
dialog: that when I turn into one of the
dialog: undead, you'll kill me?
text: Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
dialog: temple.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
dialog: only gonna count to five. One...two...
dialog: three... four...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not good enough, swear to God.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I swear to God, our father, that when
dialog: you change into one of the undead, I
dialog: will kill you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
dialog: less time, so I'm only giving you the
dialog: count of three. One...
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You don't believe in suicide.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's not suicide if you're already
dialog: dead. Two...
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
dialog: I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Thank you, son.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
dialog: fuckin' vampires.
scene_heading: INT. BARROOM - NIGHT
dialog: The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
text: down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
dialog: the door.
text: Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
text: and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
text: grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
text: stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
text: the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
text: into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.
dialog: What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
text: Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
text: watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
text: like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
text: starting up the jackhammer.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Kill 'em all!
text: Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.
text: The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
dialog: flesh.
text: The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
dialog: forward.
text: They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
dialog: the door.
text: Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
text: in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
dialog: green vamp blood.
text: Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
text: and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
dialog: other.
text: Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.
text: Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
text: toss them into the crowd.
text: They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
dialog: in pain.
text: From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
text: HURLS toward the group.
text: Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.
text: The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.
text: Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
text: the hammer stake into vampire chests.
text: The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
dialog: junk.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Why did they block the door again?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: To keep the daylight out! This is
dialog: where they sleep! Get to the door!
text: Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
text: half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
text: above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
text: Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
text: off the ground.
text: Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
text: he CRASHES into a table.
text: The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
text: sticking out of his chest, dead.
text: Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
dialog: screams:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Seth!
text: Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
text: on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
dialog: and feel all right!
text: Kate clusters with her father and Scott.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I'm going for 'em!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Everybody goes home!
text: Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
text: one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
text: Seth's direction.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!
text: Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
text: burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
text: couple of water balloons and a stake.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: Watch my back!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Anytime.
text: Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
dialog: bar.
text: Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
dialog: fiery death.
text: Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.
text: As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
text: can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
text: to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
text: vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
text: happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
text: His eyes are yellow.
text: Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.
text: Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
text: sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
text: murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.
text: Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
text: SMASHES it against Jacob's head.
text: The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
text: of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.
text: Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
text: up to fire.
text: A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
dialog: with the boy he once called his son.
text: Scott's eyes turn to steel.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
dialog: name.
text: He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
text: creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
text: head bursts into flames, then explodes.
text: From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
text: cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fight now, cry later.
text: Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
text: with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.
text: A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
text: it bites into him. He drops the .45.
text: Kate sees Scott get bit.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
text: Scott screams.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You bastards!
text: She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.
text: Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
text: Scott is in agony.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Kill me, Kate!
text: Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
text: up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
dialog: times.
text: One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
text: all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.
text: The remaining vamps approach.
text: All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
dialog: balloon.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How many bullets left, kid?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not many.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, when you run out of weapons,
dialog: just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
dialog: sing for their supper.
text: The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
text: things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
text: throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
text: bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.
text: The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
text: them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
text: holding the .45, arm outstretched.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: Should I use the last bullets on us?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You use 'em on the first couple of
dialog: these parasites that try to bite you.
text: The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
text: on the face of an approaching vampire.
text: Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
text: vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.
text: Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
text: through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
text: vamps scream like they've never screamed before.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Shoot more holes!
text: Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
text: behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
text: Seth with a safe, lighted area.
text: The .45's empty.
text: The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
text: able to get at them.
text: The two survivors hold hands, when...
text: All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
text: from the outside.
text: The vamps look towards it in horror.
text: From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
dialog: Spanish accent.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Carlos!
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
dialog: in!
speaker_heading: CARLOS (O.S.)
dialog: (in Spanish)
text: Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
dialog: Hurry, hurry!
text: The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
text: around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
dialog: each other.
text: The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
text: the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
dialog: door.
text: The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.
text: The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
text: are instantly fried, bursting into flames.
text: The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
text: MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
dialog: in fright.
text: Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
text: hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
text: hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
text: Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
text: combust in fiery explosions.
text: The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.
text: Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
text: door into the parking lot.
scene_heading: EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
text: them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
text: Carlos's Mercedes.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: What the fuck was going on in there?
text: Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
text: breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
text: kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Why the fuck, outta all the god
dialog: forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
dialog: have us rendezvous at that place?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: I don't know, one place's as good as
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Have you ever been there before?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: No, but I passed by it a couple of
text: times. It's out in the middle of
text: nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
dialog: so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
text: And it's open from dusk till dawn.
dialog: You said meet you in the morning.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, because you picked that place
dialog: out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
dialog: And this girl's family's dead.
text: Carlos stands up again.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that. What were
dialog: they, psychos?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Did they look like psychos? They
dialog: were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
dialog: explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
dialog: don't care how crazy they are.
text: Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
dialog: themselves again.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You can't, but fifteen percent instead
dialog: of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
dialog: good start.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Twenty-eight.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
text: dead and he's not coming back, and
dialog: it's all your fault. Twenty.
text: They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.
speaker_heading: SETH AND CARLOS
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Twenty-five.
text: Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
text: to a red 1990 Porsche 911.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: You like the car?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I said new, this is an '90.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
