scene_heading: FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
text: It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the
text: people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the
text: policemen directing traffic.
scene_heading: PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS
text: waiting at street corner for light to change.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MAN
text: at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the
dialog: sky.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
text: as she follows his gaze upward.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE SKY
text: with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER
text: as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd
text: walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling
text: gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS
text: in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.
text: She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed,
text: exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick
text: sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride,
text: a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the
text: front door of a pet shop and enters.
scene_heading: INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT
text: Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back
text: toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.
text: MacGRUDER, comes toward her.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever
dialog: seen so many gulls?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: Hello, Miss Daniels.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What do you suppose it is?
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is
dialog: BARKING, o.s.
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: There must be a storm at sea. That
dialog: can drive them inland, you know.
text: They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird
text: department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor
text: of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie
text: and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end. There
text: is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls
text: are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so
text: that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained
text: birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic
text: birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages,
text: larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets
text: in the bigger cages. As they walk:
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: I was hoping you'd be a little late,
dialog: Miss Daniels.
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You said three o'clock.
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: I know. Oh, I know.
dialog: (she is more distressed
dialog: now)
dialog: I've been calling all morning. Oh,
dialog: you have no idea. Miss Daniels,
dialog: they're so difficult to get, really
dialog: they are. We get them from India,
dialog: you know, when they're just little
dialog: chicks, and then we have to...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well, this one won't be a chick,
dialog: will he?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly
dialog: not. This will be a full grown myna
text: bird. Full grown.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And he'll talk?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no.
dialog: You'll have to teach him to talk.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Oh my, I suppose I should call them
dialog: again. They said three o'clock.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.
dialog: Would you mind waiting?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (judiciously)
dialog: I think maybe you'd better deliver
dialog: him. Let me give you my address.
dialog: (she begins taking
dialog: off her gloves)
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: (producing pencil and
dialog: pad)
dialog: Oh. Oh, well, all right.
text: As Melanie starts writing:
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: I'm sure they're on the way, though.
dialog: Could I just call?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (with a resigned sigh)
dialog: Well, all right, but...
text: She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie
text: finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the
text: counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at
dialog: Davidson's.
dialog: (pause; accusingly)
dialog: It's past three, you know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, how long do you think...? All
dialog: right, would you check it please?
dialog: Yes, I'll wait.
text: Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter,
text: she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips
text: with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding
text: her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the
text: bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins
text: BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER
text: as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the
text: steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about
text: twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt
dialog: hat.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of
text: strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.
text: The birds are startled into scarlet flight.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little
text: nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes
text: her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and
text: then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of
text: the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I wonder if you could help me.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (deliberately, and
dialog: with a touch of
dialog: hauteur)
dialog: I said I wonder if you could help
dialog: me.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to
dialog: inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But
text: then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea
text: comes to her.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (solicitously)
dialog: Yes, what was it you were looking
dialog: for, sir?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Lovebirds.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Lovebirds, sir?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes. I understand there are different
dialog: varieties, it that true?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well... yes, sir, there are.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: These are for my sister... her
dialog: birthday you see. As she'll be eleven
dialog: and... well, frankly, I wouldn't
dialog: want a pair of birds that were too
dialog: demonstrative.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I understand completely, sir.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: As the same time, I wouldn't want
dialog: birds that were aloof, either.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (leading him around
dialog: shop)
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you have a pair that are just
dialog: friendly?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I think so, sir.
dialog: (she looks around)
dialog: Now then, let me see.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (at the finches)
dialog: Aren't these lovebirds?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, sir, those are... redbirds.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: The sign says strawberry finches.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (airily)
dialog: Yes, we call them that too.
dialog: (she moves away)
dialog: Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
dialog: (and stops before a
dialog: cage of canaries)
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Those are canaries, Miss.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Doesn't this make you feel awful?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (baffled)
dialog: Doesn't what make me...?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: All these innocent little creatures
dialog: caged up like this?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well, we can't just let them fly
dialog: around the shop, you know.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I suppose not. Is there an
dialog: ornithological reason for keeping
dialog: them in separate cages?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh, certainly. It's to protect the
dialog: species.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I imagine that's very important.
dialog: Especially during the moulting season.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, that's a particularly dangerous
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Are they moulting now?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Some of them are.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well... they get a sort of hangdog
dialog: expression.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.
text: The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes, I see.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: About those lovebirds, Miss...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Are you sure you wouldn't like to
dialog: see a canary instead? We have some
dialog: very nice canaries this week.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: All right.
dialog: (he smiles)
text: She smiles back.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (he waits)
dialog: All right, may I see one, please?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries
text: out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter
text: where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily,
text: and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary
text: cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (feebly)
dialog: Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.
text: One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and
text: into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh! Ohhhhh!
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
text: as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and
text: Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter,
text: finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the
dialog: birds is loose!
text: She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up
text: to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches
text: them suspiciously.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shhh! Shhhh!
text: He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers
text: the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: the canary in his hand.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: There we are!
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
text: as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (putting the canary
dialog: in)
dialog: Back into your gilded cage, Melanie
dialog: Daniels.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: startled.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What did you say?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (savoring this)
dialog: I was merely drawing a parallel,
dialog: Miss Daniels.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: But how... how do you know my name?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (secretly)
dialog: A little birdie told me.
dialog: (he smiles politely)
dialog: Good day, Miss Daniels.
dialog: (he bows to Mrs.
dialog: MacGruder)
dialog: Madam.
dialog: (he starts out)
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Hey, wait a minute!
text: She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her
text: bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't know you.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Ahhh, but I know you.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We met in court.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: We never met in court or anyplace
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw
dialog: you in court.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you remember one of your practical
dialog: jokes that resulted in the smashing
dialog: of a plate glass window?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I didn't break that window!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No, but your little prank did. The
dialog: judge should have put you behind
dialog: bars!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What are you? A policeman?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I simply believe in the law, Miss
dialog: Daniels, and I'm not too keen on
dialog: practical jokers.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What do you call your lovebird story
dialog: if not a practical...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Ahhh, but I really do want those
dialog: birds.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You knew I didn't work here. You
dialog: deliberately...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Right. I recognized you when I came
dialog: in. I thought you might like to know
dialog: what it felt like to be on the other
dialog: end of a gag. What do you think of
dialog: that, Miss Daniels?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I think you're a louse.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I am.
dialog: (he tips his hat)
dialog: Good day.
dialog: (to Mrs. MacGruder)
dialog: Madam.
dialog: (and he goes down the
dialog: steps)
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And I'm glad you didn't get your
dialog: lovebirds!
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: (breezily, as he goes
dialog: out)
dialog: I'll find something else.
dialog: (he gives a slight
dialog: bow)
dialog: See you in court some day.
text: The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: That... that... who was that?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: I have no idea.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She
text: looks through the glass.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
text: getting into his car at the curb.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: looking after the car at the curb.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She
text: begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.
text: as she comes up to the counter.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Have you got a pencil?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: What? Oh, yes, certainly.
text: As Melanie begins writing:
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: They said the myna bird would be
dialog: here later this afternoon. If you'd
dialog: care to come back...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, you'd better send him. May I use
dialog: your phone?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: (bewildered by
dialog: everything)
dialog: Yes, certainly.
text: (she puts phone on
dialog: counter)
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (as she dials)
dialog: Do you have any lovebirds?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: No, not in the shop. But I can order
dialog: them for you.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: How soon?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: Well... well, how soon would you
dialog: want them?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Immediately.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Is this the Daily News? Melanie
dialog: Daniels. Would you get me the city
dialog: desk, please?
speaker_heading: MRS. MACGRUDER
dialog: I might be able to have them by
dialog: tomorrow morning. Would that be all
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (with an edged anger)
dialog: That would be just fine.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I
dialog: want you to do a favor for me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, this is a small one.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling,
dialog: would I try to pressure you? Will
dialog: you call the Department of Motor
dialog: Vehicles for me and find out who
dialog: owns this license plate? DKQ dash
dialog: one seven six.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes, a California plate.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, I'll stop up there in a little
dialog: while. Is daddy in his office?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in
dialog: on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see
dialog: him later. Thank you, Charlie.
dialog: (she hangs up)
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Now. What time tomorrow morning?
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR
text: pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She
text: glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around
text: to the other side, and opens the door.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
text: in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses
text: in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND
text: running down the list of names slowly. It stops.
scene_heading: INSERT - THE CARD
text: her finger beside it.
speaker_heading: BRENNER, M. 3B
text: CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she
text: runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then
text: does the same for the next column.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby,
text: grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly
text: toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing,
text: waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with
text: answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the
text: elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The
text: elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows
text: her to enter first. She does so with a small nod. The
text: elevator doors close.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR
text: The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and
text: Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander
text: down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him. Self-
text: consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds.
text: The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The
text: doors begin to open.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is
text: right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The
text: man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in
text: front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn
text: the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment
text: just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key.
text: He looks at Melanie.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: smiling at him feebly.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
text: The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm
text: of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie
text: watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down
text: before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND
text: reaching into the purse for a white envelope.
scene_heading: INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE
text: written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly
text: goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
text: Miss...? She stops, distressed.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
text: the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other
text: end, near the elevator.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Is that for Mitch Brenner?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (curtly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: He's not home.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: That's all right.
text: She presses button for the elevator.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: He won't be back until Monday. I
dialog: mean, if those birds are for him....
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Monday?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes. I don't think you should leave
dialog: them in the hall, do you?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (trapped)
dialog: Well, I...
text: The elevator doors open.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well, where did he go?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Bodega Bay. He goes up there every
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Bodega Bay? Where's that?
speaker_heading: MAN
text: Up on the coast. About sixty miles
dialog: north of here.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Sixty...
dialog: (her face falls)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: About an hour and a half on the
dialog: freeway. Or two if you take the coast
dialog: highway.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm
dialog: going away myself. Someone's got to
dialog: feed them, I suppose.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (in utter despair now)
dialog: Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: I'm awfully sorry.
text: He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes
text: inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to
dialog: look at the birds.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
text: in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down
text: the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks
text: up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds
text: are COOING and CHIRPING madly.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh, shut up!
text: And she steps into the elevator.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)
text: on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day,
text: with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow
dialog: should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the
text: ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged
text: birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL
text: SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: She turns wheel forcefully.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
text: in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one
text: side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car
text: rounds the curve.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT - (MATTE)
text: Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - A CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS AT WATERFRONT
text: ahead, through the windshield as the car approaches.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: behind the wheel, leaning forward slightly for a look at the
dialog: town.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - DOCKS ON LEFT
text: through the windshield as Melanie slows her speed.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: behind wheel.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - STORES
text: on right of the road as Melanie enters the town. SLOW PAN
text: matching car's cruise past BAKERY, SHOE REPAIR, CLEANERS,
scene_heading: RADIO AND TELEVISION.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: behind wheel.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE TIDES
text: past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the
text: docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)
text: studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE TOWN
text: through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life
text: in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with
text: their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.
dialog: This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is --
text: is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's
scene_heading: P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO
text: BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR
text: pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the
text: door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling
text: suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks
text: quickly toward the front door.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: enters post office.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK
text: behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out
text: a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not
text: look up as she approaches.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: through the bars of the cage.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Good morning.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Morning.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I wonder if you could help me.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Try my best.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm looking for a man named Mitchell
dialog: Brenner.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yep.
text: He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Where does he live?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Right here. Bodega Bay.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, but where?
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Right across the bay there.

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: through the bars, exasperated.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE
text: as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's
text: vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the
text: Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches
text: him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if
text: he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock
text: still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then
text: that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither
text: speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at
text: her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends
text: his arm and points.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: See where I'm pointing?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: The two kids?
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I see. How do I get down there?
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Follow the road straight through

dialog: That'll take you right around the

speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: The front door.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Isn't there a back road I can take?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Nope. That's the road. Straight

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You see, I wanted to surprise them.
speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It's a surprise, you see.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Mmmmmm.
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: 'Course, you could get yourself a

dialog: there you could tie up at. If that's
dialog: what you wanted to do.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Where would I get a boat?
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Down at the dock by the Tides

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: CLERK

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

text: and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns
text: back toward the post office.
scene_heading: INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well, I ain't positive, if that's
dialog: what you mean.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I need her exact name, you see.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: That case, I tell you what you do.
dialog: You go straight through town 'til
dialog: you see a little hotel on your left
dialog: there. Not the motel, that's the
text: other end of town. This is the hotel.
dialog: Now you take a right turn there, you
dialog: got that?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Near the top of the hill, you'll see
text: the school and right behind it, the
dialog: church. You head for the school.
dialog: Now just past the school, you'll see
text: a little house with a red mail box.
dialog: That's where Annie Hayworth lives,
dialog: she's the school teacher. You ask
text: her about the little Brenner girl.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yep.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Could save yourself a lot of trouble.
dialog: Her name's Alice for sure.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Can I have the boat in about twenty

text: The Clerk nods.
speaker_heading: MELANIE

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.
text: The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the

text: advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE'S VOICE

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Me!
speaker_heading: ANNIE'S VOICE
dialog: Who's me?
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of
text: the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for
text: flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the
text: house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
text: two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face. Her
text: hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the
text: garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
text: stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling
text: of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Miss Hayworth?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to
dialog: bother you, but...
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
text: She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: The man at the post office sent me.
dialog: He said you'd know the name of the

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: The one who lives in the white house

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: They seemed sure it was either Alice
dialog: or Lois.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Which is why the mail in this town
dialog: never gets delivered to the right
dialog: place.
dialog: (She takes out package
dialog: of cigarettes, offers
dialog: one to Melanie)
dialog: Did you want to see Cathy about
dialog: something?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: taking cigarette, hesitating.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well... not exactly.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Are you a friend of Mitch's?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, not really.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
text: There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She
text: puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I've been wanting a cigarette for
dialog: the past twenty minutes, but I
dialog: couldn't convince myself to stop.
dialog: This 'tilling of the soil' can get a
dialog: little compulsive, you know.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It's a lovely garden.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thank you. It gives me something to
dialog: do with my spare time.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There's a lot of spare time in Bodega
dialog: Bay.
dialog: (another pause)
dialog: Did you plan on staying long?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No. Just a few hours.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You're leaving after you see Cathy?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well... something like that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so
dialog: mysterious.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Actually, it's none of my business.
text: There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it
dialog: is none of Annie's business.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (putting out cigarette)
dialog: I'd better get on my way. Thank you
dialog: very much.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Not at all.
text: They begin walking toward the car.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (still curious)
dialog: Did you drive up from San Francisco?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's a nice drive.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Is that where you met Mitch?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (hesitating, then)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I guess that's where everyone meets
dialog: him.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost

dialog: face.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss
dialog: Hayworth.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
text: as Annie leans over the seat.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do I?
text: (she shakes her head,
dialog: smiles wistfully)
dialog: No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Or maybe a closed one.
text: (she smiles again,
dialog: sees the lovebirds)
dialog: Pretty. What are they?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Lovebirds.
text: Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship
dialog: with Mitch:
speaker_heading: ANNIE

scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
text: There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a
text: little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and
text: a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the
text: engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the
text: truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch
text: Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this
text: distance -- and he comes over to the truck.
text: The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and
text: heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust

dialog: Just a few... just a day or two...
dialog: the weekend.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think we'll have to shave the hair.
dialog: Deke, have you got a razor?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: Oh, no you don't!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's still bleeding a little. Here,
dialog: let me put this on.
text: He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Bend your head down. This little
dialog: Band-Aid won't show.
text: He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a
text: mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at
text: it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So you came up to see Annie, huh?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't believe you.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I think you came up to see me.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Why would I want to see you, of all
dialog: people?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: I don't know. But it seems to me you
dialog: must have gone to a lot of trouble
dialog: to find out who I was, and where I
dialog: lived and...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It was no trouble at all. I simply
dialog: called my father's paper. Besides, I
dialog: was coming up here anyway, I already
dialog: told you...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: You like me, huh?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I loathe you. You have no manners.
dialog: And you're arrogant and conceited
dialog: and... I wrote you a letter about
dialog: it, in fact, but I tore it up.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What did it say?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: None of your business.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Am I still bleeding?
text: She lowers her head.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Can't see a thing.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I can't say I like your seagulls
dialog: much, either. I come all the way up
dialog: here to...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But you were coming up anyway,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I was! And all I get for my pains is
dialog: a... a... a hole in the head!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Right next to the one you already
dialog: had.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Look, Mr. Brenner...
speaker_heading: LYDIA (O.S.)
dialog: Mitch?
text: They turn toward the door.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER
text: closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a
text: woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse,
text: cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking
text: about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city
text: dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: I thought I saw your car. What are
dialog: you doing in town?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (rising to greet her)
dialog: I had to acknowledge a delivery.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Mother, I'd like you to meet...
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure,
text: but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the
dialog: introduction.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: How do you do, Miss Daniels?
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Acknowledge a what?
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels
dialog: brought some birds from San Francisco.
text: Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San
dialog: Francisco chippies.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Oh. I see.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: For Cathy. For her birthday. By the
dialog: way, where is she?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: Across at Brinkmeyer's.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Miss Daniels is staying for the
dialog: weekend. In fact, I've already invited
dialog: her to dinner tonight.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: After all, you did go to the trouble
dialog: of bringing up those birds.
speaker_heading: MELANIE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: You did say birds?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (understanding
dialog: completely now)
dialog: Lovebirds, I see.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: ...get away without thanking you in
dialog: some small way. After all, you haven't
dialog: even met Cathy and you are staying
dialog: for the weekend...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, but...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You are, aren't you?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Certainly, but...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Then it's settled. What time is
dialog: dinner, Mother?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: Seven o'clock, same as usual.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.
dialog: Where are you staying?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: With... with Annie, of course.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter
dialog: to seven, will that be all right?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Annie... Annie may have made other
dialog: plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I
dialog: can find my own way.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You're sure now? You won't hire a
dialog: boat or anything?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm sure.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: Seven o'clock then.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: grinning.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We'll be waiting. How's your head
dialog: now?
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE GROUP
text: Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (with an overwarm
dialog: smile)
dialog: It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull
dialog: hit me, that's all.
text: Lydia stares at her doubtfully.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT
text: Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her
text: hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still
text: in the window. The door suddenly opens.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Oh, hi!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you find her all right?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, I did.
text: There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at
text: Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I was wondering...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: That sign.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you think I could have the room
dialog: for a single night?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, I'd really hope to rent it
dialog: for...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I would appreciate it. I've tried
dialog: everywhere in town, and they're all
dialog: full.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Sure. You can have it.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Where's your bag? In the car?
text: Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's utilitarian, I'll say that for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I just picked up some things for the
dialog: night at the general store. You see,
dialog: I hadn't planned on spending much
dialog: time here.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes, I know. Did something unexpected
dialog: crop up?
text: There is a moment where both women look at each other...
text: When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she
text: is again telling Annie to mind her own business.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: May I use your phone? I'd like to
dialog: call home.
text: There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's
text: attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Why don't you come in then? I was
text: just about to mix a martini.
text: She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both
text: hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS
text: flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Don't they ever stop migrating?
text: But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously
text: serious expression.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
text: LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's
text: car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained
text: with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the
dialog: silence.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR
text: as it pulls into the Brenner yard.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine
text: her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.
text: She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.
text: She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no
text: answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In
text: the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from
text: behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Hi!
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA
text: in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Hi!
text: (she breaks into a
dialog: trot toward Melanie)
text: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
text: old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt
text: and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates
text: for just a moment.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Miss Daniels?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes?
text: And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking
text: her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: They're beautiful! They're just what
dialog: I wanted! Is there a man and a woman?
dialog: I can't tell which is which.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well, I suppose...
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (coming up)
dialog: Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm
dialog: glad you came. Are you hungry?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: Famished.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dinner's just about ready.
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: We were out back looking at the
text: chickens. Something seems to be wrong
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (going toward house)
dialog: There's nothing wrong with those
dialog: chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call
dialog: Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (as they follow into
dialog: house)
dialog: I don't know what good that'll do.
dialog: (aside to Melanie)
dialog: Chickens won't eat.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
text: as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining
text: room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer
dialog: beware.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Whose side are you on?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm simply quoting the law.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Never mind the law. Cathy, you can
text: start serving the soup.
text: She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone
speaker_heading: RINGS.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.
dialog: I didn't interrupt your dinner, did
dialog: I?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Fred, that feed you sold me is no
dialog: good.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The chicken feed. The three bags I
dialog: brought.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: holding the telephone.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Well, it's just no good. The chickens
dialog: won't eat it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They're always hungry, Fred. I opened
dialog: one of the sacks when I got home,
dialog: and I poured it out for them, and
dialog: they wouldn't touch it. Now you know
dialog: chickens as well as I do, and when
dialog: they won't eat, there's just something
dialog: wrong with what they're being fed,
dialog: that's all.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, they're not fussy chickens.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Who? What's he got to do with it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Fred, I don't care how much feed you
dialog: sold him. My chickens...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He did? Dan Fawcett?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: This afternoon?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, that only proves what I'm
dialog: saying. The feed you sold us is...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-
dialog: huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see
dialog: him. You don't think there's something
dialog: going around, do you?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, never.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, Fred, they don't seem sick at
dialog: all. They just won't eat.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get
dialog: over to Dan's farm. Maybe he'll...
dialog: mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred,
dialog: thanks.

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

text: the last bowl of soup.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (as she sits)
dialog: He got a call from Dan Fawcett a
dialog: little while ago. His chickens won't
dialog: eat, either.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It's what you said, Mom. Mr.
text: Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a
dialog: different brand.
dialog: (extremely worried)
dialog: You don't think they're getting sick,
dialog: do you, Mitch?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
text: The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have
text: been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are
text: carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.
text: Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is
text: playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from
text: the ashtray now and again to take a puff.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I still don't understand how you
dialog: knew I wanted lovebirds.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Your brother told me.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: (as she goes into
dialog: kitchen)
dialog: Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco,
dialog: is that right?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, not exactly.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Mitch knows lots of people in San
dialog: Francisco. Of course, they're mostly
text: hoods.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (from the kitchen)
dialog: Cathy!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well, Mom, he's the first to admit
dialog: it.
dialog: (to Melanie)
text: He spends half his day in the
dialog: detention cells at the Hall of
dialog: Justice.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (coming from kitchen)
dialog: In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is
dialog: entitled to a fair trial. Your
dialog: brother's practice...
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Mom, please, I know all the democracy
text: jazz. They're still hoods.
dialog: (to Melanie)
dialog: He's got a client now who shot his
dialog: wife in the head six times. Six times,
dialog: can you imagine it?
dialog: (she starts for living
dialog: room)
dialog: I mean, even twice would be overdoing
dialog: it, don't you think?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (to Mitch as he carries
dialog: load of dishes out)
dialog: Why did he shoot her?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: He was watching a ball game on
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: His wife changed the channel.
text: He GOES INTO kitchen.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY
text: Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Is smoking fun?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh, I suppose so.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Could I have a puff?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't think your mother would like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CATHY (O.S.)
dialog: Just a little one.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY
text: They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.
text: Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes
text: a small puff.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
dialog: (determined)
dialog: When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like
dialog: a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Are you coming to my party?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: (seeing the child's

dialog: I have to get back to San Francisco.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Don't you like us?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (touching her hair)
dialog: Darling, of course I do!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Don't you like Bodega Bay?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't know yet.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Mitch likes it very much. He comes
dialog: up every weekend, you know, even
text: though he has his own apartment in
dialog: the city. He says San Francisco is
text: just an ant hill at the foot of a
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I guess it does get a little hectic
dialog: at times.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: If you do decide to come, don't say
dialog: I told you about it. It's supposed
text: to be a surprise party.
text: Melanie laughs.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: You see, they've got this whole
dialog: complicated thing figured out where
dialog: I'm going over to Michele's for the
text: afternoon, and Michele's mother is
text: going to say she has a headache and
dialog: would I mind very much if she took
dialog: me home. Then, when we get back here,
dialog: all of the kids'll jump out!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Won't you come? Won't you please
dialog: come?

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes, very.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: And certainly pretty.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: How long have you known her?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I told you. We met yesterday.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: In a bird shop.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: She was selling birds.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No. I only led her into believing I
dialog: believed she was... Mother, it's
dialog: really very complicated.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: But she did buy the lovebirds and
dialog: then brought them all the way...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mother, where did you go to law
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Forgive me. I suppose I'm just
dialog: naturally curious about a girl like
dialog: that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: She's very rich, isn't she?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I suppose so. Her father owns a big
dialog: newspaper in San Francisco.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: You'd think he could manage to keep
dialog: her name out of print. She's always
dialog: mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know, Mother.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: She is the one who jumped into that
dialog: fountain in Rome last summer, isn't
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes, Mother.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I know it was supposed to be very
dialog: warm there, Mitch, but... well...
dialog: actually... well, the newspaper said
text: she was naked.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know, Mother.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: It's none of my business, of course,
dialog: but when you bring a girl like that
dialog: to...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mother?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think I can handle Melanie Daniels

speaker_heading: LYDIA

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh. That. Rome.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: In case you're interested, I was
text: pushed into that fountain.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Without any clothes on?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: With all my clothes on! The newspaper

dialog: they said...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You were just a poor, innocent victim
dialog: of circumstance, huh?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm neither poor nor innocent, but
dialog: the truth of that particular...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: The truth is you were running around
dialog: with a pretty wild crowd...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, but...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: ...who didn't much care for propriety
dialog: or convention or...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: ...the opinions of others, and you
dialog: went right along with them, isn't
dialog: that the truth?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, that's the truth. But I was

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You were lying.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, I was lying.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Did you really write a letter to me?
dialog: Or was that a lie, too?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I wrote the letter.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What did it say?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think

dialog: That's what it said.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But you tore it up.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I told you what happened in Rome!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you expect me to believe...?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't give a damn what you believe!

text: The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the
dialog: long line of telephone poles and wires and... something
text: strange on the wires.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT MITCH
text: His attention caught by the poles and wires.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE WIRES
text: Hundreds of birds sitting on them.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: standing and watching. A wind blows off the water. He shivers
text: suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house.

scene_heading: INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE
speaker_heading: HAYWORTH
text: In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking,
text: absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front
scene_heading: DOOR OPENING.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Miss Daniels? Is that you?
speaker_heading: MELANIE (O.S.)
dialog: Yes.
text: Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (seeing her face)
dialog: Is something wrong? Is that cut
dialog: beginning to bother you?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (touching her head)
dialog: No, it's not the cut that's bothering
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Would you like some brandy?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: If you have some, I'd...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.
dialog: Do you want a sweater or something?
dialog: A quilt?
text: As Annie gets the brandy:
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Won't you call me Melanie?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: All right.
dialog: (she smiles)
text: MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her.
text: She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact,
text: by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her
text: the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (sitting opposite her)
dialog: It gets a little chilly here at night
dialog: sometimes. Especially if you're over
text: near the bay.
text: Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well, how'd your evening go?
text: Melanie shrugs.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Did you meet Lydia?
text: Melanie nods.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Or would you rather I changed the
dialog: subject?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (with a tired smile)
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: How do you like our little hamlet?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I despise it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Well, I don't suppose it offers much
dialog: to the casual visitor. Unless you're
text: thrilled by a collection of shacks
text: on a hillside. It takes a while to
dialog: get used to.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Where are you from originally, Annie?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: San Francisco.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: How'd you happen to come here?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, someone invited me up for the
dialog: weekend a long time ago.
text: There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Look, I see no reason for being coy
dialog: about this. It was Mitch Brenner.
text: Melanie nods.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I guess you knew that, anyway.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I suspected as much.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You needn't worry. It's over and
dialog: done with. A long time ago.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Annie -- there's nothing between
dialog: Mitch and me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Isn't there?
dialog: (she shrugs)
dialog: Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's
dialog: never anything between Mitch and any
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I think I'll have some of that, too.
dialog: (she pours brandy,
dialog: drinks, sighs)
dialog: I was seeing quite a lot of him in
dialog: San Francisco, you know.
dialog: (she smiles weakly)
dialog: And then, one weekend, he asked me
dialog: up to meet Lydia.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Four years ago. Of course, that was
dialog: shortly after his father died. Things
dialog: may be different now.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Different?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: With Lydia.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did she seem a trifle distant?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (smiling)
text: A trifle.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Then maybe it isn't different at
dialog: all. You know, her attitude nearly
dialog: drove me crazy. I simply couldn't
dialog: understand it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: When I got back to San Francisco I
dialog: spent days trying to figure out just
dialog: what I'd done to displease her.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And what had you done?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Nothing! I simply existed. So what
dialog: was the answer? A jealous woman,
dialog: right? A clinging possessive mother.
dialog: (she shakes her head)
dialog: Wrong. With all due respect to
dialog: Oedipus, I don't think that was the
dialog: case at all.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Then what was it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Lydia liked me, you see. That was
dialog: the strange part of it. In fact, now
dialog: that I'm no longer a threat, we're
dialog: very good friends.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Then why did she object to you?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Because she was afraid.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Afraid you'd take Mitch?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Afraid I'd give Mitch.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch
dialog: the only thing Lydia can give him --
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: Annie, that adds up to a jealous,
dialog: possessive woman.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, I don't think so. She's not afraid
dialog: of losing her son, you see. She's
text: only afraid of being abandoned.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Someone ought to tell her she'd be
dialog: gaining a daughter.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: She already has a daughter.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What about Mitch? Didn't he have
dialog: anything to say about this?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: I can understand his position. He
dialog: went through a lot with Lydia after
dialog: his father died. He didn't want to
dialog: risk going through it all over again.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: So it ended. Not immediately, of
dialog: course. I went back to San Francisco,
dialog: and I still saw Mitch every now and
dialog: then... but we both knew it was
dialog: finished.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Then what are you doing here in Bodega
dialog: Bay?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You get straight to the point, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm sorry. Forgive me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, that's all right, I don't mind.
dialog: I came up here for two reasons. To
dialog: begin with, I was bored with my job
dialog: in San Francisco. I was teaching at
dialog: a private school there... well, you
dialog: know, you probably went to one
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Then you know. Little girls in brown
dialog: beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life.
dialog: I'll go into that classroom on Monday
dialog: morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
text: five upturned little faces, and each
dialog: of them will be saying, 'Yes, please
dialog: give me what you have.'
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And I'll give them what I have. I
dialog: haven't got very much, but I'll give
dialog: them every ounce of it. To me, that's
dialog: very important. It makes me want to
dialog: stay alive for a long long time.
dialog: (she sighs)
dialog: That's the first reason.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And the second?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (simply)
dialog: I wanted to be near Mitch.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It was over, and I knew it, but I
dialog: wanted to be near him, anyway.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: You see, I still like him a hell of
dialog: a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't
dialog: want to lose his friendship... ever.
text: There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE
text: shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer
dialog: it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
text: at the phone.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't
dialog: asleep. What is it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes, just a little while ago. Sure,
dialog: hold on.
dialog: (she turns to Melanie)
dialog: It's Mitch. For you.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
text: as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie
text: hesitating.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: He's waiting.
text: Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie
text: to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her
text: throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie
text: talks to Mitch in the background.
text: Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a
text: wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally
text: and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (at phone; coolly)
dialog: Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine,
dialog: thank you. No, no trouble at all. I
dialog: simply followed the road. It's a
text: very bright night.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What? Oh. Well, there's no need to
dialog: apologize. I can understand...
dialog: (pause; she listens)
dialog: Well...
dialog: (she listens again)
dialog: That's very kind of you. No, I'm not
dialog: angry.
dialog: (she listens)
dialog: I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get
dialog: back to San Francisco.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, I wouldn't want to disappoint
dialog: Cathy, but...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I see.
dialog: (she is warming)
dialog: I see. Well, if you really...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All right. Yes, I'll be there.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Good night, Mitch.
text: She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: He wants me to go to Cathy's party
dialog: tomorrow afternoon.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I said I would.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'll be going, too, to help out. It
dialog: should be fun, Melanie.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It seems so pointless.
dialog: (she sighs)
dialog: I think I'll go to sleep. This has
dialog: been a busy day.
dialog: (picking up her paper
dialog: bag)
dialog: My luggage.
text: She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Pretty. Did you get that at
dialog: Brinkmeyer's?
text: Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent
text: for a moment, pensive. Then:
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Do you think I should go?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That's up to you.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Then go.
text: The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Thank you, Annie.
text: Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door,
text: startling them both.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Who can that be at this hour?
dialog: (she walks to door)
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Is someone there?
text: Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks
text: the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.
text: There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to the emptiness
dialog: outside)
dialog: Is anyone there?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (pointing to the ground)
dialog: Look.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (sympathetically)
dialog: Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably
text: lost his way in the dark.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.
dialog: And then, slowly:
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: But... it isn't dark, Annie. There's
text: a full moon.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
text: as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and
dialog: consternation:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with
text: balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn.
text: The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are
text: clustered around a long folding table upon which are
text: sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either
dialog: helping the children to more or telling them they are having
text: too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and
text: LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party,
text: are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and
text: away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin
text: bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the
text: entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background.
text: The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more,
text: the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the
text: CAMERA out to the left.
scene_heading: CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES
text: Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and
text: stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one
text: of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one
text: of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I really shouldn't have any more.
dialog: I'm a little tipsy already.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm trying to get you to stay for
dialog: dinner. We're going to have a lot of
text: roast left over.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I couldn't possibly. I have to get
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (with a shrug)
dialog: Cheers.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Cheers.
dialog: They drink.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Why do you have to rush off? What's
dialog: so important in San Francisco?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Well... I have to get to work tomorrow
dialog: morning, for one thing.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You have a job?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (sipping at the martini)
dialog: I have several jobs.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I do different things on different
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work
dialog: for the Travelers' Aid. At the
dialog: airport.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Helping travelers.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
text: She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really
dialog: considered before what she does with her time, and now that
text: she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and
dialog: unimportant.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And on Tuesdays, I take a course in
dialog: General Semantics at Berkeley. That's
dialog: not a job, of course. I just take it
dialog: because...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What about Thursdays and Fridays?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: On Thursdays I have my meeting and
dialog: lunch.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm chairman of a group that's sending
text: a little Korean boy through school.
dialog: We plan how to raise funds and...
dialog: things like that.
dialog: (she shrugs)
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: And Fridays? What do you do then?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: I go to bird shops on Fridays.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm glad you do.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Do you know what I was doing in that
dialog: shop?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa.
dialog: She's seventy years old, and veddy
text: prim and strait-laced.
dialog: (she does an imitation)
dialog: She's coming back from Europe at the
dialog: end of the month, and I'm going to
dialog: give her a myna bird that'll talk to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What'll it say?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (facetiously)
dialog: You'll think me very bold, sir.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No, tell me.
text: She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out
text: LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into
text: Melanie's face.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: serious, introspective.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: That's silly, isn't it? Teaching a
dialog: bird to shock my aunt. That's just
text: silly and childish.
dialog: (slight pause)
dialog: Maybe I ought to go join the other
dialog: children.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where
text: the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch
text: stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse
text: of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children
text: are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold
dialog: from Michele to Cathy.
scene_heading: CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We
text: see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by
text: way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they
text: reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of
text: the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS
text: OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the
text: children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from
text: Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back. During
text: this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes
text: of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is
text: watching Mitch and Melanie.
scene_heading: MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - ANNIE
text: CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this
text: moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday
text: cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also
text: catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat
text: as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple.
text: During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: All right then, here we go.
dialog: (she spins her)
dialog: Once!
dialog: (she spins her again)
dialog: Twice!
dialog: (she spins her again)
dialog: Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!
text: She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She
text: turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on
text: her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as
text: though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.
text: Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
dialog: Look! Look!
text: Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as
text: she looks up.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
text: A gull is swooping down.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
text: as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously
text: reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly
text: swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No touching allowed!
text: She almost falls.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE GULL
text: seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then
dialog: returns.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
text: reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - ANNIE
text: with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as
text: she ducks with two gulls swooping by.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round
text: to the front of it.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY
text: She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH

speaker_heading: TWO GULLS

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH

scene_heading: LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY

scene_heading: THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY

scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE GULLS
text: against the sky, flying away in formation.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no

dialog: Melanie.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Are you all right?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (coming over)
dialog: That's the darnest thing thing I've
dialog: ever seen in my life.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Are they gone?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They're gone, Mother.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE LAWN
text: as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the
text: cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck
text: very close by without having injured anyone. All that
text: adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Well... well, is everyone all right?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (with a small boy)
dialog: I think he got a little scratch,
dialog: Mother.
speaker_heading: GIRL #3
dialog: Did you see them? They were hawks!
speaker_heading: GIRL #4
dialog: They were bigger than hawks!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Children, they were only seagulls.
text: And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her,
text: and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
text: as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent
text: meaningful glance.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: They must have been after the food,
dialog: Mother.
text: They all turn toward the table.
text: CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE,
scene_heading: UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
dialog: eyes narrowed.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They didn't touch anything.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (trying to restore
dialog: order)
dialog: Well, they're gone now, so... so
dialog: let's...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't
dialog: you, Cathy?
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You look a little shaken.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I... I am.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual,
dialog: is it? The gull yesterday when I was
dialog: in the boat, and the one last night
dialog: at Annie's, and now...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Last night? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: A gull smashed into Annie's front
dialog: door.

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: I don't know, Melanie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Look, do you have to go back to
dialog: Annie's?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, I have my things in the car.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Then stay and have something to eat
dialog: before you start back. I'd feel a
dialog: lot better.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND
text: He is slicing the leftover roast beef.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you want some mustard with this?
speaker_heading: MELANIE (O.S.)
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (coming from kitchen)
dialog: Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: She said something about having to
dialog: get home to take a call from her
dialog: mother back East.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Take it into the living room, would
dialog: you, hon?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (seeing the birds)
dialog: What's the matter with them?
text: Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some
dialog: French bread.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: What's the matter with all the birds?
text: She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still
text: tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment,
text: and then signs heavily.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm
dialog: sure Miss Daniels wants to get on
dialog: her way.
text: As she moves into the living room.
speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (coming in with two
dialog: plates)
dialog: That road can be a bad one at night,
dialog: Melanie.
dialog: (he picks up coffee
text: cup, hands it to
dialog: Melanie)
text: They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet
dialog: style.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll
text: come onto the freeway much earlier.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (picking up a cup)
dialog: Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted,
dialog: isn't it, Mitch?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that
text: traffic going back to San Francisco.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Did you put the cover on that cage,
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Just listen to them!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (to Melanie)
dialog: Some cream?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'll get it.

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE
text: a single swift is sitting on the hearth.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch...
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

speaker_heading: MELANIE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - LYDIA

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

speaker_heading: MITCH

text: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA in terror, surrounded by birds.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

speaker_heading: MITCH

dialog: Cathy, get some matches!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - CATHY
text: running for the kitchen. Birds swooping after her.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: swinging the fireplace broom.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds
text: coming out of the opening. He stuffs paper under the logs
text: already in place there.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering
text: in her hair, caught there.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: swinging the broom, covered with birds.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - A PICTURE ON THE WALL
text: (an enlargement of a photograph of Cathy, smiling.) As a

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - CATHY
text: running into the room, covering her face with bent arm,
text: rushing to Mitch with the box of matches.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: taking the matches. He lights one. A bird hits his arm. He
text: drops the match. He lights another one.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE MATCH
text: falling onto the paper in the fireplace. It flickers for a
text: moment, then catches. Birds are still pouring out, past the
text: paper beginning to catch.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE
text: as a bird crashes through it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head. She is
text: hysterics now, BABBLING. The SHRIEK of the birds is a wild
text: cacophony.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE
dialog: blazing.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - A BIRD
text: swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE DRAPES

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE DRAPES

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch! The curtains!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: turning, seeing, his eyes opening wide.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: ripping at the flaming curtain. He throws it to the floor,
text: begins stamping on it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It's working! The fire's working!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE
text: only the blazing fire. No more birds entering.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE WINDOWS
text: birds bursting through the panes, leaving.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she beats away another bird.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ONE OF THE BROKEN WINDOWS
text: the birds leaving en masse now.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: A shambles. Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures
text: askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass. In a
text: corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering
text: her face, sobbing. The burnt curtain is still smoldering.
text: Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom
text: wearily. The attack is over.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND
text: reaching down to pick up a dead bird.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY
text: a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out
text: speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the
text: palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: That's a chimney swift, all right.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We know what it is, Al.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Well, these birds live in chimneys,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Not by the thousands.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you have a light burning or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: 'Cause sometimes birds are attracted
dialog: by light, you know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Sure is a peculiar thing.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What are we going to do about it,
dialog: Al?
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do
dialog: about what?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Well...
dialog: (he feels a little
dialog: foolish)
dialog: Well... these birds attacked us.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MALONE
text: slight disbelief on his face.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: What's more likely, they got in the
dialog: room and was just panicked, that's
dialog: all.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (still a little
dialog: hesitant)
dialog: All right, I'll grant you a bird'll
text: panic in an enclosed room. But, they
dialog: didn't just get in. They came in!
dialog: Right down that chimney.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: (trying to make sense
dialog: of this)
dialog: My wife found a bird in the back
text: seat of her car once.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Didn't know how he got in there.
dialog: Had a broken leg, turned out. Just
text: fluttering all around there.
dialog: (he shrugs again)
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: These birds were...
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is
dialog: these things happen sometimes, you
dialog: know? Ain't much we can do about it.
dialog: (he shrugs)
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Tell him about the party.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's right. We had a party here
dialog: this afternoon for Cathy. Her
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Oh, yeah, yeah.
dialog: (he grins)
dialog: How old is she now?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: Eleven. In the middle of the party,
text: some gulls came down at the children.
dialog: And Miss Daniels was attacked by a
dialog: gull just yesterday after...
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MALONE
dialog: considering this.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Were the kids bothering them or
dialog: something? 'Cause sometimes they'll
dialog: do that, you know. If you make any
dialog: kind of disturbance near them, they'll
dialog: just come after you. I seen that
dialog: plenty of times myself.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: The children were playing a game,
dialog: Al. Those gulls attacked without...
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty
dialog: strong word, don't you think? I mean,
dialog: birds just don't go around attacking
dialog: people without no reason, you know
dialog: what I mean? The kids just probably
dialog: scared them, that's all.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: These birds attacked!
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Well, what would you like me to do,
dialog: Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on
dialog: any suspicious birds in the area?
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't
dialog: it?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Does this room look silly?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: No, you got quite a mess here, I'll
dialog: admit that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Maybe you oughta put some screening
dialog: on top of your chimney
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Seems a little pointless, though.
dialog: Freak accident like this wouldn't
dialog: happen again in a million years.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You want some help cleaning up?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: exasperated.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I can handle it myself.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: giving a small moan.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'll take Cathy up to bed.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Are you staying?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I think I should, don't you?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: observing, making no comment.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'll get my things from the car. Do
dialog: you want to walk with me, Cathy?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
text: as Cathy and Melanie go out.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Well, if there's anything else I can
dialog: do, Mitch...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Goodnight, Lydia.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Sure is peculiar, I got to say that
dialog: for it.
text: He exits.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still
text: as a stone in her chair. The door closes gently on a note of
text: utter helplessness.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather
text: unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store. Her
text: hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a
text: lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is
text: busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS
speaker_heading: VOICES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYDIA'S VOICE
dialog: Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to
dialog: drop Cathy off now.
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LYDIA'S VOICE
dialog: I'll probably drive over to the
dialog: Fawcett farm. Do you need anything
dialog: in town?
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: No.
text: Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window
text: and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck
dialog: starting.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
text: as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck
text: and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the
text: road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA
text: FOLLOWING. She opens the door.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch?
text: There is no answer.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch?
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty.
text: The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops
text: at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on
text: her face.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
text: She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds
text: TWEET at her.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (imitating them)
dialog: Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is
text: an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.
text: She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then
text: peers out of the side window.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
text: Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin
text: column of smoke is climbing the sky.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to
text: put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She
text: picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the
text: cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee
text: and then breathes deeply of the air.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE
text: fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have
text: not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT - MITCH
text: on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke
text: is climbing the sky.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the
text: end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off
text: the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the
text: sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs
text: as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky
dialog: for a moment.
speaker_heading: SLOW PAN
text: as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in
text: sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in
text: its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin
text: column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and
text: raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts
text: the rake down and begins walking toward the house.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch
text: coming toward her, her eyes glowing.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH
text: closer to the house now.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: waiting, anticipating.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR
text: CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the
text: garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS
text: again. She turns.
text: Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing
text: a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I wanted to change my shirt.
text: Melanie is uncomprehending.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: It smelled of the fire.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: It's hard to believe anything at all
dialog: happened yesterday, isn't it? It's
text: so beautiful and still now.
dialog: (pause; then sagely)
dialog: I think I've got it all figured out,
dialog: by the way.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really? Tell me about it.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (secretively)
dialog: It's an uprising.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Of birds?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Certainly, of birds.
text: Mitch grins.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It all started several months ago
text: with a peasant sparrow up in the
text: hills, a malcontent. He went around
dialog: telling all the other sparrows that
dialog: human beings weren't fit to rule
dialog: this planet, preaching wherever anyone
dialog: would listen...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Growing a beard...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Yes, of course, he had to have a
dialog: beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!'
dialog: he kept saying, over and over...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So they united.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows
dialog: out for kicks...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Well, they'll go along with anything.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Sure. But eventually, even the more
text: serious-minded birds began to listen.
dialog: "Why should humans rule?" they asked
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hear!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Why should we submit ourselves to
dialog: their domination?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hear, hear!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And all the while, that sparrow was
text: getting in his little messages.
dialog: Birds of the world, unite!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Take wing!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You have nothing to lose but your
dialog: feathers.
text: They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then
text: laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly
dialog: still.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (attempting to be
dialog: serious)
dialog: What it was, probably...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mmm?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They're probably hungry, that's all.
dialog: This was a bad summer. They eat
dialog: berries and... and nuts, you know,
text: and the hills are all burned out, so
dialog: they're probably searching for food
dialog: wherever they can get it.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: With my little sparrow leading team.
text: She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.
dialog: Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror
text: story, they are becoming a little frightened.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's so damn quiet out there.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It was like that yesterday.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: After the gulls attacked.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I hadn't thought of that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And then the swifts came.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: It makes you feel as if they're...
dialog: they're waiting or... resting...
dialog: or....
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (trying to make it
dialog: light again)
dialog: No, they're having a meeting, Melanie.
dialog: Your sparrow is standing on a soap
dialog: box and...
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: her face dead serious.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: ...waving his little wings...
text: His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the
text: garden is silent.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming
text: slowly and with the chill of horror on them.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: They were angry, Mitch. They came
text: out of the chimney in fury.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I had the feeling they wanted each
dialog: and every one of us dead.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes
text: to him longingly.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Melanie, Melanie...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm frightened, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No, no...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm frightened and confused and I...
dialog: I think I want to go back to San
dialog: Francisco where there are buildings
dialog: and... and concrete and...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Melanie...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: ...everything I know.
text: She looks up at him suddenly.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh damn it, why did you have to walk
dialog: into that shop?
text: They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK
text: Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name
text: of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate.
text: Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She
text: knocks. There is no answer.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan?
text: She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a
text: little away from the house.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan?
text: There is no answer. She shades her eyes and looks out over
dialog: the fields.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - FARMHAND ON TRACTOR
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BARNYARD
text: as Lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Hi, there!
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND
text: He stops the tractor, turns toward Lydia, shading his eyes.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Is Mr. Fawcett home?
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND
speaker_heading: FARMHAND
dialog: (shouting back)
dialog: I think so, ma'm. His missus is in
dialog: Santa Cruz, but he ought to be here.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Have you seen him this morning?
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND FARMHAND
dialog: No, ma'm. I reckon he's in there, though.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (shouting it)
dialog: Thank you!
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - LYDIA
text: as she crosses the barnyard again. There are several chickens
text: scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag
text: of feed lying against the fence.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
dialog: getting an idea.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - LYDIA
text: reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
dialog: Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN
text: He struts up to the scattered grain.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: watching him.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN
text: He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from
text: it and struts off.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction
text: strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett. She turns.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - LYDIA
text: approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan?
text: She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.
text: In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan? Are you home?
dialog: No answer.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window
text: closest to the door.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW
text: A small pane of glass is broken.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
dialog: puzzled.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - LYDIA
text: going to the front door, trying the knob.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - LYDIA
text: The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan?
text: The house is still and silent.
scene_heading: INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT
text: as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the
text: right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her
text: left and looks down a long corridor.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
text: a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial
text: light into the corridor.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan?
dialog: No answer.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she
text: should leave. A determined look comes over her face.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
text: as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the
text: opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Dan? Are you in there?
text: No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing
text: the door open.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.
scene_heading: SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
text: starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and
text: continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A
text: standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still
text: burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass
text: shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane
text: of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its
text: top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped
text: out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near
text: decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser,
text: all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS,
text: and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass,
text: continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its
text: PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single
text: bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas,
text: one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately
speaker_heading: CUTS TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT
text: His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - LYDIA
text: turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in
text: an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she
text: is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips
text: her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still
text: screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she
text: backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,
scene_heading: CAMERA FOLLOWING. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK
text: at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the
text: highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite
text: direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV
text: through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend
text: leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield,
text: there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in
text: the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and
text: barrels into the front yard.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH
text: alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck
text: just as it jerks to a stop.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

scene_heading: INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.
text: She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set
text: with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the
dialog: kitchen.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That was Al on the phone. He wants
dialog: me to meet him out at the Fawcett
dialog: place. Says some detectives from
dialog: Santa Rosa'll be there in a little
dialog: while.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Will you be all right here?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes. I was just taking her in some
dialog: tea.
text: He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses
text: her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to
text: him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Be careful. Please.
text: She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long,
text: full kiss.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN
text: as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and
text: then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his
text: car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen,
text: through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on
text: the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: LYDIA (O.S.)
dialog: Mitch?
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM
text: This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a
text: life no longer valid. There are photographs of her dead
text: husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of
text: Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct
text: femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing
text: the tray.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought
dialog: you might like some tea.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Oh, thank you.
text: There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed,
text: arranges the pillows behind Lydia.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Where's Mitch?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Al Malone wanted him out at the
dialog: Fawcett farm.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: He was calling from the farm, Mrs.
dialog: Brenner.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Then he saw.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: He must have. He sent for the Santa
dialog: Rosa police.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: What good will they do?
text: She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie
text: walks to the window and looks out over the bay.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Do you think Cathy's all right?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: Cathy. At the school.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression
text: clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all
text: right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting
text: smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Do I sound foolish to you?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
text: I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
dialog: (she shudders)
dialog: They have such big windows at the
dialog: school.
dialog: (pause)
text: All the windows were broken. In Dan's
text: bedroom. All the windows.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Try not to think of that, Mrs.
dialog: Brenner.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I wish I were a stronger person.
text: There is a long awkward silence. She
text: sips at her tea reflectively.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I lost my husband four years ago,
dialog: you know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It's odd how you depend on someone
dialog: for strength, and then suddenly all
dialog: the strength is gone, and you're
dialog: alone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd love to relax some time. I'd
dialog: love to be able to sleep.
dialog: (pause; the worried
dialog: look again)
dialog: Do you think Cathy's all right?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Annie's there. She'll be all right.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I'm not this way, you know. Not
dialog: usually. I don't fuss and fret over
dialog: my children.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: When Frank died...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You see, he knew the children, he
dialog: really knew them. He had the knack
dialog: of being able to enter into their
dialog: world, of becoming a part of them.
dialog: That's a rare talent.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I wish I could be that way.
text: There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in
text: this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her
text: husband's death, is discussing it with another person.
text: Curiously, the person is Melanie.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (honestly and simply)
dialog: I miss him.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know, sometimes I wake up in the
dialog: morning, and I think 'I have to make
dialog: Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get
dialog: up and there's a... a very good reason
dialog: for getting out of bed until... until,
dialog: of course, I remember.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I miss talking to him.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Cathy's a child, you know, and
dialog: Mitch...
dialog: (she shrugs a little
dialog: sadly)
dialog: ...Mitch has his own life.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm glad he stayed here today. I
dialog: feel safer with him here.
dialog: (she sighs deeply)
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Would you like to rest now, Mrs.
dialog: Brenner.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: No. No... don't go yet.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I feel as if I... I don't understand
dialog: you. And I want so much to understand.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Why, Mrs. Brenner?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Because my son is...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My son seems to be fond of you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And I...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm not quite sure how I feel about
dialog: it. I really don't know if I... like
dialog: you or not.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?
dialog: You liking me?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Yes, I think so. My son is important
dialog: to me. I want to like any girl he
dialog: chooses.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And if you don't?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (with a faint smile)
dialog: Then I don't suppose it'll matter
dialog: much to anyone but me.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I think it might also matter to Mitch.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Mitch has always done exactly what
dialog: he wanted to do.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm not complaining. That's the mark
dialog: of a man. But...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You see, I... I wouldn't want to
dialog: be... be left alone. I don't think I
dialog: could bear being left alone. I...
dialog: forgive me. This business with the
dialog: birds has me upset. I... I don't
dialog: know what I'd do if Mitch weren't
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (going to the bed;
dialog: adjusting the pillow)
dialog: Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.
dialog: Brenner.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I wish I were stronger.
text: (she pauses and looks
text: toward the window.)
dialog: Do you think she's all right? Do you
dialog: think she's safe at the school?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Would you like me to go for her?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I couldn't ask you to.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't mind, really.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Would you? I'd feel so much better.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'll just clear up here, and then
dialog: dress.
text: She picks up the tray and starts for the door.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Melanie?
text: At the door, Melanie turns.

dialog: so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going

text: booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in
text: his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and
text: efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another
text: table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing
text: and clowning around throughout following at a table in the
text: rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the
text: counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.
text: Over her head, the television set is blasting with its
text: perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Daddy, there were hundreds of them.
dialog: No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying
dialog: to tell you this as calmly as I know
dialog: how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
dialog: (she takes a deep
dialog: breath)
dialog: Just now. Not... fifteen minutes
dialog: ago.
text: The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing
text: walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking
text: woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through
text: foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what
text: Melanie is saying.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: At the school. No, I don't. Just a
dialog: minute.
dialog: (to Deke)
dialog: What's the name of the school?
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Just the Bodega Bay School.
dialog: (to Mrs. Bundy)
dialog: Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: I need some change, Mr. Carter.
text: As Deke opens cash register...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: The Bodega Bay School.
dialog: (to Deke)
dialog: Could you turn that down, please?
text: Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't know how many children.
dialog: Thirty or forty. Yes.
text: Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to
dialog: Melanie.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No, the birds didn't attack until
text: the children were outside the school.
dialog: Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy.
dialog: Is there a difference between crows
dialog: and blackbirds?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: (turning from machine)
dialog: There is very definitely a difference,
dialog: Miss.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: They're different, Daddy.
dialog: (to Mrs. Bundy)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I think these were crows. Yes,
dialog: hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked
dialog: the children, attacked them.
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Daddy, a little girl was sent to the
dialog: hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all
dialog: right, but you act as if I'm... all
dialog: right, all right.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, I can't come home now. I just
dialog: can't, Daddy. How is it there? I
dialog: mean... are there birds? In the sky?
dialog: But no trouble. Well, I hope...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't know when. I simply can't
dialog: leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.
dialog: All right, Daddy, good-by.
text: She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: They're both perching birds, of
dialog: course, but of quite different
text: species. The crow is brachyrhynchos.
text: The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (to Deke)
dialog: Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: In the book right here, Miss.
text: As Melanie looks it up...
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: (to Mrs. Bundy)
dialog: I don't see what difference it makes,
text: Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If
dialog: they attacked the school, that's
dialog: pretty serious.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: (with a superior smile)
dialog: I hardly think either species would
dialog: have the intelligence to launch a
text: massed attack. Their brain pans aren't
dialog: large enough for such...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (dialing)
dialog: I just came from the school, madam.
dialog: I don't know about their brain pans
dialog: but...
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Birds are not aggressive creatures,
dialog: Miss. They bring beauty to the world.
dialog: It is mankind, rather, who...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (going to door leading
dialog: to kitchen)
text: Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.
text: Baked potato on all of them.
text: LAUGHTER from salesman at table.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner,
dialog: please?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes, I'll wait.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: (continuing to Deke)
dialog: ...insist on making it difficult for
dialog: life to survive on this planet. If
dialog: it weren't for birds...
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to
dialog: understand. This young lady says
text: there was an attack on the school.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Impossible.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (in background)
dialog: Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.
dialog: Something terrible has happened.
text: Her background conversation continues through following:
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: It's the end of the world!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What's this about the school?
speaker_heading: DEKE
text: Bunch of crows attacked the school,
dialog: Helen.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: It's the end of the world.
dialog: (suddenly quoting)
dialog: "Thus saith the Lord God to the
dialog: mountains, and to the hills, to the
dialog: rivers and to the valleys; Behold,
dialog: I, even I, will bring a sword upon
dialog: you, and I will destroy your high
dialog: places.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The Lord's not destroying anything,
dialog: Jason.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: "In all your dwelling places, the
dialog: cities shall be laid waste, and the
dialog: high places shall be laid waste!"
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Ezekiel, Chapter six.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: "Woe unto them that rise up early in
dialog: the morning that they may follow
dialog: strong drink."
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.
dialog: Good-by.
dialog: (she hangs up)
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I hardly think a few birds are going
dialog: to bring about the end of the world.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (turning to her)
dialog: These weren't a few birds.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN
text: waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation;
text: becoming very nervous.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: I didn't even know there were many
dialog: crows in Bodega Bay this time of
dialog: year.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: The crow is a permanent resident
dialog: throughout its range. In fact, during
dialog: our Christmas Count, we recorded...
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES
dialog: eating.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: (suddenly, from his
dialog: table)
dialog: How many gulls did you count, Mrs.
dialog: Bundy?
text: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are
dialog: several varieties.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: The ones that've been raising the
dialog: devil with my fishing boats.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
text: Probably herring gulls. They arrive
dialog: in November, you know, and don't
dialog: migrate North again until March or...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (leaping upon this)
dialog: Have you had trouble with gulls?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: One of my boats did last week.
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: (making a connection)
dialog: This young lady got hit by a gull
dialog: only Saturday.
speaker_heading: SAM'S VOICE
dialog: (from kitchen)
text: Pick up the chicken.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was
text: crows.
text: (she picks up tray,
dialog: shrugs, goes to table)
dialog: Deke, I'm still waiting for those
dialog: Bloody Marys!
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Coming right up!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
text: as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really
dialog: frightened.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Could you ask them to lower their
dialog: voices, please? They're frightening
dialog: the children.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
text: Timmy has a canary.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That's nice. Are you Timmy?
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: My cousin is Timmy.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: SAM'S VOICE
dialog: (leaving table, coming
dialog: to bar)
text: A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized
dialog: one of my boats. Practically tore
text: of the skipper's arm.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (coming back)
dialog: You're scaring the kids. Keep it
dialog: low.
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: You're scaring me, too. Are you trying
dialog: to say all these...
dialog: (he shakes his head)
dialog: That sounds impossible, Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: I'm only telling you what happened
dialog: to my boat.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: The gulls were after your fish, Mr.
dialog: Sholes. Really, let's be logical
dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What were the crows after at the
dialog: school?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: What do you think they were after,
dialog: Miss...?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Daniels. I think they were after the
dialog: children.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: For what purpose?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: To...
dialog: (she hesitates)
dialog: To kill them.
text: There is a long silence.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Why?
dialog: Another silence.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't know why.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: I thought not. Birds have been on
dialog: this planet since archaeopteryx,
dialog: Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty
dialog: million years ago!
text: A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait
dialog: all that time to start a... a war
dialog: against humanity?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No one called it a war!
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
text: Scotch, light on the water.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying
dialog: as much.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Are you finished here, Sebastian?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
dialog: (to Mrs. Bundy)
dialog: Who said anything about war? All I
dialog: said was that some gulls...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (yelling to kitchen)
dialog: One apple pie! You want more coffee?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: No. ...came down on one of my boats.
dialog: They could have been after the fish,
dialog: just as you said.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Your captain should have shot at
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most
dialog: birds are. If you ask me, we should
dialog: wipe them all out. World would be
dialog: better off without them.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: Birds?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Yeah, birds. All they do is make a
dialog: mess of everything. Who needs them?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: We need them.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Not if they're starting a war.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: They are incapable of organized
dialog: warfare!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Have you ever seen a jay protecting
dialog: a nest?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: I have seen jays doing everything it
dialog: is conceivable for jays to do.
dialog: Ornithology happens to be my
dialog: avocation, Miss Daniels. You're
dialog: talking about preservation of the
text: species, a hen protecting her young.
dialog: There's a vast difference between...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Maybe they're all protecting the
dialog: species. Maybe they're tired of being
text: shot at and roasted in ovens and...
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Are you discussing gamebirds now?
dialog: All birds are not gamebirds, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't know anything about birds
dialog: except that they're attacking this
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Then fight back. Get yourselves guns
dialog: and wipe them off the face of the
dialog: earth.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: That would hardly be possible.
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Because there are 8,650 species of
dialog: birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.
dialog: It's estimated that five billion,
dialog: seven hundred and fifty million birds
dialog: live in the United States alone. The
dialog: five continents of the world...
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Kill them all. Get rid of them.
dialog: Messy animals.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: ...probably contain more than a
dialog: hundred billion birds!
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: It's the end of the world!
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Well, we seem to have more than our
dialog: share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.
dialog: Maybe this young lady's right. Maybe
dialog: they've all gone crazy.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want
dialog: it at the table?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: No. Here's fine.
dialog: (he begins eating)
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Coming.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Are we running a business here -- or
dialog: a bird sanctuary?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: (beginning to change
dialog: his mind)
dialog: Actually, those gulls must have been
dialog: after the fish.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Makes a lot more sense than... well,
text: an attack.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Of course it does. If we believe
dialog: that birds are attacking, why... why
dialog: next we'll believe that grasshoppers
dialog: and cockroaches are capable of...
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Cockroaches! Urghh!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
text: getting more and more anxious.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Maybe we're all getting a little
text: carried away by this. Admittedly, a
dialog: few birds acted strangely. That's no
dialog: reason to believe...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: This isn't a few birds! I keep telling
dialog: you that! These are gulls and swifts
dialog: and crows and...
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Maybe! Is it impossible?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Yes. I have never known birds of
dialog: different species to flock together.
dialog: The very concept is unimaginable.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Why if that happened, we wouldn't
dialog: have a chance. How could we possible
dialog: hope to fight them?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.
dialog: Bundy.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (calling from table)
dialog: Excuse me, may I have a check, please?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Is everything all right, ma'am?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (coming from kitchen)
dialog: What's the matter? Something wrong
dialog: out here?
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Nothing's wrong.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: All this shouting.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: We're fighting a war, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A war? Against who? Did the
dialog: Russians...?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Against birds.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: I'm glad you all think this is so
dialog: amusing. You've frightened my children
text: half out of their wits.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I'm not scared, Mommy.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Keep quiet. If that young lady saw
dialog: an attack on the school, why won't
dialog: you believe her?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What attack? Who attacked the school?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Birds did. Crows! And you're all
dialog: sitting around here debating! What
dialog: do you want them to do next? Crash
dialog: through that window?
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: (frightened by her
dialog: mother)
dialog: Mommy!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Quiet! Why don't you all get home?
dialog: Lock your doors and windows!
dialog: (her hysteria rising)
dialog: Put on your coats, children!
dialog: (to Deke)
dialog: What's the fastest road to San
dialog: Francisco?
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: The freeway, ma'am.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Where do I get it?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: I'm going out that way, lady. You
dialog: can follow me.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Then let's go. Now!
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: I haven't finished my drink.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (on edge of panic,
text: shouting at her
dialog: children)
dialog: Put on your coats! Do you want to
dialog: get trapped here?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I can't find my scarf.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Look in your sleeve!
text: The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Melanie?
text: At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (going to her)
dialog: I got here as fast as I could.
dialog: Where's Cathy?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: At Annie's house. She's all right.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Al, why aren't you over there where
dialog: the attack was?
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Because I just got back from Dan
dialog: Fawcett's place, that's why.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: He was killed last night. By birds.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know
dialog: that for a fact.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: What are the facts, Mr. Malone?
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: Santa Rosa police think it was a
text: felony murder. They think a burglar
text: broke in and killed him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Were the Santa Rosa police at your
dialog: school today?
dialog: (impatiently, to
dialog: salesman)
dialog: Are you coming?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Take it easy, lady.
dialog: (through window)
text: There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: "Look at the birds of the air: they
dialog: do not sow or read, yet your heavenly
dialog: father feeds them."
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'll never feed another bird as long
dialog: as I live!
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Something like this happened in Santa
dialog: Cruz last year. The town was covered
text: with seagulls.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Can't you please finish your drink?
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: That's right, sir, I recall it. A
text: large flock of seagulls got lost in
text: a fog and headed in for the town,
dialog: where all the lights were.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
text: They made some mess, too, smashing
dialog: into houses and everything.
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: They always make a mess. We're better
text: off without them.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: The point is that no one seemed to
dialog: get upset about it. They were gone
text: the next morning, just as if nothing
dialog: at all had happened. Poor things.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm leaving! Are you coming?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: All right, all right!
dialog: (he downs his drink)
dialog: Hope you figure this out, folks.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: It's the end of the world.
text: The Tides is silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Well, I'd better get back to the
dialog: cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: Let's see. Scallops and coffee...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.
text: Sholes turns to him.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: his face very serious.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: No one ever said you were, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: I think we're in trouble. I don't
dialog: know how or why this started, but I
dialog: know it's here and I know we'd be
dialog: crazy to ignore it.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Ignore what? The bird war?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Yes, the bird war, the bird attack,
dialog: the bird plague, you can call it
dialog: what you want to, they're out there
dialog: massing someplace and they'll be
dialog: back, you can count on that!
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Ridiculous!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home
dialog: and polish your binoculars?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Go on, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: If we don't do something now, if we
dialog: don't get Bodega Bay on the move...
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Look, Mitch, even if this is true,
dialog: even if all the birds...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: (after a long pause)
dialog: No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't
dialog: see any reason for it.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's happening. Isn't that a good
dialog: enough reason?
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: I like Bodega Bay as well as any
dialog: man. If I thought...
dialog: (he shakes his head)
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Then help me, Sebastian. You're an
dialog: important man in this town. If you'll
dialog: help, the rest will.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: Help how? What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm not sure, but...
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: If you don't even know what you want
dialog: to do...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Listen to him, please.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (taking position beside
dialog: Melanie)
dialog: You listen to him, Sebastian!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I only know we've got to drive them
dialog: away from town -- before they drive
dialog: us away.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mrs. Bundy, you said something about
dialog: Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting
text: lost in the fog, and heading in for
dialog: the lights.
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: We don't have any fog this time of
dialog: year, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We'll make our own fog.
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: How do you plan to do that?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: With smoke.
speaker_heading: MALONE
dialog: There's an ordinance against burning
dialog: anything in this town, unless it's...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army
dialog: uses.
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad
dialog: as birds.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: Birds are not bad!
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: How can we go on living here if we
dialog: blanket the town with smoke?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Can we go on living here otherwise?
text: Pause. They are silent.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: It's worth a try, Sebastian.
text: There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Look!
text: They turn toward the window.
scene_heading: TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT
text: Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or
text: four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of
text: the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the
text: window and out to the left.
speaker_heading: DEKE
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Gulls!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They're back!
speaker_heading: SHOLES
dialog: They're only the usual... What are
dialog: you...
scene_heading: TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT
text: The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the
text: attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is
text: seen disappearing into the men's room.
scene_heading: INT. TIDES
text: A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the
dialog: Tides Restaurant.
scene_heading: TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT
text: A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man
text: on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and
text: then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out
text: and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep
text: by. The gas begins to flow away.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie
text: after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see
text: people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas
text: station. At the door, Mitch turns.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (to Melanie)
dialog: Stay back in here.
text: Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.
text: They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at
text: the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the
text: window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to
text: rescue the attacked gas station attendant.
text: Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter
text: away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in
text: the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks
dialog: down.
scene_heading: TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT
text: on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is
text: flowing to the right into the car park.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE
text: flowing down to the car park.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS
text: along the flowing gas back to the station.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: She turns back to the car park.
scene_heading: FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
text: We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked
text: below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up,
text: has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of
text: lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the
text: happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn
text: attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the
dialog: man.
scene_heading: FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
text: The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As
text: he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and
text: he drops it.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: Her horror-stricken face.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA
text: Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's
text: car, and the one next to it go up in flames.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE
text: TURNING TO SEE
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION
text: The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars,
text: following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump,
text: which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured
dialog: attendant.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT
text: A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the
text: town rushing around the car park and the streets across the
text: highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see
text: automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil
text: smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the
text: parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and
text: have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the
text: foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill
text: with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes
text: obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop
text: down on the town.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES TOWN
text: A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone
text: booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing
text: out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin
text: to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the
text: restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch...! Mitch!
text: We see her look up to the sky.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE SKY
text: The sky is full of seagulls.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again
text: to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in
text: the phone booth.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE
text: slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all
text: around her.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES TOWN
text: From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people
text: who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with
text: clouds of birds coming on them.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her
text: eyes for Mitch.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the
text: direction of the car park.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
text: Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water
text: from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning
text: cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around
text: them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: Her eyes turn up quickly.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
text: We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.
text: Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
text: We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner
text: coming toward her in the phone booth. We can see birds flying
text: in and out of the windows of the car. We can see the arm
text: and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the
text: background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE
text: as the car comes toward her in the booth.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES TOWN
text: At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: A side view of the car after practically scraping the side
text: of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the
text: driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently
dialog: give us a view of its interior.
scene_heading: FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: watching the car.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
text: The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It
text: explodes.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.
scene_heading: TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT
text: She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no
text: avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down
text: and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight
dialog: turn, now sees:
scene_heading: THE TIDES TOWN
text: The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop
dialog: their hose.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the
text: water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows
text: of the phone booth.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window
text: she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the
text: left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its
text: palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and
text: leaping and kicking its van to pieces.
text: At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of
text: a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.
text: His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are
text: covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.
text: Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides
text: Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter,
text: the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and
text: waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of
text: recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls
text: crash around the booth causing her to go back.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE
text: looking out again toward Mitch.
scene_heading: EXT. TIDES TOWN
text: Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction
text: while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning
text: building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station.
text: Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the
dialog: smoking building.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: looking across in horror.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING
text: For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly
text: Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls
text: down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office,
text: another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the
text: window as Mitch drops the child.
scene_heading: FLASH - MELANIE
text: watching this breathlessly.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.
text: He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the
text: windows. They disappear into the building.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: holding her breath.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING
dialog: No sign of Mitch.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELANIE
text: getting more desperate.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - BUILDING
text: No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window
text: and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT - MITCH
text: sees her and starts running toward the booth.
scene_heading: HIGH SHOT - MITCH
text: beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.
speaker_heading: LOW SHOT
text: close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag
text: Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the
text: CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.
scene_heading: INT. THE TIDES
text: There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the
text: windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The
text: CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very
text: hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.
text: There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can
text: hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a
text: woman's voice SCREAMS out:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Why are they doing it?! Why are they
dialog: doing it...?!
text: Some of the heads of the group turn.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.
text: Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and
text: helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some
dialog: words.
scene_heading: MRS. BUNDY
dialog: ([Mrs. Bundy offers a
dialog: weak explanation of
dialog: why the birds could
dialog: have gone berserk
dialog: like this. This
dialog: information should
dialog: be obtained from Dr.
dialog: Stager.])
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over
text: their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: I think they're going.
text: Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud
text: CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
text: And past the heads of the other people who have also turned,
text: we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has
text: gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who
text: are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the
text: window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think it's safe to get out now.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Don't let's take any chances.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We've got to get Cathy.
text: They open the door and make their way out into the street,
text: running and looking about them desperately.
scene_heading: EXT. BODIGA STREET
text: There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched
text: on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the
dialog: sidewalk.
scene_heading: EXT. BODIGA STREET
text: There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as
text: they move along past the last street and come into the more
text: countrified part of the town.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD
text: We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which
text: we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the
dialog: school roof.
scene_heading: SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks
text: up, Melanie following his look.
scene_heading: SKY SHOT - FULL
text: of wheeling gulls.
scene_heading: SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
text: They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the
text: school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT
text: There are a few blackbirds on it.
speaker_heading: MELANIE'S VOICE
dialog: Look... the crows again.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
text: Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Careful, Mitch. The crows may be
text: back in the play yard.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
text: They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play
dialog: yard, we see what they see.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of
text: crows.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: They walk stealthily past.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they
text: approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over
text: her shoulder toward the crows.
scene_heading: EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE
text: Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE
text: A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: He reaches the body. He rolls it over.
scene_heading: QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
dialog: dead.
scene_heading: QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: The shock registering on his face.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment
dialog: what Mitch's reaction will be.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
text: He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's
text: face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket
text: and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to
text: keep her warm. He turns away then.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW
text: with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign,
text: with her eyes peering at something outside.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: turning to follow Cathy's gaze.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS
text: Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROAD
text: As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at
text: the birds. Melanie dashes forward.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (as the birds flutter
dialog: into the air)
dialog: Mitch! Don't!
text: She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he
text: maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are
text: now hovering flight.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Please! Get Cathy! Let's get out of
dialog: here!
text: Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the
text: house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a
text: state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds
text: Cathy to her.
scene_heading: CLOSER THREE SHOT
text: as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch, you can't leave her out there.
text: He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder
text: is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and
text: then a door is CLOSED.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
text: We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer
text: in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the
text: three of them as they silently make their way past the crows
text: once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out
text: cautiously to the right.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.
text: BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE
text: They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE
text: The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go
text: toward the waiting car.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: They arrive at the car.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You drive, Mitch.
text: She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch
text: slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the
text: CAMERA and goes down the school road.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR
text: Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie
text: looks over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (holding her breath)
dialog: I don't think they're coming.
text: Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes
text: wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then
text: suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as
text: the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: On our way back from taking Michele
dialog: home... we... we heard the explosion
dialog: and went outside to... see what...
dialog: what it was.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All at once the... the birds were
dialog: everywhere. All at once. She... she
dialog: pushed me inside and... they covered
dialog: her.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Annie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: She pushed me inside.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE
text: as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
text: CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA
text: TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings
text: to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues
text: low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting
text: there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd,
text: not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the
text: Brenner house in the distance.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
text: Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed
text: across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two
text: attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE BAY
text: covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is
text: still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where
text: the ladder leans against the side of the house.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
text: as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner,
text: carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She
text: is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is
text: not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her
text: hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked
text: with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there
text: is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she
text: stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: The town looks clear.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: The bay doesn't.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: How long have they been gathering
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: The past fifteen minutes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It seems to be a pattern, doesn't
text: it? They strike and disappear, and
text: then they start massing again.
text: Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I keep thinking of Annie.
text: (she squeezes her
dialog: eyes shut)
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (after a long pause)
dialog: It... it doesn't look very different,
dialog: does it? A little smoke over the
dialog: town, but otherwise...
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (looking)
text: Even the birds sitting out there.
dialog: It does look very much the same,
dialog: Mitch. This could be last week.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It may not be last week again for a
dialog: long long time.
text: They are both silent.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Look. They're still coming.
text: Mitch nods. Silence.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do you want to try your father again?
dialog: (Melanie shakes her
text: head. Puzzled, Mitch
dialog: looks at her)
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I tried a little while ago. The
text: phone's dead.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Have we still got power?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (leaning against him)
dialog: I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very
dialog: tired.
speaker_heading: LYDIA (O.S.)
dialog: Mitch! I'm getting something on the
dialog: radio!
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT
text: Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a
text: footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the
text: room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from
text: the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I can't get any of the local stations.
dialog: I think this is San Francisco.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: ...would include formulation of a

dialog: for the various facets of the project.
dialog: A vote on the motion is expected

scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
text: Continuing with the local news, police
dialog: are still investigating the series
dialog: of valuable jade burglaries in the
text: Chinatown area. The round-up of known
dialog: criminals has not as yet produced a
dialog: suspect, but Commissioner Nelson
dialog: said today he was certain the
dialog: burglaries were quote linked and the
dialog: work of the team of professionals
dialog: unquote.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In Bodega Bay early this morning, a
text: large flock of crows attacked a group
dialog: of children who were leaving the
text: school during a fire drill. One little
dialog: girl was seriously injured and taken
dialog: to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: (continuing as drone

dialog: The goal of a peaceful world of free

dialog: guide for the present and our vision
dialog: for the future -- a free community
dialog: of nations, independent but
text: interdependent, uniting north and
dialog: south, east and west, in one great
text: family of man, outgrowing and
dialog: transcending the hates and fears
dialog: that rend our age. We will not reach
dialog: that goal today or tomorrow. We may
dialog: not reach it in our lifetime. But
dialog: the quest is the great adventure of
dialog: our century. We sometimes chafe at
dialog: the burdens of our obligations, the
dialog: complexity of our decisions, the
dialog: agony of our choices, but there is
dialog: no comfort or security for us in
dialog: evasion, no solution in abdication,
dialog: no relief in irresponsibility.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In assuming the tasks of the
dialog: Presidency, I said that few
dialog: generations, in all history, had
dialog: been granted the role of being the
dialog: great defender of freedom in its
dialog: hour of maximum danger. This is our
dialog: good fortune, and I welcome it now
dialog: as I did when I first took office.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: For it is the fate of this generation --
dialog: Of you in the Congress and of me as
dialog: President -- to live with a struggle
dialog: we did not start, in a world we did -
dialog: not make. But the pressures of life
dialog: are not always distributed by choice.

speaker_heading: MITCH

dialog: When do you think they'll come?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: If there are... larger birds, Mitch...
dialog: they'll get into the house.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's a chance we have to take.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Maybe we ought to leave.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Not now. Not while they're massing
dialog: out there.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't know when. We'll see what...
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Where will we go?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't know yet. I think we'll be
dialog: safe here.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: Let's bring that wood in.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: What happens when we run out of wood?
text: Music begins to play. The music is sweet, with violins and
text: long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the
text: tension being played in front of it.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't know. We'll break up the
dialog: furni...

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - HOUSE

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Santa Rosa?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face.

speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Come on. Let's get this wood in.
text: Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
text: Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we

text: There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights,
text: kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace
text: putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room

speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: That's the last of it.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Did you close the door?
speaker_heading: MELANIE

speaker_heading: CATHY

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

dialog: Mitch? Why are they doing this? The
dialog: birds.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (putting wood on fire)
dialog: I don't know, honey.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Why are they trying to kill people?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I wish I could say. But if I could
dialog: answer that, I could also tell you
dialog: why people are trying to kill people.
text: The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the
text: lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall
dialog: silent.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
text: turning to look toward the other room, her face going white,
text: her eyes widening.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
dialog: waiting.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
dialog: waiting.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
dialog: waiting.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of
text: their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of
text: splintering glass.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Mitch...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shhh. Shhh.
text: Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING,
text: the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence. More panes
text: of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards
text: and the outside of the house begins building, almost like
text: muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm.
text: Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration,
text: is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section
text: entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the
dialog: roof.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She
text: squeezes her eyes shut.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE
text: as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds,
text: there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat
text: of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
dialog: tat. Tat-
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (in terror)
dialog: I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I
dialog: want to throw...
text: Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'll go with you.
text: They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR
text: Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling
text: of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of
text: birds striking the house.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the
text: birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his
text: watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back
text: door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the
text: dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
text: watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?
text: He cannot tell.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a
text: NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing
text: sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: coming into the entry hall.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR
text: The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside
text: assail the door.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH
text: turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining
text: room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it
text: toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and
text: piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again,
text: CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags
text: it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table
text: when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with
text: alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is
text: and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of
text: desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The
text: CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din
text: now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: When will they stop?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I thought they'd have stopped by
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Almost two a.m.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You must be exhausted.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How about you?
text: She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room,
text: the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their
text: cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready
text: to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the
text: chair, goes to the cage.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: looking at the birds, wondering.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
text: looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their
dialog: expressions. Malice or benevolence?
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
text: watching, unmoving.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER
text: as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.
text: One of them tweets.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I wonder if Cathy fed them.
text: He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door,
text: takes out a small box of bird feed.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE
text: as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.
text: His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the
text: small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.
text: Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.
text: The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the
text: small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it
text: in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then,
text: tweeting, they begin to eat.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM
text: as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped
text: against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.
text: Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling,
text: pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (holding her)
dialog: You should have left when you wanted
dialog: to.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I don't want to be safe. I want to
dialog: be with you.
text: There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like
text: a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close,
text: Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand
text: in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of
text: night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (in the darkness)
dialog: The power.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wait here. Don't move.
text: The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the
text: blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the
text: SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes
dialog: on.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
text: as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as
text: he directs the beam upwards.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We'd better light some of those lamps.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No... wait.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hold me.
text: In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is
text: almost black in the room except for the strange effect of
text: the flashlight as he holds it behind her.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think they're easing off.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
text: A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the
text: fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep
text: on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.
text: Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly
text: and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer
text: the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another
text: SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a
text: steady dribbling, difficult to place.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Mitch?
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she turns toward him.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (still whispering)
dialog: Mitch?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
dialog: asleep.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming
text: from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep,
text: picks up a very long flashlight.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the
text: entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled
text: against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into
text: the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam
text: on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor
text: outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters,
text: goes to the windows, plays the beam on them. Everything's
text: all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second
text: bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first
text: door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light
text: on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor,
text: goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to
text: the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back
text: toward the door when she stops.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
dialog: looking.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR
text: a pile of chipped and broken plaster.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING
text: A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face,
text: and suddenly, her eyes open wide.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL
text: sitting in the darkness, staring at her.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: reacting.
scene_heading: QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL
text: wings spread in the beam of light.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE
text: backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering
text: back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CEILING
text: a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward
dialog: her.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds
dialog: attack her.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MELANIE
text: swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: Melanie!
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
text: grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is
text: a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering
dialog: wings.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: Melanie, open the door!
text: He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie
text: struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed
dialog: by the birds.
text: She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the
text: spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering
text: of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault
text: on the door by Mitch outside.
speaker_heading: LYDIA (O.S.)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Mitch, get her out of there!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE ROOM
text: Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in
text: view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see
text: on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: Melanie!
text: The door begins to open.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH
text: as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room. He
text: begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for
text: Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins
text: dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been
text: shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.
text: We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch
text: pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut
text: behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at
text: the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mother, get a rope!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Oh, my God, look at her!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Get a rope!
text: She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.
text: There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He
text: will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his
text: hand, knocking the club from it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his
text: hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.
text: Another bird flutters into the corridor.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his
text: hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and
text: is immediately attacked by the other bird.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Mother! Hurry!
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
text: as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a
text: heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily
text: to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and
text: compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the
text: doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to
text: the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to
text: Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia
text: following. As they go downstairs:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Cathy! Get a blanket and some
dialog: bandages!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (at the foot of the
text: stars, on the verge
dialog: of tears)
dialog: Is she all right?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm... I'm....
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH
text: as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Just lie there and keep still.
text: Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.
text: By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over
text: Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands
text: are trembling, and he drops it.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Let me do that, Mitch.
text: She picks up the bandage.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I can handle it.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I know you can.
dialog: (her eyes meet his)
dialog: But I'd like to.
text: He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Please don't mess me up with bandages,
dialog: Mrs. Brenner.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Shhhh. Shhhh.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Please.
text: But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the
text: cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (as she works)
dialog: I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You're doing fine.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (Apologizing)
dialog: I mean. I want to...
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Listen!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: They're gone. God have mercy, they're
dialog: gone.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - MITCH
text: as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the
text: table and chair. He opens the door a crack.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE YARD
text: through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no
text: birds visible.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE DOOR
text: from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred
text: and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds
text: spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is
text: directly behind him.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
text: a shambles, all the windows broken.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: They're gone. The same pattern.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: But they'll be back.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We won't be here.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Where can we go, Mitch? There's no
dialog: place to go.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I want to try for San Francisco.
text: There are buildings there. Steel and
dialog: concrete!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: We'd never make it. They're probably
text: all over the road.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We have to try it.
dialog: (a long silence)
dialog: We can't stay here.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Melanie needs help.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Mother, the house won't take another
dialog: attack.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: If...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: If... when we get to San Francisco...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: If they're already there?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They won't be.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: If they are?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We'll worry about that when we get
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I'm frightened, terribly frightened.
dialog: I... I don't know what's out there,
dialog: Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What do we have to know, Mother?
dialog: We're all together, we all love each
dialog: other, we all need each other. What
dialog: else is there? Mother, I want us to
dialog: stay alive!
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (nodding; then after
dialog: a pause)
dialog: I started to say... inside...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You don't have to.
text: He holds out his hand to her.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think we'd better get started.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD
text: It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before
text: dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following
text: until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is
text: deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's
text: convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house
text: together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the
text: back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background
text: is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia
text: comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking
text: down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
text: She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just
text: outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: looking back at her.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA
text: Across the expanse of the desolated yard.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: May I take them, Mitch?
text: He does not answer. She continues looking at him.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: They haven't harmed anyone.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Take them.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (with a slow nod)
dialog: We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.
text: He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.
text: The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front
text: seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops,
text: and looks toward the trees.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE TREES
text: covered with waiting birds.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: getting into car.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Be careful with that door.
text: Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch
text: does the same with his door.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Mitch, if they hear the car
dialog: starting... if they see movement...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We'll take it slow until we get to
dialog: the main road.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Are you ready?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND
text: turning the key. The motor springs to life.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
text: anticipation on all the faces.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: All right.
text: (he takes a deep breath)
dialog: Here we go.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR
text: from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is
text: still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it
text: passes the gate and starts down the road.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small
text: fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.
text: The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the
dialog: road.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: She gasps quickly.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE
text: standing, waiting silently.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR
text: as the tension begins to starts.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shhh. Shhhh.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with
text: waiting seagulls.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: turning toward the side of the road ahead.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.
text: covered with waiting birds.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Mitch, let's turn back.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shhh. Shhhhh.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE
text: as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front
text: porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his
text: hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded
text: window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
text: reacting.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.
text: as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding
text: road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
text: standing wires, watching, waiting.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as
text: the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of
text: birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every
text: pole, on every fence.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Mitch!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MITCH
text: as he stops the car and looks ahead.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR
text: in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: frightened, try not to reveal her fear.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Can we turn back?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I... I don't think so. If we get
dialog: through town, I think we'll be all
dialog: right.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
text: There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest
text: reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing,
text: who makes the decision.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Then go ahead, Mitch.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR
text: as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow
text: rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: as she turns to look out the window on her side.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS
text: as the car moves past them slowly.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
text: closing her eyes.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE
text: through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with
text: birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all
text: over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the
text: open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the
text: gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken
dialog: windows.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH
text: The tension on their faces,
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES
text: as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and
text: merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere,
dialog: waiting.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN
text: lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his
dialog: arms.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: strained, looking at the road ahead.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD
text: a clear sky, a bird-free stretch,
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (almost as a prayer)
dialog: Here we go.
text: (he rams down on the
dialog: accelerator)
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR
text: as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead
text: in a burst of speed.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS
dialog: taking wing.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MORE BIRDS
dialog: taking wing.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: screaming.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Mitch!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD
text: through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing
text: immediately ahead.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD
text: from the inside, as birds flutter against it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR
text: from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin
text: line of light.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
text: wrenching at the wheel again, another bend.
scene_heading: HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR
text: navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it
text: in straight lines.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
text: in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over
text: their heads, letting in more light.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
text: More slashes, more light in scattered beams.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the
text: memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the
dialog: owl.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
text: more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the
text: incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: (almost a prayer)
dialog: Dear God... dear God... please,
dialog: please, what have we done? Please.
dialog: (and then in anger at
dialog: the roof and the
dialog: birds)
dialog: Can't they leave us alone?
dialog: (shrieking it)
dialog: LEAVE US ALONE!
text: MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof
text: suddenly rips back.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - BIRDS
text: from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof
text: tears back.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
text: This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds,
