speaker_heading: SCREAMS.
text: We see clearly the face of the dead man -- an older gentleman

speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Hey, hey, hey! Lighten up!

speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: C'mon now. Sit down. You need

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not kidding, Hilly. I saw it.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Okay. Here.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wow! I can't believe it.
speaker_heading: HILLY

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But I saw it, really I did.
speaker_heading: HILLY

scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S COMPARTMENT - DAY : 25
text: George, looking bright-~eyed and happy, exits from the bath-
text: room where he has washed and shaved. He puts on a clean shirt
text: and hums to himself "Hilly's Theme," as he buttons it up.
text: Hilly is lying in bed, deep in a relaxed and contented sleep. |
text: George looks at his watch and picks up a train schedule to
text: see when they will arrive at the next station. He puts the™
text: schedule in his back pocket, sees the empty champagne bottle
text: and picks it up with fond remembrance of the lovemaking the
text: night before. Then he remembers his vision of the dead man
text: and his expression changes. He steps to the window and ignor-
text: ing the desert in bloom stretches his neck to try to see the
text: roof. Unsatisfied, he steps to the next window, folds up his
text: bed. to make the couch and tries again to see the outside roof
text: of the train. He finally gives this up, looks at the bostle,
text: and drops it into the wastebasket. He goes over to Hilly and
text: smiles down at her. :
text: Leaning forward to gently touch her hair, he knocks the :
text: Rembrandt book off the chair. He picks it up and notices an
text: envelope stuffed with papers sticking out from under the
text: jacket cover. He pats the envelope back in place and is about
text: to put it down when he turns it over to look at the author's
text: picture on the back. He gasps with surprise for the picture
text: of the grey-haired old man with the white goatee is the same
text: man he saw hanging dead outside the window. The train lurches
text: and George staggers. Turning quickly to Hilly, he shakes her
dialog: awake, .
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hilly! Hilly! Wake up. Look
dialog: at this.
text: Hilly stirs and sits up, still half-asileep.

scene_heading: INT. THE TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY 29

text: hesitates, debating in his mind if he is not being a fool
text: about the whole thing. Suddenly from inside the room’ he

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wait a minute! You can't do

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, you big ox, what the hell do
dialog: you think you're doing. Hold it.

scene_heading: INT. THE CAR PLATFORM - DAY 30

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, man, you're in trouble. I

scene_heading: EXT, THE DESERT - DAY 31
text: George flies through the air and lands on the sandy bank of

dialog: by.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What the -- |
text: He stands up and feels himself. He is not hurt. He dusts
text: himself off and notices that the sleeve on his jacket has
text: been ripped. He fingers it lovingly. Then he begins to get
text: the full realization of what has happened. He runs up to the
text: railway tracks and squints at the train racing off in the
text: distance. He looks behind him and out across the flat desert
text: on either side. There is no sign of life or civilization
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Son-of-a-bitch!

scene_heading: EXT. THE DESERT - DAY 34°

text: George climbs up on one of the smaller mesas » and, shielding

text: he sees something. He looks again. Off across the flat
text: plain is a farmhouse and a windmill, a distant vision that
text: sits incongruously on the desert floor like @ children's

text: down, and begins running toward it as fast as he can.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - LONG SHOT - DAY , 35
text: The farmhouse is a startling sight, a clapboard oasis

text: them is a yard encircled by a corral, a cow shed, a chicken

text: trailer, George runs INTO FRAME and down the road.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FARMYARD - DAY 36
text: George arrives at the farmyard and stops to catch his breath.
text: He looks around at the pigsty, the turkeys in the chicken
text: coop, and the lazy-eyed dog who glances up disinterestedly
text: from his kennel. He walks over to a 1950 Chevy parked by
text: the porch and is about to knock on the front door when he

text: her back towards us is finishing a late lunch with
dialog: Roger Devereau, the suave, continental gentleman we glimpsed

text: stops short. He is confused and sits quietly down at the
text: nearest table to watch her. Sweet is at the table, reading a

speaker_heading: SWEET
dialog: I asked you to join me for breakfast.
dialog: This is lunch.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, sorry. I lost track of the time.

speaker_heading: SWEET

scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S CORRIDOR - DAY 54

text: goes to his compartment and steps inside.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S COMPARTMENT - DAY 55
text: The first thing we notice is the partition between his and
text: Hilly's rooms has been put back up and the connecting door is
text: closed. George listens for a moment at the door and then
text: opens it slowly. Hilly is kneeling on the couch sadly
text: leoking out the window. She sees George and couldn't be

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hilly, what's the matter?
text: Hilly suddenly breaks away from hin, totally changing her
text: emotion from one of need to one of nonchalance.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Tne matter? Who left who? The

speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: The professor is dead. Murdered.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, listen to me. I went to

text: were going through his things.
dialog: They pushed me out, twisted my arm
dialog: and threw me off the train.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Threw you off!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The point is they were looking for

dialog: Well, that's good news, You know,

dialog: manage to get back on?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wait, wait a minute. Who's Reace?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAU

dialog: couldn't find them. We searched his
dialog: compartment -- twice. We sent Reace
dialog: in here to get Hilly and finally we

speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: George thinks the professor has

speaker_heading: DEVEREAU

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's right. Last night.

dialog: Oh, yes. I'm sticking my nose into

scene_heading: INT. THE BAGGAGE CAR ENTRANCE - DAY 68

scene_heading: INT. THE BAGGAGE CAR - DAY 71

text: as an avenue of emergency escape. He opens the latches and
text: tries to pull the door back. He tries again, It opens with
text: a sudden jerk so unexpectedly that George trips backward and
text: knocks his gun off the trunk. He gasps in horror as the gun

dialog: the train...certain death to anyone who would try to jump

scene_heading: INT, THE BAGGAGE CAR ENTRANCE - DAY 76

text: Gold Teeth throws down the axe and kicks the door open.
text: Taking out his gun, he advances cautiously,
scene_heading: INT. BAGGAGE CAR - DAY 77
text: Gold Teeth steps into the car and drops down behind a trunk,
text: He looks around. George is nowhere to be seen. He stanis up
text: and very carefully begins making his way to the barricada,
text: He looks behind it. George is not there, Disgusted, he
text: turns and quickly looks through the rest of the car even
text: pushing over the cardboard cut-out of "Mary-Lou" to see if he
text: is hiding behind that. Satisfied that George is not in the

text: begins carefully walking back toward the rear. As he hops

text: Gold Teeth staggers in shock, lurches over and falls. His
text: body slides off the roof of the train and George watches
text: horrified as it tumbles down the gorge, bouncing from rock

text: George stands on the roof stunned at what he has seen and
