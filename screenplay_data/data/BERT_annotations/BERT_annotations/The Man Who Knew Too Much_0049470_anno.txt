scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach
text: with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see
text: much of the background which is receding from us.
text: THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at
text: each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the
text: aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They
text: are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with
text: an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The

scene_heading: EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS,
text: photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the
dialog: screen is the destination board. By the time we get
text: opposite the window out of which the McKennas are
dialog: looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA --
dialog: MARRAKESH."
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window.
text: Jo's interest seems only casual.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa
dialog: before? It looks familiar.
scene_heading: INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
text: Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus is
text: entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and plaster
text: building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys and one

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.
speaker_heading: JO
dialog: This isn't really Africa, Hank. It's

dialog: Northern Africa.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Still seems like Las Vegas.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (Slightly indignant)
dialog: We're only a hundred miles north of

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
text: The bus is passing through the center of the town. We

dialog: It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!
text: Jo and Ban smile at Hank.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Just wait till you see Marrakesh.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Marrakesh. Sounds like a drink.
text: Ben runs his tongue across his lips.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You bet it does.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
text: The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open
text: desert once again. It looks parched and grim.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank
text: grows, restless. He looks about for something to do.
text: Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes.
text: Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her
text: place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the
dialog: bus and test its possibilities for adventure.
text: The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly
text: makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab
text: village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to
text: bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better
text: than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a
text: particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger.
text: In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to
text: grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only
text: succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman.
text: Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
text: The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her
text: face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
text: With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers
text: a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the
text: woman's veil.

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
text: The woman still covers her face, but from the seat
text: next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and
text: makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's
text: robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining
text: twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The
text: Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank,
text: repeating his demand.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
text: People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the
dialog: reason for the trouble.
scene_heading: INT. BUS (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

text: source of the trouble behind him.
scene_heading: INT. BUS (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
text: Hank looks up at the oncoming Arab, and retreats
text: uncertainly, not realizing he is still holding the
dialog: veil.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
text: The Arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy
text: in furious Arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Two Arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats
text: apparently disturbed by what the brown-clothed Arab is

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Ben and his wife, Jo, are straining from their back

text: Ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
text: Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his
text: son and the oncoming Arab.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
text: Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother,
text: still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab
text: who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's
dialog: benefit.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.
dialog: Simmer down.
text: The Arab continues pointing, talking.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes
text: rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the
text: Arab. He pushes in between the pair.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (To Ben)
dialog: Pardon me.
text: He turns to the Arab, moves him back a little, sharply
text: silences his attack, and then begins, in Arabic, to
dialog: explain firmly that the boy meant, no harm. It was an
text: accident. The Arab isn't convinced, points to Hank.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he
text: is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the
text: Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The
text: Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS
text: him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats,
text: growing quiet.

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You talk Arab talk.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: A few words.
speaker_heading: JO
dialog: Why was he so angry? It was an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: LOUIS

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who
text: moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so
text: that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In
text: the rear windows behind them we see the retreating
dialog: landscape of French Morocco.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: How different.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: For Josephine. Called her Jo so long,
dialog: nobody knows her by any other name.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I do. Mummy.
text: She smiles at Hank, rubs the back of his neck.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Now about the "accident." You see, a
dialog: Moslem woman never takes off her veil
dialog: in public under any circumstances.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: They feed her intervaneously?
text: Louis looks at the boy with some surprise.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Quite a big word for such a small boy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm a doctor.
speaker_heading: LOUIS

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Ben seems happy to talk with somebody new.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We've been to a medical convention in

dialog: thought I'd like to see Morocco again.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Daddy liberated Africa.
text: Louis laughs a little. Ben seems uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I was up around Casablanca with an
dialog: Army field hospital, that's all.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
text: Jo his been listening. She seems annoyed at Louis

speaker_heading: JO
dialog: Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?
scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: (To Ben)
dialog: I suppose you came directly from Paris?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We looked in on Rome and Lisbon a few
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: HANK

scene_heading: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
text: It moves through the outskirts of Marrakesh, a somewhat

text: A persists with Louis Bernard.
speaker_heading: JO
dialog: Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Do you eat snails.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: When I'm lucky enough to got them.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: If you ever get hungry, our garden
text: back home is full of snails.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (Chuckles)
dialog: Thank you for the invitation.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: That's all right. We tried everything
dialog: to got rid of them. We never thought
dialog: of a Frenchman.
text: Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues
dialog: on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good

scene_heading: EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

text: bicycle riders, Arab women carrying things on their

scene_heading: EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

text: The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the
text: passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together
text: with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab
text: helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,
text: to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage
text: of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped
text: bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to
dialog: take the people to their various destinations in the
text: city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Hank rubs his backside a little.

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That's kind of you, doctor, but
dialog: unfortunately I have some business
dialog: first.
text: Jo tries to be casual.
speaker_heading: JO
dialog: What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?
text: But he has turned his head and speaks something in
text: Arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the McKenna's

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. Now that's not a fair bargain.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: But I know Marrakesh. I can show you

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (Gives in)
dialog: Well -- that's what we came here for.
dialog: Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: A wagon! I want to ride in a wagon!
text: He points out one of the open horse-drawn carriages.
text: Louis looks to Ben for confirmation. Ben nods assent.
text: Louis turns to the porter, and orders him in Arabia to
dialog: put the McKenna's baggage aboard the first available

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Au revoir. I look forward to cocktails.

text: He Packs some more clothes away. Jo doesn't stir, she

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So we're going to London to find him.
text: He looks at her for a reaction. She turns her head
text: away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting
text: for control of her emotions. Ben crosses to her, the

text: He opens it. In careful, low tones, he reads Louis

dialog: Understand, Jo?
text: Jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece

text: pocket. He speaks with a shade more urgency in his
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We've only got a few hours, Jo! We
dialog: have to got up and start moving.
text: Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to the dresser
text: and the suitcases. Then he pauses and looks back at
text: Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns back to look
text: at Ben. She is studying him now as if she has just
text: seen him for the first time. Her eyes are more alert.
text: Ben turns back to his packing.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I've paid the bill, and there's a car
dialog: waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack,

speaker_heading: JO
dialog: Oh Ben, Ben, Ben...where is he? Where
dialog: is he?

speaker_heading: BEN

scene_heading: EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

scene_heading: EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

scene_heading: EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

speaker_heading: EDINGTON
dialog: As things are, there's no need for you

text: His tone and manner of asking them leaves little doubt

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Whatever you say.
speaker_heading: EDINGTON

text: The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do.
speaker_heading: BUCHANAN
dialog: Do sit down, won't you?
text: Jo hesitates, then sits down. Ben doesn't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why does Scotland Yard want to talk

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

speaker_heading: BUCHANAN
dialog: We might find him. Quite soon, indeed,

speaker_heading: BUCHANAN
dialog: Those people kidnapped your boy -- in

speaker_heading: BEN

text: THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from,
text: his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is
text: completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so
text: that his footsteps click on the pavement and create
text: the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the

scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

text: The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty-

dialog: he would like to make his destination before the man

scene_heading: EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

scene_heading: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
text: She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA

text: someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and
text: tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped

scene_heading: EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
text: They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around

text: about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist
dialog: type and the congregation consists mostly of middle-

text: look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something
text: to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks
text: up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and
text: begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of
text: following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own
text: words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at

speaker_heading: BEN

text: This looks like mother wild goose chase.
speaker_heading: JO
dialog: (Singing them)

text: From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister,
