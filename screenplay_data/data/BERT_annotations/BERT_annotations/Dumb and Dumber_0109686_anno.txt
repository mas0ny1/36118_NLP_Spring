scene_heading: EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING
text: A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
text: for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.
text: A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
text: SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
text: her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
dialog: about.
text: Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
text: CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
text: little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Excuse me, can you tell me how to
dialog: get to the medical school? I'm
text: supposed to be giving a lecture in
dialog: twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
dialog: lost.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (heavy European accent)
text: Go straight aheads and makes a left
text: over za bridge.
text: Lloyd checks out her body.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: I couldn't help noticing the accent.
dialog: You from Jersey?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Austria.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Austria? You're kidding.
dialog: (mock-Australian accent)
dialog: Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
dialog: we get together later and throw a
text: few shrimp on the barbie.
text: The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Guess I won't be going Down Under
dialog: tonight...
text: He SIGHS and zips the window back up.
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO
text: Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
text: seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
dialog: away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!
text: The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: Carr 22, come in, car 22...
text: Lloyd grabs his CB mike.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This is 22.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: 22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
dialog: You're running late on the East Side
text: pick-up.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: Well hurry it up. And make sure you
dialog: park legally. One more ticket and
dialog: your ass is history.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
text: This building is white with black spots on it, like a
text: DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
text: DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.
text: The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
text: hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
text: on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.
text: HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
text: a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
text: EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
text: of DOGS pile out.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, gang, single file. You know
dialog: the rules: No pushing, no humping,
dialog: and no sniffing heinies...
dialog: 3.
text: The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
text: PALMER, sticks his head out.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Hey, why aren't those mutts on
dialog: leashes?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: The same reason you're not on a leash,
dialog: sir because it's demeaning and it
text: chafes like hell.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Just get them in here now! They all
dialog: have to be bathed and clipped in an
dialog: hour.
text: Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
text: they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
text: wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
text: them on a wall.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You kids stay right here...
text: As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
text: isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
text: taking the two dogs with it.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (at truck)
dialog: Hey, wait a minute!
text: Harry chases after the vehicle.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY
text: Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
text: driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
text: STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
text: front oor and RINGS THE BELL.
text: The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
text: appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
text: he lays eyes on her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll be just a minute...
dialog: 4.
text: As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
text: Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
dialog: his ears...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - DAY
text: Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
text: window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
text: her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
text: glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
text: is speechless. Then:
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Why you going to the airport? Flying
dialog: somewhere?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (dead-pan)
dialog: How'd you guess?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well, I saw your luggage, then when
dialog: I noticed the airline ticket, I put
text: two and two together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So where you heading?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Aspen.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
dialog: California's beautiful this time of
dialog: year.
text: Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
dialog: glance.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm Mary.
text: ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
text: to impress her.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
dialog: It's only temporary.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
dialog: are saving up our money so we can
dialog: open our own pet store.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's nice.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I got worms.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's what we're gonna call it: I
dialog: Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
dialog: selling worm farms you know, like
dialog: ant farms. A lot of people don't
dialog: realize that worms make much better
dialog: pets than ants. They're quiet,
text: affectionate, they don't bite, and
dialog: they're super with the kids.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Aren't ants quiet, too?
text: Lloyd realizes she has a point.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
dialog: as affectionate. And if you cut an
dialog: ant's head off, it won't grow back.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: And best of all, worm farming is a
dialog: seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
dialog: industry. I wouldn't mind having a
dialog: piece of that pie, if you know what
dialog: I mean.
text: To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
text: at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
dialog: concerned about something.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the matter? Little tense about
dialog: the flight?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something like that.
text: Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It's really nothing to worry about,
dialog: Mary. Statistically, they say you're
dialog: more likely to get killed on the way
dialog: to the airport. You know, like in a
text: head-on crash, or something.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
text: eyes on the road.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
dialog: rivers out there.
text: Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
text: Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
text: and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
text: reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Here you go.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Keep it. It was my pleasure.
text: For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
text: makes her more lovely than ever.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
dialog: pass out. You'll be there before you
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thanks Lloyd.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And good luck with your worms.
dialog: 7.
text: Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
text: followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
text: ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.
text: Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo, LOVESICK. For a
text: moment he doesn't even have the energy to turn the key. He
text: just drops his head against the steering wheel, DEVASTATED.
text: There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks up to see a POLICE
text: OFFICER standing there.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Come on, move it, you're in a red
dialog: zone.
text: Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
text: travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
text: focused straight ahead.
text: She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
text: an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.
speaker_heading: ARMANI SUIT
dialog: She's gonna leave the briefcase at
dialog: the foot of the escalator. You make
text: the pick-up.
speaker_heading: PLAID SPORTCOAT
dialog: Piece of cake.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
speaker_heading: window and SEES MARY
text: WALKING ALONG.
text: When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
text: She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
text: her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
text: turns to see a car irectly behind him.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to car's driver)
dialog: Drive around me, you pinhead!
text: When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
text: that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
text: THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.
dialog: 8.
text: He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
text: starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
text: Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
text: dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL
text: The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
text: approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
text: for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
text: THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
text: each other, dumbstruck.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE
text: Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
text: the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
dialog: of numbers.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Damn!
text: QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
text: watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
text: FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
text: when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.
text: HIS POV - his limo is being towed away under the supervision
dialog: of the Police Officer.
text: He takes off after it, but to no avail.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You can't do this! I'll lose my job!
text: As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
text: fingers through his hair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON
text: We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
text: dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
text: and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
text: briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
text: They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.
dialog: 9.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
text: and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
scene_heading: They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE
speaker_heading: MENTAL).
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Who the hell do you figure this guy's
dialog: working for?
speaker_heading: SHAY
dialog: I don't know, but we'd better find
dialog: out...
text: Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.
speaker_heading: SHAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your ulcer?
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: It ain't gonna kill me.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR
text: Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently
text: toward the door of their apartment.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
text: Lloyd and Harry ENTER and pass each other quietly as they
text: both plunk down in their favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still
text: has the briefcase in his lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,
text: tweets hello, but the two guys just sit there SILENTLY.
text: The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The
text: carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a
text: miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
text: and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
text: with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I got fired again.
text: Lloyd shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
dialog: let's face it, you are one pathetic
dialog: loser. No offense.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: None taken. Were you shitcanned,
dialog: too?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Of course not.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I quit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why'd you quit?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why didn't you wait and see if your
dialog: suspicions were well-founded?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Winners control their own destiny,
dialog: Har.
text: Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know, the thing that really chaps
dialog: my ass is that I just spent my life
text: savings turning my van into a poodle.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The alarm alone cost me two hundred.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Big deal. That car's an old bomb
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you talking about? It's
text: only six years old.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's forty-two in dog years.
text: They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry
text: notices the briefcase.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's with the briefcase?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It's a love memento.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: The most beautiful woman alive. Her
dialog: name was Mary. I drove her to the
text: airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran
text: high, breasts heaved. She left this
text: case in the terminal and flew to
dialog: Aspen and out of my life. End of
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's in it?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: DO you really expect me to go snooping
dialog: around in someone else's private
dialog: property?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (beat)
text: It's locked.
text: They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a
text: LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK.
text: The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to
dialog: the
scene_heading: PEEPHOLE.
text: HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental
text: are standing at the door.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: (WHISPERING to Harry)
dialog: Friend or foe?
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: We don't have any friends.
text: Harry is still squinting out the peephole.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can't recognize them. Could be student
dialog: loan thugs again, or the IRS, or
dialog: maybe somebody pissed off about that
dialog: case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced
dialog: a check on.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little
dialog: swindlers gave me Peanut Butter
dialog: Praline.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, whoever they are, they look
text: serious. One of them's even wearing
dialog: plaid.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (cringing)
dialog: That's a hostile pattern. I say we
dialog: bail and get down to unemployment.
text: Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the
text: window and down the fire escape.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building
text: and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out.
text: Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE
scene_heading: HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.
scene_heading: INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE -
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
text: STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.
speaker_heading: GRABNER
dialog: Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that
dialog: neither I nor the unemployment
dialog: epartment of the state of Rhose Island
dialog: can do anything for you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've run out of chances. You're
dialog: unemployable. Remember last year?
dialog: Middle of winter I busted my butt to
scene_heading: GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE-
dialog: fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Blew it? For your information, we
dialog: only missed three days in two months.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, and that was because of a
dialog: blizzard
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: GRABNER
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!
text: Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find
dialog: something else for us. How about
dialog: another crack at that Suicide Hotline?
text: Grabner jumps up.
speaker_heading: GRABNER
dialog: OUT!!!!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRY &amp; LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
text: J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen
text: cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom.
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: The briefcase ain't here. He must've
dialog: taken it with him.
speaker_heading: J.P. SHAY
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well he's gotta come home sometime.
text: Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage.
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Maybe we should leave him a little
dialog: message to let 'em know we're playing
dialog: hardball.
text: Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around
text: the bird, who SCREECHES IN
speaker_heading: TERROR.
speaker_heading: MENTAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (a la Tweety Bird)
dialog: I taut I taw a puddy cat.
text: Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone-
text: chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MENTAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (still Tweety)
dialog: I did, I did...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd
text: and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building
dialog: entrance.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Give me what's left of our dough.
dialog: I'll go to the corner and buy a few
dialog: necessities.
text: Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night
dialog: Train?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
text: Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
text: He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
text: removes a quarter.
text: He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
text: that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
text: He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
text: and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET
scene_heading: STILL INSIDE.
text: Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
text: his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN
text: struggles by using a WALKER.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Excuse me, little old lady, do you
dialog: have change for a dollar?
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well could you do me a favor and
dialog: guard this while I go break a dollar?
dialog: My wallet's locked in this machine.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY LADY
dialog: Of course, young man...
text: Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as
text: Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.
text: Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER,
text: AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he
dialog: sees that
text: SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up

scene_heading: INT. LLOYD &amp; HARRY'S APARTMENT
text: The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the
text: couch, looking almost comatose.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where's the booze?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma
dialog: Walton. She got my wallet, too.
text: Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, man, cheer up. We've been
dialog: own before. I'm sure we'll land on
dialog: our heads somewhere.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet
dialog: Petey he's... he's dead.
text: Lloyd looks touched by this.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: His head fell off.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: His head fell off?
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, he was pretty old.
text: Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: I don't suppose he had a warranty...?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nah, I bought him used.
text: As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's it! I've had it with this
dialog: ump! We don't have food, we don't
dialog: have jobs, our pets' heads are falling
dialog: off, we're surrounded by roving gangs
dialog: of larcenous old
dialog: LADIES...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, calm down.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No I won't calm down.
text: Lloyd flops down in a chair.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are we doing here
dialog: anyway, Harry? We've got to get out
dialog: of this town.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, and go where?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'll tell you where: someplace warm,
dialog: a place where the beer flows like
dialog: wine, where beautiful women
dialog: instinctively flock like the salmon
dialog: of Capistrano.
speaker_heading: (dramatic PAUSE)
dialog: I'm talking about Aspen.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Aspen?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's right, Aspen.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't know, Lloyd, the French are
dialog: assholes.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Let me ask you something: do you
dialog: want to end up like Petey dead in
text: some flea-ridden apartment, face-
text: down on a Dear Abby column, with a
text: soggy sunflower seed pressed against
dialog: your beak? Or do you want to enjoy
dialog: your life?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's
dialog: eath be in vain. Don't you see what
dialog: he was saying? Spread your wings,
dialog: man. he was saying? Spread your wings,
dialog: man. Fly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What are you talking about, Lloyd?
text: His head fell off.
dialog: (dawning realization)
dialog: Wait a second, I know what you're up
dialog: to. You just wanna go to Aspen so
dialog: you can find that girl who lost her
dialog: briefcase and you need me to drive
dialog: you there.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's bullshit. I'll drive.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And what's so wrong about going
dialog: someplace where we know someone who
dialog: can plug us into the social pipeline?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (torn)
dialog: I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should
dialog: stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep
dialog: saving money for the worm store. I'm
dialog: getting a little sick and tired of
dialog: always running from creditors.
text: Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry
dialog: cityscape.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You know what I'm sick and tired of,
dialog: Harry? I'm sick and tired of having
dialog: to eek my way through life. I'm sick
dialog: and tired of being a nobody.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But most of all, I'm sick and tired
dialog: of having nobody.
text: There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then
text: Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: On the other hand, maybe you're right,
dialog: Harry. Maybe we should stay here and
dialog: try our luck in bankruptcy court.

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well, we're finally doing it. Do you

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Been run out of town?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: Taken a trip.
text: Harry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches,
dialog: curious.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Why'd you do that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Take your seatbelt off.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Because we just cleared the danger
dialog: zone.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety
dialog: percent of all accidents happen within
dialog: five miles of home. We've already
dialog: traveled 6.3 miles.
text: LLOYD THINKS ABOUT THIS. THEN:
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well what about the people who live
dialog: around here? What if we got into an
dialog: accident with one of them?
dialog: 20.
text: Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back
text: on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where'd you get those?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Bought 'em when we filled up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer
dialog: on all expenditures. We're on a tight
dialog: budget, remember?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This didn't come out of our travel
dialog: fund. I was able to scrape up twenty-
dialog: five bucks before we left. You know,
dialog: so we could live in style.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where'd you get twenty-five extra
dialog: bucks?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You mean the blind kid?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's right.
text: Lloyd looks out the window guiltily.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What did you sell him, Lloyd?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Just some odds and ends.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Specifically?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of
dialog: marbles, Petey, three comic books a
dialog: second, are you telling me you sold
dialog: my dead bird to a blind kid? Well
dialog: who else was I gonna sell it to?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: OUT:
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me, mister. Is there something

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'll give you three-to-one odds.
dialog: That's three feedbags if you win,

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I
dialog: already told you, I don't gamble.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay, five-to-one I can get you

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sorry, pal, no way.
speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

dialog: Anything else before I leave the

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Actually, this chocolate milk isn't

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: There. Now you don't need one.
text: The guys watch her stomp away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID-

text: KNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You spilled the salt. That's bad
dialog: luck. We're driving across the country
dialog: and the last thing we need is bad
dialog: luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt
dialog: over your right shoulder.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Because that's good luck.
text: Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it

speaker_heading: YELP.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: What the fuck?!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Or was it the left shoulder?
text: They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his

speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Who's the dead man threw shit in my

text: The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's

scene_heading: SIXTY-NINE 'EM.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It was a terrible accident, Sir.
dialog: Believe me, I would never do anything

speaker_heading: BURLY FRIEND #1
dialog: Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass!

text: Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger.
speaker_heading: SEA BASS
dialog: You gonna eat that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Um... the thought had crossed my mind.
text: At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF
scene_heading: TOBACCO SPIT ONTO
scene_heading: THE HAMBURGER.
speaker_heading: SEA BASS
dialog: Still want it?
text: Harry stares at the burger non-commitally.
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like

speaker_heading: SEA BASS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What I'm trying to say is, my friend
dialog: and I would like to buy you guys a

dialog: hatchet.
text: Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the
text: Truckers seem to like the idea.
speaker_heading: SEA BASS
dialog: Make it four boiler-makers.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Whatever you want, sir. I'll have
dialog: the waitress send them over. Oh, and
dialog: fellas hope to see you again down
dialog: the road.
text: Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lloyd, what are you doing? You know
dialog: we can't afford to buy them drinks.
text: Lloyd hands the Cashier their check.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered
dialog: to pick up our check. They said just
dialog: add this to their tab.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Sea Bass said that?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well, if that guy at the table over
dialog: there is Sea Bass...
text: He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass
text: NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING
text: TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...
dialog: 28.
text: Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy
text: bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, and put these on there, too.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: You got it.

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I hope we never have to.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Don't worry. That fish-head is

dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I hope so.
text: Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a
dialog: whiz.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now.
dialog: What if they figure out we went the
dialog: other way. They'll be on us in no
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But I gotta go. What am I supposed
dialog: to do?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hold it.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well... just take a whiz in an empty
dialog: beer bottle. There's a couple on the
text: floor in the back seat.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping
dialog: now. We could get killed.
text: Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back
text: seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: The bottle's almost full and I'm
text: still going.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well stop going.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I can't stop once I already started,
dialog: you know that. Quick, get me another

text: Harry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way
text: in the back seat for an empty.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, be careful! You almost went

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, I haven't gone all day.
text: Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER:
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: Pull over!
text: They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside
text: then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
speaker_heading: PULL OVER!
text: Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at
dialog: the Trooper.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for
dialog: noticing!

dialog: Lloyd.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, what is this, the fashion
dialog: police?
text: The Cop turns on his SIREN.
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER

dialog: Have you boys been doing a little

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, sir.

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: Then what's that?
text: He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, that's nothing, sir.
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: Do you know it's against the law to
text: rive with an open alcohol container
dialog: in this state?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But, your honor, he's telling the
dialog: truth. It's not beer.
text: The officer smirks.
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: Is that right?
text: The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He
text: inspects the beer label, then MOVES
text: THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep
dialog: your mouth shut if you knew what was
dialog: good for you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: YOU WOULD, TOO...
text: Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: (pained)
dialog: Get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: LLOYD'S FANTASY:
text: Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered
text: chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue
text: and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out
text: of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary
text: opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks
text: into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she
text: slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...
text: Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her,
text: she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances
text: over her shoulder at him.
text: CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY

scene_heading: MMMM... TINGLY...
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: How's the other side?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Nothing. Nothing at all.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?
text: ON MARY - her hair is slicked back, making her look better
text: than ever. As the CAMERA PANS DOWN toward her breasts, we
text: are surprised to see not breasts but a SET OF HEADLIGHTS
text: SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER CHEST AREA. The headlights FLASH ONCE.
text: Then TWICE.
text: ON LLOYD - he blinks, confused at what's happening.
text: JUMP CUT TO - an eighteen-wheeler is ROARING RIGHT TOWARD
text: THE MUTT CUTTS VAN on the highway. Lloyd quickly veers back

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON HOTEL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yep, this sure is the life. Cold
text: beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink
dialog: sheets... You know, there's only one
dialog: thing that could make this moment
dialog: any better.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: If you had a nice set of knockers.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's two things, Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Right now I'd settle for one.
text: Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and
text: looks around at the romantic decor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't know, Lloyd, these places
dialog: just don't do it for me. Brings back
dialog: too many memories.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What happened, Harry? Some little
dialog: filly break your heart?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.
dialog: We stayed at a place like this once
dialog: No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Felcher? You mean the babe who worked
dialog: for the tractor company?

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I called her up and she gave me some

speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: I don't like this one goddamn bit,

dialog: this shit. Now I don't know what the

text: Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip.
text: The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...
text: Mental puts the phone down and motions the Anxious Man closer
text: to the booth. The Man moves forward a few inches. Mental
text: motions him even closer. When he's about a foot away, Mental
text: punches his hand through the glass of the booth and knocks
text: the Anxious Man out cold. Then
text: Mental picks up the phone again.
speaker_heading: MENTAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, boss. You were saying...?
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Look, Mental, just find out what
dialog: they're up to. I want to know who

speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Don't worry. I'm on it.
text: Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's
text: not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van.
text: He's joined by J.P. Shay.
text: As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW
text: GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see
text: a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step
text: forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental
text: and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.
speaker_heading: SHAY
dialog: What the fuck...?
text: Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he
text: touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a
text: siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING.
text: Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Where's the goddamn dog?

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It just doesn't make any sense. I
dialog: left the money exactly where they

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Actually, it makes a great deal of

speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Now, Helen, we've been through this

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think this guy's in trouble. Why

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hmmm, not bad...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, more tingly than hot.

speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Have some water. It'll help.
text: Lloyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start

speaker_heading: MENTAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just

scene_heading: INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That really wasn't very polite of

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you.
dialog: Perhaps it's about time you brushed

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (humbled)
dialog: You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'
speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Feeling any better, boys?

speaker_heading: MENTAL (CONT'D)
dialog: So tell me, why you fellas headed to
dialog: Aspen? Vacation?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: More like re-location.
text: Mental starts toward the burger but stops again.
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Doesn't look like you packed much.
dialog: All I saw was a couple bags... and

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: MENTAL
dialog: Talk about being in the wrong place
dialog: at the wrong time...
text: Lloyd and Harry share a confused look. Mental shakes his
text: head and BITES INTO HIS BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost
text: immediately, his happy demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF
text: HORROR. His FACE TURNS RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS
speaker_heading: TO THE

text: The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, you okay, man? It was just a

speaker_heading: MENTAL
speaker_heading: (STRAINED WHISPER)
dialog: My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...

text: with his foot.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.
text: Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.
scene_heading: EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
text: Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT
text: ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he
text: sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lloyd comes around the corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY
text: ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room.
text: When he gets it to the door, he struggles to lift the engine
text: on it's side, finally managing to slip the key into the lock.
scene_heading: EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
text: Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee
text: pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs
text: out. This seems to wake Harry up.
text: The Athletic Beauty smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and
text: starts to fill her jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to
text: brush his hair into place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods
text: to the skis on her roof-rack.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Skis, huh?
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Great.
text: She continues to pump gas.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: They yours?
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Uh-huh..
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Both of 'em?
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Um, yeah.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Cool.
text: THE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T
text: NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS
text: like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.
dialog: 56.
text: Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He
text: immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump
text: as she smiles to herself.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM
text: Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read
text: the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one
text: that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993,
dialog: 2:15
text: A.M. SHARP.
text: He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.
text: CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8.
text: ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 2:15.
text: Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the
text: BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd
text: quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet
text: bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
text: approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see
text: a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely
text: hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds
text: his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a
text: SIGH OF RELIEF.
text: All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE
text: STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS.
dialog: HIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass.
speaker_heading: SEA BASS
dialog: Well, well, well, if it ain't my old
dialog: friend.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: And right on time...
text: As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
text: The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has
text: sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side-
dialog: view mirror.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (re: suitcases in
dialog: back seat)
dialog: That's a lot of luggage for a little
dialog: vacation.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've
dialog: got to get away from my boyfriend.
dialog: He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid
dialog: accident-prone guys.
text: Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on
text: SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS
text: HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN
text: QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (holding out mirror)
dialog: Here, this is a little loose.
text: She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Allow me...
text: He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.
text: The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match
text: to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes
text: rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING
text: BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen
dialog: we can meet up... you know, for hot
dialog: chocolate or something.
text: She looks him over and smiles.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Why not? You seem pretty harmless.
dialog: I'll give you my number. Just let me
dialog: find a pen.
text: As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE
text: SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!
text: He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,
text: but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still
text: searching for a pen.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I have one here somewhere...
text: Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
dialog: This only helps to fan them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Look, why don't you just tell it to
dialog: me, I've got a good memory.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Are you sure you won't forget?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Positive please hurry.
text: He begins hopping around violently.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Is something wrong?
text: Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
text: screaming.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, my number is 652-2553.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, wait a second, that's my old
dialog: number. It's so funny how your mind
dialog: god sakes, give me the damn number!
text: She's taken aback by this outburst.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy
dialog: you can just forget it!
text: She throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM
text: Sea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyd's neck as he
text: slides him up the wall of the toilet stall.
speaker_heading: SEA BASS
dialog: First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm
dialog: gonna kill you. Any last request?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Um, yeah could you do it the other
dialog: way around?
dialog: 59.
text: Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps
text: back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a
text: green color to Lloyd's face.
text: ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED
text: Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his
text: desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA
text: BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the
dialog: toilet,
text: EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.
text: Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice
text: LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND
text: SEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE.
text: Harry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he
text: lets out an admonishing
speaker_heading: WHISTLE.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You've got some serious explaining
dialog: to o, young man.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
text: CLOSE UP - of Harry's BURNT SHOE with the toes sticking out
text: on the accelerator.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Look, Harry, I told you what happened,
dialog: now drop it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to
dialog: mention another word about you being
text: in a bathroom stall with a six-foot,
text: five-inch trucker with his pants
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's a low blow, man.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not at that height it's not.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Listen, bud, if you're trying to
dialog: imply that I'm that thought look,
dialog: we're almost in Colorado.
dialog: 60.
text: LLOYD SQUINTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. A SIGN UP AHEAD SAYS:
scene_heading: LAST EXIT IN NEBRASKA -
scene_heading: COLORADO STATE LINE - 3 MILES.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think it's about time we pull over
dialog: and change seats. I've been driving
dialog: for nine straight hours I don't
dialog: have the energy to start a new state.
text: Lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON A SIGN - it reads WELCOME TO COLORADO, HOME OF THE
text: ROCKY MOUNTAINS. PAN DOWN to reveal a number of POLICEMEN
text: stopping and checking cars as they cross the border. A
text: HELICOPTER lands on the side of the road and Detective Dale
text: hops out. He hurries to the COP in charge.
speaker_heading: DT. DALE
dialog: Any sign of them yet?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: No, but we're expecting them shortly.
text: A motorist said he spotted a pooch
dialog: about thirty miles back headed this
dialog: way.
text: Detective Dale nods, satisfied.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MINI MART - NIGHT
text: ESTABLISHING SHOT of a mini mart.
scene_heading: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
text: The door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos
text: and a soda. He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a
text: Beef Jerky out of his back pocket.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky...
text: When he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already
text: fast asleep in the passenger seat. Lloyd shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Boy, some guys just weren't cut out
dialog: for life on the road.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
text: Lloyd starts the engine and pulls out of the parking lot to
text: the nearby freeway entrance. As he enters the on-ramp, we
text: ZOOM IN on a sign that says: ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly
text: headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION THEY JUST CAME FROM!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - SUNNY MORNING
text: It's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in
text: the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a
text: bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: How long have I been out?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'd say a good five hours, anyway.
text: Harry yawns and stretches.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Great. We must be getting real close,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Should be. I've been averaging about
dialog: ninety miles an hour all night.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Good man.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Boy, I'll tell you, this is one
dialog: angerous highway. You wouldn't believe
dialog: all the road pizza two dead ogs, a
text: couple of rabbits, a snake and some
dialog: big thing I couldn't even recognize.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's awful. Did you see them get
dialog: hit or were they already lying there?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I hit 'em.
text: Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains
dialog: to be a little rockier than this.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I was thinking the same thing. That
dialog: John Denver's some full of shit,
dialog: huh?
text: They both stare out the window.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: I must say, Des Moines sure is a
dialog: pretty little town.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, it really is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait a minute when did you visit
dialog: Des Moines?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Last night. We drove through it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you talking about? You were
dialog: snoring like a baby when we went
dialog: through Des Moines.
text: Lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then SNAPS HIS FINGERS
text: in Harry's face.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (sing-song)
dialog: Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and
dialog: shine.
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: You were the one who was asleep,
dialog: numbskull. Here, take a sip of coffee. You're delirious.
text: A confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing
text: terrain. Then something starts to awn on him. Slowly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't
text: the sun rise in the east and set in
dialog: the west?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: In our country it does, yes.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Then perchance you can explain to me
dialog: why the sun is in our face at 7:30
dialog: in the morning when we're heading
dialog: west.
text: Lloyd thinks about this and then looks SICKENED.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCKSTOP - MORNING
text: The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry
text: is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can
dialog: make a mistake.
text: But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, man, pull yourself together.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know, I got half a mind to just
dialog: jump on the bus to Europe and say
dialog: goodbye to your ugly mug forever.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (rolls his eyes)
dialog: You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh yeah? Why not?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You don't have a passport.
text: Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, stop being a baby about
dialog: this. Okay, so we back-tracked a
dialog: tad.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a
dialog: sixth of the way across the country
dialog: in the wrong direction. Now we don't
dialog: have enough money to get to Aspen,
dialog: we on't have enough money to get
dialog: home, we don't have enough to eat,
dialog: we don't have enough to sleep!
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well it doesn't do any good having
dialog: you sitting there on your butt whining
dialog: about it. If we're gonna get out of
dialog: this hole, we're gonna have to dig
dialog: ourselves out.
text: Harry thinks about this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know, you're absolutely right,
dialog: Lloyd.
text: He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward
dialog: the highway.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Home. I'm walking home.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You can't be serious.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Why not? We're probably only five
text: miles away.
text: Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)
dialog: Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you
dialog: never screwed up.
text: Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his
text: friend. He seems completely rained.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, man... I'm sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I never should have let you talk me
dialog: into this in the first place. You've
dialog: got a good reason to goo a beautiful
dialog: girl's waiting for you. But let's
dialog: face it, Lloyd, there's nothing
dialog: waiting for me in Aspen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's nothing waiting for me
dialog: anywhere.
dialog: 65.
text: Lloyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks
text: away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car,
text: causing it to BARK.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out
text: unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping
text: at his clothes.
text: A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG OF GARBAGE out the
text: window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S
text: FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek (like the Indian
text: in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of garbage. We see
text: it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.
text: Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking
text: vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls
text: down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Got room for one more, if you still
dialog: want to go to Aspen.
text: Harry looks the hearse over.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where'd you find this baby?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Used car dealer. I traded the van
dialog: for it. Plus I got the guy to throw
dialog: in fifty bucks for gas money.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on, man, what do you say? We
dialog: still partners?
scene_heading: HARRY SMILES AND WE
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COLORADO STATE LINE - DAY
text: An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the
text: Colorado border with several other officers.
speaker_heading: DT. DALE
dialog: It doesn't make sense. They should've
dialog: been here hours ago.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Maybe they're smarter than we thought.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DT. DALE
dialog: How smart can they be? They're riving
dialog: a goddamn dog!
text: Another COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: We just got a report that they were
dialog: spotted about two hours ago heading
text: east near Des Moines on I-80.
speaker_heading: DT. DALE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred
dialog: miles from here!
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Guess they got wind of our welcoming
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: DT. DALE
dialog: We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.
text: Dt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow.
text: As the officers climb into their cars, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE - DAY
text: Lloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Tell me something, Harry. Would you
dialog: really have kept going home if I
dialog: hadn't come back to get you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well let me put it this way, Lloyd:
dialog: Do you remember when we were Cub
dialog: Scouts and we got lost in the woods
dialog: uring that blizzard? We huddled
dialog: together all night, and we made an
dialog: oath that if we ever got out of there
dialog: alive we'd never ever leave each
dialog: other's side again. Do you remember
dialog: that?
dialog: Lloyd thinks hard about this.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: We were never Cub Scouts.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Exactly.
text: Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite
text: direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry
text: glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN
text: in the rear of the vehicle.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell is this? There's a
dialog: coffin in the back!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Relax, it's empty.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't give a shit. I'm not driving
dialog: anywhere with a casket. You know I'm
dialog: superstitious calm down. We'll dump
dialog: it off first chance we get.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse.
text: Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is
text: a CADILLAC.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY
text: (This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and
text: a WOMAN are arguing.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I married a cheapskate.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Shut your trap, Gerdie.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be
dialog: able to show my face again.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I knew something good would come out
dialog: of this.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: We could have given him a more
text: ignified burial.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember
dialog: what he got us for our twenty-fifth?
dialog: A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm
dialog: gonna spend a load to get him planted.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of
dialog: them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the
scene_heading: ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY
text: FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY SUPERMARKET - DAY
text: Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the
text: market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys
text: get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back.
text: Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER
scene_heading: AND WIPE THEIR HANDS
speaker_heading: OFF.
text: ON THE LEAD CAR OF THE PROCESSION - The Woman's jaw is
text: practically on the floor.
speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Isn't this wonderful? What more could
dialog: a couple of single guys like us ask
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How about food and shelter?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're so materialistic.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why don't we get down to business
text: and eliver the briefcase to Mary.
dialog: Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in
dialog: for tea and a strumpet or two?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes
dialog: the lovely young lady reside?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Um... good question.
text: Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone
text: booth next to them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well what's her last name? We'll
dialog: look it up in the phone book.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I
dialog: caught that either.
text: Harry's concern grows.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about the briefcase, Lloyd?
dialog: There must've been a name on it,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: Come to think of it, there is. It's
text: engraved right into the leather.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Samsonite spelled just like it
dialog: sounds.
dialog: 70.
text: Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly
text: HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE - NIGHT
text: The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a
text: picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the
text: front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse.
text: They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and
text: sipping it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Any soup left?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: A little. Shall we share it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Please.
text: Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it
text: into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a
text: few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Mmmm mmmm good...
text: Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and
text: leans toward him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, you got something stuck in your
text: front teeth.
text: Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hmmm... looks like an old piece of
dialog: Beef Jerky.
scene_heading: HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wanna split it?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're pathetic. Get your own.
text: Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it.
text: Another gust of wind swirls around them.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Roll up your window.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: It is rolled up.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Then I guess the damn anti-cold system
dialog: isn't working. You really should get
dialog: it fixed if we're gonna live here
dialog: all winter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What anti-cold system?
text: Lloyd points to the dash.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Right here the A/C button. I put it
dialog: on full blast about an hour ago and,
text: if anything, the car's getting colder.
text: Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted.
text: He opens the car door and starts to climb out.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you going out there for?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: To warm up.
scene_heading: EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT
text: Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms
text: crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What are you worrying about now?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm worried about how you're gonna
dialog: survive the pummeling I'm about to
dialog: give you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Huh?
text: Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the
text: other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd
text: manages to evade his grasp.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Harry, calm down! You're acting like

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Get over here and take your medicine,
dialog: Lloyd!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.
dialog: I'm a Christian Scientist!

speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Something I should've done a long
dialog: time ago. This stupid thing has been
dialog: the root of our problems all along.
text: Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Don't do anything foolish, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Foolish? This is the most sensible
dialog: thing I've done in years. I'm gonna
dialog: toss this goddamn curse right into
dialog: that river.
text: Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're making a big mistake, Harry!
dialog: I'll never forgive you for this!
text: Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose
dialog: of the briefcase.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get
dialog: better, I promise! In fact, I think
text: I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's
dialog: yours, Harry, all yours!
text: Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're bluffing.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No I'm not, man look.
text: Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints
dialog: at it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's a filling, you liar!
text: Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs,
text: but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase
text: GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
text: in the snow, rolling over and over.
text: Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on
scene_heading: top and CLASPS HIS HANDS
scene_heading: AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to have a life! A miserable
dialog: one, but a life, nonetheless!
text: Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S.
text: behind his friend.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
speaker_heading: (CHOKED VOICE)
dialog: Harry, look!
text: Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd
dialog: as we see
text: THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND,
text: REVEALING STACKS AND
text: STACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - NIGHT
text: Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching
text: the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny
text: lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a
dialog: few bucks just a small loan from
text: the briefcase, and we check into a
dialog: cheap motel.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sounds good.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: And we'll keep track of the money we
dialog: spend with IOUs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We'll be meticulous right down to
dialog: the last penny.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That way, whatever we borrow we can
dialog: pay back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Absolutely. We're good for it.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You know, as soon as we get jobs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It'll come right out of our first
dialog: paycheck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
text: A tuxedoed Bell Captain, BARNARD, is showing the guys around
text: an ENORMOUS AND LUXURIOUS SUITE. The place is big enough to
text: throw a touchdown bomb in.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: ...This is the Hotel Danbury's
dialog: Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's
dialog: normally reserved for royalty,
dialog: visiting dignitaries, and illustrious
dialog: stars of stage and take it.
text: The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.
speaker_heading: BARNARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Very good, sir. Are there any bags
dialog: you'd like sent up?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our
dialog: own chicks.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: (peevish)
dialog: I wasn't talking about ladies.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up.
dialog: What are their names?
dialog: Barnard SIGHS.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: Sir, I meant your luggage.
text: Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Tell you what you can send up, my
dialog: friend how about some chow?
text: The Bell Captain nods.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: I'll bring you a menu.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Don't bother. Just order us one of
dialog: everything.
text: At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: One of everything? Lloyd...
text: Lloyd looks guilty.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Make that two of everything.
text: Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR
text: BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in
text: Barnard's top pocket.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: And here you go, Barney. You keep us
dialog: happy, we'll keep you happy.
text: The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: Yes, sir!
text: He bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the
text: briefcase and inserts a SMALL PIECE
text: OF PAPER.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: Our first IOU. Signed and dated.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mary? You awake?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: COME IN...
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the French
text: windows when Helen ENTERS.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I brought you some tea. I thought it
dialog: might help you relax.
text: Mary smiles.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thank you.
text: She takes a mug, sips, and pulls back.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yech! What's in this, whiskey?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Uh, sorry... that one's mine.
text: Helen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Feeling any better, honey?
text: Mary can't take her eyes from the window.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Just knowing that Melvin's out there,
dialog: being held by God knows who...
dialog: (fighting back tears)
dialog: It's all my fault. I should've been
dialog: there.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Bullshit. You can't blame yourself
dialog: for this. If you'd been there they
dialog: would've taken you, too.
text: Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Maybe we should just pay them the
dialog: money again and get this thing over
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Now Mary, everything that can be
dialog: done is being done. You've got to
dialog: stop torturing yourself.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What am I supposed to do? Go about
dialog: my life as if everything were fine?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That's exactly what you should do.
dialog: Get the hell out more, go skiing,
dialog: socialize. Don't you see, honey? We
dialog: can't let on that anything is wrong.
dialog: If the press or authorities get wind
dialog: of this, the kidnappers might panic.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY
text: The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse.
text: Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd
text: get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur
text: boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors
text: everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and
text: then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT
text: The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies.
text: Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the
text: balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the
text: mountain view.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh god, it's really true. Last night
dialog: I thought I might've been dreaming.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked
dialog: the big time.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And it was so simple. All it took
dialog: was somebody else's money.
text: Harry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty
dialog: puff, and
speaker_heading: EXHALES.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, Lloyd, I think you might've
dialog: gone a little overboard with the
dialog: spending today.
text: He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What's the big deal? We're gonna pay
dialog: it all back anyway, right?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sure, but do you really think you
dialog: needed to buy those two surfboards?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Surfboards? I thought those were
text: beginner's skis.
text: This suddenly makes sense to Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ahhh. I was wondering why you had
text: those bindings put on them.
text: Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Where'd this come from?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: I bought it.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What for?
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I like the feel of it against my
dialog: skin...
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: ...I mean, you know, when a woman's
dialog: wearing it.
text: Lloyd inspects it more closely.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Harry, how many women do you know
dialog: who wear a size XXL?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.
dialog: I'm supposed to have a few
dialog: eccentricities.
text: There's a KNOCK on the door.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Enter, parlez vous!
text: The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket
text: and a newspaper under his arm.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: I brought you your newspaper and
dialog: some champagne, gentlemen.
dialog: Unfortunately, we didn't seem to
dialog: have the, um, label you requested.
text: Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: All out of Boone's Farm, huh?
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: You have a rapier wit, sir. I took
dialog: the liberty of bringing a comparable
dialog: substitute: Dom Perignon.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?
text: Lloyd smiles and over tips him.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: Thank you so much, sir.
text: He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads
dialog: for the door.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, one more thing: You can dispense
dialog: with the 'sir' crap. Let's face it,
dialog: Barney, we're all from the same mold.
dialog: (winks)
dialog: We just have a little more dough
dialog: than you right now.
text: Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He
text: picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,
text: sending out a resonant RING.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Cocktail hour has commenced!
text: He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins
text: thumbing through the newspaper.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, later on what do you say we...?
text: He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something
text: he's found in the paper.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Lloyd... you okay?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (dumbstruck)
dialog: Harry, it's her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: Mary with the briefcase. This is
dialog: her...
text: He shoves the newspaper at Harry.
text: CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST

scene_heading: MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:
dialog: 81.
text: -The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.
text: -Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The
text: ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both
text: guys' hair in curlers.
text: -Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.
text: Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck
text: as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his
text: fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd
text: LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in
text: his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.
text: -We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to
text: the floor to reveal a PILE OF
scene_heading: NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.
text: -Then a shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN
text: OVER to Lloyd's bare feet he has toe nails like Howard
text: Hughes. Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety
text: goggles tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric
dialog: sander.
text: -Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a
text: massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred
text: dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and
text: WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.
text: -Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with
text: her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.
text: -The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out
text: of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He
text: couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,
text: but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.
text: -Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman
text: looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.
text: -This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE
text: TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks
text: sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.
text: PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive

scene_heading: EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT
text: Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
text: the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and
text: Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue
text: tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
text: (THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse
text: stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Thanks for the lift, Barney.
scene_heading: INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY
text: Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when
text: Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them
dialog: the once over.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
dialog: five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.
text: Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd
text: takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels
text: off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This should cover a couple plates.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if
dialog: we want seconds?
text: Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Put us down for four plates, my good
dialog: man.
text: They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate
text: J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.
speaker_heading: J.P. SHAY
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.
text: BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through
text: the affluent crowd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'm getting nervous, Harry.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: relax, Lloyd. These people are just
dialog: like you and me.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What are you talking about? They're
dialog: educated, well-bred, charming, and
dialog: sophisticated.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So what? We can be sophistica holy
dialog: shit, would you look at the fun bags
text: on that hose hound.
text: He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.
text: Lloyd rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm
dialog: already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't
dialog: like me?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, let's just go saddle up to the
text: bar and down a couple bowls of
dialog: loudmouth soup. A little booze'll
dialog: bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
dialog: over-confidence.
text: The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they
text: make their way to the bar.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
speaker_heading: (to BARTENDER)
text: Two martinis, straight up.
text: As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL
text: RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then
text: walks away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut up, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah, well I know what you were gonna
dialog: say and I'm telling you to shut up
dialog: in advance.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How do you know what I was gonna
dialog: say?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I read you like a book.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, if you read me like a book
dialog: then what was I gonna say?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You were gonna say:
dialog: (in Harry's looped
speaker_heading: VOICE)
dialog: 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't
dialog: mind roasting my weenie in.'
text: Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: And I would say 'shut up', because
dialog: this is our chance to get in with
dialog: the rich and powerful and you don't
dialog: ingratiate yourself to the kind of
dialog: people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
dialog: Spanish Fly.
text: The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.
text: CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to
text: see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a
text: LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and
dialog: Elizabeth Swanson.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: If I could have your attention,
dialog: please...
text: The crowd QUIETS.
speaker_heading: ANDRE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to thank you all for coming
dialog: to this very special event. As you
scene_heading: KNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -
dialog: founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl
dialog: and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of
dialog: endangered species. Our
text: SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-
dialog: three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
dialog: on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight,
dialog: we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our
dialog: twenty-fourth.
dialog: 85.
text: The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the
dialog: podium.
speaker_heading: MR. SWANSON
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
dialog: Icelandic Snow Owl.
text: He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE
text: OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.
speaker_heading: MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
dialog: These magnificent specimens were
scene_heading: RESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-
dialog: year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they
dialog: constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on
dialog: the planet.
text: ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks
dialog: pale.
speaker_heading: MR. SWANSON
dialog: Here these lovely birds will be
dialog: allowed to breed in a natural but
dialog: protected habitat. And, God willing,
dialog: with your help and that of the
dialog: Society's, we will see these wonderful
text: creatures flourish once more.
text: More APPLAUSE.
speaker_heading: MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Again, thank you, and enjoy your
dialog: evening. Oh, and feel free to take a
dialog: closer look at our new friends here.
dialog: Enjoy.
text: The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns
text: back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Two more, please.
text: Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lloyd, I've never seen you this
dialog: uptight. You've gotta chill out.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I can't help it. This is a very
dialog: important night for me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Harry, have you ever wondered why
dialog: you and I never have long-term
dialog: girlfriends?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you talking about? I went
dialog: out with Fraida Felcher for two and
dialog: a half weeks.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That was a fluke.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The reason we never have long-term
dialog: girlfriends is because of one thing:
dialog: We're afraid of the C word.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's crazy. We live for the C word.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'm talking bout commitment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.
dialog: The first time I laid eyes on Mary
dialog: Swanson, I knew she was the one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Some things you feel in your heart,
dialog: other things you feel in your groin.
dialog: This girl makes me feel it all in
dialog: the heart.
text: Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.
text: HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE
scene_heading: OF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A
text: spectacular black cocktail dress.
text: Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit, there she is.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (checking her out)
dialog: Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.
dialog: She's an angel.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, what are you waiting for? Get
text: over there and talk to her.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: She's gonna think I'm some kind of
dialog: psycho when she realizes how far I
dialog: came just to see her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You have her briefcase she's gonna
dialog: be thrilled to see you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: And then what? She'll take it back
dialog: and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.
text: Harry thinks about this a moment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, man, you just drove two thousand
dialog: miles to see this girl. Don't quit
text: on the last fifty feet.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: Wait a second, I have an idea. You
dialog: go over and introduce yourself. That
dialog: way you can build me up so when I
dialog: come along I won't have to brag about
dialog: myself. Tell her I'm good-looking
dialog: and I'm rich and I have a rapist's
dialog: wit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I can't tell her you're good looking,
dialog: Lloyd she's got eyes.
text: Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Please Harry, I'm appealing to you
dialog: as one loser to another. Just build
dialog: me up and then give me a signal to
dialog: come over. Please.
dialog: Harry SIGHS.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All right. But you're gonna owe me a
dialog: big one for this.
text: Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES
text: Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice set of hooters you got there.
text: Mary turns to Harry, stunned.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: The owls. They're beautiful.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh. Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you a bird lover?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, I used to have a parakeet, but
dialog: my main area of expertise is canines
dialog: that's dogs to the layperson.
text: She smiles at this.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how
dialog: are you involved with them?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,
dialog: clipped them; I've even bred them.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really? Any unusual breeding?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But
dialog: one time we successfully mated a
dialog: Bulldog and a Shitzu.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really? That's weird.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.
dialog: (breaks out LAUGHING)
dialog: Just a little breeder joke.
dialog: 89.
text: She seems strangely charmed by this.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, the real reason I came over
dialog: is because I want to introduce you
dialog: to a friend of mine.
text: Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a
text: martini and looking a little sloshed.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mary, I don't believe I've met your
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Actually, we haven't been introduced
dialog: yet.
dialog: (holds out hand)
dialog: I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my
dialog: stepmother, Helen.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you
dialog: both.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.
dialog: I was hoping we'd get a chance to
dialog: meet.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: You were?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That tuxedo I love a man with a
text: sense of humor. So does Mary.
text: Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Really?
text: For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages
dialog: to snap out of it.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, about my friend you doing
dialog: anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because
dialog: I believe Mary's looking for somebody
dialog: to hit the slopes with. Whuh?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Helen, you're embarrassing me.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well you are, aren't you?
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So

dialog: available?
text: Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a
dialog: hopeful Lloyd.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend
dialog: your friends for one day. You and
dialog: Mary will have a ball.
text: Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Um... well... I don't know. You see, the
dialog: thing is... sure.
text: ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: How come you didn't call me over?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Relax, you're golden. I got you a
dialog: ate with her tomorrow.
text: Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's
text: SPEECHLESS.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Wha... you... I... it's...
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I love you, man. I love you!
text: Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making
text: a scene.
text: Lloyd steps back elated.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This calls for a toast!
text: He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to
dialog: open it.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gonna be my best man, Har, I
dialog: mean it. It was always between you
dialog: and my future wife's brother, but
dialog: you just earned a seat at the head
dialog: table, pal.
text: Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND
speaker_heading: ZIPS ACROSS
text: THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN
speaker_heading: WIDER-
text: EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!,
dialog: and a THUMP!
text: A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their

text: THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE
text: CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW
text: Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to
dialog: extinction.
text: Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking
text: champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: I think we've done enough hobnobbing,
dialog: Lloyd.
text: The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before

speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Don't be stupid. It's a message,

speaker_heading: J.P. SHAY
dialog: But how could anybody off a bird

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I, uh, thought while you were making

text: on the slopes.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You mean you're gonna go out in public
dialog: dressed in tights?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: These aren't tights. They're

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But you can see the outline of your
dialog: who-who.
text: Harry looks down at his crotch.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HARRY

scene_heading: EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, look... frost.

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Believe me, it was the right place.
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: I don't know, Har, maybe she just

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a minute...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It just occurred to me. She must've

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Of course! Why would she have you

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I knew there was an explanation. And

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That'll teach you to jump to

dialog: Anyway, since you have your night
dialog: all

speaker_heading: LLOYD

dialog: before you head out?

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: EX-LAX.

scene_heading: TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE-

scene_heading: EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and

speaker_heading: LLOYD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna ask you something flat out
dialog: and I want you to answer me honestly:
dialog: What do you think the chances are of
dialog: a girl like you and a guy like me
dialog: ending up together?
text: Mary is obviously thrown by this question.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I
dialog: mean we hardly --
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: --I asked you to be honest, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But Lloyd, I really can't --
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: --Come on, give it to me straight. I
dialog: rove a long way to see you, the least
dialog: you can do is level with me. What
dialog: are my chances?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not good.
speaker_heading: BEAT
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You mean not good, like one out of a
dialog: hundred?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'd say more like one out of a
dialog: million.
speaker_heading: BEAT
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (Duh)
dialog: So you're telling me there's a chance?
text: Just then, there's a KNOCK at the door. When Lloyd opens it,
text: he's face to face with Nicholas Andre.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Nicholas... what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: I've been looking for you, Mary.
dialog: I've got some interesting news about your husband.
text: Lloyd looks at MAry, devastated.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Husband?
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Aren't you two going to invite me
dialog: in?
text: Lloyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A
text: GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL DANBURY - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone CALL OUT:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: Hey!
text: Harry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You...? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE
text: Nicholas Andre has his gun pointed at a stunned Lloyd and
dialog: Mary.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Well at least you two got to say
dialog: your goodbyes.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Don't play dumb with me, asshole.
dialog: I'm the rightful ower of that
dialog: briefcase you've been carrying.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: Mary can't believe what's happening.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Nicholas, you... you motherfucker!
dialog: My family trusted you!
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want
dialog: you to know, my friend Harry and I
dialog: have every intention of reimbursing
dialog: you.
text: Andre looks alarmed. He motions Mary to the briefcase with
text: his gun.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Open that damn thing!
text: Mary opens the briefcase and a pile of WHITE, CRUMPLED-UP
text: BALLS OF PAPER fall out along with a few packets of hundreds.
speaker_heading: ANDRE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell's this? Where's all
dialog: the money?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's as good as money, sir. Those
dialog: are our IOUs. You can add them up
dialog: yourself. Every penny's accounted
dialog: for.
text: Andre looks like his head is about to BURST in anger.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: You're fucking dead!
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Now don't do anything hasty, man.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY
text: Harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the
dialog: Presidential Suite.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE
text: Harry ENTERS looking contrite and CALLS OUT:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta
dialog: talk, man. I have a serious confession
dialog: to make.
text: Harry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD.
text: HIS POV - Lloyd and Mary are lying on the bed, their arms
text: handcuffed to the bedpost.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh good, you found her. I'll just
dialog: leave you two kids alone.
text: Harry turns to go, but bumps into the MUZZLE OF ANDRE'S GUN.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Why don't you stay and join the party?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Harry is sitting beside Lloyd and Mary on the bed. Nicholas
text: Andre keeps his gun trained on them while he SPEAKS on the
dialog: phone:
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: ..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De
dialog: Janerio departing as soon as
dialog: possible...
text: ON THE BED - Harry and Lloyd can't look each other in the
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You mean you two know each other?
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (cutting)
dialog: Yeah, we used to be best friends.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Until he turned into a backstabber.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Me a backstabber? You got a lot of
dialog: nerve. I saw her first.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, I couldn't help it if she found
dialog: me irresistable.
text: Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But you knew how crazy I was about
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was
dialog: about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't
dialog: stop you, did it?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (waning righteousness)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me
dialog: the whole sordid story.
text: Lloyd can't muster a defense.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Look... I was gonna tell you about
dialog: that. It was gonna be mentioned at
dialog: the reading of my will. I swear, you
dialog: can ask my lawyer.
text: Harry glares at him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well I guess we both learned a little
dialog: something about each other, didn't
dialog: we?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as
dialog: good friends as we thought we were.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Guess not.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I mean, if one beautiful girl could
dialog: rip us apart like this, then it seems
dialog: our friendship isn't worth a damn.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe we should call it quits right
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just tell me where to sign, bud.
text: Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING
speaker_heading: COCKED.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Okay, which one of you losers wants
dialog: to die first?
text: The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I wouldn't pull that trigger if I
dialog: were you.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: Why not? It'll look like just another
dialog: Aspen love triangle. You caught the
text: two of them in bed, handcuffed them
dialog: to the post, murdered them, and killed
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (smug)
dialog: Except you're forgetting one minor
dialog: etail.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: What's that?
text: Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If you kill us, you'd be killing
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You see, philosophers believe that
dialog: we're all really just tiny pieces of
dialog: one huge universal being. In other
dialog: words, I am you and you are me, so
dialog: if you were to kill us you'd be
dialog: committing suicide, you unenlightened
dialog: idiot --
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: --Shut up!
text: Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about my husband? Did you kill
dialog: him, too?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Husband? What husband?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Mary's married, Harry.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: No need to worry about Melvin.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now this is the last time I'll ask:
dialog: Who wants to die first?
text: Harry gestures with his head at Mary.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Kill her. The bitch should've told
dialog: him she was married back at the
dialog: airport. It would've saved us a lot
dialog: of trouble.
text: Andre points the gun at Mary.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the
dialog: one who got you into this mess.
text: Andre points the gun at Lloyd.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, wait, do me first. I'm the one
dialog: who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve
dialog: it.
dialog: 115.
text: Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and
text: Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his
text: stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Jesus Christ! You killed my best
dialog: friend, you bastard!
text: Andre smiles.
speaker_heading: ANDRE
dialog: If it's any consolation, you're about
dialog: to be reunited.
text: He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a
text: SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand.
text: ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol
text: at the stunned Nicholas Andre.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Harry! You're alive!
text: Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS
text: storm in with their weapons drawn.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Get your hands up, asshole!
text: Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned
text: Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He
text: reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted
text: by the turn of events.
text: There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way
text: through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She
text: flashes an ID.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal
dialog: Bureau of Investigation.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (dumbstruck)
dialog: You gotta be kidding.
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Good work, Harry.
text: Lloyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt,
text: revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She grabbed me down in the lobby and
dialog: explained what was up. They slapped
dialog: this on me and gave me a gun.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to Athletic Beauty)
dialog: But how did you...?
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: We've been following you two all the
dialog: way from Providence. Mr. and Mrs.
text: Swanson had a homing device plated
text: in the briefcase.
text: The guys glance guiltily at one another.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, about that dough...
speaker_heading: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
dialog: Every bill was counterfeit and marked.
text: Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT
text: There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are
text: hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS
text: to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: She's something, ain't she, Har?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You were right, Lloyd. She was
dialog: efinitely worth the trip.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Guess we have to admit it, she was
dialog: too good for us.
text: Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.
speaker_heading: MELVIN
dialog: Oh god, baby, I missed you!
text: Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of
text: the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: MELVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't thank you enough, fellas. It
dialog: was so darn dank in that well, I
dialog: really thought it would be the death
dialog: of me.
text: Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at
dialog: each other, and we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY
text: Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager
text: luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY
text: The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain,
dialog: Barnard.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, Barney...
speaker_heading: BELL CAPTAIN
dialog: Yes, gentlemen?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Look, we just wanted to say that we
dialog: appreciate all you did for us during
dialog: our stay.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And we're, um, sorry about the money
dialog: we gave you turning out to be phony.
speaker_heading: BELL CAPTAIN
dialog: Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The
dialog: Swanson family has promised to
dialog: reimburse everyone.
text: This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered
text: to the front door.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well, anyway, thanks again for
dialog: everything.
text: They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: Where are you two headed?
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer
dialog: camp somewhere to call home.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: Why not right here?
text: Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This joint is a little out of our
dialog: budget, Barney.
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh, I think we might be able to find
dialog: you a free room somewhere -- after
dialog: all, like you once told me, we're
text: all from the same mold.
dialog: (winks)
dialog: You just don't have any dough right
dialog: now.
text: The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you on the level?
speaker_heading: BARNARD
dialog: Absolutely. We'll just slide you
text: into one of the employee rooms...
text: The guys beam at this.
speaker_heading: BARNARD (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Provided, of course, you don't
dialog: mind working one or two afternoons a
dialog: week.
text: Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You know what, Barney, I think we'll
dialog: take out chances down the road.
text: Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
text: hearse and drive off.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,
dialog: what next, lloyd?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: I say we head due south and try a
text: little nose-rubbing with some of
text: them slinky eskimo babes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: Now you're talking my language. You
dialog: know I got a weakness for blondes.
text: As they head toward their next adventure, the CAMERA PULLS
dialog: UP, UP, UP...
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
speaker_heading: THE END
