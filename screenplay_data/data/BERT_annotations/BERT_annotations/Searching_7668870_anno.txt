speaker_heading: MR. LEE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: MR. LEE (V.0.)

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O.)
dialog: No. Why?
text: In the email, a .jpg attachment. David CLICKS it and-

speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O.)
dialog: ..-Margot.
speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)
dialog: You mentioned earlier she was

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She sent money to herself? What was

speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)
dialog: That’s what it looks like. I'd see

speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She gets a fake ID, she sends money

speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)

scene_heading: GOOGLE CHROME - LATER

dialog: That’s what we don’t have: motive--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: --Why would she do that? Three

scene_heading: I/E. SERIES OF LIVE-CASTS (YOUCAST BROADCAST) 53
text: Musicians strum their guitars, wannabe pop-stars sing covers,

dialog: 55
dialog: 57.
text: A user live-casts him or herself and then verbally responds
text: to the live stream of typed comments and questions from

scene_heading: INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (YOUCAST BROADCAST) 54
text: We're looking at David as he discovers he’s broadcasting.
text: A user named “fish_n_ chips” joins the session... but then
text: immediately leaves. After a few moments of zero viewers-—
text: David is prompted to stop recording. He does. But only then-
scene_heading: YOUCAST - GOOGLE CHROME
text: -does he notice the “SAVED VIDEOS” button on the YouCast
text: toolbar. David DRAGS his cursor to the folder... and CLICK.
dialog: Inside...

scene_heading: INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - EVENING (YOUCAST BROADCAST) 55
text: A hand FIDDLES with the WEBCAM and then pulls away. We’re
text: looking at Margot, who’s not really sure what she’s doing.
text: There’s something very different about her. Something sad.
text: Stumbling through her first live-cast, Margot waits nervously
dialog: for a visitor. Any visitor. No one comes. Then-
text: David skips a minute ahead in the video and suddenly-
text: A new visitor appears in the chat-box and-
scene_heading: XxX5753: Boobies plz
text: Gross. Margot immediately grabs her cursor, presses a button
text: and- “XxX5753 has been blocked from this livecast." Beat.

dialog: Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 58.

text: Margot leans in, reads the message from the new visitor,

speaker_heading: MARGOT

speaker_heading: PETER DAVID (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: VICK

speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (11/01/16) 105.
speaker_heading: VICK (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 107.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: And that was the cash he was

speaker_heading: VICK
text: He had to come clean. It was over.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: Why didn’t he just give it to her
dialog: at school?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: She could've reacted the wrong way.
dialog: In public. Marvin doesn’t like that

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT

speaker_heading: TRAFFIC CAMERA FEEDS

scene_heading: 140 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (TAPED INTERVIEW) 140
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: And what was Margot doing when your

speaker_heading: VICK
text: She was getting high, in her car.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: And what happened then?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: He got inside.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: What was Margot’s reaction?
dialog: Pink Rev. (11/04/16) 108.
speaker_heading: VICK
text: She screamed. She hit him. By the
dialog: time Marvin noticed he was
text: bleeding, she was already running

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: Where did he catch up with her?
speaker_heading: VICK
text: A few hundred yards west of the
dialog: lake.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
text: By the ravine.
speaker_heading: VICK
text: She was punching. Yelling. Marvin
text: just reacted. He pushed back once
dialog: and... she fell. Just disappeared.
dialog: And then it was quiet.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So then your son calls, asks for
dialog: your help to cover up a murder--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: --No. It was my decision.
scene_heading: IPHONE UI - VICK’S PHONE
text: The original call. Vick tries to calm Marvin down.

scene_heading: 142 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (TAPED INTERVIEW) 142
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: So now you’re looking down this
dialog: ravine. Could you see Margot’s body?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: Did you go down?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I tried. But it was narrow, jagged,
dialog: and at least 50 feet to rock
dialog: bottom. Impossible without SAR.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: Then how did you figure--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: --She was dead? It was narrow,
text: jagged, and at least 50 feet to
text: rock bottom. And it was dead quiet.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: So you helped your son.
speaker_heading: VICK
text: I put her phone in the car and
text: dumped the car in the lake.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: And the cash?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Nothing could trace back to him.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Then I thought about my options. A
dialog: police investigation was
dialog: inevitable.
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: So you decided to head it.
speaker_heading: VICK

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: But David found the car.
speaker_heading: VICK (V.0O.)
dialog: I scrambled. First I delayed the

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: Then?
scene_heading: A FAMILIAR PRESS CONFERENCE
text: Vick points to a map of the search area, telling reporters

speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)
dialog: I told the law enforcement team

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT
dialog: Okay. Let’s talk about Randy

scene_heading: SILICON VALLEY HERALD NEWS WEBSITE
text: We see the newspaper photo of Vick and Randy, smiling. Then-

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: So you drugged up a “bum” you knew
dialog: and fed him lines?
speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: She was really hurt, wasn’t she?
speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)

scene_heading: LIVELEAK - GOOGLE CHROME
text: The video is uploaded to LiveLeak.
speaker_heading: VICK (V.O.)
dialog: I uploaded it. And planted his DNA

scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (TAPED INTERVIEW) 145
speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT

speaker_heading: HOMICIDE AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: What did he ask?
