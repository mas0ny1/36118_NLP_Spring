scene_heading: INT. MINIVAN - DAY
text: Open hard on the passenger seat of a speeding minivan, where
text: a MALE TEENAGER is slumped against his blood-stained window.
text: He’s dead, and a distinctly female voice is screaming in
dialog: recognition of this horror.
text: Pull out to reveal that this voice belongs to the minivan’s
text: driver, the late teen’s MOTHER, who’s presumably racing to a
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Why? Why is this happening?!
text: Pull out even more to reveal two more DEAD BOYS in the back
text: seats of the vehicle. More subtle this time. They’re
text: slumped over their PSPs. We can’t see their faces.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Just hold on! I’m going to get you

text: The mother is cut off mid-sentence by EXPLODING GLASS, as her

scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY INTERSECTION - CONTINUING
text: Cut outside as a SPEEDING FIRE TRUCK runs a red light and
text: easily KNOCKS ASIDE the minivan that dared cross its path.
scene_heading: INT. FIRE TRUCK - CONTINUING
text: Behind the wheel, a rock-hard FEMALE FIREFIGHTER shakes her
text: head at the smaller vehicle that stupidly ignored her blaring
text: sirens.
speaker_heading: FEMALE FIREFIGHTER
dialog: Fuckin’ women drivers...
scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - CONTINUING
text: Outside, the street is LITTERED with crashed cars, most of
text: which contain the CORPSES of recently deceased male drivers.
text: A few small FIRES dot the landscape. This looks more like
dialog: Fallujah than Jersey.
text: The fire truck reluctantly slows to a halt as it confronts a
text: JERSEY CITY POLICE CAR parked in the middle of the road.
text: Outside the squaddie, a Hispanic FEMALE POLICE OFFICER is
text: cradling the lifeless body of her MALE PARTNER, whose face is
text: smeared with fresh blood.
text: The female firefighter hops out of her vehicle to assist her
text: sister-in-arms.

speaker_heading: POLICEWOMAN
dialog: They’re dead, Nat. The whole

dialog: Al Qaeda. Smallpox or something.
speaker_heading: POLICEWOMAN
dialog: Then why are we okay? Why aren’t
dialog: we-—
text: The female officer is interrupted by the sudden arrival of an
text: AMBULANCE, which screeches to a halt inches from the two
text: other emergency vehicles. A FEMALE EMT hops out and sprints
text: over to the other uniformed women.
speaker_heading: FEMALE EMT
dialog: What the hell is happening?
dialog: Dispatch says I’m the only bus
text: responding to calls.
speaker_heading: FEMALE FIREFIGHTER
dialog: Is your dispatcher a woman?
text: Suddenly, a WAILING SOUND is heard, like a distant wounded
dialog: animal.
speaker_heading: FEMALE EMT
dialog: What difference does that make?
text: The sound grows louder.
speaker_heading: POLICEWOMAN
dialog: Is your dispatcher a fucking
dialog: woman? !
speaker_heading: FEMALE EMT
dialog: Yuh--yes. Yes. Why?
text: The women raise their voices to compete with the alien sound,
text: which is even louder now.
speaker_heading: POLICEWOMAN
dialog: It’s the men! All of the men are--
text: Pull out, as the sound reveals itself to be a BOEING 747.
text: It’s falling out of the goddamn sky.

speaker_heading: YORICK (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - MORNING
text: Inside a tastefully decorated office, we learn that the voice
text: behind this non sequitur belongs to YORICK BROWN, an oddly
text: attractive 20-something white guy who looks all wrong in a
text: tie. He’s wearing one anyway. Yorick’s staring right at us
text: as he nervously rambles:
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: It’s true. Jesse Garon Presley. He
dialog: was an identical twin, stillborn
dialog: a few minutes before Gladys gave
dialog: birth to the King. They buried him
dialog: in a shoebox. How insane is that? I
dialog: mean, what if Jesse had lived and
dialog: Elvis had died? Or vice versa? It’s
dialog: destiny, right? Why does fate
dialog: choose one man over another and all
dialog: that?
text: Cut across the desk to the unimpressed FEMALE EXECUTIVE who's
text: apparently been interviewing Yorick.
speaker_heading: FEMALE EXECUTIVE
dialog: And that’s why we should hire you
dialog: to be an assistant editor?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I'm just saying, I’m more Elvis
dialog: than Jesse. Plus, I’m a ninja with
dialog: the grammar. Ma’am.
text: The woman looks over Yorick’s resume.
speaker_heading: FEMALE EXECUTIVE
dialog: You haven't worked since you
dialog: graduated more than two years ago?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: No, I’ve, uh, sorta been doing the
dialog: Kerouac thing. Minus the road
dialog: trip. Or traveling. Or leaving my
dialog: apartment at all, really. I’ve
text: been thinking. Mostly thinking.
speaker_heading: FEMALE EXECUTIVE
dialog: Mr. Brown...
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yorick. Please. Mr. Brown is my
dialog: father. My grandfather, actually.
dialog: Professor Brown is my old man. He--
speaker_heading: FEMALE EXECUTIVE
dialog: Yorick, I'll be honest. With your
dialog: lack of publishing experience, I
dialog: never even would have given you an
dialog: interview if Congresswoman Brown
dialog: hadn’t asked me personally.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: My... my mom called you?
speaker_heading: FEMALE EXECUTIVE
dialog: I’m sorry, son. You're a good kid,

scene_heading: INT. DOLL FACTORY —- MORNING
text: It’s after hours inside a dimly lit DOLL FACTORY that’s
text: cluttered with unassembled plastic body parts of girls’ toys.
text: Standing under a naked bulb in this warehouse-sized room is
text: AGENT 355, a late-twenties African-American woman who could
dialog: kill you with a single dreadlock.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: If you want him dead, I’m your man.
text: Pull out, as we reveal that Agent 355 is speaking with two
text: men, a seated RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN and the nervous ASSISTANT
text: standing behind him.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: And yet... you’re not. I am paying
dialog: for an assassin, not a--
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: The woman comes very highly
dialog: recommended, sir. She took down
dialog: the head of Roberto Oil. In
dialog: Venezuela?
text: 355 smiles.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Haven’t you heard? We’re the
dialog: deadlier of the species. If Mother
dialog: Russia could hold onto her brides
dialog: better, maybe you wouldn’t have to
dialog: outsource all your dirty work.
text: The frowning Russian businessman just stares at 355... but
text: his grimace eventually gives way to a smile.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: You remind me of my first wife.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Messy divorce?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I cut her face off and had it
text: stretched into a lampshade.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (ignoring this)
dialog: Give me the first ten million now,
dialog: and POTUS will be dead before he
dialog: leaves his stupid ranch.
text: The businessman motions to his assistant, who brings 355 a
text: SUITCASE. Just as he’s about to hand over this case, 355
text: GRABS the assistant’s wrist and TWISTS it behind his back.
text: With her free hand, 355 pulls out a GLOCK, which she presses
text: to her startled hostage’s head.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Federal agent! You’re both under
dialog: arrest!
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Which federal agency?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You're not really in a position to
dialog: be asking questions, fuckface.
text: The businessman calmly raises a finger, and GUNSHOTS ring out
text: as the hostage’s chest suddenly EXPLODES. The dead assistant
text: slumps to the ground, as SEVERAL HEAVILY ARMED RUSSIAN
text: BRUISERS step out of the shadows behind their boss.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Hurt her as much as you want, but I
dialog: get to finish it.
text: 355’s eyes narrow, as she uses her free hand to pull out a
text: BALLISTIC BATON, which she EXTENDS with a satisfying THINK.
text: The first of the six thugs RUNS at 355, and she promptly
text: SHOOTS him in the chest, knocking him to the ground.
text: The next uses his muscular forearm to CHOP the Glock out of
text: 355’s hand, but she SWINGS her metal baton right into one of
text: his eye sockets.
text: As this blinded man screams in pain, two more charge at 355.
text: She GRABS the first by his thick neck and SNAPS it by using
text: his skull as a fulcrum to SWING around and KICK his partner
text: in the face with devastating force.
text: 355 continues to throw punches and break bones, until she’s
text: eventually overpowered by Russian muscle. As the men wrestle
text: her to the ground, 355 looks up to see the businessman
text: holding one of his goons’ machine guns.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I’m going to enjoy reading by the
dialog: light of your face.
text: And with that, he SMASHES her in the skull with the butt of
text: the weapon, knocking her unconscious.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
text: A dejected Yorick shambles towards his rundown brownstone in
text: Queens, as an AIRPLANE roars directly overhead. He lives
text: right next door to LaGuardia Airport. What a nightmare.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUING
text: As Yorick forces open the sticky front door, he’s greeted by
text: his very PREGNANT NEIGHBOR, who’s retrieving her mail.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: How'd it go, Yorick?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Better than the last three?
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Well, you’ll get it next time.
text: Yorick looks at her belly.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You know yet or you want it to be a
dialog: surprise?
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Oh, we just found out. Little boy.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Seriously? Congrats, that’s so--
text: The two are immediately interrupted by their TRANSVESTITE
text: LANDLORD, a man trying (unconvincingly) to pass as a woman.
text: S/he angrily slings open the door to his/her ground floor
dialog: apartment.
scene_heading: TRANSVESTITE LANDLORD
dialog: Something in your apartment smells
dialog: like shit.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Sorry. I... I think I
dialog: burnt popcorn last--
scene_heading: TRANSVESTITE LANDLORD
dialog: It’s literally shit, Yorick. The
dialog: lease says no animals!
text: Yorick quickly gathers his bills and trudges up the stairs.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: No, it says no cats or dogs...
text: Yorick pushes into his dark pad, a hilariously tiny studio
text: apartment decorated with posters of HOUDINI and other
text: assorted nerdery.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Ampersand? Amp? Where are you,
dialog: buddy? Your questionable hygiene
dialog: has run its course, little man.
dialog: Time for--

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: They're doing a piece on female

speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: They're not doing anything until

text: Suddenly, GUNSHOTS ring out. The reporter and his cameraman
text: flinch, but the Israeli soldiers just casually toss their
dialog: cigarettes aside.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Are... are they shooting at us, um,
dialog: Alter?
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: My name is Colonel Tse’elon, and
dialog: you will address me as such. Come,

dialog: safety.
text: The reporter subtly signals for his cameraman to keep

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: So, how did you--
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Twenty-one months of military
dialog: service is compulsory for all
dialog: Israeli women.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Yeah, but this is sort of a new
dialog: phenomenon, right? Women on the
dialog: front lines?
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: My grandmother crossed into enemy
dialog: territory during our War of

dialog: was part of the all-female
dialog: Battalion of Death during the

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What’s with the trench? You’re
dialog: flying to sunny Los Angeles, not
dialog: old-timey London.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’m insulted. This is what I wore
dialog: to our first date, remember?
dialog: Midnight screening of Miller's
dialog: Crossing at the Angelika? You said
dialog: I looked like a degenerate flasher.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: That wasn’t our date! You were
dialog: still seeing my troglodyte of a

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So, you were seeing Libby!
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You guys set me up with her! And
dialog: she covered her eyes every time
text: someone in the movie got shot.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well, my date kept falling asleep.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (pulling Beth close)
dialog: But right after the Danny Boy
dialog: scene, when Leo blew that guy’s
text: brains out and stole his tommy gun,
dialog: you turned to me and whispered,
dialog: “That was the coolest motherfucking
dialog: thing I’ve ever seen.”
text: He kisses her.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: And that’s when I knew you were the
dialog: only degenerate flasher I would
dialog: ever love.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And that’s when I knew I needed a
dialog: better wardrobe.
text: Beth undoes her trenchcoat, revealing skimpy LINGERIE
text: underneath. Yorick is predictably awestruck.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Wow. I mean, that is--
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Shh. It’s a going-away present.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But, I’m not the one leaving
dialog: town... unless those pharmaceutical
dialog: nerds want you so bad, they've
text: thrown in an extra ticket.
text: Beth sighs. They’ve obviously had this conversation before.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: My internship’s only for three
dialog: months, Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Sure, until you discover the cure
dialog: for cancer, and they offer you--
text: Fed up, Beth PUSHES Yorick to the floor and climbs on top of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Do you have protection?
text: Yorick fumbles for a nearby box. He tips it over and out
text: spills DUCT TAPE, a GASMASK, and various CANNED GOODS.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Do you have anthrax?
text: Beth kisses him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It’s fine.

speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Why are you people coming to me?

speaker_heading: YORICK

dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SUPERMODEL

speaker_heading: SUPERMODEL

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Ow! Son of a bitch!

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Tell me this is real. Please. I
dialog: can’t live through another goddamn

text: He collapses to the floor, taking a seat next to his pet

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Jesus! What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: His name’s Ampersand. I’m training

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Him? But the NSA says every male

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I don’t know, but whatever kept me

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Or maybe that animal is carrying
dialog: something that shielded you from
dialog: whatever killed all the other men.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Huh. Guess I hadn’t considered

text: Yorick’s mom subtly shakes her head. She loves this kid, but

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Whatever. I’m all alone.
scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: (squeezing his hand)

speaker_heading: YORICK

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN (cont'd)

dialog: I mean, who’s even in charge here?
scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: President Rice.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: ("We're fucked.)

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN

dialog: Mier, and we're going to hold it
dialog: together, too.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yeah, but what about Congress?
dialog: Aren't, like, 90% of you dead?
dialog: You’re the one who always
dialog: complained that fucking Burundi had
dialog: more female politicians than us!
scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: And you might be able to help us
dialog: change that.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How, by locking me in the Oval
dialog: Office so I can be a...a stud for
dialog: however many women you want me to
dialog: inseminate?
scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: I have no intention of whoring out
dialog: my own son, Yorick. But you need

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Now go upstairs, get some sleep.

scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Everything’s going to be all right,

scene_heading: INT. YORICK’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Upstairs, Yorick carries his monkey into his boyhood room,
text: which is lit only by what moonlight streams inside.
text: Yorick notices a few boxes labelled “NYU,” leftover memories
text: from his last year at college. He opens one of these
text: cardboard containers, and pulls out an UNFRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.
text: It’s a picture of him with Beth at a college Halloween party.
text: Yorick is wearing a STRAITJACKET, and Beth is dressed in the
text: top hat and fishnet stockings of a MAGICIAN’S ASSISTANT.
text: Beth is holding up bunny ears behind the laughing Yorick.
text: He flips the picture over, and scribbled on the back is a
text: hand-written note from Beth that reads, “YORICK BROWN + BETH
scene_heading: DEVILLE = DRUNKEN MAGIC FOREVER”
text: Yorick smiles, but his happiness fades as he thinks of how
text: far away his best friend is. He clutches the photo against
text: his chest, falls back into his old bed, and closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. YORICK’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Smash cut to a few hours later for this image of a sleeping

scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2
dialog: To a classified location.
scene_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
dialog: Like fuck you are! This is my

scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT #1
dialog: Ma’am, please lower your voice.
dialog: This is above all our heads, so...
text: Just then, the Secret Service agent looks upstairs and
text: catches a glimpse of Yorick in his bedroom doorway. He
text: immediately SLAMS the door shut.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2
dialog: (to her partner)
dialog: Take him.
scene_heading: INT. YORICK’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM —- CONTINUING

speaker_heading: CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN (0O.S.)
dialog: Yorick, I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!

text: The two Secret Service agents soon KICK OPEN his flimsily
text: locked door... but Yorick has already disappeared.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUING
text: DROPPING to a concrete patio, Yorick (still carrying
text: Ampersand’s case) LANDS awkwardly and stumbles to his feet.
text: He races for the side of his house, where he finds a large
text: shape covered by a white sheet. Yorick yanks it off,
text: revealing an old HARLEY MOTORCYCLE. Frantically, he starts
text: tipping over lawn equipment and nearby bags of plant food
text: looking for its KEYS.
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Come on, dad, a little help here...
text: Finally, Yorick cracks open a can of paint, grabs the hidden
text: treasure inside, and JAMS the key into the bike’s ignition.
text: It roars to life, just as the two S.S. agents storm outside!
text: The women GRAB for Yorick (who’s riding the bike while
text: carrying Amp’s case on his lap), but he deftly out-maneuvers
text: them, and RACES out into the night.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT
text: Later that evening, Yorick (again wearing his hood and
text: gasmask) WEAVES through the cluttered D.C. intersections on
text: his father’s old motorcycle. Ampersand’s carrier is now tied
text: onto the back of the bike.
text: Confident that he’s no longer being followed, he stops at a
text: makeshift roadblock to catch his breath and find his
dialog: bearings.
text: Suddenly, Yorick hears the sound of SINGING. He turns to see
text: a FUNERAL PROCESSION, hundreds of women marching down the
text: street carrying candles, flowers and mementos of their fallen
dialog: brothers, husbands and sons.
text: In the middle of the crowd, Yorick spots someone else wearing
text: a GASMASK. Could this be another male in disguise? Yorick
text: slows his bike next to this masked figure.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Excuse me. You’re not a... are you
dialog: a...?
text: The figure pulls off the mask, revealing a weathered forty-

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I know you, sweetie?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh, I... I saw the mask, and I
dialog: thought maybe you were... I thought
dialog: Maybe you were someone I knew.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sorry, just got so used to wearing
dialog: this thing, it’s kinda become my

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’m... Beth. Where are you guys
dialog: headed?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh, they turned one of the
dialog: monuments into a kinda memorial for
dialog: all the men.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Which monument?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Guess.
text: Heather points up at the nearby WASHINGTON MONUMENT, looking
text: particularly phallic in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Always about size with you ladies,
dialog: isn’t it?
text: Just then, Yorick hears the rumble of MORE motorcycles, as he
text: turns to see a gang of several DAUGHTERS OF THE AMAZON circle
dialog: this ad hoc shrine to men.
text: These post-apocalyptic survivalists have RIFLES and other
text: weapons slung over their backs, and numerous MEN’S NECKTIES
text: attached to their belts, like freshly shorn scalps. Two of

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: The hell?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Daughters of the Amazon.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’ve only heard rumors. They're,
text: like, roving packs of pissed-off
dialog: lesbians, right?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: They’re not gay, they’re crazy.
dialog: Been burning down all the sperm
dialog: banks.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Why?
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Who knows? Some girls will do any
dialog: stupid shit to get into a gang,
dialog: long as it means food and
dialog: protection.
text: Push in on the bikers, as one of the helmeted women (the
text: apparent leader) removes her helmet to address the crowd of
text: mourners. It’s the female chess grandmaster, VICTORIA.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Sisters, why do you continue to
dialog: worship at the altar of the
dialog: patriarchy? The gendercide is
dialog: cause for celebration! It rid the
dialog: planet of rapists and dictators and
dialog: serial killers! The Y chromosome
dialog: was an genetic aberration, one that
dialog: the planet rightly expunged!
text: As the largely frightened crowd scatters, Victoria spots the
text: disguised Yorick in the background. She turns to two of her
text: underlings, THERESA (a young woman with a completely shaved
text: head) and CATHERINE (the other helmeted Amazon).
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Theresa, Catherine... a pound of
dialog: Godiva to whoever brings me that
text: woman's bike.
text: While the rest of the Daughters of the Amazon begin attaching
text: some kind of ELECTRONIC DEVICE to the base of the Washington
text: Monument, Catherine and Theresa hop on their bikes and speed
text: towards Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh. Oh, crap.
text: Yorick squeezes the throttle, and his bike JUMPS to life. He
text: squeals past a bewildered Heather, with the two Amazons in
text: hot pursuit. Zooming down a side street and away from the
text: crowds, Yorick does his best to out-race his two pursuers,
text: but Theresa (the bald one) pulls out a handgun and FIRES at
text: Yorick’'s back tire, causing his bike to LOSE CONTROL and
text: SPARK to a painful halt on its chromed side.
text: Ampersand WHINES from inside his carrier, as Yorick pulls
text: himself out from under the bike.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (groggy, to Ampersand)
dialog: Well, how do you think I feel?
dialog: 37
text: Yorick looks up to see the two Daughters of the Amazon
text: standing over him. Theresa has her gun trained on his face.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I'll take the mask, too, whore.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’m sorry, I... I can’t.
text: The helmeted rider begs Yorick to be sensible.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Just do what she says, lady.
text: Reluctantly, Yorick peels off the gasmask, and the two women
text: react with appropriate shock and awe to his stubbled face.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You're... you’re...
text: Yorick stands and puts on his best female impersonator voice.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (terrible female
dialog: impersonation)
dialog: It’s just glandular, okay?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You have an Adam's apple.
text: Theresa steps forward and puts a HAND down the front of
text: Yorick’s PANTS.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Hey! What are you--
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: He’s a man... but just barely.
text: Yorick pulls away, offended.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What are you going to do, rape me?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Don’t flatter yourself. I’m taking
dialog: you to my boss.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (0.S.)
dialog: No. You’re not.
text: Theresa turns to see Catherine's gun in her face.
dialog: 38
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Jesus, Catherine, we can split the
dialog: fucking chocolate.
text: “Catherine” finally removes her helmet, revealing that she’s
text: actually AGENT 355.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: My name’s not Catherine.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: What are you talking about? I’ve
dialog: been bunking with you for a week.
dialog: You’ re--
text: Without hesitating, 355 PISTOL-WHIPS Theresa, instantly
text: knocking the girl out. Yorick FLINCHES in fear as 355 aims
text: the gun at him, but she instead fires at the front tire of
text: Theresa’s BIKE, before jumping back on her own motorcycle.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (to Yorick)
dialog: Hop on.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Like hell, Warrior Princess.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I’m not an Amazon. I’m an agent of
dialog: the Culper Ring.
text: Yorick picks up his carrier to make sure that Ampersand is
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Forget it. We should go before the
text: fireworks begin.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What fireworks?
text: Suddenly, a deafening EXPLOSION is heard, and Yorick turns
text: just in time to watch the Washington Monument TOPPLE on its
text: side, felled like a marbled redwood.
text: As the dust from the demolition spreads their way, Yorick
text: matter-of-factly climbs onto 355’'s bike.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Right. And away we go.

scene_heading: INT. TEL AVIV COMMAND CENTER —- MORNING
text: Cut to an Israeli war room, where countless YOUNG FEMALE
text: CADETS man phone banks and computer screens. Rachel is
text: looking up at a BIG MAP of the Middle East with her
text: commander, Alter. This display shows heavy TROOP MOVEMENTS
dialog: out of Israel and into Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: When does it end?
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: When our people are safe.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Our people are safe, Alter...
dialog: thanks to you. But we no longer
dialog: have their support. The women want
dialog: security, not world domination.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Security must be earned, Rachel.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It was already given to us when the
dialog: boys died! Israel has more combat-
dialog: ready soldiers than any nation on
dialog: the planet now, and you know it!
dialog: You have every teenage girl in Tel

dialog: fractured governments, and unless
text: the three girls on board that

speaker_heading: RADIO GIRL
dialog: Lieutenant-General Tse’elon! I
dialog: have something!
text: Alter gives Rachel a knowing look.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: (to the Radio Girl)

text: Over the tinny speaker, the voice of one of the female SECRET
text: SERVICE AGENTS is heard.

speaker_heading: FROM SPEAKER
dialog: I have not been drinking, Madame
dialog: President. Congresswoman Brown's

speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Another delusional crackpot.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Perhaps, but all it would take is
dialog: our enemies finding a single boy
dialog: for them to resurrect their entire
dialog: armies.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What? You’re not seriously
dialog: considering wasting resources on
dialog: some wild goose chase, are you?
text: Alter shoots Rachel daggers before pulling the young woman
text: aside to quietly lecture her.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You're welcome to question me,
dialog: Colonel, but never in front of my
dialog: troops. I’m your friend, but I’m
dialog: also your superior.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You may have asked for this career,
dialog: Lieutenant-General, but I’m just a
dialog: lowly film student serving her time
dialog: in your “stop gap.”
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: So what, you want to make bullshit
dialog: romantic comedies to sedate the
dialog: helpless widows?
text: Rachel looks up at the big map with a hint of sadness.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Or do you want to save the world?
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT
text: The motorcycle that 355 and Yorick are riding slows to a halt
text: next to a pickup truck. The two dismount.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You ever siphoned before?
dialog: 4l
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Kind of a personal question, don’t
dialog: you think? Mind if I ask your name
dialog: before I start spilling my sexual
dialog: history?
text: 355 pulls out a small length of rubber hose and goes to work
text: transferring fuel from the truck to her motorcycle.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You can call me 355.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: “Three Fifty-five?” What is that,
dialog: some kind of double-oh-seven thing?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: It’s classified.
text: Hearing that word again, Yorick suddenly grows nervous.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You're not part of the Secret
dialog: Service, are you?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: We’re a hell of a lot more secret
dialog: than that.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I told you, I’m not allowed to...
text: 355 stops herself.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Fuck it. What’s the point, right?
dialog: My bosses are all dead.
text: Yorick actually looks a little relieved to hear this.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh, that’s cool. I mean, it’s not
dialog: cool, but I was worried you were--
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: 355 was the codename assigned to
dialog: this country’s first female spy.
dialog: She was part of General
dialog: Washington’s Culper Ring during the
dialog: Revolutionary War.
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So you’re what, one of those re-
dialog: enactors?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You wouldn’t have learned this in
dialog: A.P. History, but Washington never
dialog: disbanded the Culper Ring. For
dialog: more than 200 years, we've been
text: secretly working to protect the men
dialog: and women of this country.
text: Yorick looks at a CORPSE inside one of the nearby vehicles.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You're doing a bang-up job.
text: 355 spits out gasoline.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: What’s your story?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So far? A pretty crappy mystery.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: So you have no clue why you’re the
dialog: last guy?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Your guess is as lame as mine. I’m
dialog: Yorick, by the way.
text: 355 just shoots him a look: “You thought my name was weird?”
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: My dad teaches... taught drama. I
dialog: guess he thought naming his kid
dialog: after an obscure Shakespeare
dialog: character would help him get
dialog: tenure.
text: The Culper Ring agent finishes putting away her siphoning
dialog: gear.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Well, it’s a good thing I found you
dialog: when I did. You wouldn’t survive
dialog: another month out there on your
dialog: own. The Amazon movement is
dialog: growing, and those women would love
dialog: nothing more than killing someone
dialog: like you.
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Why? I mean, I can see locking me
dialog: up, but if those violent femmes
dialog: offed the last man, wouldn’t they
dialog: sort of be insuring the death of
dialog: the fairer sex, too?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I infiltrated their organization to
dialog: find out if they had anything to do
dialog: with whatever caused the global
dialog: Manslaughter. They’re smart enough
dialog: to exploit it, but I don’t think
dialog: they started it. Unfortunately for
dialog: you, they do have a plan to keep
dialog: humanity going.
text: 355 jumps back on the refueled bike.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: And it’s strictly no boys allowed.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGETOWN LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
text: Having finished their work at the Washington Monument, the
text: Daughters of the Amazon have returned to this brightly lit,
text: peaceful lecture hall, where they’re passing out free Power
text: Bars to the starving women funneling through the doors.
text: On stage, Victoria is addressing these new recruits while
text: standing next to a large projected image of a human EGG.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Parthenogenesis, the development of
text: an embryo without fertilization by
dialog: amale. It’s every woman’s dream.
dialog: The joy of creation without having
dialog: to endure the most painful part of
dialog: childbirth... marriage.
text: A few of the hardcores laugh at this, as Victoria changes the
text: slide to an image of DR. MANN.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: It’s no longer science fiction
dialog: thanks to the pioneering work of
dialog: this woman, bioengineer Dr. Allison
text: Mann. By injecting a single cell
dialog: into one egg, she could help us
dialog: give birth to our own twins.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (cont'd)
dialog: Can you imagine, a society of
dialog: daughters brought into this world
dialog: without the poisonous seed of man?
dialog: We find this woman, and the battle
dialog: of the sexes is won.
speaker_heading: THERESA (0.S.)
dialog: Victoria!
text: Victoria looks out to see Theresa, her bald follower. The
text: girl KNEELS as she enters the room.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Off your knees, Theresa. You know
dialog: we're all equals here.
text: Dutifully, Theresa rises.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What happened out there? Are you
dialog: all right?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You have to put out a dragnet,
dialog: Victoria. I saw one. I... I sawa
dialog: man.
text: Close on Victoria, suspicious, but not disbelieving.
scene_heading: EXT. BALTIMORE SHIPPING YARDS - DAWN
text: Early the next morning, 355 walks her empty motorcycle along
text: a dirt road. A gasmask-clad Yorick is strolling beside her,
text: with Ampersand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So you're going to Frisco to find
dialog: this doctor before Mad Maxine does?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: That’s the plan. Hopefully, Dr.
dialog: Mann will be able to tell us why
dialog: you and your animal survived, too.
text: Yorick grows nervous.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Um, actually, I kinda have a prior
dialog: engagement. So to speak.
dialog: Ampersand and I are headed to Los
dialog: Angeles to find Beth.
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Who the hell is that?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: A woman I trust more than my own
dialog: mother. These days, anyway.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick, you have a responsibility.
dialog: We can look for your girlfriend
dialog: after we see if there’s anything
dialog: you can do for the human race.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I appreciate the offer, Three, but
dialog: I’m not looking for a chaperone. I
dialog: handled myself just fine out there
dialog: before you came into the--
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Quiet.
text: Ampersand loudly EEKS as 355 points at a grizzly sight up
text: ahead, THREE SNARLING WOLVES gnawing on the REMAINS of a male
dialog: corpse.
text: As the growling animals approach them, a frightened Yorick
text: casually STEPS BEHIND 355. She quickly dispatches the killer
text: wolves with a WARNING SHOT fired above their heads.
text: A grateful Yorick suddenly looks a little more amenable to
dialog: the idea of a travelling partner.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Okay, let’s say I did opt to come
dialog: with you. How are you getting to
dialog: Cali?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: First, I have to sell our bike.
text: The Plague hit at rush hour out
dialog: west, so the highways will be too
text: congested with dead guys, even for
text: a motorcycle.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But, commercial aircraft have all
dialog: gone the way of boy bands. How are
dialog: we getting cross country?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: The old-fashioned way.
dialog: 46
text: 355 and Yorick finally reach a TRAIN YARD, where hundreds of
text: American women are lined up like REFUGEES, vying for a spot
text: on board an impossibly long DIESEL TRAIN.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Girls have been trading tampons and
dialog: vibrator batteries for seats in
dialog: first class, but these wheels
dialog: should buy us some room in cargo.
text: The masked Yorick stares at this overgrown train set, unable
text: to hide his boyish enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Cool.
text: Push into the bustling crowd, where a FEMALE SCOUT clearly
text: dressed in the garb of the Amazons subtly watches Yorick and
text: 355’s every move.
scene_heading: EXT. DIESEL TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Later that evening, the packed DIESEL TRAIN chugs out of
text: Maryland. The landscape is peppered with LARGE PIECES OF
text: WRECKAGE from the various passenger jets that crashed in the
text: minutes following the Plague.
scene_heading: INT. FREIGHT CAR —- CONTINUING
text: Push inside a freight car, which is filled with boxes of
text: CARGO, but only two passengers, 355 and an unmasked Yorick.
text: The duo is quietly eating out of cans. Yorick is feeding
text: most of his share to Ampersand.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’ve eaten so many canned peaches
dialog: over the last few months, I think I
dialog: shat a cobbler last night.
text: Disgusted, 355 sets down her food.
text: Yorick checks out the car’s sparse interior.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So we’re gonna have to sleep in
dialog: this thing, huh? Hobo-tastic.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Sorry I couldn’t get us booked in
dialog: the Four Seasons.
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You know, I actually stayed there
dialog: one night. After the Plague, right
dialog: before I left to find my mom.
text: Slept in the presidential suite.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Because I could, I guess. It was
dialog: mostly sad though. The whole place
dialog: was packed with homeless women, and
dialog: they didn’t exactly seem...
dialog: distraught about the turn of
dialog: events, you know? Made me wonder
dialog: if this whole thing happened for a
dialog: reason. “And the meek shall
dialog: inherit the earth,” and all that.
text: 355 glares at him, half-joking.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Who’re you calling meek?
text: Ignoring this, Yorick stands and looks out the car’s open
text: door at the unlit scenery passing by.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Man, I have no idea where we’re at
dialog: now. All these towns look the same
dialog: in the dark. Is it that hard for
dialog: you ladies to turn some lights on?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Electricity doesn’t come through
text: the sockets magically, Yorick. It
dialog: takes a lot of manpower... human-
dialog: power to operate all of the plants
dialog: and substations. Energy was a male-
dialog: dominated industry, but other
dialog: Culper Ring agents are out there
text: trying to fill the void.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So you weren’t you the only girl in
dialog: your... club?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Men held administrative positions,
text: but the Culpers’ undercover agents
dialog: were all women.
dialog: 48
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Why go the Charlie’s Angels route?
text: 355 stands to stretch her legs.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Because men can think with their
dialog: brains or with their penises, but
dialog: not with both. We have better
dialog: relationships with our bodies,
dialog: makes us stronger in the field.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Sure, as long as that field doesn’t
dialog: contain Mike Tyson.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: We're not always as physically
dialog: powerful, but there’s a reason the
dialog: best rock climbers are women.
dialog: We've got you beat in flexibility,
dialog: agility, problem-solving.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I’ve seen this sitcom.
dialog: You're all great, we suck at
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Not everything. You ever been to a
dialog: nursing home? Notice how it’s
dialog: ninety percent old women? Same
dialog: with suicide. We might attempt it
dialog: more, but you guys usually succeed.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So what, you’re saying the one
dialog: thing men are better at than
dialog: women... is dying?
text: 355 looks out at the darkness.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You’re ahead of us so far.
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER - DAWN
text: Cut to the next morning, as a fleet of stolen BLACK HAWK
text: HELICOPTERS flies past the rising sun.
dialog: 49
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER —- CONTINUING
text: Cut inside the passenger section of one of these attack
text: choppers, as Alter and Rachel talk to each other over radio
text: headsets. They’re alone here, so Rachel can speak freely.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m still not sure how wise it was
dialog: to steal vehicles from our most
dialog: loyal ally.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: The U.S. military isn’t an ally,
dialog: Rachel, it’s a distant memory. All
dialog: of their brass is dead, and the
dialog: girls they coddled and refused to
dialog: let fight are stranded in foreign
dialog: theaters. Besides, the end
dialog: justifies the means. The troop
dialog: transport we used to fly to the
dialog: States was too slow and unwieldy to
dialog: keep up with the elusive Mister...
text: Rachel consults her small field notebook.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Brown, Yorick. Our intelligence
dialog: has nothing on him outside of a
dialog: social security number and three
dialog: posts to his old blog. He’s a
dialog: zilch, Alter. If Yorick’s really
dialog: the last, God didn’t exactly leave
dialog: us a Moses, did he?
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: The fact that you still believe in
dialog: a higher power after all this is
dialog: charming.
text: Rachel listens to something coming over her headphones.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Scuttlebutt on the ground is that a
text: young man was recently spotted in
text: D.C. But unsubstantiated male
dialog: sightings are more common than
dialog: corpses these days, so I continue
dialog: to question the wisdom of all this.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: My gut says Yorick is alive,
dialog: Rachel.
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let’s say he is. And let’s say we
dialog: abduct the Americans’ only son.
dialog: You realize they’1l go to war to
dialog: get him back.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: We should be so lucky.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You saw what happened at the Temple
dialog: Mount a few months ago, didn’t you?
dialog: Between our own people? The
dialog: rioting? The fistfights?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yeah, well, the ultra-orthodox
dialog: women interpret the men’s death a
dialog: little differently than the rest of
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: The fighting didn’t begin in
dialog: earnest until the Israeli Defense
dialog: Forces... sedated our Arab
dialog: neighbors. As soon as we removed
dialog: all of Israel’s external threats,
dialog: the internal conflict that’s been
dialog: simmering for years finally came to
text: a boil.
text: The helicopter BANKS into the sun.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: The same will happen to our friends
dialog: in the States soon enough. Without
text: an outside “evil” for its citizens
dialog: to hate, poor will turn against
text: rich, white against black...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What are you suggesting, that the
dialog: only way to protect peace in our
dialog: time is to invent a war? What the
dialog: hell kind of plan is that?
text: Alter smiles a little Mona Lisa grin.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: A very old, very reliable one.
dialog: 51
scene_heading: INT. FREIGHT CAR - MORNING
text: Open tight on a sleeping Yorick, who’s JOLTED awake as the
text: stopped train begins to MOVE.
text: He bolts upright, and is relieved to see 355 sitting across
text: from him with Ampersand on her shoulder. Strangely enough,
text: the Culper Ring agent is KNITTING.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What are you working on? Rifle
dialog: cozy?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Just keeping my hands busy.
text: The train quickly picks up full speed.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How long were we stopped?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Few hours. Crew had to remove a
text: herd of dead cows from the tracks.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Bulls.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: All cows are females. Any dead
dialog: cattle were probably bulls.
text: 355 scrunches up her nose as she points at Yorick’s shirt.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yeah, well, speaking of rotting
dialog: livestock...
text: Yorick sniffs at himself.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Whoof. Sorry. I haven’t changed
dialog: my shirt since I got to Washington.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You want to borrow one of mine?
dialog: Say what you will about the
dialog: Daughters of the Amazon, but their
dialog: laundry skills are phenomenal.
dialog: 52
text: 355 takes a fresh dress shirt out of her bag.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Third time you’ve saved my life,
dialog: Three-fiddy.
text: Yorick pulls off his dirty T-shirt, and 355 can’t help but
text: check out his body. Surprisingly, the seemingly scrawny
text: young man actually has a pretty good build. 355 quickly
text: looks away as Yorick starts putting on the new shirt.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Am I having a stroke or are these
dialog: buttons suddenly on the wrong side?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: It’s a woman’s shirt, Yorick. Deal
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Since when are your buttons on the
dialog: left?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Since buttons were invented? Guys
dialog: used to carry swords, so the left
text: side of his jacket had to close
dialog: over the right. So he could draw
text: without his blade getting caught in
dialog: something?
text: Yorick continues to stupidly fumble with his buttons, and 355
text: comes over to help him.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Ladies had servants who did their
dialog: dressing for them, so putting
dialog: buttons on the left made it easier
dialog: for them.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: That was then, huh?
text: The two look into each other’s eyes for a moment. They’re
text: only inches apart here.
text: Suddenly, Ampersand (sitting on a crate in the background)
text: interrupts this near-romantic moment with his SCREECHING.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Settle, Amp. What’s got you so...
text: 355’s ears perk up, too. Her expression is grave.
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You hear that?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
text: The sound of a hundred women’s
text: cycles syncing up.
scene_heading: EXT. DIESEL TRAIN - CONTINUING
text: Outside, the train is now being pursued by DOZENS OF
text: MOTORCYCLES being ridden by the heavily armed DAUGHTERS OF
text: THE AMAZON. Victoria is in the pole position, as her troops
text: begin to LEAP off of their bikes and BOARD the moving
text: freighter’s caboose, like a modern-day Great Train Robbery.
scene_heading: INT. CABOOSE - CONTINUING
text: As Victoria and her followers climb inside, this rear car’s
text: female PASSENGERS scream and clutch their possessions.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: We mean you no harm, sisters!
dialog: We're simply here to liberate you
dialog: from the last of your oppressors!
scene_heading: INT. FREIGHT CAR —- CONTINUING
text: 355 is looking out her freight car’s open side door as the
text: last of the Amazons board the rear of the train. She pulls
text: her head back inside and slides the door closed behind her.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How bad?
text: 355 pulls a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN out of her bag, and hands it to
dialog: Yorick.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Depends how many of these crates
text: have ammo in them.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: We're not going to fight them,
dialog: Three!
dialog: 54
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: No, I’m gonna hold them for as long
dialog: as I can while you make a break for
dialog: the conductor. Tell her to
dialog: disconnect the engine from the rest
dialog: of the cars. She gives you any
dialog: trouble, put that scatter gun to
text: her head.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But you said it yourself, I can’t
dialog: make it to California on my own! I
dialog: need you out there!
text: Push in on 355 as she checks the clip of her HANDGUN.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: This isn’t a democracy, remember?
dialog: Consider it payback for all the
dialog: years women weren’t allowed to
dialog: vote.
speaker_heading: YORICK (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah, well, I’m big into suffrage.
text: 355 turns to see that Yorick is aiming his shotgun at her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Here’s the new plan.
scene_heading: EXT. DIESEL TRAIN - CONTINUING
text: The Daughters of the Amazon are making their way between cars
text: of the moving train. Theresa (the bald Amazon) takes point,
text: and KICKS open the small door at the rear of Yorick and 355's
text: car. Her fellow Amazons follow her inside... but there’s
text: nothing here but big boxes of freight. Yorick and 355 are
text: nowhere to be seen.
text: The women make their way through the car quickly, with
text: Victoria taking up the rear. As her followers exit, Vic
text: stops dead in her tracks. She looks down and sees a FRESH
text: SLICE of canned peach on the floor of this car.
text: She pulls out her own .357 MAGNUM and looks around, finally
text: noticing a CRATE that’s been recently opened, one large
text: enough for two people to hide inside of.
text: Victoria aims her gun at this box as she quickly PRIES open
dialog: its side.
dialog: 55
text: Out come tumbling a dozen CANS OF PEACHES... followed by a
text: dozen HUNGRY RATS. They scurry across Victoria's feet.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
speaker_heading: AHHH!
text: Embarrassed by her less-than-brave reaction, Victoria looks
text: around to make sure none of her women heard it. Finally, she
text: holsters her weapon and prepares to exit the car.
text: But just then, over the rumble of the tracks, Victoria hears
text: an unfamiliar sound. She looks around for its source, before
text: finally staring up at the CEILING of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. FREIGHT CAR ROOF - CONTINUING
text: Cut onto this car’s ROOF, where 355 and Yorick are hiding.
text: Yorick is frantically trying to shut up Ampersand, who's
text: SCREECHING his little head off here.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Exactly who is that thing supposed
dialog: to be helping?
text: Yorick stuffs the monkey into his backpack.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: It’s not my fault! He’s fucking
dialog: learning disabled or something!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (0.S.)
dialog: Men never were very good teachers.
text: 355 and Yorick spin around to see Victoria standing behind
text: them on this moving train. A trigger-happy Yorick attempts
text: to load a shell into his sawed-off shotgun by FLIPPING it by
text: its handle, Terminator 2-style, but sadly, as he spins it,
text: the weapon goes FLYING out of his hand and pinwheeling over
text: the side of the train.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Son of a...
text: 355 is about to draw her weapon, when Victoria warns:
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I don’t have to kill you both, you
dialog: know.
text: 355 keeps her handgun at her side but chivalrously steps IN
text: FRONT of a clearly grateful Yorick.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yeah. You do.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Theresa tells me you’re not who you
dialog: said you were, “Catherine.” That's
dialog: fine. We’re all welcome to remake
dialog: ourselves in this brave new world.
dialog: But don’t tell me that you didn’t
dialog: believe what I had to say.
text: 355 listens silently.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I looked into your eyes. I saw the
dialog: way men have hurt you. It’s time
dialog: to stop protecting our abusers like
dialog: helpless battered wives. We have
dialog: to step aside... and let evolution
dialog: take its course.
dialog: 56
text: Slowly, reluctantly, 355 steps aside, leaving Yorick exposed,
dialog: not to mention confused.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Uh...
text: Victoria again aims her gun at Yorick.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Thank you, sister. You'll be able
dialog: to tell your granddaughters that
dialog: you were there to witness the fall
dialog: of man.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Truer words.
text: All of a sudden, 355 GRABS Yorick and YANKS him over the side
dialog: of the moving train with her!
text: Pull way out, as the train barrels across a LARGE BRIDGE.
text: 355 and Yorick are just tiny figures here, FALLING a hundred
text: feet before finally SPLASHING into a river far below.
text: Victoria watches in disbelief, as Theresa and a few of her
text: fellow Amazons join their leader atop the train.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Victoria, are you...?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I'm... I’m fine.
dialog: 57
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: And the man?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: History.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED AREA —- MAGIC HOUR
text: Cut to later that early evening, as SONIA, an attractive 19-
text: year-old vixen with tattoos and piercings, carries two
text: buckets of water along the bank of a river.
text: Sonia stops in her tracks when she sees AMPERSAND sitting on
text: top of a backpack that’s washed up against a stone. She
text: approaches the little capuchin monkey slowly, careful not to
dialog: frighten it.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Where'd you come from, little guy?
dialog: Guess they musta opened up the zoos
dialog: like they opened up our...
text: Sonia DROPS her two pails as she notices something else
text: that’s washed ashore. It’s YORICK, waterlogged and
text: unconscious, but alive.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Thank you, Jesus.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - EVENING
text: We're looking through Yorick’s P.O.V. As he opens his eyes,
text: a blurry figure looming over him slowly takes shape.
speaker_heading: YORICK (0.S.)
dialog: Beth...?
text: Rack focus to reveal that this is actually Sonia.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Who’s Beth?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Bah!
text: Yorick sits up to find that he’s in Sonia’s messy bedroom,
text: lying in her bed. His clothes are dry now.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 58
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Take it easy.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: My name’s Sonia. I... I found you.
dialog: With your pet.
text: Ampersand eeks over on Sonia’s dresser.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Where did you come from, Yorick?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How the hell do you know my name?
text: She holds up Yorick’s wallet.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Your library card. I didn’t even
dialog: know people still carried--
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh my God. 355. Is she...?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: You mean her?
text: Sonia points across the hall, through the open door to
text: another bedroom, where Agent 355 is sleeping peacefully.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: She's fine. Bit of a bump to the
dialog: head, but she should be all right.
dialog: What happened, Yorick? I just
dialog: found you out there, like Thomas
dialog: Newton or something.
text: Yorick’s confused.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: The Man Who Fell to Earth?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Seriously? You a fan of the book
dialog: or the movie?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Both, I guess. Mostly Bowie, to be
dialog: honest.
dialog: 59
text: Yorick’s almost starting to fall for this girl, when he
text: notices Ampersand playing with his RING BOX.
text: Feeling guilty, Yorick gets up to SNATCH it away.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: That's... that’s cool.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Anyway, we figure you must be some
dialog: kind of genetic anomaly, like those
dialog: prostitutes in Africa that are
dialog: immune to HIV?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Huh, I hadn't...
dialog: (backing up)
dialog: Wait, what do you mean “we?”
text: Sonia walks over to the window of this second-story bedroom.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Yorick, this is a town of sixty-
dialog: seven gossiping women. Did you
dialog: really think I could keep something
dialog: like you a secret?
text: Yorick joins her at the window and looks out to see all SIXTY-
text: SEVEN WOMEN, a collection of various ages and races (but no
text: children), gathered below. They’re looking up at him
text: expectantly.
text: Yorick sighs.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER —- EVENING
text: Back inside the passenger hold of Alter’s helicopter, she and
text: Rachel speak to each other over their headsets.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We might have a hit, Alter. Sixty
text: clicks due south. Girls in the
dialog: listening stations back home are
dialog: reporting a lot of chatter about a
dialog: twenty-something male washing
text: ashore in a little town called
dialog: Marrisville.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Good work. We’ll pay a visit right
dialog: after we refuel.
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Actually, we should probably send
dialog: as many choppers as we can now.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Why? You honestly think some
dialog: undersexed American will be ina
text: hurry to leave an entire village of
dialog: lonely women?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That’s not my concern, Lieutenant-
dialog: General. I’m worried about who
dialog: these women happen to be...
scene_heading: EXT. SONIA’S HOME -- EVENING
text: Back at Sonia’s place, Yorick’s new friend escorts him
text: outside. She introduces him to the town, which stares at
text: this last man with a mixture of disbelief and mistrust.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Marrisville, this is Yorick.
dialog: Yorick, this is Marrisville.
text: Yorick waves shyly.
text: NINA, a middle-aged Hispanic woman gives Yorick the once-
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: You really the last?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I... I don’t know. I think so.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Hn.
text: Sonia leads Yorick through the crowd of gawkers.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Is it just me, or are there no kids
dialog: in this town?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Um, I guess I’m the youngest one,
dialog: yeah. Come on, you want to help me
dialog: in the hydroponic greenhouse?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You have food? Fresh food?
dialog: 61
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Sure. Why so surprised?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: It’s just, almost every post-Plague
dialog: town I’ve been to has looked like
text: the third act of a Godzilla movie.
text: Yorick looks up at the town’s working street lamps.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But you guys still have a perfect
dialog: little utopia.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: I don’t know about that. But we
dialog: did vote to slaughter one of the
dialog: lambs for you tonight. And don't
dialog: feel guilty. Lydia wants us to get
dialog: rid of them anyway, before the damn
text: flies eat them alive.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Lydia?
text: Suddenly, an elderly white woman steps out of the crowd.
speaker_heading: This is LYDIA.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Hard to believe that helpless
dialog: little women can get by without
dialog: your kind, huh?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I... I didn’t mean any disrespect.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: We've all had plenty of experience
text: making do without any men around.
text: Nina steps forward to try to silence Lydia, but the old
text: lady’s on a roll.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Lydia...
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Back in ‘42, the only fellas left
dialog: in this country were the goddamn 4F-
dialog: ers tryin’ to get into our
dialog: overalls. Girls weren't part of
dialog: the workforce, we were the
dialog: workforce.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: LYDIA (cont'd)
dialog: If none of our boys had come home
dialog: alive, we coulda run this place
dialog: just fine on our own... better
dialog: even.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Back up, you said you all had
dialog: experience living without men.
dialog: How? I mean, most of you are a
dialog: little too young to have been doing
dialog: the Rosie the Riveter thing, right?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Maybe Lydia can explain herself
dialog: after we fix you some supper.
text: Sonia starts to pull Yorick away, but Nina calls after him.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Kid. The black girl up there, she
dialog: your wife?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: No! I mean, she’s just a... a
dialog: friend. But Three’s good people.
dialog: She's kind of a government agent.
dialog: But on the downlow, you know?
text: As Sonia and Yorick walk away, Nina and Lydia exchange
text: nervous glances.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Cut to a few minutes later for this establishing shot of an
text: impressive greenhouse. Its windows are fogged with
text: condensation, so we can’t quite see inside.
scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE - CONTINUING
text: Sonia and Yorick enter the well-lit facility, which is filled
text: with fresh flowers and vegetables. They’re alone now.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: So, you and your neighbors all seem
dialog: pretty... close-knit. Do you mind,
dialog: can I ask, are you all, not that I
dialog: care, but...?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Some are, but it’d take a hell of a
dialog: lot more than all the men dying to
dialog: make me suddenly eat pussy.
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Well, you don’t beat around the
dialog: bush. As it were.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: No. I don’t.
text: Suddenly, Sonia PULLS Yorick close and KISSES him deeply.
text: Yorick pushes her away, but only eventually.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Sonia.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: What? Oh my God. Are... are you
dialog: gay?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What? No! No, not at all.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Oh. ‘Cause, talk about irony.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: It’s just, there’s someone else.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: But you said your bodyguard--
text: Yorick pulls out his PHOTO of Beth, which he hands over to
dialog: Sonia.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: No, my fiancee’s name is Beth.
dialog: We’re on our way to find her.
dialog: She's... she’s in Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: It must be hard.
text: Sonia sets aside the photo, and presses herself against
dialog: Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: It is.
text: But Yorick gently pulls away from her.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Look, I’m flattered, but for some
dialog: retarded reason, I was picked to
dialog: survive all this, so I’m trying not
dialog: to take advantage of the situation.
dialog: 64
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: You're not taking advantage of
dialog: anything, Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But I would be. Beth... Beth was
dialog: my first, you know? She was the
dialog: only woman alive who wanted me back
dialog: when I was an unemployed loser. If
dialog: nothing else, I owe her a little
dialog: loyalty.
text: Sonia steps forward and runs her fingers through Yorick’s
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: I’m sure lots of girls wanted you
dialog: back then. They just didn’t know
dialog: how to tell you.
text: Again, she kisses him. Harder this time. The two fall
text: backwards onto one of the greenhouse tables. Sonia is on top
text: of Yorick, who’s clearly wrestling with more than just his
dialog: conscience.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Please. You... you have to get
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I’m trying.
text: She kisses him again.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Beth--
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: --will never know. Besides, this
dialog: isn’t about her. It’s about you
dialog: helping the planet, and the only
dialog: way you can do that is by sowing
dialog: your seed, right?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I love her.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: You think JFK didn’t love Jackie?
dialog: You think MLK didn’t love Coretta?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 65
speaker_heading: SONIA (cont'd)
dialog: Great men fuck around on their
dialog: wives, Yorick, and whether you like
dialog: it or not, you’re the greatest man
text: alive now.
text: Sonia writes against Yorick, who's really struggling to be
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Yorick?
text: Sonia and Yorick look up to see a relatively recuperated
text: AGENT 355 standing in the doorway of this greenhouse.
text: Ampersand is on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You all right?
text: Sonia and Yorick quickly pull themselves apart, like two
text: teens caught making out at Lovers Leap.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: It’s cool. We’re... we’re done
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: (to Yorick)
dialog: I’m so sorry. I... I don’t know
dialog: what came over me, I--
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick, may I borrow you for a
dialog: second?
scene_heading: EXT. GREENHOUSE - CONTINUING
text: 355 drags the embarrassed last man outside. As Yorick
text: finishes buckling his pants, Amp jumps onto his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Look, whatever you saw in there...
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I don’t care. We have to get out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Right now? I mean, this town is a
dialog: wonderland. We should at least
dialog: stock up on provisions and--
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: These people aren’t what you think,
dialog: Yorick. They’re--
speaker_heading: NINA (0.S.)
dialog: That’s far enough.
text: Cut over to Nina, Lydia and several of the other residents of
text: Marrisville. They all have HUNTING RIFLES trained on Yorick
dialog: and 355.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I’m afraid we can’t let some spy
dialog: rat us out to the feds.
text: 355 shoots Yorick a dirty look.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Does the secret in secret agent
dialog: mean anything to you?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What is this? Some kind of
dialog: militia?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: There’s a women's penitentiary
text: about a mile up the road, Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You mean, they’re... they’re
dialog: convicts?
speaker_heading: SONIA (0.S.)
dialog: Escaped convicts, technically.
text: Yorick turns just as Sonia walks out of the greenhouse.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: When all the men died, the warden
dialog: decided to turn us loose... instead
dialog: of letting us starve to death in
dialog: our cells.
text: The other women close in on Yorick and 355.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: The guards lived in the houses
dialog: we're in now. They took off weeks
dialog: ago. Guess they couldn’t stand
dialog: staying where their kin passed.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: None of us wanted to get out like
dialog: this... but it happened. The other
dialog: inmates and I all get along pretty
dialog: well, and we've been taking care of
dialog: ourselves for years already, so
dialog: this community just kinda... fell
dialog: into place.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What did you do? Murder someone?
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Robbed a bank. For a guy. Long
dialog: story.
text: Lydia aims her rifle at Yorick.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: If you’re looking for a killer, you
dialog: got one. I shot my bastard of a
dialog: husband in ‘59 and I don’t regret
dialog: it for a goddamn second.
text: Sonia walks over to Lydia and pushes her rifle down.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: (to Yorick and 355)
dialog: Please. We just want to live in
dialog: peace.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (to the women)
dialog: This isn’t my jurisdiction, and we
dialog: have no intention of telling anyone
dialog: about your situation.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Why should we believe some spook?
text: 355 starts to lose her cool, so it’s Yorick’s turn to play
dialog: peacemaker.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: For your sake, I hope you’re
dialog: talking about my occupation and not
dialog: my race.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Look, let’s all just... pretend
dialog: tonight never happened, okay? 355
dialog: and I have bigger things to worry
dialog: about, so we’re just gonna--
dialog: 68
text: Suddenly, Yorick is illuminated from directly overhead by a
text: burningly bright SPOTLIGHT. He looks up, half-expecting to
dialog: see a mother ship here to take him home.
text: A WHIRLWIND kicks up dirt and leaves as three BLACK HAWK
text: HELICOPTERS descend into view.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It’s a setup!
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: No, I have nothing to do with this!
text: Like the word of God, a familiar voice booms from the heavens
text: over one of the chopper’s loudspeakers. It’s Alter.
speaker_heading: FROM HELICOPTER
dialog: Women of Marrisville, this is not
dialog: your fight! Hand over the boy, and
dialog: no one will be harmed!
text: As the helicopters circle to land in a nearby field, a
text: baffled Yorick turns to 355.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Why does everyone keep calling me
dialog: boy? I'm a college graduate!
text: Nina again swings her rifle in 355’s direction.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Whatever, we're not fighting an
dialog: army. They can take you both for
dialog: all I care.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What the hell does the Israeli
dialog: military want with me?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: If it was anything good, they
dialog: probably only would have brought
text: one gunship.
dialog: (to the women)
dialog: Please. If you hand Yorick over to
dialog: another country, you people will
dialog: never know another peaceful day.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: If we don’t, we'll never know
dialog: another day period.
text: Sonia suddenly steps in front of Yorick and 355.
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Run. They're probably landing by
dialog: the orchard, so you’ve still got a
dialog: few minutes. Take Lewis to
text: Montecito. No street lamps there
dialog: so you'll have some cover for a
dialog: getaway.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: You lost your head, girl?
text: Sonia looks at Yorick with sad eyes.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: We still owe a debt to society, and
dialog: without someone like him, there
dialog: might not be another one.
text: 355 nods gratefully before dragging Yorick away from the
text: scene. As he’s being pulled away, Yorick calls after Sonia.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Wait! Sonia! Come... come with
dialog: us!
text: Sonia just watches with regret as the man who fell to Earth
text: disappears into the darkness.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Good-bye, Yorick.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT
text: 355 and Yorick run through the unlit outskirts of this
text: neighborhood. A winded Yorick is falling out of his Chuck
dialog: Taylors.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Keep up, goddammit!
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Totally... not.. running shoes..
text: As the two round the corner, they run smack into another
text: Black Hawk helicopter, this one parked in the middle of the
dialog: street.
text: Three female I.D.F. SOLDIERS all drop their cigarettes and
text: raise their machine guns as they spot Yorick and his
dialog: bodyguard.
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Four gunships?!
text: The youngest Israeli soldier looks for guidance from her
dialog: older superiors.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: (in Hebrew)
dialog: What... what do we do?
speaker_heading: OLDER SOLDIER
dialog: (in Hebrew)
dialog: We take the male alive, but kill
dialog: anyone who--
text: That’s all 355 needs to hear, as she raises her weapon and
text: FIRES it at the two older soldiers, killing them both
dialog: instantly.
text: Yorick screams in fear and revulsion.
text: 355 aims her Glock at the youngest soldier (she’s frozen in
text: terror), and squeezes the trigger. Nothing. The gun’s empty.
text: With trembling hands, the young soldier aims her SIDEARM at

speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: (in Hebrew)
dialog: Fuh--freeze!
text: 355 instead TOSSES her own weapon aside and CHARGES directly
text: at the young female soldier.
text: The soldier fires wildly as the screaming Culper Ring agent
text: rushes her. 355 eventually TACKLES the soldier, knocking her
text: to the ground. The two wrestle over the Israeli’s firearm,
text: as the young soldier struggles with what few English phrases
dialog: she remembers.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Let go of the gun! Please!
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: Lo! Bevakasha!
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You don’t have to die!
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: Take... take me to my hotel! How
dialog: much does this cost please! Where
dialog: is the library! Which train--
dialog: 71
speaker_heading: BANG.
text: Push in close on the two women, as one of them is SHOT.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Stupid...
text: 355 stands, as the young soldier rattles her last breath.
text: The Culper Ring agent looks over at Yorick, who promptly
text: VOMITS all over his own shoes.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Why... why did you...?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Me or them. Let’s go.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: They were girls! If you’re such a
dialog: fucking markswoman, couldn’t you
dialog: have just wounded them or--
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: This isn’t a comic book, Yorick.
dialog: They knew what they were doing when
dialog: they filled their hands, and so did
dialog: I. Now get in the chopper.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Now we're stealing helicopters?
dialog: No, I... I don’t want anything more
dialog: to do with this.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: If you had listened to me on the
dialog: train, we wouldn’t be in this
dialog: situation! Now do as I fucking
dialog: say!
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Go on without me, Three. I’m tired
dialog: of people dying. I’m... I’m just
dialog: gonna surrender.
text: 355 aims her weapon at Yorick.
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: That stopped being your decision
dialog: the second other countries got
dialog: involved.
text: Ampersand barks in protest, but Yorick hangs his head. He’s
dialog: done fighting.
text: In the distance, a faraway gun battle can be heard.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sonia and her fellow inmates are waging an epic battle
text: against the incoming army, but they’re clearly no match for
dialog: the Israelis’ numbers.
text: As more and more of them take fire, the surviving townswomen
text: eventually lay down their arms and hold up their hands in
text: surrender. Sonia screams in defiance.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Keep fighting! We can take them!
text: As the shooting dies down, Alter steps out from behind her
text: troops’ frontline.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Thank you for your attention. The
dialog: good news is that I have no
dialog: interest in taking prisoners, so
dialog: you don’t need to fear another
dialog: incarceration.
text: Alter pulls out her sidearm and AIMS it at Nina’s head.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: The bad news is that I have no
dialog: objection to field executions.
text: The rest of the townswomen start to rush to Nina’s defense,
text: but the overpowering I.D.F. soldiers back them off.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Tell me where you’re hiding Yorick
dialog: Brown or I start putting bullets in
text: brainpans.
text: Sonia drops her rifle and calls out.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Don’t! He... he ran away!
dialog: 73
text: Alter cocks her gun.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Nonsense, I stationed roadblocks at
dialog: every possible exit. He--
text: After consulting with a young female soldier carrying a RADIO
text: PACK, Rachel steps forward to whisper something to Alter.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Alter, North Team is dead. One of
dialog: our snipers saw their chopper being
text: stolen. She thinks she caught a
text: glimpse of a black woman behind the
dialog: controls.
text: Alter looks at Rachel in stunned silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: (to her troops)
dialog: Kill them all.
text: Sonia charges forward and all of the I.D.F. Soldiers promptly
text: aim their rifles at her.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: Wait! I... I can tell you where he
dialog: went. He has a girlfriend. In
dialog: L.A. Beth something.
text: Careful not to make anyone think she’s reaching for a gun,
text: Sonia slowly pulls out the PHOTO that Yorick left behind.
text: Alter stares at the picture of this once-happy couple with
dialog: interest.
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN AIRSPACE - DAWN
text: Several hours later, 355’s stolen Black Hawk soars just above

scene_heading: INT. STOLEN BLACK HAWK - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick, I’m... I’m sorry about back
dialog: there, okay? I never should have
dialog: pointed a gun at you.

speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yeah, well, guess I opened that
dialog: door.
text: A nervous Yorick just silently stares out the window as their
text: craft barely skims the foliage.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I can’t believe you really know how
dialog: to fly this thing.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I told you, the Culper Ring trained
dialog: me well.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How do you study espionage,
dialog: exactly? Is there some kind of
dialog: correspondence school?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: The Ring recruited me out of a
dialog: foster care facility when I was
dialog: thirteen, after I put two redneck
dialog: teenagers in the hospital for
dialog: calling me names.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Foster care?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: My parents were killed I was six.
text: Yorick suddenly looks guilty.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Don’t be. You weren’t driving the
dialog: truck that night.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You know, before all this, I
dialog: honestly wasn’t sure if your whole
dialog: undercover sister spiel was legit,
dialog: or if you were, you know... insane.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick, a mentally ill person
dialog: wouldn't be able to fly a medium-

dialog: 75
text: Suddenly, the chopper DIPS uncomfortably as one of its
text: extended range fuel tanks accidentally CLIPS a high branch.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Oops.
text: A frightened Yorick looks down at his diaper-clad monkey, who
text: yelps.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (quietly, to Amp)
dialog: Yeah, I’m gonna need a diaper
dialog: change, too, buddy.
text: 355 activates a few controls on her dash.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: If you want to help, check that
dialog: navigation computer and make sure
dialog: we're on target for San Fran.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: We're still headed to this Attack
dialog: of the Clones doctor?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: A few refuelings aside, we should
dialog: be able to fly a straight shot to
dialog: her lab. It’s more important than
dialog: ever that we find out why you’re
text: still alive.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yeah, but what if Victoria and her
dialog: goons get to Mann’s joint first?
dialog: We lost some time in Marrisville.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Don’t worry, the trains are about

speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: “Ma'am” is short for madam, the

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Let her speak, Theresa.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR

text: stop at the next station to pick up
dialog: medical supplies for California.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: That can wait, sister.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Begging your pardon, but it can’t.
dialog: If you care about women so much,
dialog: there are girls with diabetes and
dialog: whatnot suffering as we speak.
dialog: Seeing how the shipping lanes died
dialog: with all the sailor boys, the only
dialog: way anyone’s gettin’ insulin is--
text: Victoria puts a hand on the frightened woman's back.

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Nothing is more resilient or

scene_heading: EXT. L.A. TRIAGE CENTER - EVENING
text: Cut to later that night, where HUNDREDS OF WOMEN are gathered

scene_heading: INT. L.A. TRIAGE CENTER - CONTINUING
text: Push inside, where Yorick’s long lost girlfriend BETH DEVILLE

text: FEMALE COMMUNITY LEADERS in a meeting. She turns her
text: attention to a young Asian woman named CHLOE.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: All right, so Fara is taking care

speaker_heading: CHLOE
text: A step above Pony Express, but a

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Speaking of which, how are we on

speaker_heading: CHLOE

scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS’S MCCARRAN AIRPORT - CONTINUING
text: Cut over to the airport across the highway, where Yorick and
text: 355 calmly watch this conflagration. Their grounded
text: helicopter is REFUELING next to a tanker truck at the Vegas
text: airport. Ampersand is playing on the hose connected to the
dialog: Black Hawk.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: This is men’s fault, too, right?
dialog: Because we taught our daughters to
dialog: be showgirls instead of firemen?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Firefighters.
text: Yorick is fed up.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You know, I’m not the He-Man Woman-
dialog: Hater you think I am. I didn’t
dialog: roadie for Lilith Fair or anything,
dialog: but I’m down with the cause. I
dialog: rarely make sexist jokes, always
dialog: hold doors open for ladies...
text: Suddenly, 355 gets into a SPARRING position.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I mean, I never hold doors open?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I’m not always going to be around
dialog: to protect you, Yorick. But the
dialog: S.U.V. of the sky here needs
dialog: another ten to finish gassing up,
dialog: so I figured I might as well teach
dialog: you a little self-defense.
text: Yorick waves her off.
dialog: 79
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’ve gotten myself out of plenty of
text: scrapes before, thanks.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: In what, Double Dragon?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Double Dragon? What are you,
dialog: forty?
text: 355 playfully flicks him the finger.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Like many a high school nerd, I
dialog: survived bullies in the tried and
dialog: true fashion of fighting like a
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Which means what exactly?
speaker_heading: YORICK
text: Scratching eyes, pulling hair,
dialog: kicking balls. Not that the last
dialog: one is so applicable anymore...
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Why not just go to the gym?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What’s the point? You know what
dialog: the strongest muscle in the human
dialog: body is?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: The heart?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: No, it’s not the heart, you sappy
dialog: fuck. It’s your jaw muscle. Even
dialog: a scrawny dude like me has five
text: hundred pounds of bite strength.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Great, that’1l come in handy when
dialog: you're fighting food.
text: As the helicopter continues to refuel, the two sit down on
text: its edge and watch the fires continue to rage in the
dialog: distance.
text: Ampersand scampers over to sit on Yorick’s lap.
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Hey, before all this, did you, you
dialog: know? Have somebody?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Not for a while. My relationships
dialog: always ended bad.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Because of your job?
text: 355 takes a deep breath.
text: She softens a bit.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Because men are all cheating
dialog: bastards.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh. Hey, look, what happened with
dialog: Sonia...
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Relax. You’ve got to be the only
dialog: guy on the planet who’d end up in
dialog: this position and not try to bang
dialog: everything that moves.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yeah, well, I scored someone way
dialog: above my pay grade.
text: A wave of sadness suddenly washes over Yorick. 355
text: recognizes it and reaches out to touch his shoulder.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
text: Beth is still out there, Yorick.
dialog: You’1l find her soon and she’1l be
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I don’t. I’m just saying whatever
dialog: shit will get you to stop moping.
text: A smiling Yorick sets Ampersand down and stands into sparring
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Okay, show me what you got, killer.
dialog: 81
text: 355 rises to meet him.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355

scene_heading: EXT. CALIFORNIA TRAIN STATION -- EVENING

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Last stop, Victoria, and Dr. Mann's
dialog: laboratory is gonna take at least
dialog: another ten hours to reach on foot.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Why the hell would we travel on
dialog: foot, Theresa?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Well, bikes are pretty much
dialog: nonexistent after we lost ours
dialog: boarding this thing, and the
text: highways are too clogged with
dialog: makeshift hearses for us to all
dialog: pile into a Greyhound or whatever.
text: Walking along the tracks, Victoria approaches a LIVESTOCK
speaker_heading: CAR.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Do you know what the Girl Scout

text: Victoria stops in front of a car filled with a dozen young

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Same as the Boy Scouts’.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Hours later, 355’s helicopter LANDS in the empty parking lot
text: just outside of Mann’s modest laboratory in San Francisco.
text: Push in on the craft, as Yorick (with Ampersand on his
text: shoulder) exits the helicopter with Agent 355. They inspect
text: the darkened lab.
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Abandoned?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Maybe. I’11 look around. You and
dialog: your animal stay here.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: And let you inspect the mad
dialog: scientist’s haunted laboratory all
dialog: by yourself? If you insist...
text: Ampersand chirps as 355 walks into the black building.
scene_heading: INT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY -- CONTINUING
text: 355 steps inside the eerily quiet building and draws her
text: sidearm, just in case.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Hello?
text: Just then, she hears something SNAP behind a door to her
dialog: left.
text: Slowly, 355 turns its knob and pushes her way inside. A
text: small GENERATOR is whirring away quietly as it powers
scene_heading: numerous COMPUTER TERMINALS, ELECTRON MICROSCOPES, etc.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Dr. Mann? Dr. Allison M--
text: Suddenly, a figure steps out from behind the door and presses
text: a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE millimeters away from a frozen 355's
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: It’s DR. MANN.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: There are enough sedatives in this
dialog: syringe to put a woman twice your
dialog: size to sleep for a month.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I’m not here to hurt you, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: The Black Hawk you parked in the
text: handicap spot suggests otherwise.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I’m here to protect you. I’m Agent
dialog: 355, I--
text: A terrified Mann immediately BACKS AWAY from her hostage.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: You work for the Culper Ring?
text: With lightning speed, 355 reaches up and GRABS Mann’s wrist,
text: snatching the hypodermic away from her.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: How the hell do you know about the
dialog: Culpers?
text: Dr. Mann takes a seat in one of her lab chairs, exhausted.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: You're the people responsible for
dialog: all this.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: “Project: Setting Son” or whatever
dialog: you monsters called it.
text: A disbelieving 355 aims her Glock at the doctor.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Please, if you’re going to kill me,
dialog: just do it, but spare me the
text: feigned ignorance.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Doctor, look at me. I have no idea
dialog: what this is all about. I’m here
dialog: to protect you from... from people
dialog: who want to use you.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Like your superiors did?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Which superiors?
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: You're serious? The Culper men
dialog: honestly kept their foot soldiers
dialog: in the dark about their real plans?
text: 355 lowers her gun and sits down across from Mann, ready to
dialog: listen.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Your “ring” was terrified of the
dialog: possibility of our country
text: eventually having to fight a ground
dialog: war with the Chinese military. So
dialog: aman named 1033 ("Ten-thirty-
dialog: three”) apparently began
dialog: considering the possibility of a
text: preemptive biological strike.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: How... how do you know all this?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Because Ten told me. He came here
dialog: once a week, offered me millions in
dialog: exchange for helping to make his
text: sick vision a reality.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: His vision?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Discretely releasing a chemical
dialog: agent into Beijing’s air supply,
dialog: one that wouldn’t harm civilians...
dialog: but would prevent its women from
text: conceiving male children. His hope
dialog: was that it could be used to
dialog: effectively cripple China’s
dialog: economic and military capabilities
dialog: within a generation.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Someone from the Culper Ring did
dialog: this? That's... that’s impossible.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: If only. I refused to have
dialog: anything to do with Ten’s tests,
dialog: but he and his team proceeded to
dialog: the experimental stage without me.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: What always happens when man tries
dialog: to fuck with Mother Nature.
text: Dr. Mann stands and looks out her window at nothing in
dialog: particular.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: I knew the second I read their
dialog: preliminary research that the
dialog: environmental impact of even an
dialog: isolated test would be severe...
dialog: but I had no idea it would be this.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: But, how did it spread so quickly?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Morphogenetic fields? Trade winds?
dialog: Migrating flocks? Your guess is as
dialog: good as mine. All I know is that
text: there doesn’t seem to be one corner
dialog: of the globe that wasn’t affected.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Can it be reversed?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: I can’t raise the dead, Agent.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: But, can you bring mankind back to
dialog: the planet?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: The Plague destroyed every last
text: sperm, fetus and fully developed
dialog: mammal with a Y chromosome. And
dialog: whatever was released into the
dialog: atmosphere is still there. I've
dialog: attempted to make new XY rats by
dialog: using the cells of dead subjects,
text: but they all end up suffering the
dialog: same fate as their late brethren.
dialog: I'm afraid a living male will never
dialog: again set foot on this planet.
speaker_heading: YORICK (0.S.)
dialog: Then this is one small step for
dialog: man...
text: 355 and Dr. Mann turn to see YORICK walk inside the room.
text: Ampersand is on his shoulder, as always.
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Etcetera, etcetera.
text: Mann’s jaw goes slack.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Oh... oh my God.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I get that a lot.
text: Much to Yorick’s surprise, the doctor rushes over to inspect
dialog: Ampersand.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: The size of those canines. Is this
dialog: monkey a male?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Uh, yeah. Actually, I’m also--
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Obviously. I could understand one
dialog: of you being some kind of mutation,
dialog: but how did you both survive?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Doc, the last time I delved into
dialog: science on my own, it involved a
text: baking soda volcano nearly blowing
dialog: off one of my testicles. I was
dialog: kinda hoping you had some answers.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Where did you find this creature?
text: Mann takes Ampersand from Yorick, but the animal LEAPS out of
text: her hands and starts playing with one of the nearby TEST
speaker_heading: TUBES.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Online, at this volunteer group’s
dialog: website. But maybe Ampersand... I
dialog: don’t know, escaped from some Area
dialog: 51 research facility first. He
dialog: certainly seems at home here.
text: Mann inspects Ampersand’s fur.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: He’s not tagged with any lab
dialog: markings. I'11 need to take a
dialog: blood sample. From both of you.
dialog: 87
text: 355 is lost in her own world, still processing her group’s
dialog: unforgivable betrayal.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I... I dedicated my life to those
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’m sorry, Three, but we gotta save
dialog: the existential crises for later,
dialog: right?
dialog: (to Mann)
dialog: Do whatever you need to get
dialog: started, Doc, but there’s a crazy
dialog: train blowing into town with your
dialog: name on it, so we should really be
dialog: out of here by morning.
text: Mann ominously pulls on a single RUBBER GLOVE.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: We'll leave when I’m good and
dialog: ready. Last man or not, it’s going
dialog: to take more than the apocalypse
dialog: for me to start taking orders from
dialog: my patients.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Have you seen Citizen Kane?

scene_heading: INT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Open on an image of Y-SHAPED PROTEINS as seen through an
text: incredibly powerful microscope.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN (0.S.)
dialog: It’s about sex.
text: Pull out, as Mann looks up from her work.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Like everything, it’s about sex.
text: 355 and Yorick are confused.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: A foreign agent was introduced into
dialog: your animal’s bloodstream, and his
dialog: immune system produced unique
dialog: antibodies to fight it. Somehow,
dialog: these antibodies had the added side
dialog: effect of masking him from the
dialog: effects of the Plague.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: How'd this “foreign agent” end up
dialog: inside a monkey?
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
text: It appears to travel through the
dialog: body much like syphilis or
dialog: hepatitis, so my guess is that it
dialog: was sexually transmitted.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But... how did it get inside me?
text: 355 and Dr. Mann just stare at Yorick and Ampersand.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Okay, that’s just sick. I did not
dialog: blow my monkey!
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Well, did it ever bite you deeply
dialog: enough to draw blood?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: No, the only person he ever bit
dialog: was...
text: The truth slowly dawns on Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
text: Beth. JI fucked Beth.
text: 355 and Dr. Mann just look at each other.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Look, I had sex with my girlfriend,
dialog: and Ampersand bit her. Whatever
dialog: mojo saved the two of us must have
dialog: come from Beth.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: How’s that possible? How is she
dialog: connected with the Culper Ring?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: She’s not. I don’t think this
dialog: antidote was created deliberately.
dialog: It’s another moldy Petri dish that
text: turns out to be penicillin.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Beth isn’t mildew, she’s a genius.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: I don’t care about her mind, I care
dialog: about her body. What made her
dialog: special?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: DR. MANN (cont'd)
dialog: Was she ever diagnosed with a rare
dialog: blood disorder? Polycythemia vera
dialog: or Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura
dialog: or--
speaker_heading: YORICK
text: Her shot. Beth’s been testing some
dialog: kind of... of injectable
text: contraceptive on herself.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Then she might be the greatest
dialog: failure in the history of
dialog: science... because her “birth
dialog: control” could very well be the key
dialog: to repopulating the entire planet.
text: As this slowly sinks in, a vindicated Yorick celebrates.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I knew it! I knew we should have
dialog: been looking for Beth all along!
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Doctor, can you replicate the
dialog: antibodies inside Yorick and
dialog: Ampersand?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Maybe, but I need to know exactly
dialog: what triggered their creation
dialog: before I can retro-engineer an
dialog: inoculation.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Then we have to get to Los Angeles
dialog: fast, before Beth--
text: Suddenly, a SQUAWKING is heard coming from outside Mann's
text: laboratory window. 355 draws her weapon.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: The hell is that?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Sounds like it’s coming from our
text: copter.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY - CONTINUING
text: 355 warily escorts her companions outside, as Yorick notes a
text: flashing light on the helicopter’s cockpit.
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: We have a radio?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Don't touch it, Yorick. Just--
speaker_heading: FROM RADIO
dialog: I repeat, this message is for
dialog: Yorick Brown. You have until
dialog: midnight to surrender yourself to
dialog: us at the Hearst Castle in San
dialog: Simeon. If you don’t, we will be
dialog: forced to terminate your loved one.
text: The blood drains out of Yorick’s face as his GIRLFRIEND’S
text: VOICE comes over the speaker.
speaker_heading: FROM RADIO
dialog: You people are insane! My
dialog: boyfriend is dead! Yorick is dead!
text: Change angles so that we’re now looking at Yorick through the
text: familiar P.O.V. of a pair of BINOCULARS.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO HILLTOP - NIGHT
text: Reverse angles to reveal that these field glasses belong to
text: Victoria, who’s standing at the top of a nearby San Francisco
text: hill, in front of her assembled troops, most of whom are now
text: mounted on HORSEBACK.
text: Victoria lowers the binoculars to speak with Theresa, her
text: bald-headed second-in-command.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I don’t suppose that’s his clone?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Where the hell did they get a
dialog: helicopter?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I have no idea, but we’re not
dialog: letting him steal the good doctor
dialog: for himself. Bring me Sam.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Victoria just glares at Theresa, who quickly summons TWO
text: AMAZON RECRUITS carrying a LONG CRATE.
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Sorry, just thought we were saving
dialog: her to use on Mount Rushmore.
dialog: Victoria opens this box...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: The best laid plans of mice and
dialog: men...

speaker_heading: LAUNCHER.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Cut back to Yorick and the others, outside the helicopter,
text: still debating what to do about Beth.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: We have to tell these people what
dialog: they have. This Beth girl is the
dialog: Holy Grail!
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Somehow, I don’t think that’s going
dialog: to make the Israelis more likely to
dialog: part with her.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Then I have to give myself up.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: No. If they take you, it’s going
dialog: to destabilize the entire world.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Like it’s not destabilized already?
dialog: What difference is one less guy
dialog: gonna make to the--
text: Just then, Yorick and the others are violently THROWN to the
text: ground, as the entire tail section of the Black Hawk EXPLODES
text: after being struck by a S.A.M. missile.
text: 355 groggily gets to her feet, and looks up to see a STAMPEDE
text: of mounted Amazons charging down a hill in the background.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What?
dialog: 93
text: 355 yells at a temporarily deafened Yorick, who's holding his
text: terrified pet monkey.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: We have to get out of here!
speaker_heading: YORICK
speaker_heading: WHAT?
text: An impatient 355 helps a disoriented Dr. Mann to her feet.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Do you have a car?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: What does that mean?
scene_heading: EXT. REAR ALLEY - CONTINUING
text: Open tight on a “Y” logo, and pull out to reveal that it’s
text: attached to the front of a 1990 YUGO CONVERTIBLE.
text: Yorick and his companions race for this tiny vehicle, which
text: is parked in the narrow alleyway behind Mann's lab.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: A Yugo?!
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Hey, don’t blame me for this
dialog: country’s pathetic funding of the
dialog: sciences!
text: 355 throws her duffel bag into the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Mann, you drive. Yorick, get in
dialog: the back and keep your head down.
text: 355 pulls out a PUMP-ACTION MOSSBERG.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I got shotgun.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO HILLTOP - CONTINUING
text: Outside the alley, the car soon SCREECHES around the corner.
dialog: 94
text: The vehicle dodges several larger cars still parked in the
text: middle of the street (leftover victims of the Plague), as
text: Mann & Co. are immediately confronted by the oncoming posse
text: of horse-riding Daughters of the Amazons.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Are you kidding me?
text: The car’s hood is soon PEPPERED with shots fired from the
text: rifle-toting Amazons. 355 leans out of the convertible and
scene_heading: RETURNS FIRE.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Don’t shoot the horses!
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Don’t you experiment on animals for
dialog: a living?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: You kill a horse, I’11l drive us
dialog: into a lamppost!
text: 355 shakes her head as she SHOOTS another girl, careful not
dialog: to hit any of the mares.
text: The Yugo FLIES past Victoria, who circles around to GIVE
text: CHASE to the slow-moving car.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: We want the doctor alive! Save
dialog: your bullets for the boy!
text: Inside the car, Yorick sticks his head up from the back seat.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What’s this thing’s top speed,
dialog: eleven?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: It’s a goddamn obstacle course!
dialog: I'm doing my best!
text: 355 turns around and angrily PUSHES Yorick back down, as she
text: FIRES a shot over his head.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Do better! If we can’t shake them
dialog: by San Simeon, we'll have two sides
dialog: going to war over Yorick!
text: Suddenly realizing what she’s just said, 355 lowers her gaze
text: to look down at Yorick, whose expression is equally knowing.
dialog: 95
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - NIGHT
dialog: Welcome to this ridiculously palatial estate overlooking the

text: of their two parked helicopters, while the third chopper
text: circles directly above this modern-day Xanadu.
scene_heading: INT. HEARST’S PRIVATE SUITE - CONTINUING
text: Inside Mr. Hearst's private suite, a room filled with an

text: for help echo throughout this massive room.
scene_heading: EXT. SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING
text: Just outside Beth’s makeshift prison, Alter and Rachel are
text: surveying troop movements from the castle’s GRAND BALCONY.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yorick’s not coming for her, Alter.
dialog: He could have any woman he wanted!
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: So could Menelaus, and he still
dialog: launched a thousand ships to

text: Alter points at an APPROACHING VEHICLE kicking up dust in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: The woman he can’t have.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - NIGHT
text: Cut inside this approaching vehicle, as a nervous Mann
text: chauffeurs 355 and Yorick towards certain doom.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: How sure are you about this plan?
text: Yorick and 355 speak over each other.
scene_heading: YORICK AGENT 355
dialog: Forty percent. Ten percent.
dialog: 96
text: Dr. Mann just sighs, as Yorick reaches back to pull up the
text: vehicle’s CONVERTIBLE TOP.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: That’s a combined fifty percent,
dialog: baby. Even odds we live through
dialog: this...
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

scene_heading: EXT. SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING
text: Rachel inspects the car through BINOCULARS, as Alter gives

speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: He’s not alone. Looks like at
dialog: least two others in there, but
dialog: snipers won’t be able to get a
text: clear shot at them while the top is
dialog: up. A Trojan Horse?
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: (through bullhorn)
dialog: Hold your fire until the target is
dialog: out of the vehicle! Approach with

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ah, Alter?
text: An annoyed Alter lowers her megaphone.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Forget the horse... they brought

scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: Cut back outside, as VICTORIA leads her mounted troops

dialog: 97
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Victoria, what is this?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Endgame.

scene_heading: INT. YUGO - CONTINUING
text: Back inside the vehicle, the trio nervously watches this

speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: We're dead.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: No, the Amazons won't risk hurting
dialog: you, and the Israelis want Yorick
dialog: alive. They’re not going to be
dialog: shooting at us.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Yeah, haven’t you ever seen two
dialog: girls go at it over a guy, Doc?
dialog: After the first slap, they forget
dialog: he ever existed.
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: As Victoria’s followers keep their weapons trained on the
text: opposing army, the Amazon leader addresses the Israelis.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Sisters, your animal instincts tell
dialog: you to shelter this boy, but ask
dialog: yourselves, are you animals or are
dialog: you women? Why give your lives to
dialog: defend some testosterone-drunk
dialog: predator?
scene_heading: EXT. SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: ALTER

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The enemy of our enemy...?
speaker_heading: ALTER

speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Air team, take them out.
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER - CONTINUING

scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: As her mounted warriors take heavy fire, Victoria barks out
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Kill them all, let the Goddess sort
dialog: them out!
text: Theresa again produces the S.A.M. Launcher, which she FIRES
text: at the helicopter above. Its main rotor EXPLODES and the
text: helpless craft spirals towards oblivion, ultimately CRASHING
text: on top of several I.D.F. ground troops.
text: The Amazons cheer, but the surviving Israelis quickly resume
text: their firefight.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - CONTINUING
text: With the two armies otherwise occupied, 355 gathers her
text: weapons and reaches for the passenger-side door.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: All right, I’m gonna make a break
text: around back and try to find Beth.
dialog: As long as these assholes don’t run
dialog: out of bullets, you two should be
dialog: safe in here.
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Three...
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Doctor, if I’m not back in five,
dialog: peel the hell out of here and do
dialog: what you can with Yorick.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Three!
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: Yorick calls after her, but 355 is already gone. As she
text: dodges the crossfire, 355 DIVES for a row of hedges on the
dialog: sidelines of this battle.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - CONTINUING
text: Back inside the tiny car, Ampersand LEAPS out of Yorick’s
text: arms and goes running out the car’s window after 355.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Goddammit, Ampersand! Get back--
text: Yorick starts to open his door, but quickly closes it as a
text: HAIL OF GUNFIRE kicks up dirt just outside the car.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE GARDEN - CONTINUING
text: At the rear of the sprawling estate, 355 carefully lurks
text: around a maze of crumbling old marble columns. She
text: accidentally brushes past a loose fragment of one of these
text: pillars, which falls to the ground with a not insignificant
speaker_heading: CHUNK.
text: Nearby, the TWO LONE I.D.F. GIRLS entrusted with guarding
text: this rear entrance turn their machine guns in the direction
text: of this sound. An outgunned 355 steadies her SILENCED PISTOL
text: and takes a breath, preparing to confront these women.
text: Just then, a SCREECHING is heard, and the two soldiers pivot
text: to see Ampersand hissing at them from another column in the
dialog: background.
text: Before this bizarre sight has time to sink in with the two
text: soldiers, 355 takes advantage of the distraction to SHOOT the
text: women dead. 355 looks at the capuchin monkey with a hint of
dialog: gratitude.
dialog: 100
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: You're finally good for som--
text: Unfortunately, Ampersand proves to be just as useless as
dialog: ever, as his noises apparently attracted the attention of a
text: THIRD GUARD, one who promptly SHOOTS 355.
text: The bullet enters high in her left collarbone, just above her
text: heart, with enough force to KNOCK 355 backwards. Before she
text: falls, 355 squeezes off a single round, HITTING her attacker
text: square in the eye.
text: COLLAPSING to the ground, 355 fights to maintain
text: consciousness, but her eyes start to roll back into her head.
text: Ampersand watches all this with seeming indifference.
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: Back at the main battlezone, Victoria again rallies her
dialog: followers.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Hold your ground, sisters! Give me
dialog: cover while I retrieve our savior!
text: Still on horseback, Victoria’s mare GALLOPS into the fray.
text: The Amazon dismounts when she reaches Yorick’s vehicle.
text: She promptly RIPS OPEN the Yugo’s driver-side door.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Dr. Mann, I presume.
text: Victoria starts PULLING Mann out of the car, but Yorick is
text: holding onto the doctor’s feet.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Don’t struggle, you belong with me.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: I only... date... sane chicks!
text: Mann pulls out the same HYPODERMIC she threatened 355 with,
text: and PLUNGES it into Victoria’s arm. The Amazon leader looks
text: at this needle with confusion before finally COLLAPSING,
text: while Yorick PULLS Mann back inside the car.
dialog: 101
scene_heading: EXT. SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING
text: Back on the balcony, Rachel watches the battle with disgust.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: By the time we kill the last of
dialog: these maniacs, they’1l have wiped
dialog: out half our platoon. We have to
dialog: stop this!
text: Cut over to Alter, as she opens a crate of GAS GRENADES.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: I concur.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Fentanyl? No, the gas is too
dialog: unpredictable. When the Russians
dialog: used it on those Chechen women--
speaker_heading: ALTER
text: Yorick’s a virile young man. It
dialog: won't kill him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But if the wind carries a strong
dialog: enough concentration our girls’
dialog: way, they could be paralyzed or
dialog: worse. We have to call them back
dialog: first!
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Retreat? And risk letting those
dialog: savages escape with our prize?
text: Push in on Alter, as she begins loading a grenade into a
text: large RIOT GUN.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: I'm afraid that’s not an option.
text: Cut back to Rachel, as she reluctantly DRAWS her sidearm and
text: aims it at her superior.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Put it down, Lieutenant-General.
text: Alter slowly lowers the riot gun.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You remember the punishment for
dialog: treason, I trust?
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I should have done this back in Tel
dialog: Aviv. You’re a disgrace to our
dialog: country and our--
text: With a flick of the wrist, Alter produces a DAGGER WITH A
text: PEARL HANDLE. She steps forward and quickly PLUNGES it into
text: Rachel’s heart.
text: She stares into the girl’s eyes as Rachel’s pupils become
text: still and black.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: I forgive you.
text: As Rachel’s lifeless body crumbles to the balcony floor,
text: Alter picks up her riot gun and LAUNCHES several grenades
text: down at the ongoing battle below.
text: Push past Alter into a close-up of Beth, still hostage in the
text: room behind her. The gagged girl has been watching this
text: entire act of barbarism. Her eyes flash both fear and rage.
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: As the fentanyl gas grenades IMPACT against the battlefield,
text: I.D.F. soldiers immediately drop their weapons and KEEL OVER.
text: The Amazons soon follow suit, as their horses struggle to
text: stay upright before finally COLLAPSING, pinning the equally
text: unconscious female warriors under their heavy bodies.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - CONTINUING
text: Inside the vehicle, Mann watches this shocking display of
dialog: chemical warfare with terror.
text: A panicking Yorick fumbles for the little car’s buttons.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: The windows!
text: But a frantic Mann quickly opens her door and starts to climb
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: No, the vents will let it all in
dialog: anyway! We have to get outside!
dialog: Get low! Get...
dialog: 103
text: Push in on an instantly unconscious Mann, as she promptly
text: falls FACE FIRST onto the hard earth.
scene_heading: INT. HEARST’S PRIVATE SUITE - CONTINUING
text: Beth shudders as someone PULLS OFF her cloth gag. She looks
text: up to see Alter standing over her.
speaker_heading: ALTER
text: It’s over now.
text: Beth promptly SPITS in Alter’s face.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You're a fucking Nazi.
text: After a nerve-wracking beat, Alter just calmly wipes her face
text: with Beth’s gag.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: If you want to live to see your
dialog: boyfriend, I'd advise against
dialog: comparing me to the scum that
dialog: slaughtered my grandfather.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: If the jackboot fits.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Your hatred is unjustified...
scene_heading: EXT. HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING
text: Alter’s words continue over images of the gas cloud swirling
text: around the still bodies on the battlefield below.
speaker_heading: ALTER (V.O.)
dialog: .+-your true love is only sleeping.
text: Push in on Yorick’s body. He’s lying down on his stomach
text: just outside of the car.
speaker_heading: ALTER (V.O.)
dialog: Dreaming of you, no doubt.
text: But suddenly, Yorick’s body begins to MOVE. Track over to
text: his face, which we can now see is wearing the familiar GAS
dialog: MASK Yorick’s been carrying with him since New York!
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: ALTER (V.O.)
dialog: The boy will be fine in a few
dialog: hours.
text: The gasmask-clad Yorick looks around to make sure that no one
text: is watching, before he reaches for one of the fallen Amazon's
text: REVOLVERS. He picks it up, and triumphantly RISES.
speaker_heading: ALTER (V.O.)
dialog: And he’1l wake in a much safer
dialog: world.
text: Walking into the noxious fog that still lingers over the
text: grounds, Yorick DISAPPEARS.
scene_heading: INT. HEARST’S PRIVATE SUITE - CONTINUING
text: Smash cut back to a disbelieving Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What the fuck are you?
text: Alter turns her back on the girl and starts to walk out of
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Alter Tse’elon.
text: Beth calls after her.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Isn’t that a guy’s name?
text: Alter stops in her tracks. She turns to look back at Beth.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Don’t tell me Yorick found himself
dialog: a nice Jewish girl. But only half,
dialog: no? Your mother must have found
dialog: herself a nice Aryan to settle down
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Alter. It means “old one,” right?
text: Alter approaches her.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: A stupid tradition. Two of my
dialog: siblings died at birth, so when my
dialog: parents had me, they decided never
dialog: to speak my real name aloud.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: ALTER (cont'd)
dialog: The nickname is meant to deceive
dialog: the Angel of Death, so that he’1ll
dialog: never be able to find me.
text: Beth just sneers.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Today's the day he catches up with
dialog: you.
text: A sinisterly smiling Alter gets close to the girl’s face.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Really? Have you guessed my true
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah. It starts with “C” and
dialog: rhymes with “cunt.”
text: Cut over to the gun-wielding YORICK, as he dramatically rips
text: off his gasmask with his free hand.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: YORICK!
text: He confidently aims his weapon at Alter, but she immediately
text: steps behind the still-bound Beth, and presses her pearl-
text: handled DAGGER against the stunned girl’s throat.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Drop it before I open her.
text: Yorick looks at the revolver in his trembling hand. There
text: are only TWO BULLETS in its chambers. What if he misses?
text: Reluctantly, Yorick lowers the weapon.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’m sorry, Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yorick, it’s fine! Go, get out of
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: No, not just about this. I’m...
dialog: I’m sorry about before. I lied to
dialog: you.
text: Beth is confused, but Alter’s just impatient.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: This is not fucking couples
dialog: therapy!
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I told you I got Ampersand because
dialog: I wanted to help people, but
dialog: really, I just wanted to impress
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yorick, leave!
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I love you, Beth, but everything
dialog: I’ve ever done, I’ve done for
dialog: myself. I don’t know why fate
dialog: chose a selfish bastard like me,
dialog: but she made a huge mistake.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: If you want to help your girl, why
dialog: the hell are you still talking?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Because, men are only better than
dialog: women at one thing.
dialog: Alter can’t resist.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: And what might that be?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: This.
text: Suddenly, Yorick SPINS his revolver’s open wheel, before
text: slamming it shut... and PRESSING THE GUN TO HIS OWN TEMPLE.
text: He closes his eyes and plays his first round of Russian
dialog: Roulette.
speaker_heading: CLICK.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I’m useless to you dead, right?
dialog: Let her go, or I punch my own
dialog: ticket.
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You're lying. That gun’s even not
dialog: loaded. You’d never--
text: Yorick interrupts her by FIRING a shot into the marble floor.
text: Beth and Alter flinch in shock, as Yorick again SPINS the
text: wheel and takes aim at his own skull.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: All it takes is one, right?
text: Push in close on the gun, as we see the one remaining bullet
text: start to move into position behind the revolver’s slowly
text: descending hammer.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: No!
text: Just as Yorick’s about to squeeze the trigger, Alter THROWS
text: her pearl-handled dagger at his WRIST!
text: As the dagger EMBEDS itself just below Yorick’s hand, the
text: last man DROPS his weapon before it discharges.
text: Alter RUNS for the fallen weapon, but Yorick KICKS it away
text: before she can get her hands on it.
text: As Alter cautiously approaches him, Yorick YANKS the dagger
text: out of his wrist. He’s trying to look like a badass as he
text: wields the blade, but the pain is unbearable.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: AHH! Holy shit did that hurt!
text: As Yorick continues to brandish the dagger, Alter suddenly
text: CHARGES at him.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You've never even met pain.
text: Alter KICKS the knife out of Yorick’s hand before ferociously
text: HEAD-BUTTING him between the eyes.
text: As a stunned Yorick falls backwards, Alter calmly picks up
text: her dagger, tucks it into her belt, and heads for the
text: revolver. But just as she’s about to reach this gun, Yorick
text: catches a second wind and DIVES for it. The two violently
text: WRESTLE over the weapon... until a SHOT finally rings out.
text: Yorick smiles. This is just like what happened with 355 and
dialog: the Israeli soldier back in Marrisville, right?
dialog: 108
text: Wrong. A horrified Alter looks down to see the smoking
text: weapon in her hand... and a smoldering hole in Yorick's
text: shirt, just to the left of his belly button.
text: Yorick slumps to the ground, and Beth is too shocked to
dialog: scream.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: No...
text: A worried Alter stumbles back to Beth. The solider DRAWS her
text: blood-stained dagger. Beth flinches, but Alter just SLICES
text: her free of her restraints. She points at the fallen Yorick.
speaker_heading: ALTER
speaker_heading: FIX HIM!
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm... I’m not a medic, I’m just
dialog: Asee
text: A furious Alter glares at the girl.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I‘1l need your knife.
dialog: More glaring.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: To cut his clothes.
text: Alter reluctantly flips the pearl-handled blade around and
text: hands it to Beth, but not before she AIMS Yorick’s sidearm at
text: her, and takes a defensive position near the room’s one
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Don’t fuck up.
text: Beth runs over to Yorick, quickly kneeling at his side. She
text: brushes his hair affectionately before she tears into his
text: shirt with her knife.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (smiling, playfully
dialog: sarcastic)
dialog: My knight in shining armor.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Right, more like... your damsel in
dialog: distress.
dialog: 109
text: As Beth goes to work, Yorick whispers to her:
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Listen to me. Don’t worry about
dialog: Alter. That gun... is empty now.
dialog: You have... to let me die.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don’t talk like that.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: The world’s... safer without me.
dialog: Just-—
text: Alter angrily aims her gun at the young lovers.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: STOP FUCKING TALKING! One more
dialog: word out of either of you, and...
text: Just then, Alter notices something in one of the suite’s many
text: MIRRORS. A figure has silently entered the room behind her.
text: It’s Agent 355, badly wounded, but alive.
text: Just as 355 is about to put a silenced bullet in Alter’s
text: head, the Israeli general spins around and KNOCKS the gun out
text: of her hand.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
speaker_heading: AHN!
text: Yorick is both excited and frightened to see his friend.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Three!
text: Alter then KICKS 355 in the stomach, sending the secret agent
text: flying out of the room. Alter runs out after her.
text: Back in the suite, Beth is more confused than ever.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Who the hell is that?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: It’s... a long...
text: And with that, Yorick slips into unconsciousness.
dialog: 110
scene_heading: INT. NORTH WING - CONTINUING
text: In the opulent north wing just outside this suite, Alter
text: continues to battle Agent 355.
text: 355 flicks open her BATON, which she SMASHES against Alter’s
text: right hand, causing her to drop her gun. Alter then ROUND-
text: HOUSES the baton away from 355.
dialog: It’s strictly hand-to-hand and woman-to-woman from here until
text: the end. 355 taunts Alter, as she deftly uses her one good
text: arm to violently SPAR with her opponent.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You're the one who killed my girls?
dialog: Back in Marrisville?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: If anyone got them killed, it’s
dialog: you.
text: Alter charges forward and digs her THUMB into 355’s bullet
dialog: wound.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
speaker_heading: NAHH!
text: 355 tries to PUNCH Alter in the kidneys, but the Lieutenant-—
text: General dodges the attack and uses 355’s momentum against
text: her, THROWING her over a nearby railing.
text: 355 lands on her back with a sickening THUD.
text: Alter looks down at her, and, without pity, proceeds to VAULT
text: over the railing and POUNCE on 355’s one good arm, SNAPPING
text: it loudly.
text: 355 screams, as Alter uses that same broken right arm to
text: painfully DRAG the Culper Ring agent back up the stairs. At
text: the landing, Alter then climbs ON TOP of the pained woman.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Who? Who do you work for?
text: 355 says nothing, so Alter PUNCHES her in the face as hard as
text: she can. Through bloody teeth, 355 spits out:
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: The... the Culper Ring.
text: Alter smiles.
dialog: 111
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: You're joking. I thought your
dialog: little sewing circle was just a
dialog: myth the drill instructors used to
dialog: scare us at boot camp. They told
dialog: us you were the best of the best.
text: Alter PUNCHES 355 again.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Tell me, what number did your
dialog: keepers give you? Maybe I’1l get
text: it tattooed on my ass.
text: A winded 355 struggles to whisper something inaudible.
speaker_heading: ALTER
dialog: Speak up, girl.
text: Alter leans in close, as 355 echoes Yorick’s earlier words to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You know what the strongest muscle
dialog: is?
text: Before Alter can answer, 355 SNAPS her jaws around Alter’s
text: throat, and BITES DOWN as hard as she can.
text: Alter howls a hideous, gurgling scream, as 355 TEARS OFF a
text: healthy chunk of her neck.
text: Stumbling away from her defenseless opponent, Alter presses a
text: palm against her own neck to try to stem the horrible tide
text: pouring out of her opened jugular.
text: With her free hand, Alter reaches down to pick up the GUN 355
text: knocked away earlier. She raises her shaky hand to fire a
text: fatal round down into her opponent's face.
text: 355 squeezes her eyes shut, bracing herself for impact...
text: when she hears an unfamiliar SHUNK noise.
text: The Culper Ring agent opens her eyes just in time to watch
text: Alter fall forward, DEAD. Sticking out of her back is the
text: pearl-handled dagger.
text: 355 looks up to see a trembling BETH standing over the
dialog: deceased soldier.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Are... are you all right?
dialog: 112
text: Struggling to stay conscious, 355 asks:
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick? Is Yorick...?
text: But before she can finish her thought, 355’s eyes fall shut.
dialog: Blackness.
scene_heading: WHITE TEXT ON BLACK BACKGROUND:
scene_heading: TOMBSTONE, ARIZONA. TWO WEEKS LATER.
scene_heading: INT. DR. MANN’S NEW LABORATORY - MORNING
text: Gradually, this blackness gives way to the sight of a BLURRY
text: FIGURE looming overhead.
speaker_heading: YORICK (0.S.)
dialog: Beth...?
text: As the figure racks into focus, it turns out that it really
text: is Beth. We’re again seeing the world through Yorick’s
speaker_heading: P.O.V.
speaker_heading: YORICK (0.S.)
dialog: Beth, I... I had this fucked-up
dialog: dream that--
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Doctor! He’s awake!
text: Similar framing from Yorick’s bed-ridden point of view, but
text: now Dr. Mann appears in frame, with Ampersand on her
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: YORICK (0.S.)
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Nice to see you, too, dick.
text: Pull out to reveal that we’re inside of Dr. Mann’s glistening
text: new futuristic laboratory, where Yorick has apparently been
text: recuperating.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: A while. And then some.
dialog: 113
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Are you guys...?
text: Mann puts a hand on Beth’s back.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: We're fine.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: And 355?
text: Low angle on the doorway to this room, as a figure carrying a
text: CANE steps inside.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355 (0.S.)
dialog: Never better.
text: Change angles to reveal Agent 355, her face badly bruised and
text: her right arm in a cast. She looks like SHIT.
text: Yorick tries to mask his revulsion.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Let me guess, walked into a door?
text: 355 holds up her cane.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Don’t cry for me, gimp. This is
dialog: for you. Figure you'll need it
dialog: until your “strength” comes back.
text: She gives the hand-carved walking stick to Yorick, who sits
text: up a bit in his hospital bed.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Does it have a sword in it?
text: 355 just squints at him.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Somebody gimme the post-game. Is
dialog: that Israeli woman...?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: No longer active duty. And we had
text: her troops deported, with a little
dialog: help from your mother.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You called my mom?
dialog: 114
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: She’s the one who told us about
dialog: this safe house. She doesn’t want
dialog: the rest of the government knowing
dialog: where you are until she’s sure they
dialog: can be trusted.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: And the Amazons?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Somewhere safe, where they can all
dialog: be deprogrammed.
scene_heading: INT. MARRISVILLE PENITENTIARY - AFTERNOON
text: Open tight on Victoria.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Man can imprison our bodies, but he
dialog: cannot enslave our minds!
text: Pull out to reveal that Victoria is wearing an ORANGE
text: JUMPSUIT, and she’s addressing a crowd of her FELLOW INMATES
text: inside of the women’s penitentiary back in Marrisville. The
text: other prisoners cheer with each of Victoria’s declarations.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: We are the chosen few who recognize
dialog: that the Plague was our
dialog: emancipation, but we can’t stop
dialog: until all our sisters are freed
dialog: from the yoke of the past!
text: As the women continue to applaud, pan over to SONIA, the girl
text: who tried to seduce Yorick. She’s dressed in the uniform of
text: a PRISON GUARD, and as she listens to Victoria speak... she
text: slowly begins to CLAP.
scene_heading: INT. DR. MANN’S NEW LABORATORY - MORNING
text: Cut back to Yorick, exactly where we left him.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Well, at least there’s that.
text: Pull out, as Yorick asks a favor from 355 and Mann.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Hey, Doc, Three, you mind if I have
dialog: a moment?
text: Mann looks at Beth for approval, and Beth nods.
text: escorts 355 outside.
text: Yorick reaches for his nearby bag.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Beth, there’s something I need to
dialog: ask you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You're looking for this, right?
text: Beth pulls out Yorick’s RING BOX from her pocket.
text: He just stares at it.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: There’s something I have to say
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yorick, back in New York, what I
dialog: was trying to tell you before I
dialog: left. I... I wanted you to know
dialog: that I thought we should break up.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’m sorry. I was too scared to say
dialog: anything. I... I didn’t want to
dialog: hurt you.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We were going in different
dialog: directions, Yorick. You recognized
dialog: it, too.
text: Beth hands him the ring. She’s starting to cry.
dialog: 115
dialog: The doctor
dialog: 116
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: That’s why you tried so hard to
dialog: hang on to me, because you knew the
dialog: world was pulling us apart.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: That was a different world, Beth!
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Maybe, but it would be selfish
dialog: and... and dishonest to say yes to
dialog: the last man when I would have said
dialog: no to the man.
text: Now Yorick is tearing up, too.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: But I’ve changed since then!
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And so have I. Look, I... I don’t
dialog: believe in coincidence. There’s a
dialog: reason my formula worked the way it
dialog: did, and I have an obligation to
dialog: stay here with Dr. Mann and help
dialog: her find new ways of applying it.
text: Beth lovingly touches Yorick.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And it’s no coincidence that
dialog: destiny picked you. There's a
dialog: reason you're still alive, and it
dialog: wasn’t to save me.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Then why? Why am I here?
text: Beth wipes away Yorick’s tears and kisses him, one last time.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Alas, poor Yorick... that’s the
dialog: question that separates the men
dialog: from the boys.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. MANN’S NEW LABORATORY - MORNING
text: Cut outside what appears to be an ordinary FARM somewhere in
text: the United States, as a hi-tech hatch OPENS IN THE EARTH.
text: 355 and Dr. Mann walk out of it.
dialog: 355 walks
dialog: passenger
dialog: 117
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: You sure you guys will be all right
dialog: here on your own?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Yeah, Yorick’s mother said this old
dialog: shelter was designed to house
dialog: Congress for fifty years in case
dialog: the Y2K bug plunged the country
dialog: into chaos. Thank Christ for
dialog: misplaced paranoia.
text: over to the parked Yugo and throws her bag in the
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Well, I appreciate the parting
dialog: gift.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: Where are you off to, 355?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: If what you say about the Culper
dialog: Ring is true, then they might be
dialog: responsible for more atrocities
dialog: than just this. I’m going to find
dialog: out what they were and try to make
dialog: up for as many as I can.
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: You don’t have to pay for the sins
dialog: of the father, you know.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: All you have to do in life is die,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: DR. MANN
dialog: I guess, ‘cause I’m sure as shit
dialog: not filing taxes anymore.
text: The two shake hands, before Mann returns to her new home.
text: As 355 finishes loading her stuff into the car, the sound of
text: the hatch re-opening is heard off-screen. 355 turns to see
text: Yorick (cane in hand), with Ampersand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: What, does the hard-as-nails secret
dialog: agent suck at good-byes?
dialog: He stares
dialog: 118
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Just figured you had more important
dialog: things to do down there.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Actually, the doc says she’s gotten
dialog: everything important from Amp and
dialog: me already. She took all the semen
dialog: samples she needs while I was out.
dialog: Not sure I want to know how she
dialog: took them, but--
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: I hope Beth let you down easy.
text: at 355 in disbelief.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You... you knew she was gonna dump
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: From pretty much the moment you
dialog: told me about her, yeah.
text: Yorick just kicks at the dirt a bit.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Why is women’s intuition only right
dialog: when it’s too late to do anything
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: It’s never too late, Yorick. I’m
dialog: sure you two will work it out.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Actually, I told her I’m leaving.
text: 355 stops what she’s doing.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: And going where?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: I was kinda hoping to hitch a ride
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick...
dialog: 119
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Just hear me out. I know you
dialog: ladies have the world under
dialog: control. Beth was telling me the
text: water’s back on in most cities and
dialog: the nuclear power plants are
dialog: cooling down and all that... but
dialog: maybe there’s something out there
dialog: that someone still needs a man for.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Opening jars?
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Yorick, you're safest here.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: You sure about that? What if
dialog: other... villainesses find out
dialog: about this place? Burn it to the
dialog: ground, God forbid. It’s not smart
dialog: to keep all our sperm in one
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: (a little disgusted)
dialog: You have a way with words.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Does that mean I can tag along?
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Why not.
text: As Ampersand scampers into the Yugo’s back seat, Yorick
text: climbs in shotgun. 355 takes the wheel.
speaker_heading: AGENT 355
dialog: Buckle up. I don’t need the last
dialog: man on earth flying through my
dialog: windshield.
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Not the last man, Three.
text: Yorick pulls out a CD from his bag, which he throws in the
text: car’s sound system.
dialog: 120
speaker_heading: YORICK
dialog: Just the only one for now.
text: Jay-Z's “99 Problems” comes to life over the speakers.
text: Agent 355 reaches for the volume, and with a little half-
text: smile, turns it up.
text: We're looking at the car from above now, as it peels away
text: from the hidden shelter, eventually slowing to stop at a fork
text: in a clearly Y-SHAPED ROAD.
text: We pull out farther, faster and faster, high into the AIR,
text: past the CLOUDS, past the UPPER ATMOSPHERE, until we’re once
text: again in SPACE, taking in the serene blue planet, looking
text: much like it did in the moments before the Plague.
text: But this time, a LARGE OBJECT suddenly floats into frame.
scene_heading: INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - NOW
text: Push in through one of the space station’s tiny windows to
text: reveal a FEMALE ASTRONAUT, the one we heard come over the
text: NASA Ground Control speaker during the opening Plague
text: montage.
text: This woman's checking a complicated control panel.
speaker_heading: FEMALE ASTRONAUT
dialog: That’s it. The Elektron’s gone
dialog: from working intermittently to
text: belching hydrogen into the cabin.
text: Even the HAM radio’s dead.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Then the decision’s been made for
dialog: us.
text: Finally, cut over to two MALE ASTRONAUTS, a bearded RUSSIAN
text: COSMONAUT and the handsome AFRICAN-AMERICAN TEAM LEADER,
text: hovering in the weightless environment across from their
dialog: female colleague.
speaker_heading: MALE ASTRONAUT
dialog: We're going home.
