speaker_heading: BOURNE (V.O.)
dialog: I told you people to leave me

dialog: was half way around the world.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT (V.O.)
dialog: There's no place it won't catch
dialog: up to you. It's how every story
dialog: ends. It's what you are, Jason.
dialog: A killer! You always will be.
speaker_heading: THUMP!
speaker_heading: CRONIN
dialog: We think that's Bourne hitting
dialog: him on the head and then--

speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: So what does he do now?
speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: I think he's looking for

speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Like what? What's he after?
speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
dialog: gotten his memory back yet. Not
dialog: all of it.
text: A look from Kramer...
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Pam, what I need to know is, what
dialog: kind of a threat is he to us?
speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: If he just wanted to hurt us he
dialog: could have sent this tape to CNN.
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Maybe he still will. Maybe he
dialog: gave it to you because he wants
dialog: to throw you in the opposite
dialog: direction of his real plan. I
dialog: don't know. I just know my
dialog: number one rule is "the only way
dialog: to stay safe is to assume the
dialog: worst." As far as I'm concerned
dialog: Bourne is a serious threat until
dialog: proven otherwise.

speaker_heading: VOSEN
dialog: Funny how different things look

speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: This doesn't feel like Bourne to

speaker_heading: VOSEN
dialog: Why's it so hard for you to

speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: Probably because it's coming from
dialog: you, Noah.
speaker_heading: VOSEN
dialog: Lets try and be adults okay? We
dialog: all thought he was done, off the

speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: So what happened at Waterloo?
speaker_heading: VOSEN
dialog: We have a leak. Bourne showed up
dialog: in our surveillance. We had very

speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: So what was he doing?
speaker_heading: VOSEN?

speaker_heading: LANDY

speaker_heading: LANDY
dialog: The guy you're after is a CIA
