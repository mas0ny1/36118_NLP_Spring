speaker_heading: AGRA, 1886
text: BRITAIN HAS FORMALLY RULED INDIA
scene_heading: FOR TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS
scene_heading: INT. ABDUL’S ROOM, INDIA
text: A darkened room. Someone is moving in the darkness. Then the
text: shutters of the room are thrown wide open and the blinding light
text: reveals: Abdul, twenty-four, smiling into the sun — we hear sound of
text: the muezzin’s call to prayer in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF TOP, AGRA
text: Abdul praying in the glorious sunshine. We see all of Agra below him,
text: the Taj Mahal in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, AGRA
text: Abdul rushes out of a squalid doorway into the bustle of the street.
text: As he hurries through the jammed streets he acknowledges people as
text: he goes, making his way past the lame and sick, through crowds, spice
text: stalls. Suddenly he accidentally bumps into a white colonial officer:
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Idiot!
text: The officer has already turned away so Abdul hurries on through the
text: dusty streets.
scene_heading: EXT. AGRA GAOL. THE SAME
text: Donkeys, a dog pisses on the wall. Abdul hurries in.
scene_heading: INT. AGRA GAOL
text: Abdul bows to the guard enthusiastically. The lugubrious guard
text: unlocks several locks on the rusting iron gate. The door slams shut.
text: Abdul hurries along the corridor. We see pitiful inmates, all at looms
text: making carpets, watched by bored, unshaven guards.
text: Abdul rushes to his high desk and starts on the Sisyphean task of
text: compiling the prison ledgers with huge concentration. Abdul looks up to
dialog: see the prison guard.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Tyler wants to see you. Now.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER’S OFFICE. THE SAME
text: A faded, mildewed monochrome of a young Queen Victoria on the wall.
text: Abdul is underneath looking nervously at Tyler, the Prison Governor.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Ah, Mr Karim. I wanted to speak to you about the carpets
dialog: we sent to the Exhibition.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: There is problem, sir?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: No. No. The carpets went down very well. In fact the
dialog: Governor General has received a letter from the Royal
dialog: Household thanking him personally. The whole thing’s been
dialog: such a success he has decided to present the Queen with a
dialog: mohar as part of the Jubilee.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: A mohar, sir?
speaker_heading: TYLER
text: A mohar. Apparently it’s a sort of ceremonial coin, rather
dialog: like a medal. I have been asked to find someone tall to
dialog: present it. Well, you’re the tallest person here.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Mr Tyler! When will she be arriving, sir?
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Not in Agra. In England.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: England?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You'll present the mohar at an official function. Like an
dialog: equerry.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: On a horse?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I don’t think there’ll be a horse.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: An equerry always has a horse, Mr Tyler, sir.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Well, maybe not like an equerry exactly. They were actually
dialog: after Hindus but I thought you’d do. What do you say?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Are you sure there isn’t a horse?
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDROOM. ENGLAND
text: Another dark room. The curtains are thrown, light streams into the
text: room. We see Mrs Tuck at the window. In the shadows is a large bed
text: into which a enormous mound appears to be upholstered.
speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: Good morning, Your Majesty.
dialog: We cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO DOCKS
text: Abdul is now with Tyler, a portly Englishman, Bigge, and what looks
text: like his short, squat Indian manservant.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This is Mr Bigge — extra Groom in Waiting to the Royal
text: Household who will be in charge. This is Abdul.
dialog: 7
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: This is Mohammed.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: He’s very short.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
text: We had to swop him at the last minute. The tall guy had an
text: accident with an elephant.
text: Abdul beams at Mohammed, who is distinctly unhappy.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Hi!
text: Mohammed looks sourly and does not respond.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: A group of straining footmen roll Queen Victoria over and then
text: manhandle her out of bed.
scene_heading: EXT. ON DECK AT SEA. DAY
text: Abdul and Mohammed standing in front of Bigge, who has a chart on
text: a tripod.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
text: At the top there’s the Private Secretary, then there are the
dialog: Ladies in Waiting, the Upper Servants, the lower Upper
dialog: Servants, the members of the Household, the Head of the
text: Household staff — splitting into three parts: the head of the
text: Bedchamber, the personal head of staff, the Butler in
text: Chief, who is in charge of the Household Butler, the
text: kitchen factotum, head of kitchen, the head of waiting staff,
text: the ordinary waiting staff (Windsor), the table maids, then
dialog: you. Any questions?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Who will have the mohar, sir?
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: I’m not exactly sure, as yet. I suspect you will both carry it.
text: On a cushion.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: We both have a cushion?
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: No, there’ll only be one cushion. Between you.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Can we have a cushion now, sir?
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: You'll have to mime the cushion.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I don’t understand, sir.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Pretend. You’ll have to pretend the cushion is there. Like
dialog: this. The key to good service is standing still and moving
dialog: backward. The most important thing is you must not look
text: at her.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But how will we present the mohar, sir?!
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: You put out the cushion and avert your gaze, appropriately.
dialog: Her Majesty will take the mohar and you will egress
text: retrospectively in a stately manner.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: What an arsehole.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: A line of dressers, ladies-in-waiting, footmen, equerries etc. all parade
text: into the Queen’s bedchamber.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN. AT SEA
text: Abdul and Mohammed in their tiny cell. Mohammed has a pile of
text: buns. He passes one to Abdul.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Have you any idea how cold it is? We’re gonna bloody
dialog: die there.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Why on earth did you agree to come?
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Had no choice. The tall guy fell off an elephant and I got
text: drafted in at the last moment. Five thousand miles to
text: present a bloody medal.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But it’s a very great honour.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Honour?! My father fought in the Mutiny. Have you
dialog: tasted English food? They eat pig’s blood.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: They do not eat pig’s blood!
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: I’m telling you they have pig’s blood in sausages. And
text: the brains of sheep. The place is barbaric.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Not to worry.
text: Abdul shows Mohammed a little tin containing a load of spices.
dialog: A present from my mother.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: My advice: eat as much as you can before we hit land.
text: He passes Abdul another bun.
dialog: Let’s give her the medal and get the hell back home.
scene_heading: TILBURY DOCKS. DAY
text: The huge exodus. Abdul, Mohammed come down the gangplank with
dialog: Arthur Bigge.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Civilisation!
text: The posh English people buffet Abdul and Mohammed in the mad
text: rush to the quayside. Finally, they look at the hawkers, scrawny
text: porters, the distinctly uncivilised detritus of Victorian London. A beggar
text: holds out his hand to Abdul.
speaker_heading: BEGGAR
dialog: Give uz a farthing.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. THE SAME
text: The Queen is sitting on a stool with her back to us..A gaggle of

speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: Arms.
text: The Queen puts her arms up.
scene_heading: INT. GENTLEMAN TAILOR’S, LONDON. DAY
text: Wood-panelled room. Men in suits. Abdul and Mohammed are dressed
text: in strange Indian costumes.
speaker_heading: TAILOR
dialog: Arms.
text: Abdul puts his arms up as the tailor fixes a sash around him.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Splendid.
speaker_heading: TAILOR
dialog: We copied them from some drawings in the British Museum.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: A sash is not traditional, sir.
speaker_heading: TAILOR
dialog: (to Bigge)
dialog: The Indian drawings didn’t seem very Indian — so we made
dialog: some innovations. We need it to look authentic.
dialog: II
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: It looks jolly good to me.
scene_heading: INT. THE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: A cloud of powder as Mrs Tuck applies a vast powder brush to the

scene_heading: INT. STATE ROOM, WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY
text: Abdul, Mohammed and Bigge arrive in a vast hall. Tables are laid for
text: an enormous dinner. A crowd of secretaries, officials, waiting staff and
text: other servants are being instructed by Alick Yorke, the portly Director
text: of Ceremonies. He stops mid-sentence. Everybody looks at Abdul and
text: Mohammed in amazement.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: The Hindoos, sir.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
text: But they are completely different sizes.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: There was an incident with an elephant.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE

speaker_heading: ABDUL

speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I thought it was a cushion.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: Who said anything about a cushion? You will present the
dialog: tray...
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: What will I do?
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: You will stand perfectly still and move backward when
dialog: required. Her Majesty takes the mohar. What is a mohar?
speaker_heading: AN ASSISTANT
dialog: It’s a coin, sir. Issued by the Moghul Empire.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: Why are we presenting it here?! Whatever you do you must
dialog: not look at Her Majesty. You will bow again. Then moving

dialog: and you will process down the hall to be met by Mr Bates

scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, CORRIDOR
text: The pageboy running.
speaker_heading: PAGEBOY
dialog: Soup! Soup!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHENS
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Soup!
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL
text: A fanfare. The main doors fly open. The fanfare reaches its climax.
text: Enter the Queen. We see her properly for the very first time. She is a
text: tiny, almost spherical figure, old, frail, glum and dreadfully tired.
text: Ponsonby leads her to her seat. The entourage follow: the Prince of
text: Wales, laughing coarsely with Lady Churchill, Dr Reid, various
text: dignitaries. All completely casual. Everyone else in the hall is frigidly
text: agog, craning to see the little old lady at the centre. She sits, then utters
text: an audible sigh of relief. Her bowl of soup is placed in front of her.
text: She attacks it greedily making a disgusting slurping noise as she eats.
text: everybody starts to eat.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. THE SAME
text: Abdul and Mohammed try to have a gander but are pushed out of the
dialog: way by Alick Yorke.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. THE SAME
text: The Queen has soup all around her mouth and is scraping the bowl to
text: get the last bit. Then she is finished in record time. She plonks her
text: spoon on the bowl and cleans her chin with the napkin. Quick as a
text: flash a waiter removes the bowl. Further down the table, as guests are
text: amiably enjoying the conversation around them, suddenly waiters
text: snatch the bowls — still full of soup. Dr Reid addresses a startled diner:
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: I’m afraid you have to be quick. They take it off you as
text: soon as she’s done.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, CORRIDOR
text: Scores and scores of waiters rush past Abdul and Mohammed carrying
dialog: soup bowls.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: One down. Six to go.
text: Bigge appears with the mohar on a tray.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Ihave the mohar.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: Is that it?!
speaker_heading: HEAD WAITER
dialog: Sir, the fish course.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: (shouting instructions)
dialog: The fish course!
scene_heading: INT. HALL
text: The babble of excited chatter. Everyone around the Queen is
text: animated. The Queen ignores it all and is shovelling quenelles into her
text: mouth, Cut to her polishing off the boeuf braisé, then tearing apart a
text: pheasant.
text: We see Lady Churchill laughing. Lady Phipps, a skinny, terrified-
text: looking Lady in Waiting is eating salad primly. Back to the Queen:
text: her plate is clean and she is nodding off.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Profiteroles, Your Majesty.
text: A profiterole is presented and the Queen immediately comes to life.
dialog: 18
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, CORRIDOR
text: Abdul waits anxiously as streams of waiters bring back the plates from
dialog: dessert.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: The profiteroles have gone. Gentlemen . . .
text: Alick Yorke makes a final adjustment to the mohar.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: Now. Process. Turn. Bow. Present. And absolutely no
dialog: sodding eye contact what-so-ever!
text: Abdul takes a huge breath, looks nervously at Mohammed. A trumpet
text: sounds and they walk up the hall. Everybody turns to see the two
text: Indians process with the mohar. The Queen is now talking to the
text: Viceroy and is taking no notice at all of the ceremony. Abdul and
text: Mohammed can see her from the corner of their eye. They reach the
text: head of the table and stop. They turn. Bow. The Queen is still talking
text: and pays them no attention. Ponsonby explains:
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: A gift from the Colony of India. A mohar, Your Majesty.
text: The Queen turns and looks at the mohar, incredulous.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: A coin from the Mughal Empire. In honour of your service
dialog: to the sub-continent.
text: Abdul presents the tray bowing his head low. The Queen takes the coin,
text: utterly bemused. Another servant puts a cushion on the table for it to
text: rest on. Abdul doesn’t quite know what to do. Ponsonby angrily indicates
text: for them to leave. Abdul takes the hint. They back away as trained.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Are we done?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: We still have coffee, Your Majesty.
text: Queen Victoria raises her eyes to heaven. Then suddenly looks across at
text: Abdul. He stops, frozen. He smiles at her. She looks at him. The title
text: appears on screen:
dialog: 19
scene_heading: VICTORIA AND ABDUL
text: We hear Mr Bigge sharply chide Abdul.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Eyes!
text: His smile falls and he drops his head.
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED ROOM. THE FOLLOWING DAY, MORNING
text: As before: a dark room, a curtain is drawn by Mrs Tuck. The room fills
text: with sunlight and we see we are in the Queen’s bedchamber.
speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: Good morning, Your Majesty.
text: Again we see the Queen seemingly upholstered into her bed. The group
text: of servants approach to extract her.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM. THE SAME
text: Regal music. The Queen immobile in the centre of the room, as before.
speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: Arms.
text: The Queen lifts her arms. This time we witness the whole unedifying
text: affair. The dresser arrives with a dress and has some trouble getting it
text: over her head. Finally her head is prised out of the garment. The Queen
text: makes no expression. A gaggle of ladies in waiting and maidservants
text: hand jewels, brooches and various pieces of the Queen’s garb to Mrs
text: Tuck who expertly puts these on. Over all of this we hear Ponsonby
dialog: outline the days activities..
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: (voice-over)
text: Breakfast with the Royal Princes of Belgium. An audience
dialog: with the Sultan of Dubai where you will be presented with

scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, THE QUEEN’S BREAKFAST ROOM
text: The Queen is eating a goose egg with a silver spoon. Dr Reid and a

dialog: itinerary for the day:
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: ... And the Crown Princess Lili’uokalani.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Who on earth is she?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Monarch and only Queen Regnant of the Kingdom of
dialog: Hawaii, Your Majesty. She has composed a song for you on
dialog: the ukelele — but we have managed to put her off. Then the
text: afternoon audience with Prime Minister Salisbury.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: And your movements, Your Highness?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: None to speak of.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Not even during the day?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: ‘We last moved on Sunday evening.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: I fear the celebratory dinners are taking their toll. May I
dialog: suggest some Benger’s Mixture, Your Majesty?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I refuse to eat Benger’s. It’s baby food.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: But it is imperative, Your Majesty, that the royal colon
text: receives a little roughage.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Is there anything else?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: ‘Was Your Highness pleased with the mohar?
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: The mohar. The ceremonial coin presented yesterday by
dialog: the Indian servants.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I thought the tall one was terribly handsome.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, CORRIDOR
text: Arthur Bigge running at a surprising lick.
scene_heading: INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE, ARSE END OF WINDSOR CASTLE
text: Bigge runs up to a door at the top. He throws it open. We see two small
text: empty beds are crushed together.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. THE SAME
text: Abdul and Mohammed with their tiny suitcases are about to board a
text: carriage. Arthur Bigge comes running breathlessly into the courtyard.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Stop!
text: He is almost doubled up with exhaustion. He catches his breath.
text: Slight change of plan.
text: Mohammed is horrified.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN PARTY. AFTERNOON
text: Abdul and Mohammed in costume. Bigge is in a food tent, guests mill
text: around outside. They are near a table laden with puddings as they
dialog: receive instructions.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: You must not talk to any guests. Nod or bow but please do
dialog: not interact with anybody other than the serving staff. I will
dialog: 22
dialog: come to you when the Queen is seated and you will present
dialog: the pudding, as requested.
text: Abdul looks at the jelly on the table.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Excuse me, but what is it?
speaker_heading: BIGGE
text: That is a jelly. A pudding made from the liquor of fruit.
text: Abdul and Mohammed survey it with great curiosity.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: How do they get it so stiff?
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Gelatin: a by-product of cow bone.
text: They look at the wobbling mass in horror.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Barbarians!
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S MARQUEE. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY
text: The Queen is sitting at a table with Lord Salisbury.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: There’s another famine in India, more trouble in Ireland,
dialog: I’m afraid. Suez is a perennial nightmare and I’m afraid the
text: Boers are at it again.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Is there any good news, Prime Minister?
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: We have decided to annex Zululand, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Whatever for?
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: To prevent the Transvaal having access to the sea.
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Is that absolutely necessary?
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: We really have to box in the Boers if we possibly can, Your
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Prime Minister, you really are terribly depressing.
text: Food starts to arrive.
dialog: Ah, luncheon!
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAME, TABLE AT THE GARDEN PARTY
text: A wobbling jelly. We pull up to see Abdul carefully carrying it, followed
text: by Mohammed who has his own. Queen Victoria is at the table,
text: looking dour and fearsome. Abdul starts to panic as the jelly starts
text: wobbling perilously on the plate. The more he nears the Queen the
text: more errant the giant jelly becomes. With a great deal of sweat and
text: consternation Abdul navigates the jelly to Her Majesty.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Jelly, Your Majesty.
text: Abdul puts the jelly in front of the Queen, her eyes light up. Abdul
text: bows ostentatiously, then drops to his knees. The entire table of guests
text: crane round to see what he is doing. Bigge and Ponsonby look on in
text: horror. The Queen looks down curiously. The whole Royal Household
text: seem to hold their breath. Abdul suddenly lunges down — everyone
text: gasps. Kneeling down, he kisses her feet, rises, bows again and retreats
text: backwards. Everyone is astonished. The Queen is startled then her face
text: breaks into a smile.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I feel a great deal better.
text: She picks up her golden spoon and looks at the jelly.
text: EXT. THE SAME, BEHIND THE FOOD TENT
text: An extremely red-faced Bigge has Abdul by the collar.
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: What the hell were you thinking?!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: You said present the jelly.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: I didn’t say kiss the feet of the Empress of India.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I thought it would cheer her up.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: What on earth’s going on here?! Her Majesty has requested
dialog: Mr Karim and Mr Baksh to be her personal footmen for
dialog: the rest of the Jubilee.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY
text: Abdul and Mohammed follow Bigge up a staircase:
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: You stupid bloody idiot. All you had to do was give her

speaker_heading: PONSONBY

speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Don’t worry. I’m not going to eat you.

scene_heading: INT. WRITING ROOM. THE SAME

speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Thank you, Mr...
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Abdul. Abdul Karim. I am always writing. In India. ’m
dialog: writing all the day, every day.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Really. So in India you’re not a servant.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: No. In India I am writing in my very big book.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You’re writing a book!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes. I am writing every name, who they are, what they
dialog: will be. This is my life. Every day I am writing. From the
dialog: morning to the night.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And this is fiction?
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: No, this is true. Everything I write is the very truth.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I don’t understand, if you are an author why you are here,
dialog: presenting the . . . thing, the...
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: The mohar. It is my humble privilege to serve Her Majesty.
dialog: I was the one who chose your carpets.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: The carpets?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: For the exhibition. The Viceroy asked Mr Tyler but actually
dialog: it was me. You have to have very good eye for the carpets.
dialog: This is a very nice one. For example.
text: They look at the carpet beneath them.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: Very tight knots. This is the sign of a very nice carpet. The
dialog: art of carpets came to India with the great Emperor Akbar.
dialog: The skill of a great carpet is to bring all the different
dialog: threads together and we weave something we can stand on.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You seem to know an awful lot about it.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: My family were carpet makers. But now I write in the
text: book. Life is like the carpet. We weave in and out to make
text: a pattern.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: How very true. That is a very beautiful image.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: It is a very beautiful carpet. Look at this — here is a bird of
dialog: freedom caught forever in the design.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: So in India you are a poet?
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: No. I just make a ledger of the prisoners.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Indeed we are all prisoners.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Indeed we are, Your Majesty.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, ANTEROOM

speaker_heading: LADY PHIPPS
dialog: Apparently he’s a poet!
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: A poet?!

text: Abdul. Mohammed hisses in Hindi:
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: What the hell are you playing at?
scene_heading: INT. ABDUL AND MOHAMMED’S CELL. NIGHT
text: A tiny room with two beds squashed together. Mohammed is shivering.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I was just trying to be friendly.
text: Abdul is breathing out, fascinated by his breath freezing.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Stop being friendly.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: She’s a very nice person.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: She is the tyrannical oppressor of our entire country.
dialog: And if we don’t get out of here we’ll die of bloody cold.
dialog: 28
text: Mohammed wraps himself in his blanket and turns away. Abdul

speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Will you stop doing that!
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY
text: Ponsonby with Dr Reid and Lady Churchill are hiding behind some

speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: You realise this is the third day in a row.
scene_heading: EXT. CANOPIED WRITING STATION. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY
text: The Queen finishes writing. Abdul blots her copy. She closes the book.
text: He goes back to ‘standing sentry’. Then the Queen turns her attention
text: directly to him.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: So Mr Abdul. May I ask you which part of India are you
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I am from Agra. The Taj Mahal. You have been to the Taj
dialog: Mahal?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, it is the most marvellous building in the entire world.
dialog: The Crown of Palaces. It was built by Shah Jahan, the
dialog: grandson of the great Akbar, to remember his dead wife,
dialog: Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childhood with their
dialog: fourteenth child.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Goodness.
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: He was so upset with grief. He brought the greatest
dialog: architects from Persia and Afghanistan to build the Taj
dialog: Mahal.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: It certainly sounds like a handsome building. I would very
dialog: much like to see it.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, it is beautiful, Your Majesty. All white marble. And
text: Mumtaz laid inside. All of that beauty for the dead Queen.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: How romantic.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes. And he wrote a poem:
dialog: ‘The sight of this building brings me sad sighs;
text: ‘The sun and the moon have tears in their eyes.’
dialog: But it makes everyone so happy. Agra is very beautiful.
dialog: Shah Jahan built the Red Fort, the Gardens of Shalimar,
dialog: and the Peacock Throne.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: The Peacock Throne?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, it was the most beautiful throne in all the world. A
text: throne of gold with peacocks on it. And in the throne was
text: the Koh-i-Noor. He would look at the Taj Mahal through
dialog: the diamond.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: But I have the Koh-i-Noor. I have it as a brooch.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Do you?!
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: It was given to me by the East India Company. It wasn’t
dialog: very shiny so Albert had it recut. So what happened to the
dialog: Peacock Throne?
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I don’t know, they smashed it up.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: How awful.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, they are always smashing things up. All the British
text: soldiers have taken the jewels from the Taj Mahal.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: British soldiers?!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes, after the Mutiny.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: But this is terrible.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: At least you have the diamond.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY
text: Dr Reid looking through the binoculars.
speaker_heading: DR REID
text: What can they be talking about? An Indian and a servant
dialog: to boot.
text: Lady Churchill grabs the binoculars.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: What on earth does she see in him?
text: We see Abdul from Lady Churchill’s point of view.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Well, he is rather handsome.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAME, AVENUE OF TREES
text: Queen Victoria continues talking to Abdul as they walk.
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: But what happened to Shah Jahan?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: He was overthrown by his son and died in Agra Fort.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: The wickedness of children.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: They buried him in the Taj Mahal next to his wife. They
dialog: put an inscription: ‘Here lies Shah Jahan who left this world
text: to the Banquet Hall of Eternity’
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: The Banquet Hall of Eternity.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes, it is a banquet when we leave here.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I rather like that idea. You seem very well informed, Mr
dialog: Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, these are famous stories in Uttar Pradesh. You should
dialog: go there.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Oh, I can never go there. I am forbidden.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Forbidden?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: They fear I would be assassinated.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But you are the Empress of India.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Exactly. (Proudly.) You know I’ve been shot at four times.
dialog: And someone came for me with a knife!
dialog: 32
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Goodness. So you have never seen an India street, or a stall
dialog: of spices.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: Oh, the spices. Cardamom, turmeric, cumin, coriander.
dialog: Garam masala.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: What is garam masala?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: It’s what you put into the sauce. You have never tasted
dialog: Indian food? A dahl? A rogan josh? Oh they are the greatest
dialog: dishes in the world! Biryani with mango chutney?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Mango chutney?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes, a chutney made of mango.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: A mango?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, the mango is the Queen of Fruit.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: What does it taste like?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: A mango is the most delicious fruit in all the world. Like an
text: orange and a peach.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. THE SAME
text: Ponsonby and the ladies in waiting are accompanying Queen Victoria

dialog: 33
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Ponsonby. I would like a mango.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: A mango?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Yes, I would like to taste a mango.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: It’s impossible. They only grow in India, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam the Empress of India, so have one sent. I hope you
dialog: will like Scotland, Abdul.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE MOOR. SCOTLAND. DAY
text: Scottish mists. The vast landscape of Scotland. A train of flunkies
text: come into shot carrying tables, chairs, carpets. Ponsonby, Lady
text: Churchill, Miss Phipps and Reid struggle up with them. Queen
text: Victoria comes into view close to the camera. She points a finger.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Here!
scene_heading: EXT. WILD PROMONTORY. DAY
text: Queen Victoria is sitting at her ‘tea’ table, formally set up and replete
text: with every unnecessary accoutrement. It overlooks spectacular scenery,
text: but Queen Victoria behaves as if she was in her back garden. Abdul
text: and Mohammed stand to attention in the background. Mohammed
text: sneezes. Butlers and maids serve the tea. Queen Victoria is very well
text: wrapped up. She gorges herself on a sponge cake. Everyone else is cold
text: and miserable. Ponsonby whispers to Dr Reid:
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: It’s alright for her. She’s upholstered.
text: The hand of the serving man shakes as he pours the tea.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: How do you like your new Scottish costumes?
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: They’re very scratchy, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Everything in Scotland is scratchy. (Jo Ponsonby.) When
dialog: does Bertie come?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Tomorrow, Your Majesty. He is on his way from Monte
dialog: Carlo.
text: The Queen takes a slurp of the tea then puts the cup on the table.
text: Suddenly there’s a splish in the teacup. Then a pitter-pat as rain hits
text: the table cloth.
scene_heading: EXT. VICINITY OF THE WILD PROMONTORY. SCOTLAND. DAY
text: Torrential rain. Queen Victoria is being led along by a river by a
text: ghillie with an umbrella. Behind her, Abdul and Mohammed,
text: Ponsonby and Reid are all getting soaked.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Thate Scotland.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, BALMORAL
text: A piper plays very close to Dr Reid and Ponsonby who both blow their
text: noses and wince at the infernal racket. It seems everyone now has a
text: cold. The Household are sitting round in misery. The Queen is seated
text: at the centre and is tapping her foot delicately as one of the ghillies is
text: doing a dance in front of her. There is forced merriment from the staff.
text: Mohammed and Abdul are standing at the side, watching the
dialog: proceedings.
speaker_heading: GHILLIE
dialog: (in incomprehensible Scots)
dialog: Ye must be the Hindoos. Very nice to meet ye.
text: Incomprehension from Abdul and Mohammed.
speaker_heading: GHILLIE
dialog: Ye must be the Hindoos. Ye. Must. Be. The. Hin. Doos.
dialog: 35
text: The piping stops.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: More! More!
speaker_heading: GHILLIE
dialog: I wish she’d bloody well go to bed.
text: The Ghillie wearily knocks back a dram from his hip flask. The piping
text: starts again. Lady Phipps yawns. The unfortunate dancing Ghillie
text: wearily raises his arms for another reel.
scene_heading: INT. STAFF CORRIDOR. NIGHT
text: Abdul and Mohammed walk to bed. Ahead of them is a butler, with
text: a tray, careering from wall to wall. They pass an open door and inside
text: see the kitchen staff with bottles of whisky open and someone playing
text: the fiddle. Suddenly the music stops. They all look at Abdul and
text: Mohammed looking in at them. The door closes. Abdul and Mohammed
text: look at the closed door. The strathspey starts up again.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S STUDY. DAY
text: The Queen is sitting at her desk, Abdul by her side. A servant comes
text: in and puts down the boxes. Ponsonby blows his nose and takes her
dialog: through it.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Your boxes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: And the blank journal you requested.
text: Ponsonby puts on his glasses and takes a pen out of his pocket ready
dialog: to get down to work.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: ‘You may go.
text: Ponsonby waits. He is confused.
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: Iam perfectly capable of working through the boxes. Abdul
text: is very helpful with his blotter.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: But these are parliamentary papers, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam aware of that.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: But Abdul is a servant. He cannot assist with the boxes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam the Queen of England. I will have whatever help with
dialog: my boxes that I require.
text: Ponsonby is completely banjaxed by the turn of events.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, OUTSIDE THE QUEEN’S ROOM
text: Ponsonby emerges wiping his brow. Mohammed is standing outside the
text: room, as is Lady Churchill. They look to Ponsonby to discover the
dialog: royal news.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: He’s helping her with the boxes.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, QUEEN’S STUDY
text: Now the Queen and Abdul are alone she turns to him.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I want you to teach me Indian.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Indian?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Hindu. Whatever it is you speak.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: 37
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Of course I am sure.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But why would you want to speak Hindi?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam Empress of India. Look. I have ordered a book. I want
dialog: you to give me private lessons.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I can’t teach you Hindi.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Why ever not?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: You are the Empress of India. You must learn Urdu. The
dialog: language of the Mughals. Oh there are a thousand
dialog: languages in India but Urdu is the most noble. The
dialog: difference is when you write it down. In Urdu you write
dialog: like this.
text: He demonstrates it.
dialog: This is Persian script. Just like Arabic. And for Hindi you
dialog: write like this — in Devanagari:
text: He demonstrates.
dialog: The Persian script is most superior.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Isee.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Iam the Queen. Mairn raini hoom.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR

speaker_heading: REID

speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Were you learning Urdu?!
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Do you think that’s entirely appropriate?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam the Empress of India. What could be more appropriate
dialog: than learning Urdu?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: But in front of the entire Household —
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You are absolutely right. I can’t have all of these
dialog: distractions. Ponsonby, I wish to go to Glassalt Shiel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Glassalt Shiel?!

speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA

speaker_heading: 4I
text: She turns to Abdul.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: They don’t understand anything, those stupid aristocratic
dialog: fools. Toadying around. Jockeying for position. I’ve had this
dialog: my whole life. They couldn’t bear me bringing dear John
dialog: Brown here. Yet I have been happier here than anywhere in
dialog: the entire world. Oh, I miss him, Abdul. And Albert. It’s
dialog: been thirty years and I think about him every day. I am so
dialog: lonely, Abdul. Everyone I really loved has died. And I just
dialog: go on and on and on.
text: She weeps.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, Your Majesty.
text: Abdul kneels and wipes her eyes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: It’s an impossible position. No one really knows what it is
dialog: like to be Queen. I am hated by millions of people — all
dialog: over the world. I have had nine children, all vain and
text: jealous, and completely at loggerheads with each other.
dialog: Bertie is a complete embarrassment. I have thirty-four
dialog: grandchildren, my offspring will rule most of Europe — but
text: look at me: a fat, lame, impotent, silly old woman. What is
dialog: the point, Abdul?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: The point, Your Majesty?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Of life?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Service.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Service?!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I think we are not here to worry about ourselves. We are
dialog: here to serve a greater purpose.
dialog: 42
dialog: Queen Victoria thinks about this.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: In the Koran it says: we are here for the good of others.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: The Koran?
text: Abdul is trying to cheer up Her Majesty with his enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes, I am a Hafiz. I know the Koran by heart.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: By heart. Isn’t it very long?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: There are 114 Surahs containing 6,236 verses.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And you know every word?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Many Muslim people know the Koran.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I thought you were a Hindu.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Iam a Muslim, Your Majesty. I learnt the Koran from my
dialog: father. And he taught me all the great poets: Kabir, Rumi.
dialog: He is my Munshi.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Munshi?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Yes, Munshi. My teacher.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Then we would like you to be the Queen’s Munshi.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But I am a servant. A servant cannot be a Munshi?
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, you are a servant no longer. You are my teacher. You
dialog: shall teach me Urdu and the Koran and anything else you
dialog: think of.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. BALMORAL. NIGHT
text: A dozen local guests are waiting for the dinner. Mohammed is

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What the hell is a Munshi?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Apparently it’s some sort of ‘spiritual teacher’, Your Royal
dialog: Highness.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Has she completely lost her mind?! She’s the head of the
dialog: Church of England, for God’s sake! What’s the Archbishop
dialog: of Canterbury going to say?
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: It’s utter lunacy.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: I say he’s ‘brown’ John Brown.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: And what’s more she’s given him my room!
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: But where have they put you, Dr Reid?
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: (with a hateful look to Ponsonby)
dialog: In the tower!

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh my God.

speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA

speaker_heading: BERTIE

scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, STAIRCASE
dialog: Bertie with Queen Victoria.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Lady Churchill was absolutely scandalised. A servant. And
dialog: a Hindoo to boot!
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: The Munshi is a Muslim scholar. He knows the Koran off
dialog: by heart and for your information is no longer a servant.
text: He is to be given a staff of his own.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: This is absurd. Letters. Invitations to supper. You’re treating
dialog: him like family.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: No, I like Abdul. Lady Churchill had better get used to the
dialog: fact — as the Munshi is coming on holiday with us as a fully
dialog: equal member of the Household.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You can’t take a Muslim to Florence!
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: That will be all.
text: The Queen walks off upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. RAILWAY CARRIAGE. DAY
text: The train is trundling along. Mohammed blows his nose into his

speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: A spiritual advisor!? You haven’t an idea in your head. You
dialog: promised to get us out of here. And now we’re going to
dialog: bloody Florence.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But don’t you see what a privilege it is to see the glories of
dialog: Italy with all these wonderful people?
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: You complete bloody idiot. Do you really think they are
dialog: going to stand there and let her promote a wog? I did not
dialog: come here to carry your bloody cases.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: What you are complaining about? We have our own
dialog: carriage. With a bathroom. They’ve a very nice bed for
dialog: you on the floor.
text: Mohammed blows his nose.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: I’m dying here. I want to go home. I am telling you this
dialog: whole thing is a disaster waiting to happen.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Iam getting sick of your negative attitude. Life is a big
dialog: adventure. You just need to open up and enjoy it. We’re on
dialog: holiday. What on earth could possibly go wrong?

speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: It was nothing at all, Abdul. Anyway, it’s a completely
dialog: understandable mistake. I am just so glad you are with us.
dialog: What a treat to show you Florence for the first time.
text: Bertie emerges from the royal bathroom in his pyjamas to see Abdul.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What’s he doing here?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul was just explaining what happened earlier.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I really don’t see why I have to share your bathroom.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I shared a bed with my mother until I became Queen.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mother, I am fifty-seven years old. The Munshi’s got his
dialog: own bathroom.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh yes, it is a very fine bathroom indeed, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He has to push his way past Abdul.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Goodnight, Ma-mah.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Goodnight, Mr Bertie.
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Bertie. Make sure you shut that door.
text: Bertie pushes past Abdul unhappily and leaves. The Queen grabs
text: Abdul’s hand
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul, I have something for you. To celebrate your first trip
dialog: to Florence. And becoming my Munshi. It is a locket. With
dialog: a picture of me.
text: She gives him a locket.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh Your Majesty! How can I ever thank you.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Keep me safe.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: For ever, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Oh Abdul. You will love Florence. Such wonderful views.
scene_heading: INT. GARDENS, VILLA PALMIERI. DAY
text: Abdul and Queen Victoria are walking in the Italianate gardens below
text: the terrace of the Villa Palmieri, Mohammed standing sentry in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Isn’t it glorious. Albert loved it here. The Brunelleschi
dialog: Dome. The Uffizi Gallery. He spent all of his money on
dialog: Old Masters. We collected so much I had to give most of it
dialog: to the National Gallery. He so admired the Medicis. That
dialog: they would commission the greatest artists of the day. So
text: they could leave something astonishing behind.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: In India we also commision great artists. Each Mughal
dialog: Emperor would bring the greatest craftsmen to make great
text: glories for their Durbar Room.
dialog: 48
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: A Durbar Room?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, yes, every Emperor had a Durbar Room. Full of the
dialog: finest things known to man.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, Iam the Empress of India. I should have a Durbar
dialog: Room.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: A brilliant idea, Your Majesty. But where would you put it?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: The Isle of Wight. Obviously.
text: Ponsonby arrives.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Signor Puccini has arrived, Your Majesty.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND ROOM. NIGHT
text: We are in the middle of the recital. The Royal Household are listening
text: to a fat man singing ‘Donna non vidi mai’ at the piano. Abdul is
text: listening intently next to the Queen, Bertie next to Lady Churchill.
text: Ponsonby says something to Dr Reid. The Munshi turns:
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Ssshhhh!
text: The fat man at the piano finishes his song. Abdul applauds
text: enthusiastically.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And where did you say it was from, Mr Puccini?
speaker_heading: PUCCINI
dialog: It’s from my new opera Manon Lescaut. It’s about two
text: lovers separated by the class divide who run away together.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: It sounds marvellous.
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: PUCCINI
dialog: But she is imprisoned for her love, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: PUCCINI
text: But they escape.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Bravo.
speaker_heading: PUCCINI
text: But finally she dies, leaving him utterly bereft.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I’m not sure we do like the sound of it. We prefer comic
dialog: opera. Do you know any Gilbert and Sullivan?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Perhaps Your Majesty will sing us a song?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Oh no. I couldn’t possibly.
dialog: The Household on cue:
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: But please, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (aside)
dialog: God save us!
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, just one. From Pinafore. Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Do I have to?
text: Bertie, reluctantly, goes to the piano.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: ‘Little Buttercup’. In C.
text: Bertie sits at the piano with immense reluctance. Queen Victoria sings
dialog: 50
text: ‘Little Buttercup’ poorly. She dries, is about to continue, but Ponsonby
text: prompts the applause.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Bravo! More! More!
text: But to everyone’s relief Puccini produces a glass of champagne and
text: hands it to the Queen.
speaker_heading: PUCCINI
dialog: Bellissimo, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I was taught by Mendelssohn, you know.
text: Puccini raises his glass.
speaker_heading: PUCCINI
dialog: To the Queen.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: To me.
text: She knocks back the champagne.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE, FLORENCE. NIGHT
text: The Queen is tipsy. She holds on to Abdul’s arm as they walk along
text: the terrace in the warm evening air, Florence twinkling below. Bertie
text: and Lady Churchill look on aghast. The Queen is singing the melody
dialog: of the Gilbert and Sullivan song:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: La, la, la, la, la, la.
text: She lifts her arm as she walks, half dancing.
dialog: We should not have drunk all that champagne.
text: She giggles.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: May I?
text: Abdul takes the Queen’s other hand and they waltz their way along
text: the terrace, la-la-ing’ an accompaniment. We are close up on their
dialog: 51
text: almost childish pleasure. Finally the Queen and Abdul stumble and
text: come to a stop. Abdul smiling at the Queen. Still holding her.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul, I have not been so happy for years.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: When I came to England, I was terrified of you. But you
dialog: are a very kind lady. You are a very unique lady to me.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And you are very, very ‘unique’ to me, Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I know that you are very much older than me. And you are
dialog: the Queen of England and Empress of India and I am just
dialog: a humble Munshi. But I think you are the most special
dialog: person in my whole life.
text: His eyes are alight. They look at each other intimately.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Even more special than my wife.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Wife?!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Yes.
text: The Queen is computing this information, her face severe.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You are married?!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: But where is your wife?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: In India.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me you were married?
dialog: 52
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I didn’t think it mattered.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: (severely)
dialog: Of course, this changes everything. You will have to return
dialog: to India immediately.
text: Abdul looks concerned.
dialog: And bring her back at once!
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. ISLE OF WIGHT. DAY
text: A shot of Osborne House. Huge music as a carriage approaches.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: The Queen is sitting with her journal practising her Urdu.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Aaj kal Agra ka msusam kesa hay? [How is the weather
dialog: in Agra these days?]
text: Mrs Tuck runs in.
speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: He’s coming!
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S DRESSING ROOM/BEDCHAMBER. DAY
text: The Queen passes a mirror, checks her appearance, then dashes out of
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: A carriage races down the drive and into the circle in front of Osborne
dialog: House.
scene_heading: INT. TOP OF THE STAIRS, OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Queen Victoria rushes past maids who jump to attention as she goes
text: round a corner and dashes past Ponsonby and Dr Reid, who watch
text: her whizz by in amazement.
dialog: 53
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The music of Triumphant Return continues as the carriage comes to a
text: stand still. Mohammed is waiting by the door. He blows his nose.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Bloody hell.
text: And rushes towards the carriage to open the door.
scene_heading: INT. GLAZED TERRACE, OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The Queen is now looking out from the terrace with great anticipation.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: How terribly exciting!
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Mohammed runs, ignominiously, over the gravel to open the door of
text: the carriage. We cut back to Osborne House. There are expectant faces
text: at every window. The terrace is crowded with Household members.
text: Mohammed opens the carriage door. Abdul emerges from the carriage.
text: He steps down resplendent in his ceremonial outfit, double-sashed,
text: replete with sword and pistol, and the Star of India. He looks like a
text: cross between a Maharajah and a Pirate King and rather fatter than
text: before. Mohammed is unimpressed.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: For God’s sake!
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR TERRACE, OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Bertie, Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps are gathered with Alick Yorke, all
text: looking down at Abdul’s arrival.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
text: Look at the size of him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And he’s got a sword.
dialog: 54
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: And a pistol!
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. THE SAME
text: Abdul holds out his hand and Mrs Karim emerges from the carriage ~
text: in full burga.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR TERRACE, OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: There is an audible gasp from Miss Phipps.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What the devil is she wearing?
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: You can’t even see her face!
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: A skinny serving boy, Ahmed, gets out of the carriage. He looks
text: around amazed at his surroundings.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST-FLOOR TERRACE, OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Now Dr Reid and Ponsonby are out on the terrace — further down
dialog: from Bertie and the Ladies in Waiting.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Who the hell is that?
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Abdul cuffs Ahmed on the ear, bringing him ‘to’.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: The bags. The bags!
text: Ahmed runs to help Mohammed with Mrs Karim’s bags. Mrs Karim
text: stands resplendent.
dialog: 55
scene_heading: INT. GLAZED TERRACE. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The Queen looks on delighted.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I think she looks rather splendid.
speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: But you can’t actually see her, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I think it’s rather dignified.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Abdul turns and helps another fully burga’d lady from the carriage.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR TERRACE, OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Another scandalised gasp from the company.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Oh my God. Another one! How many has he got in there?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The ruddy sod’s a bigamist!
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: This is an absolute scandal!
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Abdul stands with his two burqua’d ladies while Mohammed and
text: Ahmed get bags from the carriage.
scene_heading: INT. GLAZED TERRACE. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The Queen looks on.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I do hope they like their little cottage.
dialog: 56
scene_heading: INT. ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: A knock at the door. Abdul opens the door to find the Queen.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I hope it’s not inconvenient. I just thought we’d pop round
dialog: for tea.
scene_heading: EXT. OTTAGE. DAY
text: A chocolate-box cottage on the Osborne Estate. We see the Queen is
text: accompanied by a vast entourage of people.
scene_heading: INT. TINY LIVING ROOM, ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: A ‘tableau’ of Queen Victoria, Ponsonby, Lady Churchill, the Queen
dialog: of Greece (1870-1932), the Grand Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-
dialog: Eisenach (1824-97), Princess Helena of Schleswig-Holstein-
text: Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1848-1923), and their entourages,
text: Mohammed, Abdul, Ahmed, Mrs Karim and the mother-in-law along
text: with the usual entourage, plus the retinue of the royal visitors, all
text: squashed tightly in Abdul’s tiny living room. Bertie and Dr Reid are
text: perched on travel cases because of the lack of chairs.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: This is my granddaughter, Sophia, The Queen of Greece,
dialog: this is the Grand Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-
dialog: Eisenach, and my daughter, Princess Helena Augusta
dialog: Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: A pleasure to meet you. This is my wife Mrs Karim, and
dialog: this is my mother-in-law.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: How very nice to meet you. How are you enjoying England,
dialog: Mrs Karim?
text: Abdul translates this — at great length — to his missus. She whispers
text: something to him — also at great length, then...
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: She says: ‘Very well. Thank you, Your Majesty.’
dialog: 57
text: The Munshi’s wife then whispers to him again for an interminably
text: long time. Everyone waits politely. Finally he turns and smiles.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: ‘Apart from the cold’
text: They laugh gently.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (aside)
dialog: God help me.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Your Majesty, Sophia — the Queen of Greece, Grand
dialog: Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Princess Helena
dialog: Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-
dialog: Augustenburg, I would like to take this opportunity on
dialog: behalf of myself, my wife and my wife’s mother to thank
dialog: Her Majesty Victoria Regina of the United Kingdom of
dialog: Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Empress
dialog: of India, for accommodating us in this beautiful cottage.
dialog: We are extremely grateful for her infinite kindness and
dialog: interior decoration. The gift of hospitality and friendship
dialog: to strangers is of very high importance in our culture and
dialog: we are honoured to repay it in our very small way. What is
dialog: ours is yours.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Quite literally.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: And this is how the world should be. Here we are,
dialog: representatives of the great nations of the world, all
dialog: snuggled together, having a nice cup of Indian tea. Thanks
dialog: be to Allah.
text: Queen Victoria leads the polite applause.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: My dear Munshi, Mrs Karim and Mrs Karim’s mother —
dialog: it’s so good to have you back, my children. We have missed
dialog: you enormously.
dialog: 58
scene_heading: EXT. ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: A groom and pony-driven carriage wait for the Queen. The royal
text: visitors are leaving. Bertie marches up the path, Ponsonby anxiously
text: following close behind:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Children?!
text: Dr Reid is on Ponsonby’s heels.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: (aside, to Ponsonby)
dialog: If they are going to live here can I get my room back?
text: The Queen is the last to leave. She takes his hand:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Oh Abdul, I am so glad you are back — it really has been
dialog: dreadfully dull without you. And I am so glad to meet Mrs
dialog: Karim. There’s just one thing I’ve been curious about this
dialog: whole afternoon. What does Mrs Karim look like behind
dialog: her veil?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Behind her veil? You must see her.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Is that allowed?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Of course it is allowed. You are a lady. And the Empress
dialog: of India.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Really?! You think she’d let me take a glimpse?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: She would be honoured, Your Majesty.
text: Ponsonby and Bertie at the end of the garden path.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Where the hell is she going now?
dialog: 59
scene_heading: INT. TINY LIVING ROOM, ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: Queen Victoria is sitting on a chair. Mrs Karim takes off her burga.
text: We glimpse the gorgeous costume underneath, full of colour. Then we
text: see her face. Her nose is pierced with a gold chain linked to her ear.
text: She giggles like a schoolgirl. Victoria is transfixed.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Oh, you really are beautiful.
text: Mrs Karim giggles again, not understanding a word. The Queen
text: stands and takes both of her hands:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Tum bahut sundar ho. [You are very beautiful.]
text: Mrs Karim beams. Her mother watches inscrutably from her burqa.
text: Abdul looks on at the whole scene, proud as Punch.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Main tum yahaan hai bahut khush hoon. [I am so happy
dialog: to have you here.]
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: A carriage arrives. Ponsonby is waiting for Lord Salisbury, who
text: gets out.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: What on earth is a Durbar Room?
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE, CORRIDOR APPROACHING DURBAR ROOM. DAY
text: The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, is marching up a corridor,
text: followed by his private secretary and deputy private secretary, with a
text: face filled with fury. Bertie and Ponsonby are running alongside.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: It is a celebration of all things Indian inspired by the
dialog: Mughal Emperors, Prime Minister.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: But I don’t understand. Who gave her permission to build
dialog: this in the first place?
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don’t blame me. I was in Monte Carlo.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I’m afraid she is a law unto herself, Prime Minister.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: For God’s sake. She’ll be wearing a burga next. I am
dialog: holding you entirely responsible, Ponsonby.
text: They have arrived at the Queen, who is waiting with Dr Reid, Lady
text: Churchill, Miss Phipps and the usual entourage.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Prime Minister, you are late.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: I’m terribly sorry, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Let us begin.
scene_heading: INT. INDIAN CORRIDOR. DAY
text: The Queen leads Salisbury, Ponsonby, Bertie, etc. down the Indian
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: This, as you can see, is the Indian corridor. The Durbar
dialog: Room was designed by Mr Bhai Ram Singh.
text: They pass a smiling Mr Bhai Ram Singh.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (in Salisbury’s ear)
text: The place is crawling with them.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And we commissioned a series of portraits. Of eminent
dialog: Indians. This is Princess Gurmma.
text: Lord Salisbury tries to feign interest as he looks at the painting.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: This, of course . . . is the Munshi.
dialog: 61
text: Salisbury looks horrified at the portrait of Abdul. Then his eye falls
text: upon the real Abdul who is in full Munshi uniform, a flowing smock.
text: Abdul beams at the Prime Minister.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: An honour to meet you, Mr Prime Minister, sir.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: A very good likeness. Don’t you think?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: (whispering to Lord Salisbury)
dialog: I asked him to take a few pounds off. This is my wife, Mr
dialog: Prime Minister, sir, and this is my mother-in-law.
text: The two ladies are by his side in their identical burgas.
dialog: At least I think that’s the right way round.
text: Abdul chuckles at his own joke.
dialog: And this is my servant, Mohammed.
text: Mohammed blows his nose. Ahmed is there.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: (aside to Ponsonby)
dialog: What the hell is going on here, Ponsonby?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And this, Prime Minister, is the Durbar Room.
scene_heading: INT. DURBAR ROOM, CONTINUOUS
text: Salisbury follows the Queen into the Durbar Room in all its splendour.
text: It is a state room decorated in an over-the-top higgledy-piggle of
text: Mughal and Hindu motifs. Indian musicians play from the balcony.
text: The Queen walks through the room pointing out the carvings:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: The carvings are all from Uttar Pradesh.
dialog: And the carpet:
dialog: The carpet was woven in a gaol in Agra. Perfect, of course,
dialog: for the tableaux.
dialog: 62
text: At the end of the room is the Peacock Throne.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: And the piéce de résistance. The Peacock Throne.
text: The Queen sits on the throne.
dialog: An exact copy of the one in Agra. And, of course, the
dialog: Koh-i-Noor!
text: She is wearing the Koh-i-Noor brooch.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Now I really do feel like the Empress of India.
text: She is like a little child, swinging her feet joyously. Salisbury and the
text: household deputation look on at her:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (aside to Dr Reid)
dialog: I thought she was supposed to be dying.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: It really is a remarkable addition to the house, Your
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: We have Abdul to thank for the whole idea.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: (who is now standing next to the Queen)
dialog: Oh, really — it was nothing.
text: Ponsonby steps forward, very formally.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: To celebrate the completion of the Durbar Room. A little
dialog: surprise, Your Majesty.
text: Mohammed appears bearing an ornately inlaid box. The Queen opens
text: the box and looks inside. Pulling a confused face:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: A mango, Your Majesty.
dialog: 63
text: A general gasp. Abdul peers inside.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
text: It’s ‘off’.
text: A look of horror on everyone’s face.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: Ponsonby. This mango is off.
text: Ponsonby’s chagrin.
scene_heading: INT. LADIES’ DRESSING ROOM, OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps, and various other ladies from the
text: entourage in petticoats getting undressed. Helped by Mrs Tuck.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
text: A line has definitively been crossed.
scene_heading: INT. MEN’S DRESSING ROOM. OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Abdul is getting changed into his Sultan of Persia outfit. Mohammed
text: wipes his brow and sits down, shaking with a fever.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
text: This is a complete and utter disaster.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: They’ve been waiting for this.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Who have?
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Ponsonby, Reid. The whole damn lot of them. Don’t you
dialog: see, she’s been rubbing their noses in it but now it’s going
dialog: public. I’m telling you they’re not going to stand for it —
dialog: they’ll rise up and chop your bloody balls off. You’ve upset
dialog: the order of everything. You think they are going to lie back
dialog: and take it?
dialog: 64
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But I haven’t done anything.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: You stupid, bloody Uncle Tom. Don’t you see you’ve upset
dialog: the order of everything. I’m telling you this whole thing is a
dialog: complete catastrophe.
text: Abdul looks worried.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: Everything alright in here?
scene_heading: INT. DURBAR ROOM. NIGHT
text: Now the Durbar Room has been transformed. A large stage with a
text: plush velvet curtain has been erected at one end and dominates the
text: room. The room is crammed with people ready to see the tableaux.
text: Bigge, Reid, Ponsonby, all the staff in the rear rows crane to see the
text: arrival of Mrs Karim and Mrs Karim’s mother.
text: The Queen raises her hand and waves at Mrs Karim.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Mrs Munshi! Please, sit here. Bertie.
text: Bertie, much put out, is forced to move. Salisbury watches the whole
text: thing in horror.
scene_heading: INT. LADIES’ DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Lady Churchill puts on her a yashmak and looks in the mirror.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: I have never been so humiliated in my entire life.
scene_heading: INT. DURBAR ROOM. NIGHT
text: The lights in the hall have dimmed. Music. The Queen squeezes Mrs
text: Karim’s hand. Alick Yorke appears from between the curtains on stage.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
text: A scene in Ancient Persia.
dialog: 65
text: He withdraws. Ponsonby pops a pill. The Queen is agog with delighted
text: anticipation. The curtains open to reveal painted flats. A scene from
text: Ancient Persia. Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps and Mrs Tuck come on
text: dressed in Persian costumes. They pose as a harem of supplicants. Enter
text: Abdul, dressed as the Sultan of Persia with Ahmed as his servant.
text: Mohammed is at the back sick with fever.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Iam the Sultan of Persia, King of all Kings. You are now
dialog: under my power.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Your Highness. We bestow all the riches of the Orient upon
dialog: you.
text: The ladies proffer paste jewels. Abdul tries his best to look triumphantly
text: regal. They all look out uneasily at the audience trying to maintain a
text: matey rictus as the orchestra swells and they hold the tableau. Ahmed
text: is in the way — Abdul surreptitiously cuffs him to clear his sightline.
text: We notice Mohammed swaying, clearly ill, and just as the curtain
text: descends as everyone else is fixed in the tableau, Mohammed sneezes.
text: Lord Salisbury is open-mouthed. Ponsonby holds his forehead in
text: despair. The Queen is unabashed with her approval.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Bravo! Bravo the Munshi!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (aside to Dr Reid)
text: Now she thinks he’s Henry Irving.
text: As the curtain opens for the ‘call’, the Queen leaps to her feet. The
text: entire household follow suit, applauding politely. Only Mrs Karim and
text: her mother remain seated. Abdul gestures his respects to Her Majesty
text: and bows egregiously. She claps enthusiastically. The curtains close
text: again. Salisbury is not happy.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Lord Salisbury bollocks Ponsonby.
speaker_heading: LORD SALISBURY
dialog: What the hell is this, Ponsonby? Munshi-mania? I’m trying
dialog: 66
dialog: to keep an empire together and it looks like they’re running
dialog: the place. I want this whole sodding mess knocked on the
dialog: head or you’re finished. Understood?
text: Lord Salisbury turns and leaves leaving Ponsonby chagrined.
scene_heading: INT. POST-TABLEAU ROOM, OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: The post-tableau soirée. Victoria is sitting amongst the prominent
text: members of the household, drinking sherry. Ponsonby, battle-torn,
text: comes in to join them.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Ah, Ponsonby. Tell us, what exactly did the Prime Minister
dialog: say about the tableau?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: To be entirely frank, Your Majesty, he seemed to be a little
text: perturbed.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Whatever for? He must have liked the Munshi.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I think the Munshi was the problem, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Really? I thought he was rather good.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I think he meant his position, Your Majesty. I think he
dialog: was rather alarmed he had such a prominent role in the
dialog: Household.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Of course Abdul has a prominent role in the household. He
dialog: is my Munshi.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: But he’s an Indian, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam aware of it.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: But given current sensitivities in the sub-continent, Your
dialog: Majesty. The Prime Minister was concerned it might be
dialog: ‘sending the wrong message’.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I should have thought it was a jolly good message.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: But he’s a Muslim, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Precisely. We owe them so much, do we not? For their role
dialog: in the Mutiny, for example.
text: The hubbub drops to a deathly silence.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: The Mutiny, Your Majesty?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Yes. For all the help they gave us with the Hindus.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: But the Mutiny was a Muslim-led revolt, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Of course. The Muslim soldiers revolted when it was
text: rumoured their rifles were greased with pork fat.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: The Grand Mufti, himself, put out a fatwa against you
dialog: personally. And Muslim soldiers killed over two thousand
dialog: British personnel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Who have you been talking to, Mother?
dialog: 68
text: Suddenly Abdul arrives with a flourish in his smartest Munshi garb.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Ta-da!
text: The Queen glares at him. Everyone else is staring. He realises
dialog: something is wrong.
scene_heading: INT. SCULPTURE CORRIDOR. OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: The Queen is standing next to Abdul in the corridor, giving him a
text: furious dressing down.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Ihave opened my heart to you. I have brought your family
dialog: from India, promoted you in the teeth of very considerable
dialog: opposition and disquiet from the Household. I even turned
dialog: a blind eye when you failed to tell me you were married,
dialog: which came, as you know, as quite a surprise. How could
dialog: you let me humiliate myself in front of the entire Household?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Iam deeply sorry, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You said the Hindus were behind the Mutiny!
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I didn’t say it was only the Hindus, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You told me categorically that the Muslims were my
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But we are your friends, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul, there is a fatwa against me. It was Muslims who
dialog: started the whole thing! This is completely unacceptable.
dialog: Abdul, I thought you were outstanding as the Sultan of
dialog: Persia, but I’m afraid you will have to go home.
dialog: 69
scene_heading: INT. FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR. NIGHT
text: Bertie, Lady Churchill and Dr Reid have gathered and are spying on
text: the conversation. Unable to repress his delight:
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Hallelujah!
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE. SCULPTURE CORRIDOR
text: Abdul is knocked for six.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You have hurt my feelings very much indeed, Abdul. Don’t
dialog: you see what a position I have been put in? Thank you for
dialog: everything you’ve done for me.
text: She starts to leave. She turns and faces Abdul. We can see Mohammed
text: looking on behind her.
dialog: I will miss you a very great deal.
text: She turns and walks down the corridor.
text: Queen Victoria marches along the corridor passing Bertie, Dr Reid
text: and Lady Churchill, who dutifully follow her, smirking like cats that
dialog: have got the cream.
text: Abdul is standing devastated. We see Mohammed has been watching.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: So we’re going home.
text: He starts to cough.
scene_heading: INT. SCULPTURE CORRIDOR. NIGHT
text: Victoria walks along the corridor followed by the smirking Bertie, Dr
text: Reid and Lady Churchill. The Queen stops at the end stairs, met by
text: Mrs Tuck. Victoria turns to face Bertie, Reid and Churchill. They
text: suddenly adopt an appropriately solemn demeanour.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Goodnight, Mother.
dialog: 7o
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Goodnight.
text: The Queen eyes them suspiciously — she knows she’s been had. They
dialog: try to keep straight faces.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS. THE SAME
text: The Queen turns and struggles up the stairs. Reid’s face breaks into
text: a smile.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: The Queen on her dressing stool, unnerved. She looks up at the photo
text: of Abdul on her wall: Abdul standing proudly as she sits at her desk.
dialog: She thinks.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Mrs Tuck!
scene_heading: INT. ABDUL’S COTTAGE. NIGHT
text: Pouring rain. It is Mrs Tuck under an umbrella. Abdul is amazed.
scene_heading: EXT. LANE OUTSIDE. NIGHT
text: Victoria is in her pony and trap. Abdul is standing by the trap under
text: an umbrella held by Mrs Tuck.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul, you have been an utter fool and I am absolutely
dialog: furious with you. It is unconscionable that as my Munshi
dialog: you should have lied to me in any way. But also it would be
text: completely churlish not to recognise the considerable
dialog: kindness and devotion you’ve shown. And after all, I am
dialog: sure you thought in some way you were protecting me. But
dialog: as the monarch, I do realise nothing can really protect me.
dialog: And in that light I have decided, even though I am very
dialog: disappointed, I would like you to stay.
text: Abdul is astonished.
dialog: 71
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: But it must never happen again.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh Your Gracious Majesty. How can I ever thank you?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, there is something we really must sort out, Abdul.
text: Abdul has no idea what she could mean.
text: Iam deeply concerned about Mrs Karim.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDROOM. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The Queen is having breakfast in bed attended by Dr Reid, Ponsonby
dialog: and Mrs Tuck.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I want you to examine Mrs Karim.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Examine Mrs Karim?!
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Just make sure everything’s working.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: But I thought the Munshi and his family were leaving us,
dialog: Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Whatever gave you that impression?
text: Astonishment from all and sundry.
text: The Munshi and his family are an integral part of the Royal
dialog: Household. And I would be very grateful if you gave her a
text: thorough examination.
text: She blithely goes back to work on her egg. Dr Reid looks at Ponsonby.
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE. TOP OF STAIRS. DAY
text: Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid descending the stairs.
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: As far as I’m concerned this is war. We’re going to dig up
dialog: every last piece of shit the blaggard’s ever done. I want
dialog: someone in India raking through the family coals. Isn’t
dialog: your son out there, Ponsonby?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I couldn’t possibly be involved in subterfuge, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Look. I’m going to be the one in charge very soon. You’ll
dialog: do as you’re bloody well told. I want no stone unturned.
dialog: We are going to make a dossier. Have it all down in black
dialog: and white; and put an end to this for good.
text: Bertie leaves. Ponsonby looks at Dr Reid.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Well, I better go and examine Mrs Munshi.
scene_heading: INT. COTTAGE. DAY
text: Dr Reid is sitting awkwardly on a chair, a stethoscope round his neck,
text: clearly very unhappy. The Munshi’s wife is in full burga with a veil,
text: sitting on the side of the bed. Her mother, also in full burga, sits beside
text: her holding her hand. Dr Reid looks at Mrs Karim awkwardly, then
text: turns to Abdul who is waiting anxiously by the doctor’s side.
speaker_heading: REID
dialog: I need to see her tongue.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Oh, it is not possible to uncover a lady’s mouth, Doctor.
speaker_heading: REID
dialog: But how can I tell anything if I can’t see her tongue?
text: Abdul speaks to the mother-in-law in Hindi, the mother-in-law speaks
text: to Mrs Karim. Then she daintily lifts her yashmak a fraction and
text: sticks out her tongue. The doctor looks at it gingerly then it disappears
text: back behind the veil as quickly as it appeared.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Well?
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: REID
dialog: I think she’s fine.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE MOHAMMED’S ROOM. DAY
text: Ponsonby and Bertie are in the servants’ corridor. Ponsonby knocks
text: on a door.
scene_heading: INT. MOHAMMED’S ROOM. DAY
text: Bertie and Ponsonby are in Mohammed’s room. Mohammed has
dialog: declined since we last saw him.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Mr Mohammed. We have come here because we are not
dialog: unaware of your predicament. That you arrived in the first
dialog: place almost by accident and find yourself stuck here
dialog: through a bizarre set of circumstances — none of your own
dialog: making. It is not beneath our notice that the inclement
dialog: English weather, especially on the Solent, has been the
dialog: cause of a precipitous decline in your general health and
dialog: what’s more you continue to suffer the vast indignity of
dialog: being a servant to someone who is in many ways your
text: inferior, who seems to discharge his role with increasing
dialog: abuse and disregard. But it has occurred to us that we
dialog: might be able to offer you some help.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: Help?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Travel home, medical care, perhaps a modest pension.
dialog: In return, of course, for a little information.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: What sort of information?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Look, I’m not going to beat about the bush. You’ve borne
text: the brunt of Abdul’s appalling behaviour and that is of a
dialog: great deal of interest to a lot of people.
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: You want me to dish the dirty?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: In a manner of speaking.
text: Mohammed coughs into his handkerchief.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: What would you like me to say?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Anything really.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: We need details. What he says, what he does.
dialog: Mohammed thinks about this.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
text: Abdul does what everybody else does. Looks for preferment.
text: ‘Curries’ favour. Crawls up the stinking greasy pole of the
dialog: shitty British Empire. Making fools of you all because he is
dialog: a servant — an Indian, Muslim servant — and you are all
dialog: quaking in your boots because he’s beating you at your own
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: No one is quaking in their boots. We are the most powerful
dialog: nation on Earth at the height of our influence.
speaker_heading: MOHAMMED
dialog: In that case the only way is down. So stick your stupid
dialog: British Empire up your stinky royal bottom-hole, Mr Bertie
dialog: Prince, sir. I hope he makes the whole damn thing come
text: tumbling down.
text: He coughs into his handkerchief. There is blood. Mohammed is
text: shocked. Ponsonby looks on in pity.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: T’ll see that you die here.
dialog: 75
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE. COUNCIL CORRIDOR. DAY
text: Bertie and Ponsonby in a cabal with Dr Reid.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: What do you mean, he wouldn’t say anything?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The man’s a complete shit.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: (out of shot)
dialog: Dr Reid!
text: The Queen comes round the corner, Suddenly Ponsonby et al. swing
text: round to see her with Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps et al.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam not a fool. I know there is some skulduggery afoot.
dialog: Something is going on here and I am not going to stand
dialog: for it.
text: Ponsonby et al. look terrified.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Dr Reid, I asked you to get to the bottom of Mrs Karim’s
text: fertility issues and it seems nothing has been done.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Well, actually, Your Majesty, it was impossible to make a
dialog: conclusive judgement for religious reasons.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, did you examine the Munshi?
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: No, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, examine the Munshi.
text: The Queen heads off. Lady Churchill and Bertie hold back.
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Bertie.
text: Bertie sheepishly follows. Dr Reid turns to Ponsonby.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: I did not do seven years at Edinburgh University to look
text: at Indian dicks.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Dr Reid stomps, unhappily, carrying his doctor’s bag towards Abdul’s
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: Dr Reid with his stethoscope, as before. Abdul standing.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Trousers.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. OSBORNE HOUSE
text: Dr Reid running. He skids round a corner.
scene_heading: INT. PONSONBY’S OFFICE. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Reid bursts in.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Eureka!
text: Ponsonby looks up.
text: He’s riddled with the clap!
dialog: 77
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Ponsonby and Reid knock on a bedroom door. A voice from inside.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: of)
dialog: Go away!
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Your Royal Highness. We come with important news about
dialog: the Munshi!
scene_heading: INT. BERTIE’S BEDROOM. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Bertie is now in bed with a post-coital cigar. Lady Churchill is also in
text: the bed. Ponsonby and Dr Reid have just explained the news.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The clap!
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: But we can’t possibly tell her. It would kill her stone dead.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Maybe it’s not such a bad idea.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: There’s more. It appears the father, far from being an
text: Indian Eminent, is in fact a prison apothecary.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I received a telegram only this afternoon from Agra. My
text: son visited the gaol himself. They are absolute nobodies.
text: Bertie takes a puff while he thinks about this.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well, it sounds pretty conclusive to me.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S STUDY. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Bertie knocks on the door and goes in.
dialog: 78
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mother, we have to see you...
text: The Queen is sitting behind a small desk, Abdul intimately by her
text: side. Ponsonby and Dr Reid stand nervously before her.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (looking at Abdul)
dialog: Alone.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam in the middle of my Urdu lesson.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mother, we come with very important news of a highly
dialog: personal matter.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I have nothing to hide from Abdul.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Iam afraid, Your Majesty, We have news concerning the
dialog: Munshi. Proof, beyond any doubt, that Abdul Karim is a
dialog: low-born imposter, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: But the Munshi is from a noble family and a long line of
dialog: teachers.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
text: The Munshi was a mere clerk in a common gaol.
text: She is silent.
dialog: My own son has sent word from India and has actually
text: spoken to the man in question.
speaker_heading: DR REID
text: His family are completely uneducated. His father is a lowly
dialog: apothecary.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The Munshi didn’t even go to school, Mother. The man’s a
text: complete fraud. There he is, overseeing the boxes. I’m next
dialog: in line and I can’t get anywhere near them.
dialog: 79
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: It is true, Your Majesty. You have been hideously duped and
dialog: ignominously misused, Your Majesty. The Munshi is a
dialog: blackguard and an arch deceiver. I am afraid Abdul and his
dialog: father are completely common.
text: The Queen looks horrified at the proceedings.
dialog: We have prepared a dossier.
text: Ponsonby flourishes the dossier and slams it on the Queen’s table. She
text: seems flabbergasted. She looks at the dossier. The case seems conclusive.
text: They stare at her with bated breath.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You despicable toads. Racialists! Spying?! Dossiers?!
text: Picking on a poor defenceless Indian. Of course they don’t
dialog: have qualifications. It’s completely different out there.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: But don’t you see, Mother, he’s using his position for his
dialog: own gain.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: And how does that make him any different to any one of
dialog: you? How dare you look down on Abdul. How dare you
dialog: defame his poor father. Bertie, I am ashamed that you are
text: part of this. Abdul is a loyal, wise, sympathetic human
dialog: being who has risen on his own merits. Not by endless
dialog: backstabbing or family connections. I will not have this.
dialog: Now. Repeat after me. I will be courteous to the Munshi.
text: She stares at Ponsonby. He looks at Abdul, then reluctantly:
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I will be courteous to the Munshi.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: I will be courteous to the Munshi.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Bertie. All of you. ‘I will be courteous to the Munshi.’
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: I will be courteous to the Munshi.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: It has become apparent that to get any respect in the
dialog: Household one needs to be formally recognised. In which
dialog: case, Abdul, I intend to give you a knighthood in the next
dialog: honours list.
text: Ponsonby almost collapses.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Enough! This is absurd. We can’t protect you from this any
dialog: further.
text: The Queen stares in astonishment.
text: The man is riddled with gonorrhoea.
text: Stunned silence.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Gonorrhoea!?
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Yes, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Well, you’re a doctor. Why don’t you treat him?! Now get
dialog: out of my sight. All of you.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE QUEEN’S STUDY. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Abdul, Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid come out of the room. Suddenly
text: Dr Reid loses it and pins Abdul up against the wall.
speaker_heading: REID
dialog: You’re killing her, you pox-ridden Indian shit.
text: Reid is strangling Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
speaker_heading: Doctor R—
text: Abdul turns puce as Reid throttles him. Ponsonby tries to wrest Abdul
text: from Dr Reid’s clutches.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Dr Reid! Be courteous!
text: Reid comes to his senses and lets go. Abdul is shaken.
scene_heading: INT. PONSONBY’S OFFICE. OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: The council is completely full with scores of staff and members of the
dialog: Royal Household.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Knighted?!
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Surely there is some law against it?
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: The man’s a common Indian, for God’s sake.
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: And a Muslim.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: She can’t just do what she likes.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: That’s right. We are the ones who make this palace work
dialog: and we are being ignored and exploited. We have to stand
dialog: up to this wanton bullying.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Exactly. This is a usurpation of the basic tenets of
dialog: leadership.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: There are moral standards at stake. What is this? The Year
dialog: of the Munshi?
text: They all laugh.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: I propose we should rise up as a household and demand
text: that she retracts.
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: But she’s the Queen.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: She is our sovereign. Her position is entirely based on the
dialog: implicit contract she makes with us. Who manages the
text: estates? Who is up at the crack of dawn preparing her
dialog: breakfast? Toadying to foreign diplomats? Eating those
dialog: interminable meals? Listening to the infernal drivel? Lords
dialog: and Ladies, the time has come to say no. We must stand
dialog: together and show her who really runs this ship.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: But this is a palace coup.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: It is an assertion of our inalienable rights as the aristocracy
dialog: of this country. The monarchy is not there by divine right.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I think it is, actually.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Oh shut up.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: I agree. We must resist these foreign intruders, for the sake
dialog: of England, the Empire and St George.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: I say: either she drops this preposterous insult or we will
dialog: all leave.
speaker_heading: GENERAL ASSENT
dialog: Hear, hear!
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: But isn’t this treason?
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: This is politics. The bloody unions do it. I don’t see why we
dialog: shouldn’t have a go.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Hooray!
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
text: The Nabob has met his match.
dialog: Yes! Yes!
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: Let’s show them what we are made of.
dialog: More approval!
dialog: That we are prepared to stand up to tyranny: for justice, for
dialog: right and for England!
text: Huge cheers.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Are you with me?
dialog: Unanimous assent.
dialog: Are you with me?
text: Unanimous assent and self-congratulation apart from:
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: So what should we do?
dialog: Nobody is sure.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Somebody has to tell her.
text: They all suddenly look nervous.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: We should make a deputation.
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: Won’t that look like a cabal?
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: I think you should go. You are the head of Household.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: I couldn’t possibly go, it would bring the position into
dialog: disrepute.
dialog: 84
scene_heading: ALICK YORKE
dialog: You know her quite well, Mrs Tuck.
speaker_heading: MRS TUCK
dialog: I’m just a dresser. What about Miss Phipps?
text: Everyone’s attention is drawn to the skinny, mild-mannered, nervous
dialog: Lady in Waiting.
scene_heading: LADY CHURCHILL
dialog: Brilliant. You’re the maid of honour. Exactly the person to
dialog: break the news.
text: Miss Phipps looks terrified.
scene_heading: INT. COUNCIL CORRIDOR. OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Mrs Tuck fusses over Miss Phipps, making her look just so. Ponsonby,
text: Dr Reid and Lady Churchill are there.
speaker_heading: PONSONBY
dialog: Off you go — and don’t take no for an answer.
text: The poor woman is terrified. She timidly makes her way up the stairs.
text: She stops and looks back. Lady Churchill gives her a look of stern
text: admonishment. Phipps nervously carries on. Then stops again. It’s
text: grandma’s footsteps. Churchill ushers her on again.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL ROOM. NIGHT
text: A terrified Miss Phipps knocks meekly on the double doors.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S STUDY. NIGHT
text: Miss Phipps walks nervously across the vast room to the little table
text: where Queen Victoria is sitting alone at her letters. The Queen looks
text: up, clearly displeased to be interrupted. Miss Phipps is shaking. The
text: Queen stares at her full of indignant expectation.
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: Erm...
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Speak up.
dialog: 85
text: Miss Phipps tries to gather herself and stop herself collapsing.
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: Your Majesty...
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Out with it, girl, we are very busy.
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: There is something I must say that .. .
text: She looks at the Queen, terrified.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: What is the meaning of this? Stop shaking.
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: I have come to ask you to reconsider the elevation of . . .
dialog: of Mr Karim.
text: The Queen can’t quite believe her ears.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: Ihave come to ask you not to give Mr Karim a knighthood,
dialog: Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Why the devil not?
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: The members of the Household demand that you abandon
dialog: your plans, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Demand?!
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: We believe that it degrades the very concept of knighthood.
dialog: He comes from a very low family, Your Majesty. And he is
dialog: coloured.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Get out of my sight.
dialog: 86
text: Miss Phipps looks like she’s beginning to crack.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Did you not hear me?
speaker_heading: MISS PHIPPS
dialog: Your Majesty, I must inform you that if you refuse — the
dialog: entire Household will resign.
text: The Queen cannot believe her ears. She pauses for a moment. Then lets
text: out an earth-shattering scream of rage:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Treason! Treason!
text: She sweeps the table in anger, evicting her Fabergé egg.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHENS, THE SAME
text: Miss Phipps is given whisky.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE QUEEN’S STUDY, THE SAME
text: Ponsonby, Bertie and Reid approach the Queen’s study.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S STUDY. DAY
text: Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid march into the room. The Queen is sitting
text: with Abdul. Abdul stands up and moves out of the way.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mummy. Enough is enough. You are bringing the monarchy
dialog: into crisis. And you are humiliating yourself for no good
dialog: reason. You will drop this Munshi business forthwith. Do
dialog: you hear me?
text: She stares at him.
text: The Munshi is a servant. He is an ignorant, pox-ridden,
dialog: Indian peasant. Did you really think the Household would
dialog: countenance such an insult?
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I will not be disobeyed.
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No, I’ve put up with you for over fifty years. You will drop
dialog: this forthwith or...
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Or?...Or?...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We will have you certified insane. And removed from office
dialog: immediately. Here are the papers. Signed by Dr Reid.
text: The Queen is stunned. She looks at Dr Reid, who appears terrified of
dialog: the whole situation.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Iam eighty-one years of age. I have had nine children,
dialog: forty-two grandchildren, and almost a billion citizens. I
text: have rheumatism, a collapsed uterus, am morbidly obese,
dialog: deaf in one ear. I have known eleven prime ministers,
dialog: passed 2,347 pieces of legislation. I have been in office for
dialog: sixty-two years, 234 days — thus I am the longest-serving
dialog: monarch in world history. I am responsible for five
dialog: households and a staff of more than three thousand. I am
text: cantankerous, boring, greedy, ill-tempered, at times selfish
dialog: and myopic, metaphorically and literally. I am, perhaps,
dialog: disagreeably attached to power and should not have
dialog: smashed the Emperor of Russia’s egg. But I am anything
dialog: but insane. If the Household wish to disobey me, so be it —
dialog: let them do it face to face. I will see everyone in the Durbar
dialog: Room. At once!
text: She marches out past Abdul:
dialog: Where on earth did you get gonorrhoea?
scene_heading: INT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DURBAR ROOM. DAY
text: The Durbar Room is full. The chief members of the Royal Household
text: are there: Ponsonby, Reid, Phipps, Lady Churchill, but so are the
text: pages, footmen and the maids. The Queen marches in to face them.
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I understand there is some concern over my desires on
dialog: preferment. I understand that feelings have run high and
dialog: I understand that you have decided to resign rather than
dialog: withstand my decision. If any one of you would like to
dialog: tender their resignation it will be accepted without any
dialog: unfortunate consequences — but at least have the decency
dialog: to do it to my face. If anyone wishes to resign, please step
dialog: forward.
text: She stares at them, absolutely formidable. Nervousness. People looking
text: at one another. Small feints, but no one moves. Abdul is watching from
text: the doorway.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I would like to inform you that I have decided against
dialog: awarding any knighthoods at this moment.
text: Relief all round that she’s come to her senses.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Instead, you will be delighted to know I have decided to
dialog: make the Munshi a Commander of the Royal Victorian
dialog: Order as a special token of my personal esteem for his
dialog: services to the Empire. That will be all.
text: Ponsonby is so overcome he has to sit down. The Queen is shaking.
text: She walks through the middle of the crowd who part to observe their
text: customary obsequies. She walks out into the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. INDIAN CORRIDOR. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The Queen walks out into the corridor alone. But we see she is
text: faltering. Abdul sees her and runs the whole length of the corridor and
text: catches her in his arms. Dr Reid and Mrs Tuck arrive. Reid pushes
text: Abdul out of the way to get to the Queen.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Satisfied?
text: Reid pushes Abdul away from the Queen. Then suddenly a shaken
text: Ahmed arrives.
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: AHMED
dialog: Dr Reid! Dr Reid! It’s Mr Mohammed!
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD. DAY
text: A devastated Abdul is at Mohammea’s funeral. The Queen is with
text: Abdul, Mrs Karim, the mother-in-law and Ahmed. Dr Reid and
text: Ponsonby stand nearby out of duty to Her Majesty. Reid turns to
dialog: Ponsonby.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: One down.
text: Abdul stands by the grave as the others leave.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Iam sorry, my friend.
text: Then Abdul helps lead the Queen away.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: We need to talk.
scene_heading: EXT. CARRIAGE. GROUNDS OF OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: After the funeral. The Queen and Abdul sit in the open carriage. The
text: Queen is wrapped up against the cold weather but looks very frail.
text: She takes Abdul’s hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I think it’s time that you went home, Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: This is my home.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I have been short-sighted and selfish. You are a young man,
dialog: Abdul. Your whole life ahead of you.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: But, Your Majesty —
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I cannot protect you if I am not here. You must go, Abdul —
dialog: go
dialog: with your wife. The vultures are already circling. I don’t even
dialog: think I will see this year out. All these stupid ceremonies.
dialog: What is the point in them, Abdul? They will kill me.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: You will live for many more years, Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: No. Abdul, I am sick and weary. I can hardly see, barely
dialog: hear. The Empress of half the world and I can’t get in and
dialog: out of my own carriage.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I cannot leave you. I am your Munshi.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: ‘You must protect yourself. How could we have been so
dialog: blind? Forget me, Abdul. You have been a very good friend.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: They can do what they like, but every day I will come and
dialog: be at your side as long as I shall live.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: You are a silly fool, Abdul. But I adore you.
text: Snow falls all around them. Abdul holds the Queen’s hand.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The Queen, now ill, is wheeled along the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: The Queen is now in bed unconscious, surrounded by the Household.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. NIGHT
text: Abdul is waiting outside the door. Ponsonby and Reid come out
text: looking grave.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: I think you should inform the Kaiser.
dialog: 91
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Wide shot of the house at night. A light shining from an upstairs room.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAME, CORRIDOR
text: Abdul is dutifully standing sentry outside the Queen’s room.
scene_heading: EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAWN
text: Wide shot of Osborne House. Carriages arrive. The Kaiser gets out.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. THE SAME
text: The Kaiser et al. walk past Abdul into the Queen’s room. The door is
dialog: closed.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAWN
text: The darkened room is full. On one side of the bed is the Kaiser, on the
text: other is Bertie. They look at the Queen, who appears to be asleep.
text: Suddenly she stirs. There is a gasp in the room. She opens her eyes.
text: Dr Reid takes away the oxygen mask. Bertie takes her hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It’s me, Mummy. And your grandson, Wilhelm. The Kaiser.
text: She takes the Kaiser’s hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: No fighting when I’m gone. Promise me. Where is my
dialog: Munshi?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Hush. Hush. Everything is fine.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: But I need my Munshi. Where is the Munshi?
text: Bertie, hurt that he is not enough, gives in.
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Bring her the Munshi.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. DAY
text: Abdul is resolutely standing by.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Don’t you dare upset her.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: The crowds of dignitaries part to let Abdul through. He approaches her
text: sadly, and holds her hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Abdul?
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Yes. I am here.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I want to talk to the Munshi alone.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: I think Your Majesty might . . .
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: I said: alone!
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. THE SAME
text: The Kaiser, Bertie, the Household et al. all troop into the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. THE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. THE SAME
text: The Queen has been propped up with pillows. Abdul kneels by her
text: bedside. Dr Reid is discreetly at the back of the room, in the shadows.
text: The Queen takes some oxygen then turns to Abdul.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: When I was young I used to long for death. And now when
dialog: 93
dialog: there is nothing to live for I cling on to life with every
dialog: breath. I am scared, Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Don’t be scared.
text: Abdul quotes a poem in Hindi. Then translates it:
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: ‘Listen, little drop, give up yourself without regret
dialog: And in exchange you will gain the ocean.
dialog: Give yourself away
dialog: And in the arms of the Great Sea be secure.’
dialog: The Great poet Rumi.
text: She squeezes Abdul’s hand.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Prema puri hai. Hama kevala tukare kara rahe haim. ‘Love
dialog: is the whole. We are only pieces.’
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: That is very beautiful. You are a teacher, Abdul.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Everybody knows Rumi.
dialog: Allah is the teacher.
dialog: Love is the whole.
dialog: Prema puri hai.
dialog: ‘We are only pieces.
dialog: Hama kevala tukare kara rahe haim.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: ‘Prema puri hai. Hama kevala tukare kara rahe haim,’
dialog: Alhamdulilah!
dialog: I keep thinking I am falling.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Fall. Everything will be well. You are about to go to a much
dialog: safer place.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
text: To the Banquet Hall of Eternity.
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Yes. Goodbye, my Queen.
text: Abdul is crying. The Queen holds on to Abdul’s hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN VICTORIA
dialog: Goodbye. Take care, my sweet son.
text: She starts to nod off, Dr Reid puts his hand on Abdul’s shoulder,
text: clearly moved.
speaker_heading: DR REID
dialog: Let her sleep.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Abdul emerges still in tears. Bertie, the Kaiser, the Archbishop et al. all
text: look on in pity as Abdul, completely absorbed, walks away. They troop
text: back into the Queen’s chamber.
scene_heading: INT. THE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: Everyone has resumed their vigil. The junior serving girl yawns at the
text: back. Suddenly we realise the Queen’s oxygen bottle stops emitting
text: bubbles. Bertie has the Queen’s hand. He realises she has died.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: Abdul is waiting outside. The doors open. Bertie appears. He looks
text: Abdul in the eye with contempt.
scene_heading: EXT. PALACE GATES. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Bigge, dressed immaculately in black with a top hat, walks to the gates
dialog: to make an announcement.
speaker_heading: BIGGE
dialog: I grieve to say Her Majesty passed away at half past six
dialog: precisely. Long live the King.
dialog: 95
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S STUDY. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Bertie in the darkness of the Queen’s study. He throws open the
text: shutters himself, morning light floods in. He sits at the Queen’s desk —
dialog: it’s his now.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Mrs Tuck throws open the curtains as she did at the beginning of the
text: film. The crepuscular room is flooded with light. Maids throw off the
text: sheets. The Queen’s body is blanched.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S STUDY. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY
text: Bertie looks down and sees on the desk her Urdu journals.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: Mrs Tuck comes out of the Queen’s bedchamber. She takes Abdul’s
text: hand and leads him into the room.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER
text: The Queen has been transformed into a transcendental vision. We see
text: Abdul transfixed by the dead Queen. Slowly, with great reverence, he
text: kneels before her.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: May Allah bless you.
text: He hisses her feet. Finally as he raises his head we see his devastated
text: sadness. Then his look turns from one of devastated loss to one of
text: ‘foreboding.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, OSBORNE HOUSE
text: Abdul walks out along the corridor and down the grand staircase. On
text: the sound track we hear the sound of violent banging on a door.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (out of shot)
dialog: Open up in the name of the King!
dialog: 96
scene_heading: EXT. ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY

text: pushing her aside as they rush into the house.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM, ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: The henchmen run into the room and start ransaking the place. Mrs
text: Karim and her mother in full burga try to prevent them taking things.
text: A henchman goes past with a drawer stuffed with letters.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: The henchmen have made a big pyre of the letters. One henchman
text: pours petrol on and the whole thing goes up in flames. Bertie looks on
text: contentedly, smoking a cigar. Mrs Karim runs out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: Abdul walking. He looks up to see smoke. He hears Mrs Karim
text: scream and he starts to run.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY
text: A henchman throws on more letters. Mrs Karim, screaming, is now
text: being restrained by a henchman. Suddenly there is a shout. Abdul
text: comes running into the garden.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: No!
text: Footmen hold back the screaming Abdul as the pyre burns.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I want you out of here immediately.
text: Satisfied, he leaves. Mrs Karim takes Abdul’s hand.
speaker_heading: MRS KARIM
dialog: They’ve taken everything.
dialog: 97
text: She surreptitiously gives him something as the pyre burns. He looks
text: down. She has given him the locket. He holds it tight. The smoke of the
text: fire obscures everything.
scene_heading: INT. PASSENGER FERRY, SOLENT. MISTY MORNING
text: The smoke turns into mist on the Solent. We are on a ferry. Abdul and
text: his wife as it pulls away from shore. No one recognises Abdul. He opens
text: his palm to reveal the Queen’s locket. Looking back, he disappears into
text: the mist as the boat sails away.
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED ROOM, AGRA. MORNING
text: As in the beginning of the film, shutters are opened on to bright
text: daylight as a muezzin calls to prayers.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP, AGRA
text: As before, we see a figure from behind praying. The rooftops of Agra
text: below, the Taj Mahal in the distance.
dialog: Title:
text: ABDUL RETURNED TO AGRA IN I9OIT
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS, AGRA. BRIGHT DAY
text: The bustle of an Agra street. A figure makes his way through the chaotic
text: street life as in the opening of the film. But this time the figure is slow.
text: We follow him from behind and see he has grey hair. We realise this is
text: Abdul. He makes his way determinedly through the city to a park.
scene_heading: EXT. AGRA, PARK
text: Abdul makes his way to a statue of Queen Victoria. He kneels. We
text: think he is praying but he kisses the Queen’s feet.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: Good morning, Your Majesty.
dialog: 98
text: Abdul sits on the base of the statue. He looks out at the crowds passing
text: by. In his hand we see the locket — the camera slowly cranes back.
text: Abdul the faithful retainer has kept his word: he remains loyally with
dialog: his Queen despite everything.
dialog: Title:
scene_heading: HE DIED NINE YEARS LATER
