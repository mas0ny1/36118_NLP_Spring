scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps. Apartment
text: buildings line the curb, it is very quiet. In one building, six floors
text: up, a bedroom light is on. WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE
text: looking out the window.
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: What kind of a crash was it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: You seen my suitcase?
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: There's nothing on the news about a
dialog: crash. Did he say what airline?
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: He didn't say much at all. Honey --
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: In the closet. I don't understand,
dialog: Norman -- why would they call you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Don't be so supportive, honey.
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: Well, I can't imagine five years of
dialog: unemployment --
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Four. Four years --
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: Four years of unemployment would
dialog: look too good on a resume.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Keep watching the news. Are you
dialog: watching the news?
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: How are you getting to the airport?
dialog: You need money for the bus?
text: A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front
text: of the apartment building. A U.S. NAVY decal is on the door.
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
text: There's a U.S. Navy car outside,
dialog: Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: Was it a military crash?
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: They never used to send a Navy car.

text: THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY
text: Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the
dialog: Pacific Ocean.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY
text: Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back. He studies a
text: pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE". The PILOT, in
text: the cockpit, turns to him.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson?
text: Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm in psychology. Was. Still am
dialog: really, just been a while.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I treat aircrash survivors.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You've heard of me?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Well, everybody's been talking about
dialog: that report you wrote.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What report?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What report?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: You mean you don't know?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Know what?
text: The pilot glances back at him again.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Must be another Johnson then. Been
dialog: flying so many scientists out here
dialog: -- can't keep everyone straight.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Who's everyone?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Physicists, mathematicians,
dialog: geologists, you name it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Geologists? At a plane crash?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Strange, isn't it? In the middle of
dialog: the ocean no less.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What the hell would a geologist be
dialog: doing at a plane crash?
text: Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the
dialog: water.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP DECK -- DAY
text: The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about. A
text: young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to
text: greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.
text: She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Just that. Careful, it's heavy.
text: She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: No other equipment? Scientific
dialog: instruments?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No, they didn't say --
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: This way, sir.
text: Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP
text: She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Captain Barnes wants to see you
dialog: right away, sir.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Captain who?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Barnes. He's very eager to meet you.
dialog: Been calling us every half hour to
dialog: see if you're arrived.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Really?
text: As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,
text: tries to smooth it out.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: By the way sir, I've read your
dialog: report. I think it's brilliant.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What report?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: You mean they haven't told you yet?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Told me what?
text: She staightens up, like she might have said too much.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: This way, sir.
scene_heading: INT. BARNES' OFFICE
text: CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: How's he look?... Well, we can't all
dialog: be officers, can we?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: They tell me he's brilliant.
scene_heading: EXT. BARNES' OFFICE
text: Norman stands in front of the door. The doorplate reads: PROJECT
text: COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES. Norman straightens his big-knotted
text: tie. Deep breath.
scene_heading: INT. BARNES' OFFICE
text: As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his
text: desk, as Norman steps inside.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Dr. Norman Johnson. Welcome aboard.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Thank you, Colonel.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Captain.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Captain. Right, forgive me.
text: Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up. An akward silence.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Well, thanks for the opportuninty
dialog: here -- my wife appreciates it.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson. You
dialog: weren't my choice. The Pentagon made
dialog: me take you.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: The Pentagon? I didn't know I had
dialog: friends in Washington.
text: Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Come with me. The team's already
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What team?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What have you been told so far?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: The usual. Plane crash. Survivers
dialog: unknown. Routine stuff really.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Nothing else.
text: A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Captain Barnes. Dr. Johnson.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hello.
text: Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,
text: wondering how the guard knows his name.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You talk to any reporters? Any
dialog: press?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Press? No, I haven't.
text: The steel door shuts loudly behind them.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Good. Security's been our biggest
dialog: worry. Now that you're here we can
dialog: shut this thing down tight.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: From what? What's with all the
dialog: security?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well, we don't have all the facts
dialog: yet.
text: Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...
scene_heading: INT. TECH ROOM
text: Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,
text: screens, and grids. Officers talk into radios. Technicians work on
dialog: computers.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We're moving fast considering the
dialog: storm.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Storm? What storm?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: A cyclone's on it's way in. I
dialog: thought they would have told you on
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: They didn't tell me anything.
text: Norman tries to keep pace...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We've had divers working around the
dialog: clock. Take a look at this...
text: ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean
text: floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How deep is he?
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: A thousand feet.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: A thousand? An airplane crashes into
dialog: a thousand feet of water -- I don't
dialog: want to sound pessimistic here, but
dialog: I assume there are no survivors.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Then why am I here?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What do you need me for?
text: ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic
speaker_heading: OBJECT.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr.
dialog: Johnson. It's a bit larger than
dialog: that.
text: Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: (to technician)
dialog: Bring up the grid, would you?
text: ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What is it? A military spacecraft?
dialog: Like a shuttle or satellite?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Something like that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That doesn't surprise you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Not really, no. Something of the
text: military crashes in the ocean -- it
dialog: explains why there was nothing on
dialog: the news, why you've kept everything
dialog: a secret... When did it crash?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: As best we can estimate, it crashed
dialog: four hundred years ago.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Four hundred? You're kidding, right?
text: ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft
text: and a small layer of ROCK above it.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: See this? Coral. Geologists measured
text: the coral growth on top of the craft
text: to be over five meters thick.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Geologists?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Coral grows at a rate of two and a
dialog: half centimeters a year --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: -- Wait a second --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: -- dating the crash at least that
dialog: old.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hold on --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Maybe older --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: -- there's got to be some mistake
dialog: here -- a four hundred year old
dialog: military spacecraft? There's no such
dialog: thing... our space program isn't even
text: forty years old.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Extraordinary, isn't it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson...
text: because it's sitting on the bottom
dialog: of our ocean floor.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
text: Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Off the record, I don't mind telling
dialog: you, this thing scares the shit out
dialog: of me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: It doesn't make any sense.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We think it might. That's why we
dialog: brought you here. We've assembled
dialog: your team -- they're waiting for us
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What team?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: The one you recommended. In the ULF
dialog: report you wrote for the Bush
dialog: administration.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that
dialog: in years. You mean someone actually
dialog: read it?
text: As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from
text: under his arm, hands it to Norman.
text: Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Your report's become our bible down
dialog: here, Dr. Johnson. We've been
dialog: carrying out each of your
dialog: recommendations -- one by one -- to
text: the smallest detail.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: But sir, I don't understand. This
dialog: report -- these recommendations...
dialog: they're for an encounter with extra-
dialog: terrestrial life.
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM
text: ON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: How big is this spacecraft?
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Of what we're able to measure,
text: roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: A half a mile long?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: The wing dimension alone is larger
dialog: that any aircraft we've seen.
text: The team members sit around the conference table:
text: TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here. BETH
text: HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.
scene_heading: ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet. HARRY ADAMS, 32,
dialog: mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How much damage?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right. So you're saying it survived
dialog: a high speed impact with water
dialog: without a scratch?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm
dialog: just stating the facts.
dialog: (continuing)
text: The outer metal is made of a
text: titanium alloy, built into an epoxy-
dialog: resin honeycomb. The necessary
dialog: technology to bond this type of
dialog: metal has never been invented.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Never invented?
text: ON NORMAN, watching the team...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: In basic English, what does all this
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Basic English? There's no way this
dialog: spacecraft was constructed on our
dialog: planet.
scene_heading: A LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR
scene_heading: INT. TESTING ROOM -- LATER
text: A large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE.
text: ON BETH -- standing next to him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Five years. No phone calls. What am
dialog: I -- a leper?
text: Norman sits up...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth, look, can I trust you with a
dialog: little secret?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I love secrets.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That ULF report everybody's patting
dialog: me on the back about?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I've read it twice, Norman. It's
dialog: brilliant.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's bullshit. The report's a joke.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's quite a secret.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I spent a week reading Sagan and
dialog: watching re-runs of the Twilight
dialog: Zone. Seriously. I was just trying
dialog: to pay the mortgage on my house -- I
dialog: had no idea --
text: ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room,
text: monitoring Beth and Norman.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Do yourself a favor, Norman. Are you
dialog: listening? Don't tell anyone what
dialog: you just told me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: C'mon, Beth -- that report's like
text: the blind leading the blind.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Because when we get down there --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wait -- down where?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: To the spacecraft. To investigate.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Underwater?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What do you expect? For them to
dialog: bring it up here?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We can't go down there. We're not
dialog: prepared. That deep? That takes
dialog: years of training, Beth. We're just
dialog: scientists. Lab scietists. We wear
dialog: ties and lab coats to work -- not
dialog: oxygen tanks.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well, you must have realized the
dialog: chances an encounter like this would
dialog: happen here. In the ocean.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: 70 percent of the earth's surface is
dialog: water, Norman. That's first grade
dialog: geography.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It never occurred to me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well, let's pray that's the only
dialog: mistake you made. Have you said
dialog: anything to Barnes about this?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The timing has never seemed quite
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Just keep your mouth shut, alright?
dialog: This could mean everything to our
dialog: careers, you know that? Don't
dialog: jeopardize this.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (nervous laughter)
dialog: What -- are you threatening me?
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT
text: THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.
text: ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at
dialog: the water.
text: ON NORMAN, approaching him. Arthur never looks at Norman, he just
text: stares out at the water.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I don't know you, but I'll be honest
dialog: with you. I don't like this. I don't
dialog: like any of this. Especially, the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Seasick? A marine biologist?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I don't belong here. None of us
dialog: belong here. Look at that.
text: ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It scares the shit out of me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot. It is dark. His eyes are open. He
text: stares at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DESCENT PLATFORM
text: A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly. A SUB-OFFICER
text: help Norman lower himself through the hatch.
scene_heading: INT. DESCENT SUB
text: Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment. Seated in a
text: circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur. Ahead of them, Captain
text: Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall
text: of plexiglass.
text: Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: (through the intercom)
dialog: Our descent will take 13 minutes.
text: Descending at a speed of 80 feet per
dialog: minute.
text: Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into
text: Arthur's ear.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Pressure adjustments will cause the
dialog: sub to lurch at times, but don't be
dialog: alarmed. It's perfectly normal...
text: Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
text: The sub's interior atmosphere will
dialog: experience moisture as we descend,
dialog: and the temperature will drop
dialog: rapidly. Just relax and remain
text: seated during the descent.
text: Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: We have clearing from the base.
text: Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub
text: make a HISSING sound. The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Arthur?
text: Harry has gotten to Arthur. Arthur is on the verge of panic.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Arthur? You alright?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Open the hatch door, please.
text: Harry continues to whisper in his ear.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Captain, open the hatch door, please
dialog: ... the hatch door, Captain. Open it,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Calm down, Dr. Levine.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Let me out, Captain. Open the door!
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Please, Dr. Levine.
text: Arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: (through the plexiglass)
dialog: Sit down, Dr. Levine! You're in a
dialog: military operation now --
text: Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: ... Your civil rights have been
dialog: overridden!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Open it, Captain!
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Dr. Levine, please! Return to your
dialog: seat!
text: Arthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Open the fucking door!
text: The sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop. The compartment is totally
text: silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.
text: ON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman.
text: The sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal. The hatch door
text: opens.
text: And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and
text: out the hatch door.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Anybody else?
dialog: Silence.
text: The hatch door LOCKS, loudly. The sub lurches, and begins descending.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Pussy.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's that -- mistake number two,
dialog: Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He wasn't feeling well.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He's a pussy.
text: Harry is still staring at Norman...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How are you feeling, Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You holding up alright?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Fine. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don't be defensive.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm not being defensive.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You sound defensive.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: What'd you say to him?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing
text: that Norman doesn't already know.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What does Norman already know?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Norman thinks we shouldn't be going
dialog: down. Thinks it's a mistake.
text: Norman looks over at Beth.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She told me what you said, Norman.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What is it, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just one of Norman's many secrets.
text: ON NORMAN, saying nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN
text: WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.
scene_heading: EXT. DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK
text: The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal. Around
text: it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM
text: CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.
speaker_heading: OFFICER (O.S.)
text: One moment for pressurizing.
text: A SOFT WHIRR.
text: ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the
text: small, claustrophobic pressurizing room. Like sardines. Nobody says
text: anything. A long beat.
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: in front of them, opens. TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female
text: officer, stands before them. She wears a black plastic PAD, a
text: "talker", around her neck.
text: She hands each member their own "talker". Norman takes his.
scene_heading: INT. DH-8 HALLWAY
text: Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway. Each of
text: them wears the "talkers" around their necks.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: They pressurize us with helium.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's wrong with oxygen?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It's a corrosive gas. On earth, it
text: makes a half-eaten apple turn brown
text: and puts the ugly, iron rust on an
text: Oldsmobile. At a pressure this low,
dialog: oxygen becomes toxic. Breathe it
dialog: down here, and it'll do to your dick
dialog: what it does to the Oldsmobile.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Important safety tip. Thanks
dialog: Captain.
text: Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
text: Captain, the divers have the airlock
text: mounted at the door. The robot is
text: now in position to enter the
dialog: spacecraft.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Robot? What robot?
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray
text: metal of the spacecraft.
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: Edmunds, bring up the robot's camera
dialog: feed.
text: JANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel. Another
text: MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Captain, you know, I really
dialog: appreciate you hauling us a thousand
dialog: feet below sea level so we can watch
text: this historical event on television.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Nobody goes inside, until we know
dialog: what's inside.
text: ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on
text: a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Can you open that panel?
speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: Working on it now, sir.
text: ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel. Trying to
text: pry the panel open.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'd like it noted in the report that
dialog: I think we should be doing this
dialog: ourselves. Making a manned entry...
text: The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'd also like it noted --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try using
dialog: suction.
text: ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber
text: sucker. It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.
speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: It's not sucking, sir.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Thank you, I can see that. Try
dialog: something else.
speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: We don't have anything else to try,
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well, shit -- find something, do
dialog: something... make something up --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What about a crowbar?
text: Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What about a crowbar?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What if we go out there, you know --
text: wedge a crowbar in the door and pry
text: the thing open.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Pry the thing open? What are we --
dialog: neanderthals?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: All that banging and pounding. I
dialog: don't know. We should think about
text: making a good first impression.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: For who? The fish?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: For whoever's in that thing.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Or whatever's in that thing.
text: ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back
text: at them.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Norman, what do you think?
text: Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Me? Well -- I don't really... I
dialog: mean, you could... you know, you
dialog: could make a real solid case... a
dialog: crowbar?
text: All eyes on Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't know.
text: A beat as they all stare at him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm secure enough with that.
scene_heading: INT. CHANGING ROOM
text: ANGLE ON A LOCKER door opening. Inside is an elaborate JUMPSUIT and
text: HELMET with the name: "JOHNSON", stenciled above the faceplate.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Are we all -- I mean, is it
dialog: necessary for all of us to go... out
dialog: there?
text: The other team members take their suits out of their lockers.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Nothing to be nervous about. These
text: suits are wired and electrically
text: heated. Each equipped with an alarm
dialog: that triggers automatically if life-
dialog: support sustems go below optimum.
text: Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something
dialog: nuclear.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's just like swimming, Norman...
dialog: You know how to swim, don't you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're not afraid of the water, are
dialog: you, Norman?
text: They all look over at him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (half smiling)
dialog: Isn't there a psychological term for
dialog: that, Dr. Johnson?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Yeah. Drowning.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)
text: Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of ocean
text: water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean. It looks like a
text: tiny swimming pool. Ted jumps in next. Beth, Harry, and Norman are
dialog: left...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You're next, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (nervous as hell)
dialog: No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Such a gentlemen when you're scared
dialog: shitless.
text: She hops in. Norman watches, looks up at Harry, next to him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Go ahead. Ladies first.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No, why don't --
text: Harry nudges him forward.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: C'mon.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wait a second, I --
text: Harry pushes him again. Norman catches himself.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Geez, c'mon, alright. Gimme a
dialog: minute. Let me get my bearings --
text: Harry pushes him again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: C'mon, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Look, would you --
text: And Harry just pushes him in. Norman slips and falls awkwardly... into
dialog: the ocean depths.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: Quiet. Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING.
text: For a couple beats.
text: Now... NORMAN'S POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES from
text: behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor.
text: Norman's head turns, and he's BLINDED by a light -- it's Harry, the
text: light SHINING from the top of Harry's helmet.
text: WE HEAR Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet.
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: The switch is on your waist.
text: ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist.
text: HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.
text: ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor.
text: HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground.
text: NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their
text: helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each other, like
text: searchlights on a foggy night.
text: CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING. Couple beats. And
speaker_heading: HEARS:
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: Look at that thing.
text: Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...
text: LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny
dialog: and insignificant almost as...
text: IN FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT. Dwarfing them in size, looming
text: large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen. The enormous tail fin,
text: in the distance, extends high out of the coral.
text: In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel --
text: cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: About 60 feet deep. Narrower than they'd like. Norman descends,
text: clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to
text: the coral walls.
text: THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR
scene_heading: INT. SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK
text: CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his
text: faceplate.
text: THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL
text: Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a
text: sledgehammer.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Gimme some room here, will you? Back
dialog: off. Gimme some space.
text: They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted
text: keeps swinging.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Looks alot like an airplane door,
dialog: doesn't it?
text: Ted stops and looks at the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Alot like. You know, I noticed it
dialog: before, but I didn't...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shutup, Ted. You didn't notice shit.
dialog: Keep hammering.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You want me to try?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're a 53 year old shrink, what
dialog: are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Give him the hammer, Ted.
text: Norman takes the hammer. Walks up to the wedge. Gets his bearings.
text: Rears back... then stops.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What is it, your back give out?
text: Something has caught Norman's eye. He looks down at the wedge.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What is it, Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Take a look.
text: Barnes comes toward him. The others follow. Barnes bends down, looks
text: closely down at the wedge in the door.
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: It's chipped.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Chipped? The door? How can it be
dialog: chipped?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I don't know how it can be chipped,
dialog: but it's chipped.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I thought you said there wasn't any
dialog: damage done in the crash?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Then how can it be chipped?
text: ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: There's heat coming the door.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Back away then.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Wait a minute --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I said back away.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Would you wait a minute?
text: THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE
text: Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his
dialog: buckle.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Ted, get her away from the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What are you going to do -- shoot
dialog: her?
text: The RUMBLING louder...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Get her away!
text: THE DOOR begins to slide open.
text: Beth backs away.
text: THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside. The door
text: stops, it's open, it's quiet. They all stand there, looking at
text: BLACKNESS. A long beat.
scene_heading: INT. SPACECRAFT
text: ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside. His helmet light SHINES on the
text: others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended
text: high in the air.
text: Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them.
text: Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of
text: darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and
speaker_heading: GIRDERS.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look at this.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What is it?
text: Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Some sort of lead or something.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Radiation shield, you think?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: A foot and a half thick? That'd
dialog: withstand a helluva lot of
dialog: radiation.
text: Beth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK. WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined
text: on the dusty floor.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Hold on --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Any of you get ahead of me -- walk
dialog: this far up?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well, think. Because there's
dialog: footprints here that aren't mine.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, they're not mine.
text: ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Calm down, alright? They gotta be
dialog: somebody's here. Let's stay
dialog: together, please.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LONG SHOT -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk,
text: walking. Their tiny streams of LIGHT moving about. WE SEE just how
dialog: ominous this spacecraft really is.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's empty. Why would someone build a
dialog: ship like this?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You'd have to ask them.
text: They approach a DOOR, at the end of the catwalk.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Alright, Beth, do that thing you did
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How about I just press the button?
text: She presses a button near the door. The door SLIDES open.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Or just... press the button.
text: Barnes holds out his gun, and enters. The others behind him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Strange, isn't it? You know -- how
dialog: it would have a button.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Earth doesn't have a patent on
dialog: buttons, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Still, make a note I recognized that.
text: ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall. It seems to be opening
text: up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops. Dead in his tracks.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: (serious)
dialog: What do you make of this?
text: ON NORMAN -- as he steps around Barnes, his light BRIGHTENING on: A
text: SIGN that reads: "Trash."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (softly)
dialog: What the hell?
text: Very softly, Harry begins to laugh.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: English?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's right.
text: Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES
text: throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather, very
text: comfortable looking.
text: They begin to slowly wander about...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: TED
text: It doesn't make any sense.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You don't think it does? I think
dialog: it's rather obvious.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Is it some sort of joke? Like one of
dialog: those hoaxes?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A spacecraft half a mile long --
text: with 500 tonnes of coral on top of
dialog: it? Someone went to a lot of
dialog: trouble. Try again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But it's impossible.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is it?
text: Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why would this ship carry
dialog: instructions in English?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Think about it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Unless, this alien spacecraft was --
dialog: you know -- somehow presenting
dialog: itself to Americans in a way that
dialog: would make us feel comfortable.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: 400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher
dialog: Columbus would've loved these
dialog: accomodations.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Good theory, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, what's your theory?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I
dialog: only deal with facts.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All the facts you need are right in
dialog: front of you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Gimme a minute here... I think I've
dialog: got it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If it is an alien spacecraft --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Save your breath. It's not an alien
dialog: spacecraft.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Then what is it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's an American spacecraft.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: An American spacecraft? Half a mile
dialog: long? And buried 400 years? Yeah,
dialog: good theory, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's been obvious from the start,
dialog: hasn't it, Captain? That's why all
dialog: the secrecy, why no one was told
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We had considered it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Considered what? That it's American?
dialog: How would you think it's American?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: The chip in the door.
text: ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We take a weeny little wedge, bang
dialog: on it a couple of times, and bust
text: off a chunk of the metal. Yet any
dialog: spacecraft -- even at a low
dialog: velocity, say 200 miles an hour --
dialog: crashes into the water -- it's gonna
dialog: be like hitting concrete, it would
text: crumple like paper. But there isn't
text: a dent to be seen anywhere. Not even
text: a scratch.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Meaning it didn't land in the water.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Please. It must have flown here --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It didn't fly here. It arrived here.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Arrived? From where?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not where. When. 400 years ago. From
dialog: our future.
text: A quiet moment as they take this in.
scene_heading: INT. SPACECRAFT -- DEEPER INSIDE
text: Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth
text: flashlights.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Time travel. I always thought it was
dialog: one of those myths... like Santa's
dialog: reindeer.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What would we be working on in the
dialog: future that would make us want to
dialog: come back?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Maybe we didn't want to come back.
scene_heading: BACK IN -- THE ROOM
text: Norman, Harry, and Beth...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: A light switch. A button opened that
text: door -- the craft runs on some sort
dialog: of power.
text: ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's that noise?
text: They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Sounds a little like water --
text: SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him
text: inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him
dialog: -- sucking him inside...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Get this thing off me.
text: Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I think the chair thinks you want to
dialog: fly this thing.
text: ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE --
text: reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering
dialog: across...
scene_heading: "RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... "
text: Her EYES look up slowly... as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow
dialog: lettering:
scene_heading: "RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER"
text: "ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in
dialog: count...
text: And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nice work, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Whatever I can do to help.
text: ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns:
speaker_heading: SHIP SYSTEMS
speaker_heading: DATA SYSTEMS
speaker_heading: QUARTER MASTER
speaker_heading: FLIGHT RECORDS
text: Harry punches some keys on the control panel.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A flight recorder. Our future is
dialog: about to be seen in our present.
text: ON THE SCREEN as it changes:
scene_heading: FLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES
scene_heading: FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49
scene_heading: FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52
scene_heading: FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55
scene_heading: FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56
scene_heading: FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56
scene_heading: FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: 01-01-47. Two thousand-forty seven.
dialog: 50 years in our future.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Unknown Entry Event.
text: Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys...
text: ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving...
text: WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the
text: room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the
dialog: illusion of depth.
text: The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like
dialog: we're flying through it.
text: The stars and other space matter streaking by.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's that cluster of stars there?
dialog: In the center?
text: Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Our answer.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: To what?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Time travel. A black hole.
text: The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer
text: and closer, brightening.
text: The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as
text: WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole.
text: ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Ted? Captain?
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: We know how this craft got here.
dialog: Where it's been.
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: So do we. And it seems to have
dialog: picked up something on it's travels.
text: STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Picked up something? What is it?
speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know. But it's something
dialog: alien.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY
text: ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance. AS WE PAN UP
text: and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly
text: swirling green and blue fluids. Like mercury. Mesmerizlng.
text: AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in
text: dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top.
text: They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This answers one of our questions.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Which one? Let me get the list out.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This spacecraft was designed to pick
dialog: things up. They see things they want
dialog: -- these claws go out and bring it
dialog: in. They come across this. This...
dialog: sphere. Find it interesting,
text: curious. They draw it inside to take
dialog: back home.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: But on the way home, they miss their
dialog: turn, go too far, into the past.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Our present.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: But what does it do? This... sphere.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Maybe it's a message of some sort,
dialog: you know? See this red here.
text: ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Looks like a design, some writing,
dialog: maybe. Maybe it was sent to meet the
text: spacecraft with a message.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look closely. That isn't writing.
dialog: Those are grooves.
text: ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. They don't represent a message.
dialog: They aren't decorative at all. They
dialog: have another purpose entirely.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: To conceal a small break in the
text: surface of the sphere.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: A break for what?
scene_heading: INT. HABITAT -- HALLWAY
text: DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes, through a half-closed door,
text: pacing, talking on the phone...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: ... it's definitely something alien
dialog: ... another civilization, yes, sir...
dialog: Well, we don't know yet, but we
dialog: think we've found a door...
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members (minus Ted) look at the monitor.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: So how do we get it open?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Ted seems to have some ideas.
text: ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door. Banging into it with
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Maybe we shouldn't.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't
dialog: try to open it at all.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (nodding to Norman)
dialog: Man is man, all he knows is man, and
dialog: all he can think of is what he
text: knows. The anthropomorphic problem.
dialog: Good, Norman.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I mentioned it in my report. Didn't
dialog: you read the report?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Everything ever written about extra-
dialog: terrestial life imagines that life
dialog: is essentially human. If it doesn't
dialog: look human, it's a reptile or a big
dialog: insect or something, having human
dialog: values, human understanding.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: So? What's the problem?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's nonsense. There's enough
dialog: difference between our own species
dialog: to prove that.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Take politics, our views on
dialog: abortion, the death penalty...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Cannibalism, to be extreme. And now
dialog: we're talking about a new life form.
dialog: Their values and ethics may be
text: incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Like "Thou shall not kill"?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Or maybe, it can't be killed.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You mean, what's in that thing is
dialog: immortal?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't know. That's the point.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Everything can be killed.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Not everything. Even on earth. Take
dialog: ... yeasts.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yeasts? Thank you, Beth, but I don't
dialog: think we're gonna open it up and
text: find a loaf of bread.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And we're just talking about three-
dialog: dimensional creatures. What if it's
dialog: five or six or seven-dimensional? So
dialog: dimensional that we couldn't even
dialog: see it to kill it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Good point. I don't know what you're
dialog: talking about, but good point.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Or it could contain some great
dialog: benefit to us, some astonishing new
dialog: idea or technology to help mankind.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It could. But the odds of it being
dialog: any use to us are against it.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You don't know that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Let's say whoever made this thing is
dialog: a thousand years ahead of us, just
dialog: like we are to, say, medieval
dialog: Europe. Suppose you went back to
text: medieval Europe with a TV set. There
dialog: wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Just tell me worst case. Worst case
dialog: of what we might find?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It could breathe in air and exhale
dialog: cyanide gas.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Disrupt our brain waves, interfere
dialog: with our ability to think.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Produce radioactive waste and
dialog: disintegrate us into nothing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "Surface winds at 25 knots -- Estimated Time
dialog: of Departure -- 01:45 hrs"
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DH-8 HALLWAY
text: Empty, sterile. WE HEAR the repeating sound: THWAP. Almost like a
text: dripping faucet. THWAP... THWAP...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS
text: Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at
text: his cheek: THWAP... THWAP.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You realize, Norman, that we are all
dialog: going to die.
text: Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm completely serious. There is
dialog: something very important missing
dialog: from that spacecraft. You know what
dialog: that is?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Not a clue.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A sign that the builders knew time
dialog: travel through a black hole was
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't follow you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: On that flight recorder, they called
dialog: the black hole an "Unknown Entry
dialog: Event." They didn't know what a
dialog: black hole was. Fifty years from
dialog: now, men are going to build that
dialog: ship in a very tentative,
dialog: experimental way, with no knowledge
dialog: that time travel through a black
dialog: hole is possible.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: So what?
text: Harry leans his head over his bunk.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So, we know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We know it went through a black
dialog: hole. We saw it. Norman -- when we'd
dialog: get to the surface, we'd tell
dialog: someone about the black hole,
dialog: wouldn't we? It'd go in some report
dialog: like some big discovery. So in fifty
dialog: years when they build that ship,
dialog: they'd make precautions for a black
dialog: hole.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But they didn't. The called it an
dialog: Unknown Entry Event.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Meaning we're never gonna get the
dialog: chance to tell anyone.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Meaning we're never gonna get to the
dialog: surface alive... to tell anyone.
text: Norman gets out of his bed.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I can't believe that, Harry.

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No. I didn't say that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Then what, Norman?
text: Norman stops pacing, a beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's what's in that sphere, isn't
dialog: it, Harry? Whatever you think is in
dialog: that thing -- you think it's going

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Curious, isn't it? What's inside?

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: Seconds ago. Here!

speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That far in what, Harry?

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (a beat)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: No idea. We have no surface support.

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

dialog: about how we were all going to die.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You don't remember that?
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What do you mean -- not normal?
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NORMAN

dialog: hurriedly...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't
dialog: mean...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth.
text: She's crying, glass in her hands. She looks up at Norman, frightened,
dialog: nervous...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You wouldn't go and tell the others,
dialog: would you?
text: Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I hate this place, Norman. I want
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HABITAT -- HALLWAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Barnes sits, Norman in front of him, worked up...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She
dialog: can be drastic.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: How drastic?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You don't want to know.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I think I do.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: A while back, Beth and I -- we
dialog: worked at the same university. She
dialog: was assisting a chemist there -- I
dialog: forget his name -- doing research,
dialog: experiments. She was also living
dialog: with him.
dialog: (off Barnes' look)
dialog: Yeah, I know. And when she finished
dialog: her work, he kicked her out, broke
dialog: off the relationship, and published
dialog: five papers -- all her work --
dialog: without any thank you or
dialog: acknowledgement.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: She should've known better.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: She put a razor to her wrists a day
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: '81, I think. She tried again five
dialog: years ago.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I thought you should know.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: So you knew this when you wrote your
dialog: report?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: At the time, I don't know, I thought
dialog: putting her on the list -- it might
dialog: help her career -- catch her a
dialog: break.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You knowingly recommended a woman
dialog: with suicidal tendencies for a
dialog: government operation --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wait a second --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: -- and then brought her down here --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: -- I didn't know it would come to
dialog: this --
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: -- without a cautionary word to
dialog: anyone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, Ted said something to me
dialog: earlier. I think he's right. He
dialog: said, "When you got a guy who -- if
dialog: he wasn't here -- he'd be standing
dialog: in the unemployment line, you gotta

text: Harry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a
text: PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: It's a single sequence repeated over
dialog: and over.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We're all very proud of you, Harry,
dialog: but what the hell is it?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Maybe it's a message?
speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: From what?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The sphere. Maybe the sphere --
speaker_heading: EDMUNDS
dialog: We're not hooked up to the sphere.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, if it's a discharge --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's not a discharge. Right,
dialog: Edmunds? You said before, right? So
dialog: it's gotta be a message.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: From the sphere?
speaker_heading: TED
text: What's inside the sphere.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If it is a message, it's probably a
dialog: substitution code. I'll work on it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: (to Ted, flat)
dialog: You do that.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM/SHOWER AREA
text: Ted, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has
text: Norman's ear in front of the sink...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He's manic, Norman. You know that?
text: This reliance on Harry is misplaced.
dialog: You hear me? Totally misplaced. He's
dialog: overlooking things. Obvious things.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Like what?
text: Ted hands him a printout...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's not some fucking substitution
dialog: code, it's a direct visual
dialog: representation.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You mean a picture?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Take a look. I rearranged the
dialog: numbers. Put 'em up to the light.
dialog: (Norman does)
dialog: Go ahead. Squint at it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't see anything.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Squint harder.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Please, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (hands him another
dialog: printout)
dialog: Try this one.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: This is like nursery school.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don't you see it? It's a picture of
dialog: the creature.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The creature?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Inside the sphere. Look, that's the
dialog: vertical torso, three legs, two
dialog: arms. There's no head, so I'm
text: guessing the creature's head is
dialog: located within the torso itself, you
dialog: know?
text: ON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Well, how about we wait and see what
dialog: Harry comes up with?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sure, why not. Give him the trophy.
dialog: That pretentious son of a bitch. You
dialog: heard him, Norman. All that "someone
dialog: went to a lot of trouble, try again"
dialog: bullshit. And "impotent". Where does
dialog: he get off saying I'm impotent? He's
dialog: a fucking self-righteous, little
dialog: prick.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ... I asked myself, why would the
dialog: sphere be using a code? If you're
dialog: trying to communicate, why use a
dialog: code?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: See? No code. What'd I say?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Codes are for hiding information. So
dialog: it's making a mistake. It's making a
dialog: code without intending to. I figured
dialog: it's probably substituting numbers
dialog: for letters... Then I began to wonder
dialog: what an alien intelligence would
dialog: make of our keyboard. And since
dialog: we're getting spirals, I imagined
dialog: the keyboard as a spiral. So I
dialog: translated it...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That's brilliant.
text: Ted grimaces at Norman.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ... spiralling out of the center, you
dialog: see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is
dialog: three, and so on... when I got the
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What's the message?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I have to tell you. It's strange.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: How do you mean, strange?
text: Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads:
speaker_heading: HARRY

dialog: is your name? My name is Jerry."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Barnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: He translated it wrong. "My name is
dialog: Jerry"? It's like "See Spot run."
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: The message doesn't show a lack of
dialog: intelligence. It's smart. It's
text: approaching us in a simple way. Like
dialog: you would a dog. Holding out your
text: hand, letting it sniff, get used to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What am I -- a dog, now?
text: Barnes ducks his head into the Video Feed room...

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED

dialog: "I understand. Is there one control entity?"
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He's saying, "Take me to your

speaker_heading: BARNES

dialog: am Happy."
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Great, okay. Ask him about his
dialog: weapons.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That's smart. Let's talk about guns
dialog: and violence.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You don't think weapons are
dialog: important?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I think we should be careful.
dialog: Consider his emotional response.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You want to put him on your couch,
dialog: Norman. Grill him about his
dialog: childhood?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: When he uses a phrase like "I am
dialog: Happy", I think we should think
dialog: twice about what we ask him.
dialog: "Do Not Be Afraid"

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If the technology of that sphere is

dialog: magic.
scene_heading: ON TED AND NORMAN -
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don't gimme that psychology
dialog: bullshit, Norman. Psychology isn't a
dialog: science, it's superstition. It's a
dialog: bunch of soft, subjective theories
text: without any hard data to back it up.
dialog: With an intellect like this,
dialog: emotions don't mean shit.
scene_heading: ON HARRY AND BARNES -
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci

speaker_heading: BARNES

dialog: Edmunds?
scene_heading: ON TED AND NORMAN -
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don't make stuff up, these emotional
dialog: theories, just so you can feel
dialog: important here.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if

dialog: intellect.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Edmunds?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Because if Jerry is powerful and
dialog: also emotional...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Damn it, Edmunds?
speaker_heading: NORMAN

dialog: gets mad?

dialog: of the habitat.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER -- OUTSIDE THE HABITAT

text: habitat. Still HEARING the THUMPING. They pause, looking around.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Coast is clear.
text: They go to the south end of the habitat. The THUMPING louder.
text: Norman climbs up the grid-like STANCHION, the support beam holding up
text: the habitat. The BODY above him -- flapping in the current. THUMPING
text: against the wall.
text: He climbs, reaching the body. A BOOT swings, catches the LOOP in his

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman, your suit -- it's leaking.
text: The BOOT comes off in Norman's hand -- and the NAKED FOOT, gray flesh,
text: purple toenails, KICKS his faceplate. Startles him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman. Look at this.
text: ON EDMUNDS' SUIT -- a long TEAR in the fabric, revealing red, mangled
text: FLESH. Droplets of BLOOD float past Norman's faceplate.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Her flesh has been macerated.
dialog: Chewed. I've never seen a bite like
dialog: this before.
text: Norman pulls her body out.
text: Edmunds' FACEPLATE whips around -- and Norman SEES her staring eyes,
text: mouth open in horror.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: I can't feel her bones. She's like a
dialog: sponge.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: She was crushed. Feel her skin --
text: it's like sandpaper.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What could have done this?
scene_heading: WE HEAR A SENSOR: PONG. PONG. PONG.
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him.
scene_heading: PONG. PONG. PONG.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: The sensors are picking up something
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
text: Barnes flips a switch...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It won't register. It's too big to

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Too big?
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Eggs.

speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What was Edmunds doing outside?
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: Resetting the sub.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What sub?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: In the dome hanger. All our tapes

dialog: reset the "delay" button, the sub
text: ascends to the surface with the
dialog: tapes.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: If something should happen to us,

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: At least our obituaries will be

speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: BETH

scene_heading: INT. CLOSET AREA -- DARK

text: pressing on him...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: ... He lied to us. He left us down
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: C'mon, Beth. Don't make this
dialog: personal. He told me himself they
dialog: were taking us back.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, he told you. Think. What was
dialog: Barnes doing before they cut that
text: cable loose? He was on the phone.
dialog: Except that cable is a thousand feet
dialog: long, Norman. They would've broken
dialog: off communication with us four, five
text: minutes before they cleared out.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So who was Barnes talking to at the
dialog: last minute? Nobody.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You're jumping to conclusions, Beth.
dialog: Don't get worked up --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Fuck you, Norman! It's right here...

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't tell me to calm down!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's done, alright? It's over! And
dialog: there's not a damn thing we can do
dialog: about it now, okay?
text: He turns to leave...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You said something to him, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You told him about me?
text: ON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You did, didn't you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't do this.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You bastard.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth, I didn't. Hold it together.
dialog: Alright?
text: She looks at him, piercing into his eyes...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, I should stay calm. Like you

text: Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him...
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Fletcher and Edmunds are dead,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors. Barnes
dialog: addresses Norman...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I don't want you talking to Jerry.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: But sir, I think it's imperative. I
dialog: think the messages, the animals
dialog: we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the
dialog: reading you got earlier -- I think
dialog: they're all related.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said
dialog: earlier -- we were his friends --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Of course he did. He's been isloated
dialog: for 400 years. He wants someone to
dialog: talk to. Look, you put a human being
dialog: in isolation for four days, they can
dialog: become neurotic, sometimes
dialog: psychotic. We're talking about 400
text: years here. An alien that shows
dialog: emotional responses. I think we need
text: to address him, before he reacts
dialog: further.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You think he killed Edmunds?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I
dialog: think is his response to us refusing
dialog: to talk to him earlier.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Bullshit. What's out there isn't
dialog: alien. It's an animal.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Maybe so. But I think we need to ask
dialog: Jerry about it.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: No. I think we should shut down the
dialog: communication lines inside the
text: habitat. He might be listening now.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I think he already is.
text: They turn to the monitors:
text: ON THE MONITOR: "DO NOT IGNORE ME"
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Nice work, Captain sir.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Shut up, Beth. I don't want to hear

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: BETH

text: Barnes flips a switch...
speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: BARNES

scene_heading: PONG. PONG. PONG.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What if it attacks?
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: Fifty yards and closing.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What do we use for defense?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We're a habitat. Not a castle. The
dialog: only defense we have is High
dialog: Voltage.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: High Voltage?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It sends 200 volts throughout the

dialog: used it underwater before.
scene_heading: PONG. PONG. PONG.
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: Forty yards.
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: BARNES

scene_heading: PONG. PONG. PONG.
speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABRATORY

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
dialog: BANG!

scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't pull it, Norman. It'll start a

speaker_heading: BARNES (O.S.)
dialog: Do it, Norman, it's the only choice

speaker_heading: DIMMING.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Beth! Help, I can't -- !

speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Beth!

speaker_heading: BARNES

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It won't stop.
text: Norman falls to the floor, losing Ted.
text: TED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE.
text: BANG! The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall,

text: NORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when...
text: THE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame. Ted underneath it.
text: BETH -- her extinguisher out of foam.

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: DARKNESS

speaker_heading: BLACK
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Dr. Johnson? Dr. Johnson?
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM
text: WE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens. NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African-

speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN
dialog: Norman Johnson.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Does this mean what I think it
dialog: means?
speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The ships?
speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How are the others?
speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN
dialog: The others, sir?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth and Harry?
speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN
dialog: They're in the sub, sir. Waiting.
text: Norman sighs, smiling. The relief, the jubilation.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That whole time -- I couldn't stop
dialog: thinking of what Harry was saying
dialog: earlier...
speaker_heading: NAVY SEAMAN
dialog: What was that, sir?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: About the time paradox.
dialog: (the Seaman nodding)
dialog: How we were all going to die --
dialog: that there was no way we would make
dialog: it out of here alive --
text: As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins
text: to slowly DISAPPEAR. Disintigrating. VANISHING before his eyes.
text: Norman stops, looks around him. He's gone.
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall,
text: the Navy Seaman walking next to him.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: ... how we were all going to die --
dialog: that there was no way we would make
dialog: it out of here alive --
text: ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers.
text: Norman stops tape. Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE. It is
dialog: closed.
text: THE SCREEN goes BLACK. Flashes up: "Hello Norman"
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Jerry?
dialog: "Yes Norman"
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Jerry, did you create that man?
dialog: "The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation. Did you have a Happy
dialog: talk?"
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Jerry, are you manifesting what's
dialog: destroying our habitat?
dialog: "Did you have a Happy talk?"
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Jerry, answer me.
dialog: "No."
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Jerry?
text: A beat.
dialog: "Stop calling me Jerry"
text: The MONITOR shuts off.
text: Norman looks over at ANOTHER MONITOR labled "AIRLOCK FEED".
text: ON THE SCREEN -- Beth is putting on her jumpsuit.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK
text: REFLECTED IN THE POOL OF WATER -- WE SEE Beth, slipping on her boots.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Where are you going in such a hurry?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I have to reset the sub.
text: Norman stands in the doorway...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Forget the sub.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't bother me, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's not worth the risk.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's also our only way out of here!
text: It holds three people. And there's
dialog: only three of us left now.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You, me and Harry?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You, me and Harry. He's asleep.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wake him, then. Let's go. Get
dialog: outta --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We can't. The storm. The waves would
dialog: toss us around worse than we got
dialog: down here. And we have four days of
dialog: decompression when we get up top.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Four days?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Get the helium out of our
text: bloodstream. We go to the surface
dialog: now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
text: She begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Maybe you should go. To the sub.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Why should I go?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You should know how it works. Just
dialog: in case.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: In case you die, too?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I don't trust Harry to do it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I would. But my suit --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I fixed your suit.
text: She goes to it. Brings it to him.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (watching her closely)
dialog: You fixed my suit?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You don't trust me?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: But I don't know how --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You press a button, Norman. It's not
dialog: brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You
dialog: only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go
dialog: on, Norman...
text: She hands him a BRIEFCASE, the tapes inside.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: ... I'll watch the sensors for you.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER
text: Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE. Lands on the ground.
text: BREATHING. Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE. She must've fixed it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You're clear, Norman.
text: He walks along, out from under the habitat. Carefully, looking around.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
text: The sub's a 100 feet in front of
dialog: you. You see it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I can't see anything. How does it
dialog: look? Still clear?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
text: Still clear.
text: Norman, hesitantly, ventures out. The DARK WATER. Looking around.
text: Anything could be out here. Walking. WE HEAR him BREATHING. His
text: BREATHING gets shorter. He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You fixed this suit?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Beth?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, Norman. I did. You're just
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: My air isn't... I'm coming back.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes.
dialog: You don't have time.
text: His BREATHING is short, but managable. He continues on.
text: AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,
text: forty feet high.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Still clear?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
text: Still clear.
text: UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR. Looks
text: below him. Nothing around him. He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the
text: HATCH OPEN. Lifts himself up, awkwardly. Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS
text: himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.
text: THE SUB -- in front of him. He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside
dialog: the sub.
scene_heading: INT. SUB
text: Norman sits in the small seat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm in.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hello?
text: No answer. He bangs at his helmet...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth?
text: He searches the sub's CONTROL PANEL. Gadgets, switches, buttons. Up
text: top -- a flashing red-lit BUTTON: "TIMER HOLD". Punches it. It stops
text: flashing, and a small screen glows: "TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00".
text: It begins counting backwards.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? Hello?
text: No answer. He looks at the Control Panel:
text: A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE,
dialog: SHUTDOWN... "
speaker_heading: THUMP!
text: The sub slightly SWAYS.
text: Norman sits still, nervous.
dialog: THUMP! Harder this time.
text: Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD. Sweating. Can't see
dialog: anything in here.
text: BANG! It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth. He grips the seat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth! Beth! There's something -- !
text: THUMP! BANG! He's thrown around in the sub. He can't see anything,
text: tosses around. He reaches for the doorhandle.
text: BANG! He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air. The Sub almost turns
text: over on it's side.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth! Shit!
text: His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror. Water
text: SPLASHING up from below.
text: Then, EVERYTHING stops.
text: The sub SWAYS to a still. He sits quietly. Waiting. Listening.
text: Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.
text: Stands on top of the sub. Keeping balance. He looks around, finds a
text: DOOR inside the dome. Tries to open it. Locked.
text: Looks around. Nothing else. Looks down at the water. Can he risk it?
text: His BREATHING short.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? Can you hear me?
text: No reply. He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water. Grimacing.
text: Then, cautiously slips down into the water...
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER
text: CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified. Looking everywhere. Searching. Doesn't
text: see anything. Lands on the bottom.
text: His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping. Shortness of BREATH.
text: He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger. The DARK
text: WATER. Can't see anything. Scared to death.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? Beth? Shit.
text: THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.
text: Norman goes to a STANCHION. Grips onto it. Twists around. Looking.
text: Searching. Doesn't see anything. LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.
text: Barely BREATHING.
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: ... you there? Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Norman, where are you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I can't breathe... Am I... clear?
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: You're clear. You see the airlock?
text: Norman, twists around, and as he does...
speaker_heading: A SEA SNAKE
text: HISSES at his faceplate. Norman SCREAMS.
text: ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Norman!
text: Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,
text: slithering between the grid-like posts.
text: THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
text: Backpeddaling on his arms and feet. THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.
text: It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate. Norman
text: backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman
text: falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when...
text: NORMAN is whisked up.
text: HARRY has him by the collar of his suit. Taking him up.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK
text: They burst out of the water. Harry throws Norman onto the floor.
text: Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Norman, panting, walks with Harry...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Thank you. My suit -- Beth said she

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What do you mean? She's not here?
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Getting food. We were out of food.
dialog: what's wrong? You sound mad.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm

speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)

speaker_heading: NORMAN

text: Harry shakes his head: "no way".
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: When he woke up, he said we were out
dialog: of food. He told me to get some from
dialog: the ship.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I never said that.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't
dialog: leave you out there. You know that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We never even had a conversation,
dialog: Norman.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Harry? That's bullshit. We stood
dialog: right there --
text: Harry covers the mic...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She's cracking, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You didn't say that about the food?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I was just in the cafeteria, there's
dialog: plenty of food in there. Take a look
dialog: for yourself.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: But why would she -- ?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She's lying, Norman. Just like she
dialog: lied about fixing your suit.
text: Harry uncovers the mic...
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: You get it straightened out?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I think so, Beth. Yes.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken.
text: A salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table.
text: Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's Harry doing with your suit in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Fixing it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Fixing it? But I fixed --
dialog: (notices the food)
dialog: Where'd you get all that?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The refridgerator.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: The refridgerator.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's a pretty common place to look
dialog: for food when you don't think you
dialog: have any.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: That wasn't in there before.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We must've had it delivered then.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Wait a second --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: 1-800-Deepsea delivery. I hear
dialog: they're good.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: None of this was here before.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Did you look? It was on the top
dialog: shelf.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, it wasn't. I swear none of this
dialog: was here. None of it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You think he hid it? Earlier. He
dialog: must've hid it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You don't believe me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: All I know is I opened that
dialog: refridgerator --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Damn it, Norman. I swear. I had a
dialog: whole conversation with the man when
dialog: he woke up.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: This being after you so carefully
dialog: fixed my suit.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You think it's me? You think I'm
dialog: saying there was a conversation when
dialog: there wasn't?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Damn it, Norman! He's lying. Don't
dialog: you get it? There is something
dialog: seriously fucked up going on here --
dialog: and he's causing it. Why can't you
dialog: believe me?
text: TO HER LEFT -- she looks -- HARRY is standing in a doorway, cold,
text: holding Norman's jumpsuit. He turns away.
text: ON BETH -- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK
text: Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: "JOHNSON".
text: Smoothens it out for him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: ON BETH -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands.
text: ON NORMAN -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers. Wraps
text: cellophane over the chicken. Walks with it over to the refridgerator.
text: Opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE REFRIDGERATOR
text: are BOOKS -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves.
text: NORMAN -- backs away. What the hell?
text: Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS. Goes to them.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CUPBOARD
text: Books, neatly stacked.
text: Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with
speaker_heading: BOOKS.
text: All of the books are the same. Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea
dialog: by Jules Verne."
text: Norman looks over at Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What is it, Norman? Norman?
text: She comes to him. He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman?
text: Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,
text: trying to think. Stops. Turns to Beth.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Page 87.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Page 87. "I could never read that
dialog: far."
text: Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page
dialog: 87. Reads...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: "Our fisherman frequently see some
text: that are more than four feet long.
text: Some skeletons of squids...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Squids?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: "... according to calculations of
dialog: some naturalists, one of these
dialog: animals, only six feet long, would
dialog: have tentacles 27 feet long. That
dialog: would make a formidable monster."
text: He looks up from the book, realizing something...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman?
dialog: SNAPS the book closed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS
text: CLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks. Turning
dialog: pages.
text: TEARS off the first Jerry transmission.
text: Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman, what is it?
text: Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor.
text: Norman ushers her into the Control Room. Looks around. SHUTS the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM
text: Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of
dialog: paper...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: After the attack, a Navy guy woke me
dialog: up -- I don't know -- I thought he
dialog: was an illusion. But I checked the
dialog: tape, and Jerry said he manifested
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Manifested?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Created. Brought to life. I don't
dialog: know. But at the end, Jerry said,
dialog: "Stop calling me Jerry". And --
text: Norman stops, staring at the pad.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He translated it wrong.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?
text: Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hello. How are you? I am fine. What
dialog: is your name?... My name is Harry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters...
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Remember when we first spoke to
dialog: Jerry, Barnes kept asking for
dialog: Jerry's real name? But Harry never
dialog: would? He didn't because he was
dialog: afraid the screen would say "Harry",
text: instead of Jerry. We weren't talking
dialog: to an alien intelligence when we
dialog: talked to Jerry, we were talking to
dialog: Harry... or a part of Harry.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: What do you mean, a part of Harry?
scene_heading: BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: When did the messages start? The
dialog: animals outside start showing up?
text: After Harry came out of the sphere.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You think, in the sphere --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He acquired some sort of power. A
dialog: power to manifest things.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But how?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How can the sphere do that?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't know, Beth. I'm not the
dialog: fucking alien that built the thing.
dialog: But it can. When Harry came out of
text: the sphere, he mumbled something
dialog: about page 87. How he would never
dialog: read that far -- he was too scared
dialog: to. Then you found the book,
dialog: remember in your lab. Then in the
dialog: cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about
text: a giant squid...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Which I told Barnes was attacking --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: It's his fear. The squid. He's
text: manifesting his fears. Making them
dialog: real.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But why is he doing it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: He must not realize he is. Like the
dialog: Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping
dialog: then. He must've manifested his
dialog: dream.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: His dream? You can't control your
dialog: dreams. And you can't control your
dialog: fears, can you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: No. I mean, we've always believed we
dialog: can think anything we want without
dialog: consequences. You ever read the
dialog: Bible?
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: It talks about our sinful nature,
dialog: you know? I mean, we can think, and
dialog: believe, and desire whatever we
dialog: want, but there's a part of us -- a
dialog: shadow side, as Jung called it --
dialog: that can't be controlled. It's evil.
dialog: It's inside us. It's what we are.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS
text: It's dark. Harry lies on his bunk, asleep.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: And that's the part of Harry that's
dialog: being manifested.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Must be. And if it is -- it's a part
text: of him not even he can control.
text: Harry opens his eyes, stares at us.
text: WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING...
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across...
scene_heading: "CQX VDX MOP LKI... "
text: Beth and Norman watch...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: Looks like some sort of code.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Why would Harry go back to using a
dialog: code?
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: You mean Jerry, don't you?
text: Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Jerry. Right. I said Jerry, didn't
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's a hell of a mistake to make,
dialog: Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, I don't know how you could
dialog: make that confusion.
dialog: Norman watching them...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wisconsin's your answer.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wisconsin?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (off screen)
dialog: Navy transmission. They're sent from
dialog: Wisconsin.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How do we decode it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it
dialog: for you.
text: THE SCREEN -- jumbling it's letters until finally...
scene_heading: "SURFACE SUPPORT VESSELS TO YOUR LOCATION ETA: 1600 HOURS. END."
text: Norman and Beth smile...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: The cavalry is on it's way.
text: THE SCREEN -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Just in time, too.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: In time for what?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just in time for what?
text: Beth, nervous, tries to cover...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Our habitat, I mean. This place
dialog: can't handle another attack.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Another attack?
text: A long beat, as Beth stares at Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why are you looking at me like that?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Like what? I'm not --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're staring at me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No I'm not. I'm not star--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes you are...
text: Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Did I miss something? You two seemed
dialog: to patch things up awfully fast.
text: A tense beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We just figured, you know, the three
dialog: of us -- we need to... work together
dialog: through this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: The three of us.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is that why the two of you went
dialog: through my dufflebag?
text: Norman glances at THE SCREEN behind Harry: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL."
scene_heading: INT. LABRATORY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE MEDICAL CABINET -- WHIPPING open.
text: Norman quickly digs through the medicines...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Diphenyl parlene.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Something for burns.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Ephedrine hydrochloride.
text: Beth at the computer, looking up the names...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's for motion sickness.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Valdomet.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Ulcers.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Sintag.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: A synthetic opium analogue.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Does it cause drowsiness? That's all
dialog: we need. To get him unconscious --
dialog: put him under.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Nothing about drowsiness.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Tarazine?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Bingo.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: "... and may also cause bizarre
dialog: halucinations".
text: Norman throws it on the floor. Picks another...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Riordan?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Antihistamine. For bites.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Antibiotic.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Parasolutrine?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How do you spell it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: P-a-r-a-s-o...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's a soporific.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Causes sleep.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's like a sleeping pill?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: "... used as an anesthetic if given
dialog: in combination with paracin
dialog: trichloride... "
text: Norman digs, finds paracin trichloride...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: BETH -- mixing the medicines...
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (reading from the
dialog: computer)
dialog: "20 cc's of parasolutrine in
dialog: combination with 6 cc's of paracin
dialog: given IV produces deep sleep
dialog: suitable for emergency surgical
dialog: procedures... no cardiac side effects
dialog: ... REM activity is surpressed... "
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How long does it last?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Three to six hours.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'll just boost the doses.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What? Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How fast does it take effect?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Doesn't say.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman?
dialog: What if it takes an hour? And he can
dialog: fight it off? We can't afford that.
text: Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine. Norman comes over as
dialog: she adds it to the mix...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What is that? What are you doing?
dialog: What do you want to do -- kill him?
dialog: A beat...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's an idea.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: To be on the safe side. I mean --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You want to kill him?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Look, it's either him or us, Norman.
dialog: Another attack, and we go down with
dialog: this place.
text: She fills the LARGE SYRINGE with the clear liquid mix.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You ever given an injection before.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Thirty years ago. In residency. I
dialog: passed out. You?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Only lab rats. Here.
text: She hands him the syringe...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Give him the whole thing. Hurry,
text: before he wakes up.
text: Norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Where do I stick it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS
text: Harry sleeps on his bunk. The door to the room is closed.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: Norman spirals down the stairway from the lab. Hurrying through the
text: dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side.
text: INTO THE HALLWAY
text: shuffling down the corridor, nervously. Glancing at the syringe.
speaker_heading: ROUNDS A CORNER
text: and SEES in front of the Living Quarters...
scene_heading: TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN NAVY CREWMEN -- standing guard of the door.
text: Norman stops, hides behind the wall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABRATORY
text: Norman comes in...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He's got Farrakahn's army standing
dialog: guard. What's plan B?
text: Suddenly, BANG! The room shakes. Shelves fall. Cabinet doors swing
text: open. Norman falls to the floor.
text: THE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face. It reads: "I
dialog: WILL KILL YOU ALL"
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Norman and Beth running...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Harry!
text: BANG! Water shoots through the wall. Gushing out onto the floor. The

text: ON HARRY -- running out of his room...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know what it is, Harry.
text: BANG! They lose their balance, still running...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's the squid! Stop it!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stop what? What are you -- ?
text: BANG! Another CRACK -- water gushing inside.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know damn well what. You're
dialog: doing it!
text: Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Doing what? I'm not doing
dialog: anything -- !
text: Beth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER.
text: HE SCREAMS IN HORRIFYING PAIN, FADING OVER INTO...
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR
dialog: Quiet now.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: Norman and Beth sit at a table, sipping coffee.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Not believing you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You're not sorry. You're scared.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're a psychologist, Norman. You
dialog: pride yourself on knowing when
dialog: someone's lying to you, not telling
dialog: you the truth. And now you're scared
dialog: ... because you're not sure you can
dialog: tell anymore.
text: ON NORMAN -- watching her, sizing her up.
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM -- LATER
text: ON HARRY -- lying on a STRETCHER in the corner, propped up with pillows
text: and a blanket. An IV in his arm.
text: NORMAN -- at the console, stares at the MONITOR of the SPHERE. A long
text: beat. His reflection staring back at him. He slips on the headset...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS
text: The room is empty.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Beth?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR

speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: What is it, Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
text: In the sub. Resetting the timer.
dialog: Why?
text: ON THE MONITOR -- Beth sitting in the sub.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: The sphere looks different.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: What do you mean, different?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: The grooves around the door --
dialog: they've shifted. And the pattern --
text: the fluids -- they look darker now.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How's Harry?
text: ON HARRY -- the IV in his arm.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: Harry lying on the stretcher, still.
text: Norman watching him from above, sipping his coffee.
scene_heading: HEARS A SOFT BEEPING
text: Norman goes to the console, sits. Checks the monitors. Looks around
text: the console, not knowing what it is.
text: A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board. Norman still doesn't know what
dialog: it means.
text: THE MONITORS go blank.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
text: The MONITORS flash up: "I AM COMING."
text: Norman spins around, goes to HARRY -- lying still. Norman grabs
text: Harry's wrist. Checking pulse.
text: Norman returns to the console, slips on the headset...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? Beth? Can you hear me? Get the
dialog: hell out of there.
text: THE MONITORS boot up again. Norman looks at the SUB VIDEO MONITOR --
text: the sub is gone from under the dome.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Beth? Shit.
text: No reply. MORE BEEPING. Panicking. Bangs on the headset.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? I'm getting some sort of
dialog: reading. There's something --
text: He scans the MONITORS, looking for movement. Anything. They are all
dialog: still.
text: Norman turns to looks at Harry...
text: CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE -- still.
text: BACK ON -- NORMAN, sweating...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: And whatever it is, it's not coming
dialog: from Harry.
text: Norman looks at the monitors:
text: ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN. It's
text: Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.
text: The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES. The lettering on the boxes
text: isn't in focus.
text: Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? What is that? What are you
dialog: doing?
text: The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the
text: muddy floor.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Can you hear me? Beth? Can you copy?
dialog: Get inside, there's something out
dialog: there.
text: ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward. Churning up the sediment.
text: It stops again, and releases another box.
text: Norman BANGS on the headset.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me.
text: THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING FOR YOU"
text: ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What the hell?
text: ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view. It releases it's
text: last box. Norman can read the lettering now: "CAUTION: TEVAC
speaker_heading: EXPLOSIVES"
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth? C'mon. What are you -- ?
text: THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.
text: Searching for tapes. Another cabinet. Then another.
text: A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's her.
text: THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"
text: ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console. WE HEAR faintly...
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Norman? Norman?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Norman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor. Hurrying. An inch or
text: two of water on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS
text: CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: "Captain Harold Barnes."
text: Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK. BANGING.
text: BANGING. Breaks the lock. Digs inside the case.
text: Pulls out a GUN.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR
text: Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand. Wheels him into...
scene_heading: BATHROOM/SINK AREA
text: Norman stops. Turns off the main lights. The room goes dark. The
text: florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.
text: Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall. Checks the IV.
text: Norman goes to a STALL. Steps inside. Keeps the stall door open. Can
text: still see Harry about 10 feet away.
text: Norman looks at the GUN. COCKS it. Pinches his finger.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Ouch.
text: He waits. Listening.
scene_heading: A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND
text: Norman looks over at the sinks.
text: A FAUCET is on. Water HISSING faintly from it.
text: Norman ignores it. Waiting in the dark. Listening.
text: ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.
text: ON NORMAN -- looking at it. Can't ignore it. Tries. But can't.
text: Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.
text: OVER TO THE SINKS
text: The light above them on. Norman turns the faucet off. The water stops.
text: But the HISSING SOUND remains.
text: Norman looks at the faucet, queerly. Turns it back on. Then off.
text: The HISSING SOUND still there. It isn't the water.
text: Norman looks down at his feet...
text: THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving. Something swimming in the water.
text: CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up
text: inside his pantleg, HISSING. His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly
text: slides up past his knee.
speaker_heading: HISSING LOUDER
text: As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.
text: NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE
text: slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.
text: Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,
text: sliding up around his neck.
text: WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL
text: NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,
text: slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,
text: over his face. Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.

dialog: What time is it, Norman?
text: NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her
dialog: jumpsuit.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Do you know the time?
text: Norman GLARES at her in the mirror. His body STIFF.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I have to know the time of day,
dialog: Norman. Do you know?
text: SNAKES covering his eyes, SLITHERING across his mouth.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (through his teeth)
dialog: Your watch.
text: A SNAKE flicking it's tongue at Norman's lips. Trying to get inside
text: his mouth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What was that? I couldn't hear you.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Your watch.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh yes, my watch. I almost forgot.
text: She looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Splendid.
text: She begins grabbing the SNAKES off of him, carefully dropping them to
text: the ground. SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.
text: Shakes them off. Some drop in the sink. She bends out of view -- and
text: the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.
text: Past his stomach, his groin.
text: Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: CLOSE ON A POT -- pouring a white, milkish DRINK into a cup.
text: Beth walks it over to Norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Isotonic glucose supplement.
text: Norman looks at the cup.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Go ahead, drink it.
text: Norman places the cup down.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's wrong, Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm feeling better.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Are you?
text: Beth takes a seat. Stares at him. A long beat.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: It's getting cold.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You think I'd really drink that?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You don't think I put something in
dialog: it, do you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You put explosives around the
dialog: habitat, I can't imagine what you'd
text: put in a drink.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I did do that, didn't I?
text: A beat. She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it. Norman watches
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How do you feel about snakes?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Am I afraid of them? Not during the
dialog: day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When
text: the sun's out, they don't bite.
dialog: Fortunately for you, I had on my
dialog: watch.
dialog: (off cup)
dialog: This is quite good.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What are they doing down here? In
text: the bathroom? Suddenly appearing.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Do you fear them?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Are you manifesting them?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: If I was, then I would've had to
dialog: have gone in the sphere, wouldn't
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What's the phrase -- "keeping up
dialog: with the Joneses"?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Same reason I put explosives around
dialog: the habitat. For defense. For the
dialog: power. To protect myself.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: Against what? Harry's unconscious.
dialog: He's not a threat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, he isn't.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He can't manifest.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, he can't.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put
dialog: out explosives? Why manifest the
dialog: snakes?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You think I manifested the snakes?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Someone did.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yes, someone did. But it wasn't me,
dialog: Norman.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was you. You manifested the
dialog: snakes.
text: A long beat between them.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth you're losing it. C'mon.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: C'mon -- what?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You're lying --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Am I lying? Are you sure? Are you
dialog: absolutely sure I'm lying?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Then explain to me about the
dialog: jellyfish. Earlier. Why did we see
dialog: jellyfish? Harry doesn't fear
dialog: jellyfish. You do. They're your
dialog: fear, aren't they?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And the snakes? You want to know
dialog: about the snakes? You saw one
dialog: outside earlier, didn't you? When
dialog: you thought I had deserted you --
dialog: you were terrified.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: That's when you went in the sphere.
speaker_heading: BETH
text: One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You manifested that, Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Did I? Or was that you?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When you were hiding in the bathroom
dialog: -- all conspiratorially like you were
dialog: -- you became frightened, didn't
dialog: you? Terrified. Like you were with
text: the snake earlier -- and suddenly
dialog: you have snakes slithering all over
dialog: the floor. You did that, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You're insane.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Am I? Or am I making so much sense
dialog: that you're going insane?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I never went in that sphere.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You don't remember you did. But I'm
dialog: sure you remember running like some
dialog: fucking hero to get Harry, don't
dialog: you? You remember that.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You remember before you picked him
dialog: up -- when you looked up at the
dialog: sphere, you remember that -- when
dialog: the sphere opened?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: That's right. But you can't remember
dialog: going inside, can you? No, of course
dialog: not. Harry couldn't either, could
dialog: he? "Like everything's on the tip of
dialog: my tongue", he said.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That's bullshit.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth, the message said Harry. "My
dialog: name is Harry". My name isn't Harry.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, it isn't. Your name is Norman.
dialog: But your younger brother -- what was
dialog: his name? The one who was stung when
dialog: you were younger. The one that died.
dialog: The one you couldn't save. What was
dialog: his name?
dialog: (imitating)
dialog: "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean
dialog: -- to go swimming." "But I don't
dialog: want to go swimming, Norman. I'm
dialog: scared." "C'mon, Harry, it'll be
dialog: fine, it'll be fun."
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: You heartless fuck. That's why
dialog: you're so scared of the water, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shut up, Beth --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: When you were in that sub -- and
dialog: that squid was attacking you -- are
dialog: you sure it was the squid that was
dialog: attacking? Do you know? "I can't get
dialog: Beth on the radio. I'm in this tiny
text: sub on the bottom of the fucking
text: ocean. All alone. Surrounded by all
dialog: this water." Was it really the squid
dialog: that was attacking you, Norman -- or
dialog: was it something else -- one of your
dialog: fears? You never really saw what it
dialog: was, did you?
text: Norman stares up at her, frightened. Is she right?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I
dialog: hope I'm not frightening you. The
dialog: last thing I want to do is frighten
dialog: you. You feel okay, don't you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: "It's not me, Beth. It's not me. It
dialog: can't be. I'm not doing anything."
dialog: Just like Harry said before I
text: stabbed him with the needle.
text: Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand. Norman backs
text: up, away.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't, Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But I have to, Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I promise --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You think I'd belive you? Believe
dialog: anything you might say now? After
dialog: you lied to me about telling Barnes
dialog: about my past. About my problems. My
dialog: problems. Not yours. Not his. Mine.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't, Beth. Please.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's either this... or I kill you.
text: The GUN in her other hand.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
text: She comes at him, needle in hand...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's your choice. Because it's not
dialog: safe for you to be awake. To be
dialog: walking around. To be thinking about
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's not safe for you to be either.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You think I care? You think I care
dialog: if I die?
dialog: (almost laughing)
dialog: Would I put explosives around the
dialog: habitat -- set on vibration sensors
dialog: -- that can trigger automatically,
dialog: if I cared about myself? Would I?
dialog: I've tried twice before, Norman, why
dialog: wouldn't I try a third time? I'm not
dialog: thinking about myself -- No, Norman,
dialog: I'm thinking about you. Your safety.
dialog: Protecting you from your own self.
text: She lunges at him with the needle, missing. He RUNS for the SPIRAL
text: STAIRCASE leading to the lab. Norman grabs the handrail, begins
text: climbing the stairs.
text: Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman! I'm doing this for you,
dialog: Norman.
text: He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman.
text: Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end.
text: He looks up:
text: THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in
text: number. He climbs, racing, PANTING. Beth, right behind him, laughing
dialog: almost.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Come here, Norman.
text: She GRABS his ANKLE. She raises the NEEDLE. Norman turns, KICKS her in
dialog: the FACE.
text: She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose.
text: Climbing, climbing. The STAIRS increasing above. He LUNGES for the top
text: step, GRABS it. Pulls himself up...
text: INTO THE LAB
text: Scrambling. He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Norman --
text: He SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down. He
text: holds the DOOR closed. Trying to regain his breath.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: This is what I'm talking about,
dialog: Norman. Don't you see? It's in you.
dialog: This vindictiveness. This rage.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Get away from the door, Beth.
text: He slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, Norman, I don't want to come
dialog: in...
text: The door's METAL PIVOT turns...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: ... I want to lock you in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABRATORY
text: Norman staring at the wheel. CLICK! It's locked from the outside.
text: Norman falls to his knees. PANTING.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABRATORY -- LATER
text: CLOSE ON A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAMERA -- in the upper corner of the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: You're a psychologist, Norman. You
dialog: of all people, don't want to admit
dialog: to your shadow side...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE Norman -- sitting in a corner of the lab,
text: staring up at US.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: ... You have a professional stake in
dialog: believing in your own mental health,
dialog: don't you? Don't you, Norman?...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABRATORY
text: Norman, huddled on the floor.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Of course you're going to deny it.
dialog: You want to blame someone else. You
dialog: want to blame Beth. Because you
dialog: hate Beth.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't fuck with me, Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: I'm not fucking with you, Norman.
dialog: You've fucked yourself.
text: Norman JUMPS up, looks at the ground -- WATER on the floor. Rising in
dialog: level.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Turn off the water, Beth.
text: The entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth!
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: You're frightened, aren't you,
dialog: Norman?
text: Norman, WADING through the water, searching...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Where is it coming from, Beth?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Don't you know?
dialog: Rising higher...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth, stop it!
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Stop what? Don't blame me. It's not
dialog: me.
text: Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Then where's it coming from?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: From you, Norman. From your mind.
dialog: You're doing it.
text: It's up to his waist. He climbs on top a lab bench. Puts his hands to
text: his temples, straining. WE HEAR Beth laughing.
text: A SPECIMEN BOTTLE -- EXPLODES right next to him.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
text: There's no ventalation in the room,
dialog: Norman. The pressure's going to kill
dialog: you.
text: Another BOTTLE SHATTERS, shooting fragments of glass across the room.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: It's you, Norman. Your fear of
dialog: drowning. You have to face it.
text: Microscope lenses CRACK. Bottles, Test Tubes, Dishes EXPOLDE.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: C'mon, Norman. Let me put you under.
dialog: Before you kill yourself!
dialog: SHATTER! CRACK!
text: Bottles floating in the water POP! The water too high -- Norman
text: swimming in it now, keeping afloat. His FACE strains from the
text: pressure. He looks at the CAMERA in the corner...
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: It's over, Norman.
text: Next to the CAMERA, he SEES the HATCH DOOR in the ceiling.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Don't even think it. You don't have
dialog: your suit, Norman. The water will
dialog: freeze you.
text: He reaches up at the door. Can't get it. The water rising. He DIVES
dialog: down in the water...
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: He swims to a cabinet near the floor, OPENS it, searches, THINGS
text: floating out -- AN OXYGEN CYLINDER and MASK -- he GRABS it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: NORMAN'S FACE -- bursts above water level, slips on the mask, BREATHES.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: It won't help, Norman. Your body is
dialog: boyant. You're gonna shoot right to
text: the surface and explode, Norman.
dialog: Don't you get it? It's over.
text: He BREATHES a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling HATCH DOOR, SPINS
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Norman, what are you doing! You're
dialog: insa--
text: The DOOR opens and WATER gushes inside. He grabs the frame of the
text: door, and his body shoots up through the hole...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN -- UNDERWATER
text: His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame. He grabs a PIPE
text: next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.
text: HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.
text: MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand. He loses grip. His body thrusts
dialog: upwards.
text: CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.
text: Barely gripping.
text: HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering. He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES
text: burst from his lips.
text: HIS BODY slightly descending.
text: HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe. He continues on.
text: HAND OVER HAND. Pulling himself...
scene_heading: UNDER THE HABITAT
text: He SEES the airlock in front of him.
text: He SCOOTS along, but slower, now. He stops. Can't continue. He clasps
text: his hand to his CHEST, it's burning. He SEES the airlock. His eyes
text: fluttering, he's losing consciousness. He can't do it. And he lets go
dialog: of the pipe.
text: FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?
text: HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor. His body flat underneath it.
text: Being sucked upwards against it.
text: He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands. He's
text: inches from the airlock.
text: Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward. His body
text: SUCKED UP and away...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK
text: ... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH. GASPING. He
text: flails his arms over to the ladder. Grips the ladder, but his hands
text: are like ice. Can't hold it. He slips.
text: Flailing in the water.
text: He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM. Twists his legs around, out of
text: the water, and flops his body onto the deck.
text: Shivering.
text: Tries to get up. Falls over. His body shaking. His lips purple. His
text: eyes barely open, looking at...
text: HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.
text: Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently. He reaches
text: out for his boots on the floor. Can't grip them. Inches his HEAD
text: toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: I know what you're doing, Norman.
dialog: But you can't save yourself.
text: He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up. He RIPS his suit off the
dialog: hanger.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
text: It's over, Norman. It's all over.
text: Slipping on his suit, he HEARS a MAN'S voice...
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Your attention, please. Your
dialog: attention, please. All construction
text: personnel clear the blast area now.
text: Tevac explosives are now activated.
dialog: Countdown beginning. Mark 15
dialog: minutes, and counting.
text: ON NORMAN -- as he slips on his helmet, his teeth -- chattering.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK HATCH DOOR -- Norman trying to open it.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: (through Norman's
dialog: helmet)
dialog: Locked. Don't try, Norman. You can't
dialog: get in. I won't let you in.
text: Norman turns, dives back in the water.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Norman swims out from under the habitat. Looks around at the
text: cylinders, the walls.
text: Goes to the outside of a WALL. Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.
text: TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.
text: Norman goes to him. SEES the CRACK.
text: Climbing inside. Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his
dialog: suit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Flooded to the top with water. Completely filled. Norman emerges
text: through the crack. MOVES down the hall.
text: A BOX OF CORN FLAKES
text: floats by his faceplate.
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Norman, where are you? I can't see
dialog: you, Norman. Tell me where you are.
text: Norman pulls at the cylinder's HATCH DOOR. He HEARS faintly through
dialog: his helmet...
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Twelve minutes, and counting.
text: He OPENS the door. Slips inside, the water going with him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
text: A SCREEN -- flashes: "D CYLINDER HATCH DOOR -- OPEN"
text: The CHAIR in front of the console -- spinning, empty. Beth just left.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Norman closes the door. Runs. Down the corridor...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM-SINK AREA
text: Norman ducks inside.
text: THE STRETCHER, the IV -- empty. Harry's not there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR

speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)

dialog: Please evacuate.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

dialog: Beth.
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO FEED ROOM
text: Norman runs inside...
text: The chair, stopping it's spin.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
text: THE MONITOR -- flashes: "B CYLINDER -- DOOR OPEN".
text: Norman's out the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Norman, running. SEES the B Cylinder door. Goes to it. Spins it,
speaker_heading: OPENS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. B CYLINDER
text: Norman climbs inside, takes off his helmet.
text: THE CYLINDER -- a maze of pipes and equipment. Heaters, controls, and
text: wires everywhere. Difficult to see.
speaker_heading: THROUGH PIPES
text: WE SEE NORMAN -- walking through the cylinder. Holding his helmet at
text: his hip.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth?
speaker_heading: BETH (O.S.)
dialog: Leave me alone, Norman.
text: He goes to her voice in the back. Past pipes, equipment.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I can't do that.
text: ON BETH -- huddled in the back corner, wedged among pipes. Her eyes
text: red. Holding the GUN in her hand. Pointing at Norman as he SEES her
text: through the pipes.
text: ABOVER HER HEAD -- a computer SCREEN, reading: "DETONATION SEQUENCE
text: 09:32"... descending in count.
text: Norman stares up at the SCREEN, concentrating.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You can't stop it, Norman. You can't
dialog: fight me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I know. You're too strong, Beth.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman.
dialog: Not now.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't tell me about me. I already
dialog: know too much.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth -- gimme the gun.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh, sure. Here. Anything else, Beth
dialog: can get you? Some more chicken,
text: perhaps. Let Beth check the fridge.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: C'mon --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Top shelf, is it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's
dialog: go home.
text: She sees HER REFLECTION on a PIECE of BROKEN GLASS on the floor. She
text: puts her fingers to her matted hair, tries to comb it.
text: Over the intercom...
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Nine minutes, and counting.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: C'mon, Beth.
text: ON THE GUN -- WE SEE Beth's wrists. The two scars.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It's over, Norman. Go on, get outta
dialog: here.
text: Norman walks toward her. Beth freaks...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What is that? What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You hear that?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hear what?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Get away from me!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Beth --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Get away --
text: BAM! From behind her -- Harry -- WHACKS Beth across the head with a
text: WRENCH, sending her to the ground.
text: Norman goes to her, checking her pulse.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Did I kill her?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I could hit her a little harder.
text: More toward the cranium.
text: Norman stares at the NUMBERS on the SCREEN above him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If she's still conscious, you can't
dialog: fight her. You can't stop the
dialog: numbers.
text: Over the intercom...
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Eight minutes and counting.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Killing her's the only way --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hey! Look! We didn't kill you,
dialog: alright? And believe me Harry, I
dialog: would've found great pleasure in
dialog: bashing your head in.
text: Norman RIPS off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around
text: her head.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Help me lift her.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Norman, carrying Beth in his arms, races awkwardly down the hall...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We're never gonna make it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shut up and open the door.
text: Harry does.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK
text: Harry, in his suit now, helps Norman slip on Beth's boots and
dialog: jumpsuit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How much time you figure to get to
dialog: the surface?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Two and a half minutes. Once we're
dialog: in the sub.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How far away's the sub?
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Six minutes and counting.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER
scene_heading: UNDERNEATH THE SUB'S DOME HANGER

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (picking her up)
dialog: Harry! I'm gonna have to lift her up
dialog: to you.
text: Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Alright. Hurry.

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Push her, c'mon.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm trying. Shit. Here -- catch her.

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Are you trying, damn it? Just --
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Four minutes and counting.
text: Norman loses grip, drops her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hold on.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I heard! I heard!
text: Picking her up...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Three fifty-six, three fifty-five,
dialog: three --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shut up and catch.
text: Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.

dialog: Alright, here, I'll... wait, you --
dialog: just give her to me.
text: Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub. The sub sways back
dialog: and forth.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Norman, what are you --
text: They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shit. Alright, Harry, get in there.

speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Three minutes and counting...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Take her, come on. Just --
text: Beth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet.
speaker_heading: HARRY

dialog: I'm trying to keep balance with --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Gimme a second --
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Just pull her -- down like inside --
dialog: Harry, work with me here!
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Her legs are in the way.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You got her?
text: Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps
text: push Beth's head inside.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Get her out of the seat, I need room

dialog: I'm trying. There.
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Two minutes-thirty and counting.
text: Norman drops inside.
scene_heading: INT. SUB

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know how to work this thing?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No idea.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, press something!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wait!
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
text: Two minutes and counting.
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shut up. Let me think.
text: Norman presses a button.

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER
text: The SUB comes out from under the dome. Rising above the habitat...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Less than a minute, we're never
dialog: gonna make it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's not fast enough, Norman.

dialog: down there.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER

scene_heading: INT. SUB
text: Harry looking down below him...
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)

dialog: Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Maybe. Brace yourself.
text: Harry just stares at Norman. Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (off Norman's suit)
dialog: How's that working out, by the way?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Good. Thank you. Now that I have it
dialog: on.
dialog: (Harry laughs)
dialog: Why are you laughing? You don't even
dialog: know what that means.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. I don't. But I always said to
dialog: myself, when I die, I want to die
text: laughing.
text: Harry laughs.
text: Ascending... waiting... and then...
text: A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION below them...
text: Rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the
dialog: surface.
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- RACING toward the surface, toward the
text: SUNLIGHT -- it's BLINDING -- and the screen GOES WHITE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DECOMPRESSION ROOM
text: A pale, white room.
text: ON NORMAN -- sleeping. His eyes begin to open. He awakes.
text: BETH -- is next to him, looking at him. There is a long beat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Thank you.
text: Norman looks up at her...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know, I think you really need to
dialog: see a psychologist.
text: She stares back at him, and smiles. Begins laughing with him.
scene_heading: EXT. DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER
text: TWO NAVY CREWMEN stand outside the door, looking in.
speaker_heading: CREWMAN #1

speaker_heading: CREWMAN #2
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: The Admiral's going over the tapes
dialog: they brought up now.
speaker_heading: CREWMAN #1
dialog: Does he know yet what really
dialog: happened down there?
text: Looking INSIDE -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table.
scene_heading: INT. DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER
text: At the table...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: They're going to want answers and
dialog: they're going to keep asking until
dialog: they get them.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We can refuse to talk.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Won't make any difference. The tapes
dialog: document everything.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: There is one possibility.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We all kill ourselves?
dialog: (laughing, then)
dialog: Bad joke. Sorry, Beth.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The power allows us to manifest our
dialog: fears, right? What if we feared the
dialog: power to go away?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You mean forget?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It would erase all our knowledge of
dialog: it. All of our power.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Would it work?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes. And I think we already know it
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Down below, Harry said we would all
dialog: have to die. Since there was no
dialog: evidence on that spacecraft that
dialog: anybody knew time travel through a
dialog: black hole was possible -- and we
dialog: all knew -- then we would all have
dialog: to die before we could tell anyone.
dialog: Death was the only logical
dialog: explanation. But sitting here, we
dialog: still know. So how is that possible?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Unless we make ourselves forget.

dialog: mentioned something about a squid.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL
text: A squid. However, there doesn't seem
dialog: to be any squid recorded on these
dialog: tapes.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: A squid? I don't remember anything

dialog: Did you say something about a squid,
