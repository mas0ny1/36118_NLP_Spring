scene_heading: 1	INT. OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS CHAMBER - KRYPTON NIGHT
text: All is still. A KRYPTONIAN GUARD stands at sentry beside massive crystalline portals.
text: Suddenly, silently, NON appears behind him and slips a massive arm across his throat. He
dialog: squeezes, cutting off the guard's breath: the guard crumples silently, and drops to the floor.
dialog: Now GENERAL ZOD and URSA step INTO FRAME. As ZOD nods his approval to Non,
dialog: Ursa holds the chamber door open for the General to enter.
dialog: 2	INT. COUNCIL OF ELDERS CHAMBER KRYPTON - NIGHT
dialog: ZOD leads the	way into the chamber. This imposing crystalline space, the parliament of
text: Krypton, is empty for the moment. But the signs of its members are ever-present: around the great floating slab that is their conference table each has his (or her) own console of crystals - a transparent container marked with the identifying insignia, c.f. the symbols on each of their robes in Part I.
text: As Non and Ursa follow two paces behind. Zod strides along the slab, ignoring console after 	console, stopping only when he reaches the one emblazoned with the S-like crest of Jor-El.
dialog: ANGLE DOWN ON IT as Zod lifts the lid of the console and removes, from among all
dialog: transparent crystals, the one red crystal.
dialog: PAN UP as he lifts it high. It glows even in the dim light of the empty chamber - until Zod,
text: with a satisfied and sinister smile, snaps it in half. He tosses it to the ground and looks with a
dialog: self-congratulatory air at Ursa and Non.
dialog: EFECTS: The luminous Spinning Rings (c.f. Part I) descend and encircle the villainous trio,
dialog: imprisoning them like a magical lasso in perpetual motion.
text: Zod and Ursa are instantly subdued, if sullen; Non stares out at his captors making subhuman 	noises of rags and frustrations - literally a caged beast.
dialog: 3	INT. KRYPTON TRIAL CHAMBER
dialog: A FULL C.U. OF ZOD FILLS THE SCREEN, as:
dialog: ELDER (V.O.)
dialog: General Zod. A warped, would-be
dialog: dictator. His only feeling is contempt.
dialog: His only desire is to command
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 3	CONTINUED
dialog: C.U. OF URSA FILLS THE SCREEN
dialog: ELDER (v.o.)
dialog: Ursa. Her only feeling is for the
dialog: vicious General. Her only desire --
dialog: to rule at his side.
dialog: C.U. OF NON FILLS THE SCREEN
dialog: ELDER (V.O.)
dialog: Non. He is without words and
dialog: without thought. He is a brute force.
dialog: The General need only command to 					inspire this monster to acts of
dialog: mindless destruction.
dialog: ON THE THREE - listening implacably.
dialog: ELDER (V.O.)
dialog: Together these three are responsible
dialog: for the darkest episode in Krypton's
dialog: history, the one attempt at insurrection
dialog: against our reasoned way of life.

text: CLARK KENT comes in, ready to begin a day's work, chipper and friendly. TRACKING WITH HIM as he passes various EMPLOYEES, all of whom seem to be bustling about with exceptional preoccupation. There is an air of tension, often found in newspaper offices when a big story is breaking. At first Clark doesn't realize anything unusual is up.

dialog: we refuse to negotiate.
dialog: SECOND REPORTER
dialog: (American accent)
dialog: And now they are willing to release the rest of the
dialog: hostages?
dialog: SPOKESMAN

dialog: LOIS
dialog: A hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?
dialog: SPOKESMAN
dialog: How can we be sure? Today, is possible for anyone
dialog: to make a bomb if he has the proper equipments, no?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: But . . ..that would mean all of Paris would be destroyed
dialog: SPOKESMAN
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Oui.

dialog: The hostages include a couple of NUNS, some CHINESE in buttoned-up gray jackets and a few obvious TOURISTS with cameras.
text: There are THREE TERORISTS in all, clad	in gray coveralls to look like workers. The	leader what will remain on the top level, is SERGE. The two who are taking the hostages to	the lower level are LUC and CLAUDE .

text: 47	Luc has entered the empty elevator. The oil drum stands in	it. Attached to it, wired to fuses on the top, is an activating device that functions like a grenade, i.e. once the pin is pulled, the gizmo is activated and the only thing	that keeps it from detonating is the human hand which holds the thing in the safe position. The minute the activator is released, there's only a matter of seconds till	the explosion.
dialog: SERGE

dialog: looking as harassed as any other rush hour rider. Suddenly he brightens.
text: PAN TO the sight that cheers him. It is Lois, of course, just stepping off a bus across the street on her way to the office.

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Lois! Hey, Lois --
dialog: She turns and gives him a friendly wave, but then our busy girl reporter keeps right on going toward the building.
text: ON CLARK -- Disappointed, our ever-eager swain hurries to catch up with her. FOLLOW HIM as he steps out into the street just as the light changes.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (not that she's listening)
dialog: Wait up a minute. . .
text: Suddenly, as he darts in and out of moving traffic, he is hit head-on by a speeding Checker taxi. As he disappears from view we hear a long squeal of brakes and an awful crunch.
text: 80	ON LOIS -- as she hears it too. She whirls around and hey eyes widen in horror.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (starting towards him)
dialog: CLARK!!
dialog: ON CLARK - picking himself up, dusting himself off, hurrying towards her again.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (calling to her, reassuringly)
dialog: I'm okay.
dialog: And he is indeed. The collision has left him unharmed and not even out of breath.
dialog: ON LOIS -- looking his way, very startled.
text: HER POV: The taxi is not okay. Clark's impression is cut deeply, perfectly and unaccountably into the hood, through the engine block to the windshield.
text: ON LOIS - still staring. Finally, she shakes her head sharply, as if to clear it of a wild notion.
dialog: TAXI DIRVER looks puzzled.
scene_heading: 82	INT. DAILY PLANET CITY ROOM, CLARK & LOIS' DESKS - DAY
dialog: ON LOIS' DESK is a copy of that morning's paper, the headlines bold and clear:
dialog: MERCI, SUPERMAN!
dialog: French Terror Scheme "Bombs"
dialog: Exclusive Story by Lois Lane
text: Standing patiently beside the desk with a long-suffering look on his face is CLARK, listening to the good talking-to Lois is	giving him.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Look, okay, this time you were lucky. Very
dialog: lucky. But next time you cross the street --
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: Clark, always look both ways.
dialog: Lecture over, she starts rummaging in the shopping bag we saw her carrying earlier.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (equally earnest)
dialog: Lois, I usually do.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Then maybe you should get your
dialog: glasses checked.
text: As he touches them nervously, she pulls out a plastic bag, filled with half-a-dozen oranges cut in half.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (piqued)
dialog: Not everyone can have X-ray vision,
dialog: you know.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Do I detect a note of jealousy?
text: From the bottom of bag she produces a fairly ancient hand-operated juicer -- the type where you put the orange half on a metal cone and then, pulling down a lever, bring the squeezer press down on it. She sets it and a large drinking glass on the desk.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 82	CONTINUED
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (looking at all this
dialog: with much curiosity)
dialog: Lois, what are you doing?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: When was the last time you heard me
dialog: sneeze?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (actually trying to
dialog: remember)
dialog: Uh. . .
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Well, you never will again!
dialog: (proselytizing)
dialog: Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book
dialog: that says the foundation of a sound body
dialog: structure is one thousand milligrams of
dialog: Vitamin C every day.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: One thousand?? That's an awful lot of
dialog: oranges. You know there are pill, Lois.
dialog: I've seen them.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: Oh sure. The American answer to everything.
dialog: Pills.
dialog: (as she puts an orange
dialog: in the juicer)
dialog: No, this is --
dialog: (the magic word)
dialog: -- natural.
dialog: She brings up the lever and bears down on the orange.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: And I also get some exercise this way.
dialog: That's for sure. Struggling mightily, she can hardly get the lever to budge. But she smiles
dialog: brightly as this doesn't bother her.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 82	CONTINUED
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Anyway, about being jealous -- you don't
dialog: have to be.
dialog: She's about to give it another try.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I don't?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (smiling at him)
dialog: Of course not. Not when you've got so much
dialog: going for you.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (daring to hope)
dialog: I do?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all
dialog: you.
dialog: (as his smile fades)
dialog: Look, would you mind if I gave you
dialog: some constructive criticism?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (hurting)
dialog: Actually, yes.
dialog: NEW ANGLE
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Well, you shouldn't
dialog: (intensely)
dialog: Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your
dialog: instinct! When you see your opportunity,
dialog: grab it! I do.
dialog: And she pushes down the lever.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: God knows . . .
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 82	CONTINUED
dialog: She is really having a tough time getting the press to go all the way down.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Lois, why don't you at least get one
dialog: of those automatic ones?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.
dialog: (through clenched teeth:
dialog: as she bears down)
dialog: No, this was good enough for my mother --
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Maybe I could try --
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Be my guest.
dialog: He repositions the orange and raises the lever. Clumsily, he bears down and gets, for his
dialog: pains, orange pulp juice spattered down the front of his pants. Now it's his turn to play
dialog: unperturbed.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (mopping himself)
dialog: It's okay, I was going to send this suit to
dialog: the cleaners anyway.
dialog: (he puts another orange
dialog: in the juicer)
dialog: I think I've got the hang of this now.
dialog: NEW ANGLE - He brings the lever down, then tosses away the squeezed-out orange. We
dialog: can't see what he's accomplished yet.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you
dialog: see I only say it because I really care?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (looking up, a last ray of hope)
dialog: Really?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Of course, that's what friends are for.

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (dashed again)

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (earnestly)

dialog: Jason! Watch out!
dialog: As she appears and grabs him none too gently, PULL BACK TO SEE that we are at a

dialog: VARIOUS SHOTS: The area is filled with FAMILIES, snapping away with Instamatics, and
dialog: NEWLYWED COUPLES, all holding hands. Not far away is a hot dog stand doing a brisk
dialog: business.
dialog: A fine mist rises from the Falls and hangs in the air. People are constantly wiping their
dialog: glasses and talking a blue streak.

dialog: We should be holding hands. They're all

dialog: LOIS
dialog: (taking a handkerchief
dialog: out of her purse)
dialog: How can you walk around like that?
text: And so saying, she snatches the glasses off his face. he stiffens, afraid that he might suddenly look a lot like Superman to her.
text: But she isn't even looking at him. She is busy cleaning his glasses and talking a blue streak.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: You really should pay attention to things like

text: C.U. LOIS: She is just about to set the glasses back on his nose when she gets her first look 	at him without them. She does a tiny, quizzical take.
dialog: C.U. CLARK -- Aware he is being scrutinized. He holds his breath.
dialog: She cocks her head and leans towards him inquiringly, when:
dialog: 112	Suddenly, little Jason runs INTO FRAME darting between them. He is one of those kids who
dialog: just can't stand still. Lois is jostled and completely distracted by this interruption. Clark is
dialog: vastly relieved. He casually retrieves his glasses and puts them back on as Jason's FATHER,
dialog: this time, retrieves the hyperactive child.
dialog: FATHER
dialog: Jason!

dialog: LOIS
dialog: And orange juice...but only if it's freshly

dialog: JASON
dialog: (big impish grin)
dialog: Hey, becha can't do this!
dialog: Suddenly he loses his footing and almost goes over. His mother screams. But:

dialog: ON JASON -- A high kick or two and a quick grin, when suddenly his hand slips. The grin
dialog: turns to a terrified cry as he plummets down the Falls.

dialog: 136	C. U. CLARK -- Now he knows what to do.
dialog: 137	EFFECTS: He beams a ray of intense Heat-Vision at the rotting branch and burns
dialog: it through. It drops off, tumbling into the swirling current. It floats wildly downstream
dialog: towards Lois.
speaker_heading: CLARK (o.s.)
dialog: Lois! Lois, grab hold! Grab that branch!
dialog: 138	Struggling against the strong current, she manages to get hold of it.
dialog: 139	ON CLARK: Quietly, he exhales a great gust of Super-Breath.
dialog: 140	EFFECTS: ( ON THE RIVER) This	blast of air, like a sudden favorable breeze, sends the
dialog: branch with Lois holding onto it shooting across the river, right up to the bank and dry land.
dialog: 141	NEW ANGLE -- Clark comes running off the bridge clambers down the side of the bank to
dialog: help pull her to safety.
dialog: 142	He grabs the other end of the branch she is clutching and is using it to hoist her to safety.
dialog: 143	He has no sooner got her close to dry land again then he loses his own footing . In a very
dialog: convincing and very undignified fashion, he tumbles into the drink himself.

dialog: 143	With a great effort, she hauls him up onto the riverbank. He looks as wet, bedraggled and
dialog: miserable as she does, except that on her it's adorable. Lois looks him up and down and

dialog: WIDE LONG SHOT: A bleak, scrubby landscape. A smallish lake in the center of it.

dialog: (calling from across the lake)
dialog: What shall we do now?
dialog: ZOD

dialog: elderly FISHERMAN, sitting in boat concealed by some reeds.
dialog: 146	FAVORING URSA AND NON - Behind them, in b.g. we see ZOD walking across the water
dialog: towards them. As URSA looks around:
dialog: Sound: the hissing rattle of a rattlesnake.
dialog: URSA looks in the direction of the snake.
dialog: 148	ON THE GROUND -- A few feet in front of her, a rattlesnake has crawled from beneath a
text: rock. His head rises up, his tongue flicks menacingly, his tail rattles. URSA looks curiously
dialog: at this unknown visitor.
dialog: URSA
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: A primitive sort of life form . . .
dialog: She picks up the snake.
dialog: 149	INSERT: the rattler, furious, hisses and strikes. Its fangs sink quickly into URSA'S wrist.
dialog: 150	FAVORING URSA - Unhurt, but annoyed, she throws it to the ground. She scowls and
dialog: glowers at the	snake.
dialog: EFFECTS: A beam of Heat-Vision emanates from eyes, striking the rattlesnake and 	instantly immolating it and the surrounding grass. It is as much of a surprise to URSA as	it
dialog: was to the snake.
dialog: 151	WIDER SHOT - ZOD has arrived.

dialog: ON ZOD -- not particularly impressed.
text: ON NON quite impressed in his dumb, brutish way. He looks at the carcass of the burnt snake, then at URSA, trying to puzzle it out. He touches this thick fingers to his eyes, attempting to figure the trick. His brow knots in concentration.
dialog: WIDER ANGLE -- She looks at the dead snake on the ground.
dialog: URSA
dialog: (wanting to impress Zod)
dialog: Remarkable! I have powers beyond

dialog: Ursa looks a little put out at his lack of response. As he turns away to look about the 		terrain.
text: ON NON -- concentrating fiercely on the abandoned snake, he narrows his eyes, tries to make Heat-Vision happen. But nothing comes. He picks up the carcass, holds it in front of his face, scowls exaggeratedly and tries again. He grunts with the effort.
dialog: But to no avail. NON is frustrated. He tries again.

dialog: he falls forward, sprawling, and his hand plunges right into the flames.

dialog: The three stand, unmoving, as the car approaches.
dialog: SHERIFF
dialog: Hey, y'all get your butts outta the road!

dialog: The three step closer as he emerges.
dialog: DEPUTY
dialog: Awright, just what in the hell --
dialog: Ursa touches the badge on his shirt front curiously.
dialog: URSA
dialog: What is this symbol? Do you follow
dialog: another leader?
dialog: DEPUTY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Follow the Leader . . . ?
dialog: She rips the badge off and pins it on herself, adding to her purloined NASA patches.
dialog: DEPUTY
dialog: (stunned at the effrontery)
dialog: Holeee skunk sweat!
dialog: He raises the shotgun, points it at them.
dialog: ON THE CAR, FAVORING THE SHERIFF: watching circumspectly.
dialog: The three have no reaction at all to the raised shotgun. Zod looks at it curiously.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: A weapon of some sort?
dialog: 172	EFFECTS: As Zod stares intently at the shotgun, the weapon jerks out of the Deputy's hands
text: and levitates in the air. Directed by Zod's gaze, it slowly floats in mid-air and moves a few
dialog: feet toward the General, presenting itself barrel first.

dialog: How in hell did you do that??
dialog: 174	ON THE CAR: The Sheriff is practically wetting his pants.

dialog: MUSIC: The love theme soars.
text: MED. LONG SHOT: And so does Superman, as he flies through the sky with Lois in his arms. Suddenly, in an excess of exuberance he swings into a great loop-the-loop. Lois shrieks and clings to him even tighter, like a young girl on a roller coaster. Superman grins and hugs her to him protectively, like her young swain on the roller coaster. HOLD CAMERA STATIONARY as they fly off, getting smaller and smaller, a joyously cartwheeling dot that disappears in the blue.

dialog: Until now.
dialog: 187	 EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: 
text: A general store, and beside it, a billboard. Next to that, a little post office, with a flagpole in 	front of it flying the American flag. Next to that a saloon. On its roof is one of those rather
dialog: elaborate TV antennas used in faraway small towns like this to bring in a decent picture from the transmitter. next to that a wooden building that might be garage or a former stable.
text: ON A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY, sitting on the steps of the Post office, reading a comic book. This is WILLIE. As he turns a page and idly glances up, his jaw drops.
text: 188	PAN WITH HIS GAZE, past a pick-up truck loaded with crates of turkeys and parked in 	font of the saloon, to SEE what amazes Willie: It is Zod, Ursa, and Non who have come to
dialog: town.
dialog: AS Zod and Ursa stride into the saloon, HOLD ON NON, who still carries the glass domed
dialog: police light. From the intensity of his self-absorbed expression, we can tell he is still trying
dialog: to puzzle out this Heat-Vision routine.
text: He stops and focuses on the open wooden tailgate of the pick-up truck. he narrows his eyes in 	imitation of Zod and grunts with effort.
text: 189	EFFECTS: A feeble, pitiful beam of Heat-Vision finally emanates from his eyes. it strikes the tailgate and chars a small, smouldering spot, much like a child's woodburning kit.
dialog: By George, he thinks he's got it! As Non growls with satisfaction.
dialog: 190	INT. SALOON, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: A dim light hole-in-the-wall joint. THREE BURLY GOOD OLD BOYS are putting back
dialog: beers at a center table. In between chug-a-lugs, two of them, sleeves rolled up to bare arms
dialog: like trees, are arm-wrestling. After considerable straining, WRESTLER ONE (J.J.) forces
dialog: the arm of WRESTLER TOW (Boog) down on the table.
dialog: J.J.
dialog: (in triumph)
dialog: See there, Boog. Just 'cause you're ugly
dialog: don't mean you're strong.
dialog: He picks up his beer mug in his massive mitt and then slowly sets it down again as he
dialog: notices Zod and Ursa in the bar.
dialog: BOOG
dialog: (seeing them)
dialog: Oh my God! The circus is in town!
dialog: GUY AT THE BAR
dialog: Hey, J. J., check out the bride of

text: She sits across from him, her elbow on the table, her hand open, ready to arm wrestle. J.J. 	is very amused.
dialog: J.J.
dialog: (engulfing her
dialog: hand in his)
dialog: Don't wanna spoil your manicure now.
dialog: The words are barely out of his mouth when she flicks his arm down. it is done with such
dialog: super-power that his arm crashes right throught the table, bringing J.J., table, and all smashing to the floor, table broken in half.
dialog: Enraged, Boog leaps from his chair, his great height and girth revealed for the first time.
dialog: 191	EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: From down the street the Sheriff comes running into town, followed by the Deputy. The
dialog: former is considerably the worse for the wear: tattered uniform, bruised and filthy face
dialog: and quite a tale he wants to tell.
dialog: As he waves his arms and comes yelling, Townspeople come over.
dialog: WILLIE
dialog: Sheriff! What happened?
dialog: 192	INT. SALOON - DAY
dialog: The furious Boog advances on Ursa.
dialog: BOOG
dialog: Girl or no girl, you are gonna be
dialog: spittin' teeth!
dialog: Zod steps in front of the man and gives him the slightest little push.
dialog: The effect is remarkable, as this light touch sends the beefy Boog smashing right through the
dialog: wall, splintering it. Instantly followed by:
dialog: 193	EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: SHERIFF
dialog: You ain't never gonna believe what
dialog: just happened to --
text: Crash! Boog comes hurtling out through the saloon wall, goes flying tight through the turkey 	truck and hurtles out the other side in a storm of feathers and a chorus of gobbles, and
dialog: bounces to a halt at the Sheriff's feet.
dialog: 194	Zod and Ursa stride out of the saloon and into the street where Non joins them.
dialog: 195	WIDE ANGLE -- As DINO, from across the street, pulls himself together, and faces off
dialog: against his three nemeses. It looks like the classic High Noon shot.
dialog: DINO
dialog: (leveling a shotgun
dialog: at them)
dialog: Awright, just get 'em up and keep 'em up.
dialog: 
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (thin-lipped)
dialog: These humans are beginning to annoy me.
dialog: 196	EFFECTS: A beam of intense light suddenly shoots from Zod's eyes, across the street, past
dialog: the cowering townspeople. When it strikes DINO it passes through his body like an
dialog: electrical charge, causing him to drop his gun and levitating him 30 feet in the air.
text: The crowd gasps. DINO hangs there in mid-air, terrified. The beam of light seems to hold
dialog: him there.
dialog: A woman screams. Willie, crying, runs to Zod.
dialog: WILLIE
dialog: Please, Mister!
dialog: URSA
dialog: (coldy, correcting him)
dialog: He is a general.
dialog: WILLIE
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Please, Mister General! Please let
dialog: my daddy down!
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Whatever you say.
dialog: 197	NEW ANGLE -- as Zod snaps off the beam of light. Suddenly Dino drops from the sky like a
dialog: sack of potatoes. He hits the ground with a thud.
dialog: 198	ON WILLIE -- paralyzed with horror.
dialog: 199	WIDE ANGLE -- The townspeople huddle together around Willie, murmuring fearfully.
dialog: URSA
dialog: (imperiously)
dialog: Silence! The General wishes to speak.
dialog: Zod strikes a pose -- arms akimbo, his cruel face impassive, his voice loud and commanding.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: I am General Zod. Your ruler.
dialog: (the muttering breaks out
dialog: again; he raises his voice,
dialog: stilling it)
dialog: Yes, today we begin a NEW ORDER!
dialog: ON WILLIW -- Pretending to be listening to General Zod, he is in fact, edging backwards
dialog: through the crowd, never looking away from Zod but slipping to the rear all the while, as:
dialog: ZOD (o.s.)
dialog: Each of you -- every man, woman and child --
dialog: will march proudly in the NEW ORDER! Your
dialog: land, your possessions, your very lives will gladly
dialog: be given in tribute to me! General Zod!
dialog: WE FOLLOW WILLIE as, with careful backward strides, he breaks out of the back of the
dialog: crowd. He darts around the back of the saloon.
dialog: 200	EXT. BEHIND THE SALOON, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: As Zod rants off-screen, Willie runs to an old grazing mare tethered behind the saloon. In
dialog: one jump he is on her back, loosing her rope, clinging to her neck, ready for the wild
dialog: bareback ride.
dialog: WILLIE
dialog: (whispering prayerfully)
dialog: Come on, we gotta get help! Go! Go, Betsy!
dialog: Nothing. For one agonizing second it seems as if the old horse does not even comprehend the

dialog: Suddenly, with a toss of her head, the mare catches on and with Willie clinging on for dear
dialog: life, she gallops off towards the horizon.
dialog: 201	EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: WIDE ANGLE -- As Zod continues haranguing the crowd.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: In return for your obedience, you will enjoy
dialog: my generous protection. In other words, you
dialog: will be allowed to live.
dialog: (lets that sink in)
dialog: No one may leave without my permis--
text: Suddenly Zod is silent. His eyes narrow as he spots something on the horizon.
dialog: 202	HIS POV: Willie and Betsey a hundred yards away are racing towards safety.
dialog: 203	FAVORING THE VILLAINS -- Zod's wrath is terrible.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: I said no one leaves!
dialog: He snaps his fingers. Non raises the red glass dome of the police car and hurls it, like a
dialog: grenade.
dialog: 204	LONG, WIDE SHOT -- The red dome hits (at super-speed) the galloping dot in the
dialog: background.

dialog: it's hard to explain but . . .

dialog: LADY
dialog: I name this ship BANNISTER. God bless her
dialog: and all who sail in her.
dialog: She lets go of the champagne bottle. As it starts to swing toward the prow.
dialog: 215	EFFECTS: Suddenly a blue streak whizzes between ship and lady. A split-second later it is
dialog: gone. And so is the champagne.
dialog: 216	As the piece of rope hits the prow, limply:
dialog: MUSIC: the band strikes up a tune.
dialog: The ship, which doesn't know the difference, starts to slip into the water.

dialog: just another tower. The SHOPKEEPER clutches his heart melodramatically.
dialog: SHOPKEEPER
dialog: Mamma Mia!
dialog: The SHOPKEEPER looks at the Tower, then back at his wares, then back at the Tower -
dialog: screams after SUPERMAN as the blue dot disappears in the sky.
dialog: SHOPKEEPER
dialog: Super-Cretino! Stronzo . . .
dialog: Hysterical, he makes an obscene gesture, turns, begins smashing his wares off the shelf.
dialog: 225	INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - DAY
dialog: Lois has returned to the Memory Crystal Bank, radiant with happiness, eyes wide with the
dialog: wonder of everything that has happened to her in the past few hours.
dialog: She leans over and takes the Green Crystal out, turns it over and over, studying it fondly as
dialog: if it were her beloved's baby pictures.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: I guess you knew him when.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 225	CONTINUED
dialog: Suddenly:
dialog: SOUND: a rush of air, the sound we associate with Superman landing.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN (o.s.)
dialog: (he sounds like the
dialog: young husband back
dialog: from work)
dialog: Hi, Lois! I'm home!
dialog: Happily, she runs to greet him, carelessly putting the Green Crystal down.
dialog: INSERT: The Green Crystal rolls down behind a sloped platform and comes to rest there,
dialog: out of sight and out of mind.
dialog: 226	EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
text: ON A NEWSMAN standing in the middle of Main Street. He looks out at US as he speaks
dialog: earnestly into a microphone.
dialog: NEWSMAN
dialog: This is East Houston, Idaho, until yesterday
dialog: just another town that time forgot . . .
dialog: As he speaks, PULL BACK AND WIDEN TO REVEAL that he is part of a television crew
dialog: covering the story of the century. A mobile truck full of equipment is parked nearby. A
text: CAMERAMAN with a minicam is shooting the report, while another TECHNICIAN watches a monitor and listens to sound on headphones.
dialog: NEWSMAN
dialog: Today the population -- exaggerated reports
dialog: put it a 123 -- has increased by three. And these
dialog: new arrivals bringing death and destruction in
dialog: their wake, have put East Houston back on the
dialog: map. Indeed --
dialog: 227	Suddenly Non charges INTO FRAM. He looks at the truck, the mincam, and the nervous
dialog: newsman like wonderful new toys -- he's not sure which to break first. But Zod is right
text: beside him. And Zod is looking at the monitor . . . and seeing himself. As Non picks up the monitor, about to hurl it to the ground.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Stop!
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 227	CONTINUED
dialog: With a growl of disappointment, Non sets the monitor back down again. Zod stared at his media image thoughtfully.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Who else is seeing this?
dialog: NEWSMAN
dialog: (sweating)
dialog: Well, with this live coverage -- and of course,
dialog: with the satellite -- I guess just about, the
dialog: whole world must be watching --
dialog: ZOD
dialog: The whole world? Zentar? The Vlar 18
dialog: Galaxy?
dialog: NEWSMAN
dialog: Earth. I meant . . . Earth.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Good. You may continue.
dialog: 228	L.S. of jeep arriving.
dialog: 229	Ursa comes over, looking decidedly unfriendly.
dialog: NEWSMAN
dialog: (backing away from her

dialog: Still broadcasting)
dialog: We shall indeed continue bringing you this
dialog: extraordinary story as it unfolds here in the

dialog: (petulantly to Zod)
dialog: Enough of this man! If the whole world is
dialog: watching, can we not show them something
dialog: more interesting?
dialog: 230	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
dialog: The major picks up a bullhorn and stands up in the jeep.
dialog: MAJOR
dialog: (through bullhorn)
dialog: Now hear this! Now hear this! Throw
dialog: down your weapons -- if you have any
dialog: weapons -- and surrender yourselves
dialog: immediately. This is an order!
dialog: 231	ON THE THREE VILLAINS -- Standing near the television crew.
dialog: At the command, "This is an order," Zod looks very irritated.
dialog: URSA
dialog: (regally)
dialog: General Zod does not take orders. He
dialog: gives them.
dialog: As a demonstration, Zod turns with a fierce scowl. He is about to employ hi Heat-Vision
dialog: when he sees Non standing beside him, looking rather pleadingly at him.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (to Non, giving
dialog: his big break)
dialog: Very well. You try it.
dialog: FAVORING NON -- He strikes a pose of great concentration (for him) and opens his eyes
dialog: wide. A moment later:
dialog: 232	EFFECTS: A beam of Heat-Vision shoots from his eyes and strikes the front tires of the
dialog: oncoming jeep.
dialog: 233	The tires go up in a burst of flames, causing the jeep to roll over and crash into the side of
dialog: one of the buildings. It comes hurtling out of the other side of the building and lands on a car
dialog: lot full of parked cars.
dialog: 234	Instantly, the two troop trucks screech to a halt and the soldiers leap from their places,
dialog: already firing at the three as they take cover all over the street.
dialog: IN QUICK CUTS
dialog: 235	1.	The townspeople run for cover. A few are caught in the firing and fall to the ground.
dialog: 236	2.	The soldiers fire round after round.
dialog: 237	3.	The bullets have no effect on Zod, Ursa and Non, who stand watching all this like
dialog: spectators at a fireworks display.
dialog: 238	ON THE NEWS BROADCASTER
dialog: NEWSMAN
dialog: (to his camera)
dialog: They're right in the line of fire and nothing
dialog: happens to them! I haven't seen anything
dialog: like this since Superman.
dialog: 239	REVERSE - Coming down the other end of Main Street is a COMMANDO UNIT - ten
dialog: Green Berets. Their LEADER carries a flame thrower.
dialog: 240	WIDE ANGLE--As the TV cameraman shoots from a dangerously exposed position, the
dialog: Commando Leader points his weapon at Zod and literally opens fire, shooting a solid bolt
dialog: of flame at the General.
dialog: 241	CLOSE ON ZOD - he blows
dialog: 242	WIDE ANGLE--As the crowd screams, Zod becomes a living flame thrower, blowing

text: A typical modern day small Tokyo apartment. A Japanese father and daughter are watching the horrors of East Houston on their Sony, while Mama is more intent on preparing dinner. She has a fish in front of her the chopping block and she punctuates every disapproving word with a sharp down stroke of her gleaming cleaver.
dialog: JAPANESE MOTHER

dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: I never did this before . . . I have to
dialog: tell you.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (Smiling up at
dialog: him; softly)
dialog: Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . .
dialog: well, don't rush it.
dialog: CAMERA WIDENS, PANS: And there, a short distance away, is a soufflé dish.
dialog: 247	EFFECTS: Superman beams his Heat-Vision at it. It rises almost instantly, perfectly.
dialog: 248	FAVORING LOIS -- watching in amazement. The Super-Soufflé mounts higher and higher.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Stop!
dialog: (adoringly, as he does)
dialog: Never overcook a soufflé. You'll learn.
dialog: She picks up the Champaign bottle and , doing her part, strains to push the cork out. Lightly,
text: gallantly, he takes the bottle from her and looks at the cork. It pops out, then bubbly spilling 	over in classic style.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: I though we might abandon the Orange
dialog: juice for once.

dialog: We can tell from their manner that they have been talking seriously for some time.

dialog: Kent.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: (very honestly)
dialog: I really like it sometimes.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't
dialog: have met you.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: But him is you.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Now I'm confused.
dialog: She rises, still holding his hand, smiling down at him.

dialog: Tell you what, you just keep thinking
dialog: about that while I . . .

dialog: . . . slip into something more comfortable.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:

text: BEGIN TIGHT ON LOIS' HANDBAG as she opens it. PULL BACK GRADUALLY as she, like a magician drawing scarves out of a hat, pulls something long and beautifully
dialog: filmy, which she had the foresight to bring along. PULLBACK ENDS IN FULL SHOT as
dialog: she holds this gorgeous peignoir up in front of her and smiles to herself, her eyes shining
dialog: with anticipation.
dialog: 251	INT. MEMEORY CRYSTAL BANK AREA, FORTRESS - NIGHT
dialog: As a troubled Superman sits on a platform near the Crystal Bank, looking up at the image of
dialog: Lara that floats in the fastness of the Fortress.
dialog: LARA
dialog: (nodding slowly,
dialog: feeling for him)
dialog: Kal-El, your father and I . . . we have
dialog: tried to anticipate your every question.
dialog: (dismayed)
dialog: This is the one we hoped you would
dialog: not ask.
dialog: 252	ON LOIS -- Emerging in her peignoir, radiantly ready for a night of love. She is startled to hear:
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN (o.s.)
dialog: But Mother, I have to ask. because I have to
dialog: have her.
dialog: (realizing it as
dialog: he says it:)
dialog: She's all I want in life.
text: ON LOIS - Thrilled to hear this, but confused and curious. TRACK WITH HER as she hurries towards the source of the voices, out onto an interior balcony.
text: 253	WIDE, LONG SHOT: Losi stands on the balcony at the rear of the great central chamber. She makes no attempt to hide as she observes this amazing encounter between Superman
dialog: and the floating image of Lara.
dialog: LARA
dialog: (gentle, infinite reproach)
dialog: You no longer can serve humanity if you
dialog: invest your time and emotion in one of them
dialog: at the expense of the rest.
dialog: (tellingly, but in mild tones)
dialog: Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude,
dialog: Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and
dialog: the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (stung)
dialog: Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness.
dialog: Can't I have that chance?
dialog: CONTINUED

dialog: (tortured)
dialog: Yes, but it's not all I feel.
dialog: LARA
dialog: (reprovingly)
dialog: Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like
dialog: an Earthling.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Mother, you speak only of honor, of
dialog: sacrifice, of responsibility --
dialog: LARA
dialog: Because that is your heritage. Those are the
dialog: values we lived by on Krypton.
dialog: NEW ANGLE
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (intensely)
dialog: But you had more than that, and I know it.
dialog: You and my father -- you had each other.
dialog: (a last, quiet plea)
dialog: Can I never have what you had?
dialog: LARA is silent, deeply moved. Finally, slowly:
dialog: LARA
dialog: (half-convinced)
dialog: And she -- the one you have chosen --
dialog: she feels as much for you?
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 253	CONTINUED
dialog: LARA
dialog: (taking a deep breath,
dialog: making a painful decision)
dialog: Then if this is what you wish -- to live your
dialog: life with a mortal - then you can only live
dialog: as a mortal. You must become . . . on of them.
dialog: 254	The rounded section of a polarized glass, which had always seemed like an integral
dialog: part of the Fortress now suddenly starts to rise. Now we SEE that it is, in fact, a circular chamber.
dialog: LARA
dialog: This crystal chamber has harnessed the rays
dialog: of the red sun of Krypton. Once exposed to
dialog: these rays, all your great powers on Earth will
dialog: disappear forever.
text: The crystal chamber comes to a stop and slowly opens before him. Superman stares at it in wonder.
dialog: 225	QUICK C.U. LOIS - watching, paralyzed.
dialog: 256	WIDE TWO SHOT - KARA AND SUPERMAN
dialog: LARA
dialog: But consider. Once it is done, there is
dialog: no return. You will feel like an ordinary
dialog: man.
dialog: (a mother's anguish)
dialog: You can be hurt like an ordinary man . . .
dialog: Superman steps slowly, deliberately towards the chamber.
dialog: LARA
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Oh my son, are you sure?
text: CLOSER ON SUPERMAN - as he looks at Lara, the tension showing on his face. Finally,
dialog: simply:
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Mother, I love her.
dialog: His mind made up, he turns and strides into the chamber.
dialog: 257	EXT. MAIN STREET, EAST HOUSTON - DAY
dialog: WIDE SHOT -- The three villains deployed at various places along the street, masters of all 	they survey. All around them are the signs of havoc they have wreaked: the bodies, the
dialog: smoldering houses, the overturned trucks, etc.
dialog: 258	ON A ROOF - A SOLDIER hefting a bazooka runs on the roof, ducking down to keep
text: hidden. He finds a vantage point, then rises and takes aim at NON in the street below.
dialog: 259	POV: GUN SIGHT, BAZOOKA - NON right on the crosshairs.
dialog: 260	ON THE SOLDIER - He fires.
dialog: 261	ON NON - He reaches up with one great hand and catches the bazooka shell bare-handed.
dialog: The, amazingly, he simply crushes it. It crumbles into pebble-like fragments as he opens
dialog: his palm and lets it drop,
text: 262	ANGLE UP: An Army helicopter suddenly looms up over the horizon and swoops down on the street, fires three rockets on Zod, who does not flinch.
text: 263	CLOSER ON IT: As the PILOT brings it down, a SHARPSHOOTER seated beside him trains an automatic on Zod.
dialog: 264	ON ZOD AND URSA
dialog: URSA
dialog: (patronizingly)
dialog: Look, they need a machine to fly.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear.
dialog: Blow them a kiss.
text: C.U. URSA - She lifts her face up to the sky and puckers up for an obscenely exaggerated kiss. Her lips part.
text: EFFECT: (WIDE ANGLE) As she blows, ever so softly, the current of air streaks up and hits the rotary blades with Super-Breath.
text: 265	They spin like a pinwheel. Shaking, the chopper goes crazily out of control. As Ursa continues to blow, the blades snap off. The helicopter crashes to the ground, black smoke billowing up into the sky.
dialog: Suddenly all is still. The last challenge has been met and bested.
dialog: 266	FAVORING ZOD - who looks around him in triumph.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: I win!
dialog: (pause; less triumphant)
dialog: I always win.
dialog: (almost disappointed)
dialog: There is no one on this planet who can

dialog: ZOD
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: Have I shown you enough?! or must the

dialog: 268	INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER
text: Inside the chamber, Superman passes his hand across various crystals to activate the restructuring mechanisms. Then, he waits, closing his eyes.
text: 269	EFFECTS: Violent light changes begin, spectacular lazer-like rays bouncing off the crystalline walls and playing over Superman like the red Krypton sun. As the walls glow a deeper and deeper blood-red.
dialog: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 270	INT. FORTRESS, OUTSIDE MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: The Memory Crystal Bank glows like the glass of the chamber, like fire, and suddenly explodes. Lara's grieving image fades and disappears in the black smoke that billows up from the ruins.
dialog: 271	ON LOIS - Terrified, she turns away and hides her face in her hands.
scene_heading: 272	INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: As the lights play wildly over Superman, the fiery walls of the chamber begin to darken as if they were burnt out. A final burst of light, a final current of Kryptonian energy seems to pass through Superman's body. He has always been invulnerable; now this force makes him shudder suddenly, terribly
text: 273	EFFECTS: Suddenly, before our eyes, an image of the mortal Clark Kent appears. The two "selves" separate, the life force animating Clark who moves away from the slab and toward the exit of the chamber. The Superman figure is completely still.
text: As Clark Kent becomes a brighter, more solid and substantial image, the Superman "figure" grows pale and insubstantial, fading, losing definition, and becoming opaque. Finally, it simply vanishes.
dialog: The lazer lights have all gone out and the chamber glass has turned a deadly green-black. There is absolute silence.
scene_heading: 274	INT. FORTRESS, OUTSIDE MOLECULAR RESTRUCTERING CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Clark comes slowly to a stunned Lois Lane. He wears a white shirt, slacks, but no glasses or corny hairstyle. This is somehow a more mature and manly Clark now.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: You did it. You gave it all up for me.
dialog: I . . . I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Say you love me.
text: He puts his arm around her as she stands pale and wide-eyed in her lovely peignoir. She slips her arm around him and lays her head on his shoulder.

dialog: ON A FIVE-STAR GENERAL, standing tall, chin up, face reddened with surpressed rage and humiliation.
dialog: TIGHT INSERT - Zod's hand rips off the epaulet of five gold stars.

dialog: 276	INT. FORTRESS SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY
text: TIGHT ON CLARK AND LOIS - laying quietly in the classic afterglow position. She looks	blissfully content. He, in the cold light of morning is troubled. And then (being a mere
text: mortal) he shivers. She snuggles closer. Suddenly their Eden is lost, She lays still in his arms.
dialog: but now we see in her eyes too the realization of how much he has sacrificed.
dialog: 277	INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Helmeted MARINES in full combat gear help WHITE HOUSE POLICE and SECRET SERVICE AGENTS secure the corridor leading to the Oval Office. An explosive charge is attached to the door at the entrance to the corridor, the connecting wires trailing off to a plunger detonator behind a nest of sandbags with a machine-gun emplacement. The MARINES take their positions, all eyes on the door, as suddenly: ZOD, NON and URSA burst down through the ceiling, shattering three glass domes which comprise part of it. The MARINES, POLICE, and SECRET SERVICE open fire through the shower of falling glass, send a withering barrage ricocheting around the room. ZOD watches triumphantly, the bullets bouncing harmlessly off him as URSA and NON go to work: URSA flings the advancing MARINES through the air, sends them crashing into one another as NON smashes the corridor pillars, then turns his attention to the machine-gun nest which blazes away at him. He demolishes the emplacement, breaks the gun in two, roars.
dialog: 278	INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
dialog: CAMERA LOOKS from behind the PRESIDENT'S desk chair in the Oval Office at the
text: closed and bolted entrance door. Half a dozen telephones ring with different buzzers and bells, but are not a answered. To one side, a dozen CHIEFS OF STAFF, CABINET
dialog: MEMBERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, et. al. stand waiting as the last sounds of
dialog: gunfire die away in the corridor. There is a moment of silence, punctuated only by the
dialog: sound of the unanswered phones. Suddenly: the door to the Oval Office collapses,
dialog: kicked to the floor in one piece. Standing in the open doorway, the devastated corridor
dialog: seen behind them: ZOD, URSA and NON.
text: ZOD and URSA enter. NON fills the doorway, standing guard. URSA now wears not only the NASA buckle, but the Texas Ranger badge as well. ZOD glances at the silent OFFICIALS with contempt, then turns his attention to the distinguished-looking MAN sitting behind the President's desk.

dialog: EXT. DINER - DAY
dialog: CLARK goes flying through a plate glass door, shattering it, lands in a heap on the
text: ground. The TRUCKER is already on him. CLARK tries to get up, is immediately knocked down again. LOIS 	rushes through the doorway to help, but is unceremoniously flung off to the side. Feeling new rage, 	CLARK rises, rushes the TRUCKER, actually gets in a punch or two, but is cut to pieces by a 	series of expert combinations. CLARK falls to the ground, exhausted, his face cracked and 	bleeding, feebly tries to get up once more.

dialog: LOIS
dialog: Oh, Clark . . . Clark . . . look at you . . .
text: CLARK tries to smile feebly through the blood, deeply embarrassed, bitter. A trickle of blood runs over his mouth. He wipes it away with a finger, inadvertently tasting it, stares at the stain on his hands.
speaker_heading: CLARK

dialog: TV VOICE
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen - the President of the

dialog: CLARK, LOIS and the COUNTERMAN turn, listen.
dialog: ANGLE ON TV SCREEN
text: The worried PRESIDENT sits behind his desk, reads from a prepared statement, the paper trembling in his hands.

dialog: This is the President. On behalf of my country,

speaker_heading: CLARK

dialog: He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
dialog: 281	EXT. NORTHERN HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The branches are bare, the sky cold and bleak. Clark, his face still bruised and cut, has obviously been standing at the side of the road for a long time.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSER -- As he shivers in his light clothing:
dialog: SOUND: a truck, not far off.
dialog: Desperately hopeful, Clark straightens up and puts his thumb out. With a great roar, the
dialog: truck speeds ACROSS FRAME and disappears, leaving Clark standing there, looking after
dialog: it in the gray silence.
dialog: 282	EXT. ARCTIC FIELD - TWILIGHT
dialog: There are no roads this far north. Clark doggedly, numbly, treks across the frozen landscape.
dialog: 
text: CLOSER -- He almost stumbles and then , as he catches his breath stops. He bends, scoops
text: up a handful of snow and applies it gently to his bruised cheek. He stares off into the endless distance he still has to go.
dialog: 283	INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT
dialog: The Fortress that once glittered magically now appears cold and desolate. The ruins of the
text: Memory Crystal Bank still smoulders in f.g. As the deathly silence is broken by a slight noise, CAMERA PANS and Clark comes INTO FRAME.
text: Somehow, at last, he is here. But he is exhausted and, as he looks all around him, without any real hope. He stands upright.

dialog: (anguished, barely able
dialog: to say it)
dialog: I failed everyone . . ..
dialog: He steps to the Memory Crystal Bank, picks up a couple of the now-useless crystals in his
dialog: hand and looks at them as if they were only	archeological relics. Finally he lets them fall,
dialog: the fragments tingling in the vast, cavernous stillness as the drop and shatter into even smaller pieces
dialog: Clark stands motionless through another beat of absolute silence. Then, suddenly, he raises

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (a cry of profound, total
dialog: despair)
dialog: Father!! Mother!! Can't you help me? Can't

dialog: bows his head.
dialog: Then . . . . . .
dialog: Sound: a faint pulsing sound, growing louder the longer it continuous.
text: ON CLARK - By degrees, he becomes aware of it. he looks up. Suddenly, on his face,
dialog: a green light begins to beam its reflection.
dialog: His eyes widen, as he begins to feel the pull of a long forgotten power .
dialog: WIDE ANGLE -- He walks toward the source of the pulsating green light, almost 	as if in	a
dialog: trance. He is being pulled toward it as if by invisible forces.
text: 284	ON THE CRYSTAL SLAB where Lois earlier let fall the Green Crystal: from behind it, the 	power of the Crystal makes itself known. It glows and shines with an intensity seemingly far 	beyond its size, compelling Clark to come closer.
dialog: The effect is exactly like that	moment in Superman, Part I (RELEASE SCRIPT, REEL FOUR - Page 6) when young Clark discovered it in the Kansas barn.
text: There is an awesome, even religious, feeling to all of this. He sinks on his knees beside and tentatively, very tentatively reaches for the Green Crystal.
dialog: He holds onto it now as if it were a lifeline, raising it before his eyes and staring into it.
text: The Crystal begins to glow and pulsate with an even greater intensity, transmitting its unearthly energy and power to Clark. Its radiance is reflected upon his face. He trembles as the Kryptonian force passes through him.

dialog: 295	WIDE ANGLE -- As Non and Ursa hover in the sky like evil angels.
dialog: 296	Zod lands on an exposed steel girder of a partially constructed skyscraper across the street.
dialog: Hanging a few feet above him, from a crane, is a massive concrete block, tied to a thick steel
dialog: chain which hangs from an iron hook.

dialog: ZOD
dialog: (stentorian tones)
dialog: Son of Jor-El! Kneel before Zod!

dialog: ZOD
dialog: Perhaps not. Perhaps you are only .. fool.
dialog: (with a malicious smile)
dialog: Like your father.
dialog: 299	C. U. SUPERMAN - his jaw tightens. The insult to his father has its effect.

dialog: sin of your father!
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (looking up at him)
dialog: I can't bow to someone so far beneath me.
dialog: 300	ON ZOD -- made furious by the insult. His eyes glowing fiercely, he looks up at the concrete
dialog: beam dangling a few feet above him.
dialog: 301	EFFECTS: He beams a ray of Heat-Vision at the metal chain. It burns through swiftly and
dialog: the block drops in Zod's waiting hands. He catches it easily,	as if it were light as a feather.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Then die as you deserve to!
dialog: H raises the block high and flings it down at Superman.
dialog: 302	NEW ANGLE - EFFECTS: Superman aims Lazer-vision at on-coming concrete
dialog: slab, and it pulverizes in mid-air, turning to harmless powder.
dialog: 303	FOLLOW THE POWDERY STUFF as it drops to the street .
text: 304	ON THE STREET -- A CROWD is beginning to form, looking up. As the dust falls, a

dialog: ZOD
dialog: Take him. He is yours.
dialog: 307	Let off his leash, so to speak, Non leaps into action and flies toward Superman .
dialog: 308	WIDE ANGLE -- Superman leaves his perch as well. The two begin to circle each other
dialog: warily in the air, like two fighter planes getting into position for a dog-fight, or two	knife fighters jockeying for the first advantage.
dialog: 309	ON ZOD - growing impatient with the delay.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Kill him! Kill him!
dialog: 310	Thee command triggers Non into action. He zooms forward and punches Superman with all	his murderous might.
dialog: 311	The blow sends Superman reeling backward at great speed.

dialog: Lois looks worriedly at Jimmy. Perry leans out the window, calling like a coach from the
dialog: sidelines:
dialog: PERRY
dialog: Come on, Superman - straighten up and fly
dialog: right!
text: 314	WIDE ANGLE -- Superman comes charging through the air directly at Non. He whips his foot up like a champion Karate fighter and deals Non a powerful kick in the jaw. As Non, with a grunt, goes tumbling OUT OF FRAME:
dialog: 315	ON THE STREET BELOW -- The crowd cheers their hero.
dialog: A GUY IN CROWD
dialog: Way to go Superman!
dialog: 316	ON SUPERMAN - looking in the direction of Non's flight off.
text: 317	Suddenly, Ursa flies up behind him, twists his hair in her hands and pulls it, viciously, with
dialog: all her might.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (in much pain, doesn't see who
dialog: it is behind him pulling his hair)
dialog: Why don't you fight like a man?

dialog: Superman! You?? Hit a woman??
dialog: She's got his number, that nice kid raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent. As he refrains from
dialog: belting her for one all-important second.
dialog: 318	NON swoops back INTO FRAME behind Superman and grabs him around the waist in a
dialog: bear hug.
dialog: NEW ANGLE -- As Non squeezes tighter and tighter while a greatly pained Superman
dialog: struggles to free himself.
text: 319	Ursa flies to the side of the nearest building and snaps off a flagpole that protrudes horizontally from the third floor ledge. It's one of those flagpoles with a golf ball on the end of it.
dialog: 320	She flies toward them and raises the flagpole, about to swing it like a baseball bat.
dialog: 321
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (calling from his position
dialog: of relative safety)
dialog: smash him! Smash his head open!
dialog: 322	Ursa winds up and starts to swing. As she does, Superman manages to extricate himself from
dialog: Non's grip, squeezing out and slipping away. Too late to check her swing, though
dialog: 323	The golden bowl connects with the thick chest of Non with a tremendous crack.
dialog: 324	ON THE GROUND
dialog: THE CABBIE
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: Home run !
dialog: 325	ON THE BATTLERS -- The terrific impact of Ursa's blow sends Non reeling backward at
text: an incredible speed. Tumbling end over end, he smashes into the top section of the Empire 	State Building in b.g.
dialog: 326	As he hits the television antenna it breaks off. Showers of electrical sparks go spiraling into
dialog: the air as the antenna breaks off and falls toward the street.
text: Sound: off Screen, OUT OF FRAME, the screams of the people below. Then the sirens	of	approaching ambulances and police cars.
dialog: 327	ON THE STREET -- We SEE an ambulance racing toward the area.
dialog: 328	ON SUPERMAN -- Suddenly horrified as he SEES the antenna falling.
text: 329	ON THE STREET - where a WOMAN pushes a baby carriage looks up, frozen to the spot,	paralyzed with terror.
text: 330	ON SUPERMAN -- as he catches the antenna just in time. As the woman with the carriage runs to safety, he flies up again, holding the cage-like object.
dialog: 331	ON ZOD AND URSA -- watching this from their vantage point on a building roof across the street.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have
dialog: discovered his weakness.
dialog: URSA
dialog: Yes?
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: He...
dialog: (searching for the bon mot)
dialog: cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People.
dialog: These earth People .
dialog: URSA
dialog: Sentimental idiot.
text: 332	ON TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING -- The still groggy Non lies on the broken summit. Superman flies up still holding the cage-like antenna and puts it over him, penning
dialog: him in.
dialog: 333	ON ZOD AND URSA - standing before a large billboard.
dialog: 
dialog: URSA
dialog: (distraught)
dialog: He's captured Non!
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Don't worry. I will draw his fire.
dialog: (small smile)
dialog: With a few of my own.
dialog: 334	ANGLE DOWN -- EFFECTS: Zod, using his beams of Heat-Vision, aims one ray after
dialog: another at the gas tanks of the line of parked cars on the street below.
dialog: 335	FROM	THIS ANGLE, WE CAN SEE DOWN THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
dialog: As the rays strike the tanks they glow red hot and then explode in a pillar of flame.
dialog: One, two, three, automobiles go up like this, and now we SEE that at the end of the street is
dialog: a big Exxon tanker truck. Inevitably Zod will set fire to this one and the conflagration would be devastating (not to mention the effect on the energy crisis).
dialog: 336	ON SUPER.MAN -- On top of the Empire State Building, he looks down and SEES what
dialog: Zod is up to.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: No!
dialog: 337	LONG SHOT -- He zooms down to the street at super-speed.
text: 338	Just as Zod has finished setting fire to the last car on the block and is about to move on to the tanker truck.
text: 339	CLOSER -- Acting quickly, Superman rips off the large mirror positioned outside the cab on the driver's side (the rear-view mirror, in other words) and twists it around so that it reflects
dialog: the beam of Heat-Vision.
dialog: 340	ANGLE TO SEE that as the beam hits the mirror instead of the tank, it is reflected back at
dialog: Zod with a rush of flame.
text: 341	EFFECTS: ON ZOD -- Standing before an advertising billboard. The whoosh of rushing flame completely obliterates both the General and the billboard FROM OUR SIGHT. But a moment. later we see that the sign has burnt up except for a silhouette of Zod, for where he
dialog: stood, his fireproof self, protected that portion of the billboard from the fire.
dialog: 342	NEW ANGLE -- As Superman turns towards the truck, Non has revived and launched a new
dialog: attack. He flies down at his enemy at full Speed.
dialog: 343	They connect with a sickening crunch.
dialog: The two titans crash right through the pavement.
dialog: 344	As they disappear into the crater they have created, the earth trembles with the force of it
dialog: Street lamps shake, parked cars rumble. Suddenly the glass display Windows of a clothing
dialog: store vibrate and then collapses with a great smashing of glass.
dialog: The dress mannequins in the display window pitch forward like dead bodies.
dialog: The people rush forward in a mob to peer down into the hole, to watch the fight.
dialog: 345	But, BEHIND THEM, the great form of Non comes shooting out of the street (from a new
dialog: hole), on the receiving end of a thunderous Superman punch.
dialog: 346	NEW ANGLE -- The street cracks in places, debris dropping all around. A few manhole
dialog: covers in f.g. fly up a few feet, loosened from their moorings, and drop to the gutter.
dialog: 347	FOLLOW NON -- in his unstoppable trajectory he crashes through a great glass office
dialog: building on the fourteenth floor. A moment later he comes flying out the other side on the
dialog: thirteenth floor as huge hunks of plate glass rain down into the street.

dialog: URSA
dialog: What's your hurry, Superman? Don't
dialog: you want to play with me?
text: And with that she flings the manhole cover at him in his flight. It whizzes through the air with a shrill whistling sound.
dialog: Great shot, Ursa. The manhole cover catches Superman right in the stomach with an
dialog: audible thump. It not only stops his flight, it knocks him down the street, seemingly
dialog: unconscious.
dialog: 351	C. U. LOIS -- watching from the window, she puts a hand to her mouth, afraid he's really

dialog: Now, Son of Jor-El, admit defeat. Beg forgiveness
dialog: and swear allegiance to Zod.
dialog: But it ain't that simple, General.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: That'll be the day.
dialog: And with that, the suddenly "revived" Superman grabs Zod by the hand and foot and flings
dialog: him up into the air, OUT OF FRAME.
text: 354	ANGLE ON COCA-COLA SIGN -- Zod is driven back into an enormous illuminated Coca-Cola sign. Hundreds of light bulbs pop like soda bubbles. Rainbows of sparks fall to the streets below.

dialog: Hot air! I'll show you hot air!
dialog: The three villains together blow a tremendous gust of Super-Breath down the street.
dialog: 374	EFFECTS -- It's a hurricane force wind. wreaking incredible damage. Before the mighty,

dialog: LOIS
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: He'll be back. As long as he's alive 									he'll try again.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: The next time - we will kill him!
dialog: NON roars. LUTHOR rises, dusts himself off, turns to ZOD.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: Next time, next time . . .
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: What am I going to do with you people? I 								hold up my end. I deliver the Blue Boy - 								and what do I hear from my triple threat? 							"Bow, yield, kneel" - that kind of stuff 								closes out of town.
dialog: ZOD stares hard at LUTHOR, icy, but curious.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Why do you say this to me when you know
dialog: I will kill you for it?
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: (chuckle)
dialog: Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the

dialog: LONG SHOT -- The Villains soar through the dark, star-filled sky. Ursa carries Luthor.

scene_heading: 388	INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE, MOLECULAR RESTRUCTURING CHAMBER - NIGHT
dialog: WIDE SHOT -- Inside the Fortress. Superman SEEN inside the molecular restructuring chamber.
dialog: INSIDE THE CHAMBER - Superman passes his hand very deliberately across various
dialog: crystals in a specific sequence, much as he did once before in this setting. This is seen
dialog: briefly, leaving us not time to guess what he might be doing.
dialog: 389	INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT
dialog: As they fly in the wide, multi-tiered interior:
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (to Ursa)
dialog: Put down Lex Luthor !
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: (did he hear right?)
dialog: Put down Lex Luthor?
dialog: 390	Ursa follows orders. She drops Luthor unceremoniously on a remote ledge.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: Hey! Hey, who day's have to know to get
dialog: a ringside seat here?
dialog: 391	ANOTHER ANGLE - As they land, still holding Lois. They look about them for the owner
dialog: of the house.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Superman, this wasn't my idea!
dialog: Zod takes in the décor sneeringly.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Morbid. A sentimental replica of a planet
dialog: long since vanished.
dialog: 392	PAN UP, SHARP ANGLE: Superman suddenly appears above them, standing on the
dialog: highest balcony, looking down commandingly.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: I expect better manners from my guests.
dialog: QUICK C.U. LOIS -- Much relieved to see him.
dialog: FAVORING THE VILLAINS --
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (as he sees Superman;
dialog: savagely)
dialog: Accept your destiny, Kal-El. Even as
dialog: your father once condemned us, so
dialog: now do we condemn his misbegotten
dialog: brat.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: (deliberately goading them)
dialog: As we say on Earth, Zod -- "all talk
dialog: and no action."
dialog: Non, made furious by the taunt, leaps from his place and springs at Superman.
dialog: 393	EFFECTS: Quickly, in a dazzling display, Superman puts his hand to his chest. Magically,
dialog: the "S SHIELD" emblazoned there becomes a literal object in his hand while its "original"
dialog: remains on the costume. It shimmers and shines with an energy force that clearly connotes
dialog: immense power .
dialog: Superman flings it like a discus.
dialog: 394	The effect on Non as the "S SHIELD" hits him and wraps around him.
dialog: 395	ON ZOD -- He looks worried. He is beginning to realize that Superman, on his home turf, has powers and devices at his command beyond their comprehension.
dialog: URSA
dialog: (sensing his fear)
dialog: General --- ?
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (quickly reasserting his
dialog: authority)
dialog: We must combine our strength.
dialog: As Non reappears from one side, the three stand at points of an invisible triangle, facing
dialog: Superman.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: We are three. He is one.
dialog: LUTHOR (o.s.)
dialog: Great odds! What's the point spread?
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: The combined power of three will destroy you!
dialog: (gives the command)
dialog: Now!
dialog: EFFECTS: From their three points, the three Villains beam red-hot. rays of Heat-Vision at
dialog: Superman.
dialog: 397	But, incredibly, as the three rays strike their common target, Superman reaches out and
dialog: physically grabs the apex of the combined beams in his fist. It has the effect of shorting them
dialog: out in a spectacular way. Bolts of Kryptonian energy zap and crackle into the air from
dialog: Superman's fist, negating the force, causing the startled Villains to reel back from the
dialog: negative electrical charge.
dialog: 398	C.U. SUPERMAN - still on guard, attuned to their every move.
dialog: 399	ON THE VILLAINS -- Zod doesn't give up that easily.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (smarting)
dialog: One way or another you will bow to me!
dialog: 400	C.U. SUPERMAN - His eyes dart quickly around the vast. interior.
dialog: 401	POV: The three villains have suddenly disappeared; a little magic of their own.
dialog: ZOD (o.s.)
dialog: Now it is you who are confounded.
dialog: 402	C.U. SUPERMAN -- Hi5 eyes dilate indicating X-Ray Vision at work.
dialog: 403	POV: EFFECTS - His X-Ray Vision REVEALS Ursa, Non and Zod behind opaque crystal
text: blocks. Suddenly they disappear. There are three flashes of light, denoting super-speed. Now they appear again, but behind different places.
dialog: 404	C.U. SUPERMAN -- He blinks, confused.
dialog: 405	EFFECTS: Again they shift position with lightening speed. The effect is to totally disorient
dialog: Superman, as if he were in a Hall of Mirrors.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (mocking him)
dialog: Now you see us, now you don't.
dialog: Ursa's evil laughter rings out.
dialog: LUTHOR (o.s.)
dialog: (calling out from his corner)
dialog: The old shell game, Super-sucker!
dialog: 406	C.U. SUPERMAN -- A look of intense concentration.
dialog: 407	WIDE ANGLE (EFFECTS:) Suddenly, one after another three images of Superman are
dialog: projected from the "original -- "real" Superman. As they spread out and face the villains in
dialog: the different areas of the Fortress , it is impossible to tell which of these four is the real
dialog: Superman.
dialog: LUTHOR (o.s.)
dialog: Hey, what happened to the Marquis of
dialog: Queensbury rules?
dialog: 408	ON NON -- Disoriented at first, he dumbly turns on the "Superman" closest to him. With a
text: ferocious howl, he dives at it . . . . and sails right on through it. Coming out the other side; the
dialog: expression on his face is priceless as he crashes head-on into a crystal wall. He slumps
dialog: against it bruised and bewildered (and bewitched).
dialog: Now this particular Superman image smiles, fades and vanishes.
dialog: 409	ON URSA AND SUPERMAN IMAGE 2: She takes a flying leap at her "Superman," her
text: boot up, aiming for a super-kick at his groin. But she ends up on the ground in a furious heap, as the "Superman" image breaks as if a shattered crystal and pieces fall to the ground.
dialog: 410	NEW ANGLE -- A third Superman takes a step and speaks:
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN 3
dialog: (calling to Zod, taunting)
dialog: How do you like these odds, General ? Or
dialog: are they too odd for you ?
dialog: As he speaks Lois naturally assumes that this must be the "real" Superman and runs to him
dialog: for protection.
dialog: 411	ON ZOD -- certain now that the fourth remaining Superman is a phony, the final fake, he
dialog: steps over to it, lifts his hand to flick it away.
dialog: 412	ON LOIS WITH HER SUPERMAN
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Oh, Superman, I was ---
dialog: As she speaks she throws her arms around him -- (EFFECTS) only to find that they pass
dialog: right through his seemingly solid body. She reacts with dumbfounded surprise.
dialog: 4l3	ON ZOD -- A split second later as Zod gives the brush-off to the fourth Superman he
dialog: discovers that this "illusion" is reality.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: One more mistake like that and you'll be busted
dialog: to Corporal, Zod.
dialog: And with that he seizes him in a powerful grip. As Zod struggles to get free --
dialog: 414	Ursa and Non swoop towards Lois and grab her -- each getting an arm. Now they begin to
dialog: pull like two people having a tug-of-war.
dialog: URSA
dialog: Release the General or we tear her apart.
dialog: 415	C.U. SUPERMAN -- what to do?
dialog: 416	ON LOIS -- Suffering but brave.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: No, Superman! Don't!
dialog: Non and Ursa pull harder. As Lois cries out in pain---
dialog: 417	Superman reluctantly releases Zod.
dialog: As Zod steps away, dusting off his uniform.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: Did you really believe we would give up our
dialog: advantage?
dialog: URSA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: "Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: (offended)
dialog: Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or
dialog: three times --
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (triumphant.)
dialog: Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever.
dialog: If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for
dialog: your defiance.
dialog: (he snaps his fingers
dialog: towards Lois)
dialog: Beginning with this one.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Don't do it, Superman! Not for me --
dialog: Ursa and Non tighten their hold and pull her still harder. Pain stops her from speaking.
dialog: 419	ON SUPERMAN -- thoroughly defeated.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Stop! Let her go!
dialog: (pause to Zod)
dialog: All right, Zod. you win. It's over.
dialog: 420	Zod smiles, full of himself, looks around the Fortress at the Memory Bank , crystal rows,
dialog: bench, etc.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: (to Non)
dialog: I sense the presence of Jor-El here. Destroy
dialog: all this . . . .
dialog: (at Luthor)
dialog: And we have no more need of this one. Kill him.
dialog: (AT THIS POINT, GO TO FOOTAGE ALREADY SHOT FROM SCRIPT OF 26th

dialog: Me? General, it's me, Lex Luthor! Remember?
dialog: Who got you through the tough times? You filled
dialog: your inside straight? You came to me with nothing -

dialog: ZOD turns his back on him, walks away. NON begins to smash the crystal rows with enthusiastic relish.
dialog: CLOSER ON LUTHOR AND SUPERMAN
dialog: LUTHOR edges in closer to SUPERMAN, desperate, sweating.
dialog: 
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: You think you know people, right? Promises
dialog: are made, gifts exchanged . . . what does it all
dialog: mean anymore? Not like the old days when
dialog: it was just you and me. And I've got to hand it
dialog: to you, Superman. You always told the truth. A
dialog: fellow knew where he stood with you. You wanted
dialog: to destroy me, pure and simple -- and I respected
dialog: you for it.
text: NON raises SUPERMAN'S bench high over his head in B.G., smashes it to the floor. ZOD turns, looks at chamber, examining it cautiously from the outside. SUPERMAN looks at LUTHOR carefully.
dialog: SUPERMAN

dialog: Perhaps there is some good in you after
dialog: all, Lex Luthor.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never
dialog: even used it.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all
dialog: into that molecule chamber. It takes away their

dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 421	CONTINUED
dialog: LUTHOR looks over. ZOD is about to enter the chamber.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
dialog: ZOD turns, looks over, concerned.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: It's a molecule chamber, your Grace! It turns
dialog: people like you into . . .
dialog: (feels funny saying this)
dialog: people like me.
dialog: ZOD looks up at the chamber, realizing the mistake he almost made. He turns.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: You have done well, Lex Luthor. We will
dialog: award you this Cuba place.
dialog: (to URSA and NON)
dialog: Seize him!
text: URSA and NON spring at SUPERMAN, grab him, one on each leg and arm. SUPERMAN kicks and struggles vainly.
dialog: 
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: No! Please! Don't! . . .
text: LOIS rushes to try and help, is caught by a grinning ZOD, unceremoniously flung backward to the floor. SUPERMAN is hurled into the chamber. LUTHOR rushes to the side, presses a control. The door irises shut. SUPERMAN lies on the floor, helpless.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Lex Luthor! Ruler of Australia and the Cuba
dialog: place! Activate the machine!
dialog: LUTHOR grins, pushes the starting mechanism.
speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: The chamber is activated. The lights in the Fortress begin to change - but this time they happen in the entire interior of the Fortress, and not in the chamber.
dialog: 422	ANGLE ON SUPERMAN IN CHAMBER
text: SUPERMAN writhes in agony on the chamber floor as the outside lights play on the surface of the chamber.
speaker_heading: 423	ANGLE ON VILLAINS, LUTHOR AND LOIS
text: The VILLAINS and LUTHOR watch with glee as the lights dance. LOIS hides her face in anguish.
dialog: 424	BACK TO SUPERMAN
text: The de-molecular process ends. The door to the chamber irises open again. Slowly, painfully, SUPERMAN gets to his feet, his face crestfallen, his shoulders stooped, resigned to his defeat.
speaker_heading: 425	WIDER ANGLE
text: LOIS looks at him in horror. ZOD smiles cruelly, steps forward, salivating in triumph.
dialog: ZOD
dialog: And now - finally - kneel!
text: SUPERMAN steps out of the chamber, shuts his eyes, the final humiliation sinking in. The hushed silence is deafening. He has no choice. He kneels. ZOD extends his hand in contempt.
dialog: 
dialog: ZOD
dialog: Take my hand and swear eternal loyalty
dialog: to Zod.
dialog: SUPERMAN lifts his hand in disgrace.
dialog: EXTREME CLOSE ON HANDS
text: SUPERMAN takes ZOD'S hand, then slowly starts to squeeze it. The sound of bones cracking is heard.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: ZOD'S eyes bulge with pain. SUPERMAN suddenly pulls back and jerks ZOD up and over his shoulder.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 425	CONTINUED
dialog: ANGLE ON ZOD
text: ZOD is hurled helplessly through the air the entire length of the Fortress, crashes against the far wall, drops to the floor.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: LUTHOR horrified, suddenly realizes what's happened.
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: He switched it! He did it to them! The lights

text: 427	LOIS uncorks a tremendous haymaker, knocks URSA out cold on the floor. SUPERMAN advances on LUTHOR.
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying
dialog: weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
dialog: LUTHOR
dialog: (backing up)
dialog: Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you
dialog: see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
dialog: SUPERMAN
dialog: Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .

text: COME IN TO TWO SHOT as he reaches her desk. The following is quietly spoken, though not whispered. But there's nobody in the immediate vicinity to overhear. (Though, at one point, we SEE Jimmy in b.g.)

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Lois . . .
dialog: BEGIN SLOW MOVE IN TO C.U. LOIS AS SHE SPEAKS - All the conflicting emotions
dialog: and thoughts coming out after a long and troubled night.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have
dialog: to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened
dialog: to the voices of reason" till the dawn came up. Do
dialog: you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the

dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: C.U. LOIS

dialog: "They?"
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my
dialog: little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones
dialog: who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know
dialog: who you'd have to pick.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: What else could I do?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (being fair)
dialog: Oh, I'm not blaming you.
dialog: (being honest)
dialog: I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous
dialog: of . . . of all humanity.
dialog: (an ironic smile)
dialog: Some rival, huh?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Lois, someday --
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (intensely)
dialog: Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody
dialog: else someday." Cause . . .
dialog: (looking at him,
dialog: a wry smile)
dialog: . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow,
dialog: you'll have to admit that.
dialog: (deep breath, trying
dialog: to be realistic)
dialog: Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.

dialog: (stiff upper lip)
dialog: I know you think I'm good, but you haven't any
dialog: idea how good I'm going to have to be. I mean,
dialog: if you think it'll be easy --
dialog: (this is killing her)
dialog: -- sitting near you, talking to you, pretending not to feel,
dialog: pretending not to know. . .
dialog: (with a sad little laugh)
dialog: I don't even know what name to call you anymore.
dialog: MOVE IN TO VERY TIGHT TWO SHOT: They look into each other's eyes. He takes
dialog: off his glasses.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (almost a whisper)
dialog: I don't know what to say. . .
dialog: 
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (his words to her when
dialog: he came out of the
dialog: Restructuring Chamber)
dialog: Say you love me.
dialog: 
dialog: He takes her face in his hand and pulls her toward him. Though they have made love
dialog: when he was briefly a mortal, this is the first and only time we have seen Superman kiss
dialog: her. IN C.U., it is a profound, lyrical, passionate kiss -- it is indeed magical.
text: When at last he releases her, she moves back, opening her eyes, blinking as if she had just 	awakened from a dream.
dialog: PULL BACK AND WIDEN: as she shakes her head, like somebody who has had a dizzy
dialog: spell. CLARK puts his glasses back on.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 429	CONTINUED
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (voice and manner different
dialog: somehow more ordinary)
dialog: Wow . . . I just . . .
dialog: (shakes head to clear it)
dialog: I just got so dizzy. The Whole room is

text: NEW ANGLE -- from b.g. Jimmy Olsen looks up, sees she is acting oddly, comes over.
dialog: JIMMY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: She'll be fine.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (and now she is)
dialog: See what happens when I don't have my
dialog: orange juice?
dialog: (the old Lois again)
dialog: The human body is only a workable, fairly
dialog: fragile machine when you treat it with the
dialog: same respect you'd show to ----
dialog: (still not quite recovered,
dialog: puts her fingers to her eyes
dialog: and again shakes her head)
dialog: . . . gee . . .
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: I'm fine. . . . . .
dialog: (focusing)
dialog: What was I talking about? Before?
dialog: JIMMY
dialog: If I know you. Miss Lane, it was probably
dialog: about Superman.
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 429	CONTINUED
dialog: QUICK C.U. CLARK -- just watching her; no expression.
dialog: LOIS

dialog: . . . Superman?. . . . .

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Lois, I really don't see why --
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you
dialog: hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what
dialog: you're not.
dialog: MED. C.U. CLARK -- a wry smile; and in his eyes . . . memories.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I'll try to remember that . . .
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (playing "Clark")
dialog: You do?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy
dialog: and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
dialog: ON CLARK -- He smiles. Whatever his own pain, he is happy to see her feeling none .
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Everything on it?
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Everything on it.
dialog: As he grabs his hat and starts to leave:
dialog: LOIS
dialog: Oh, and --
dialog: CONTINUED

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: I know, I know, only if it's fresh-squeezed.
dialog: With one last little fond look back, he turns and leaves. STAY ON LOIS AND JIMMY.
dialog: LOIS
dialog: (blithely)
dialog: There goes a nice guy.
dialog: (she roll a fresh
dialog: sheet of paper into
dialog: her typewriter)
dialog: Now then, what trouble can I get
dialog: into today . . .
dialog: (to Jimmy)
dialog: What's going on in the world,
dialog: Jimmy?
dialog: 430	INT. DINER - DAY
text: The same Alaskan Diner visited earlier by CLARK and LOIS. CAMERA CI.OSE on the same burlv TRUCKER seen earlier as he eats a noisy lunch, sitting on a stool directly at the corner of the "L"-shaped counter. He munches down on his food as a FIGURE appears behind him.
dialog: TRUCKER
dialog: (to Counterman)
dialog: Gimme another order of that bacon, Will
dialog: ya?
speaker_heading: CLARK'S VOICE
dialog: That's funny. I didn't know swine were cannibals .
text: The TRUCKER blinks, swirls slowly in his seat as CAMARA PULLS BACK: Clark
dialog: stands
dialog: behind him, looks down.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: You're sitting in my seat, Pig-face.
dialog: TRUCKER
dialog: Come and get it four-eyes. . .
dialog: CONTINUED
dialog: 430	CONTINUED
text: The TRUCKER spins in his seat, uncorks a tremendous right hand to the midsection; he screams as his fist cracks into what seems like solid granite, breaking a bone. CLARK leans down, spins the stool in the opposite direction at dizzying speed. The TRUCKER becomes a whirling blur, his seat spiraling upward until it reaches counter level. CLARK reaches out, taps him at exactly the right moment; the TRUCKER flies down the length of the counter through napkin holders, salt shakers, and other people's meals, crashes against the wall, lands in a heap. The COUNTERMAN gapes at CLARK unbelievingly.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (nice smile)
dialog: I've been working out.
dialog: 431	EXT. SKY - DAY
text: Against a clear blue sky we see SUPERMAN in C.U. flying at speed holding a flag-pole so that a huge American Flag streams out from behind him.
dialog: 432	EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
text: The camera CUTS WIDE to reveal SUPERMAN approaching the roof of the White House. He swoops in behind the trees carrying the flag and flag-pole, which is attached to a new translucent roof-dome (to replace the dome fractured by the entrance of the villains).
dialog: 433	INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: We CUT as the PRESIDENT opens the door from his Oval Office and looks out and upwards to the broken corridor ceiling. We see SUPERMAN land on the roof and as he begins to place the new dome in position, he talks to the PRESIDENT. The LAST SHOT
text: is SUPERMAN C.U., the flag still streaming behind him, as the roof is positioned.
dialog: WE THEN CUT TO SC. 437.
dialog: 437	EXT. SKY - DUSK
text: SUPERMAN is flying home, the sun setting gloriously behind him. Against this awesome spectacle, HOLD CAMERA as he soars AWAY FROM F.G. heading for the horizon, magnificent in his power. Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. look! Up in the sky! Is it a bird! Is it a plane! No! It's Superman.
