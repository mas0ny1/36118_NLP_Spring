speaker_heading: PULL BACK
dialog: PAST the metallic FRAME of what seems to be a SHIP'S WINDOW to a multi-colored CONTROL PANEL. Aglow with LCD LIGHTS.
dialog: INTO FRAME
text: a long, fur-covered FINGER punches buttons on the board. In a precise SERIES. A course is digitally IMAGED.
text: TILT AND REVEAL: the startling vision of a CHIMPANZEE at the controls. Fitted with monitoring helmet and vest. His deep brown eyes sentient, intense.
text: A RED LIGHT suddenly FLASHES ON THE PANEL. A BEEP sounds harshly.
text: The chimp (PERICLES) quickly re-enters his command sequence. The BEEP gets faster. And the faster
dialog: it gets, the more flustered he gets.
dialog: int. flight simulator - continuous
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW the LIGHT BEGINS to FILL THE FRAME. Pericles tries to shield his eyes; now he can't see the BUTTONS on the board. Begins to SLAP at the controls in confusion.
text: The BEEP turns into one long wail. The view in the WINDOW FREEZES. The CONTROL PANEL goes BLACK.
dialog: REFLECTED ON THE CONTROL PANEL - A SECOND FACE
text: Human. CAPTAIN LEO DAVIDSON (20's) reaches over the chimp and punches OFF the BEEPING RED LIGHT. Silence.
dialog: leo
dialog: You lose.
dialog: WIDEN: OBERON - reveal FLIGHT SIMULATOR
dialog: PERICLES, the chimpanzee, vocalizes.
dialog: leo
dialog: Surprised? I changed your flight sequence.
dialog: Pericles taps the keys. Confused. He looks to Leo.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you can hit the fast ball ... but what about the curve?
dialog: Pericles bangs the equipment hard like a toddler.
speaker_heading: LEO (CONT'D)

text: An EXPLOSION OF ANIMAL NOISES as we SWEEP BY CAGES OF PRIMATES: mostly CHIMPANZEES, a few ORANGUTANS, GIBBONS, even a young lowland GORILLA.
text: VARIOUS MED TECH SPECIALISTS work with the apes in the b.g: ONE SPECIALIST picks out a simple MELODY (easily recognizable) on an electronic keyboard for ONE APE; the APE watches, then tries to repeat the notes.
dialog: INSERT: The cages are marked with METALLIC SQUARES stamped with SERIAL NUMBER and NICKNAME.
dialog: Pericles scoots to the comforting arms of CHIEF
dialog: MEDICAL OFFICER LT. COL. GRACE ALEXANDER.
dialog: Alexander
dialog: Was the homo sapien mean to you again?
dialog: (turns to Leo)
dialog: We all know it's just rocket envy.
dialog: leo
dialog: Ever consider an actual boyfriend?
dialog: Alexander
dialog: You mean do I enjoy being miserable? I'll stick with my chimps.
text: Pericles jumps up on a counter. Pulls on a CABINET. Leo takes a BISCUIT from a huge bag of TREATS. Puts it behind his back, then holds out his hands. Pericles chooses right, nothing; left, not there either. Pericles squawks.
dialog: leO
dialog: Another curve ball.
dialog: Alexander
dialog: You weren't authorized to change his flight training.
dialog: leo
dialog: I'm teaching him.
dialog: Leo pulls the biscuit from his back pocket. Hands it to Pericles.
dialog: Alexander
dialog: You're teasing him.
dialog: leo
dialog: He's gene spliced, chromosome enhanced ... a state of the art monkey ... he can take it.
dialog: ALEXANDER
dialog: When you frustrate them, they lose focus ... get confused. Even violent.
text: Across the room a CHIMP screeches and rattles its CAGE. Alexander brings Pericles over.
dialog: Alexander (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations, Pericles, you're going to be a daddy.
dialog: leo
dialog: I thought I saw a smirk on his face.
dialog: Alexander
dialog: Actually, the female was the aggressive one.
dialog: She looks right at Leo. Leo reacts. Is this a come on?
dialog: leo
dialog: Aggressive works for me.

dialog: on LCD screen: ext. leo's house - front porch - day
text: Crammed in front of a LENS waving madly are Leo's FATHER, MOTHER, SISTER, YOUNGER BROTHER and a few other relatives. A handsome, strong family. ONE LITTLE BROTHER waves a TOY MODEL OF THE OBERON.
dialog: leo's mother
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Now? OK, Hi, honey, it's me ... your mom.
text: Leo smiles warmly. His MOTHER wears an OBERON PIN on her dress. In the b.g. we can see a small old AIR STRIP with several planes, a hangar and wind sock on a pole.
dialog: leo's mother (CONT'D)
dialog: I have so much to tell you ...
dialog: Leo's Father steps FORWARD IN FRAME.
dialog: leo's father
dialog: But she won't ... 'cause this is costing me a fortune. Hi, son. The TV showed some pictures of you from space.

dialog: ... we're all real proud of you ...

dialog: Let's get to work. We'll start with a pass through the core. Take initial radiation and gamma ray readings.
dialog: Vasich turns to Leo.
speaker_heading: VASICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your monkey ready.

dialog: Sir, this is a waste of time.

dialog: leo
dialog: (over)
dialog: And by the time you go through all of them, it could be gone.
dialog: Vasich knows what Leo is lobbying for.
dialog: vasich
dialog: No manned flights. First we send out an ape, then if it's safe, we send a pilot --in that order.
dialog: leo
dialog: Let me do my job. You need somebody out there who can think, remember that? ... You need me.
dialog: Vasich is calm but firm.

dialog: Just follow your sequence and then come home. Understand? Home.
text: The CREW finishes up. Pericles vocalizes, looks for Leo -- needing Leo's reassurance. Leo turns to Pericles, smiles, gives him a THUMBS UP.
text: PERICLES looks down at his own HAND. Selects his THUMB. Pulls it up -- as the DOOR IS SEALED and WIPES SCREEN.

dialog: leo
dialog: He's not responding.
dialog: Alexander
dialog: Surge in the heart rate. He's scared.
dialog: The MONITOR FLASHES then GOES DEAD. They're all stunned.
dialog: vasich
dialog: Light him up again.

dialog: ANOTHER WAVE OF LIGHT CRESTS AND FALLS. ALPHA POD disappears.
dialog: Leo has no way to process what he's just seen.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Oberon? Come back ...
text: For the first time we HEAR a note of fear in his voice. Leo twists in his seat to look out the side WINDOW.

text: Another TIDAL WAVE OF LIGHT -- so thick it seems viscous. Leo braces himself. It rocks the POD as it sweeps by. Shakes Leo viciously.
dialog: int. delta pod - continuous
text: Then STOPS cold. LEO'S CONTROL MONITOR goes BLACK. ALL SYSTEMS SHUT DOWN. Leo bangs on the controls. In full panic.

text: Leo looks down to see FLAMES licking the outside of the POD. The TILES ON HIS HEAT SHIELD are white hot. SMOKE coats the cockpit with dark grease.
dialog: Leo tries to get his RETROS to fire -- but the heat has disabled the control panel.
dialog: He grabs a MANUAL LEVER and fights to engage it. ENGAGES.
dialog: int. delta pod -- leo's pov
text: The hazy outlines of LAND formations come RUSHING UP AT LEO. A huge expanse of DENSE GREEN fills the POD WINDOW. Leo fights to recover some steering.

speaker_heading: LEO'S POV -- 360 DEGREE PAN

dialog: SOUND CUE: SOMETHING IS MOVING THROUGH THE WOODS
text: Then Leo hears a frightening CRY. Leo's military training takes over. Leo moves quickly for cover.
dialog: ext. forest -- leo's pov (moving)
text: Racing through forest. Nettles rip his arms. He breaks from a tangle of vines. Stumbles over roots. THE SOUND IS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. Leo wheels to fight. Picks up a STONE.
dialog: ANGLE - BREAKING CLEAR
text: An older HUMAN (KARUBI), face decorated with intricate markings. He's carrying a sack of exotic fruits. Leo has no idea how to react -- he cocks his arm with the stone.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - BEHIND
dialog: Karubi's fierce YOUNG DAUGHTER (DAENA) appears --
dialog: daENA
dialog: Father ... they're coming.
text: She knocks the STONE from Leo's hand. Karubi pushes Leo aide. Other HUMANS APPEAR -- many with the same markings. Their raid on the fruit trees has become a run for their lives. Some are badly wounded. All following KARUBI.
dialog: angle
text: Leo is left alone. Looks around. BEAT -- then the FOREST CANOPY shakes furiously. Leo hears the eerie metallic tingle of bells. DARK FIGURES MOVE with frightening speed towards him. Like ghosts.
dialog: Leo is spooked. He backs up, races after the HUMANS.
dialog: ext. forest - LEO'S POV - UP AHEAD
text: The DARK FIGURES drop through the trees onto the HUMANS. Cries and shouts.
text: QUICK SHOTS: A HUMAN FIGURE is suddenly PROPELLED THROUGH THE AIR -- disappearing as it crashes in the underbrush. Branches snap. LOUD CRIES seem to come from everywhere. A YOUNG HUMAN is dragged into the foliage.
dialog: Leo keeps moving. The nightmarish NOISE builds to an unbearable furor.
text: A hundred yards ahead the foliage CLEARS. Giving way to a sun drenched HORIZON. And HILLS in the distance. KARUBI tries to lead the other HUMANS that way.
dialog: Leo puts on a burst of speed. HEARS a GROWL. Leo looks UP.
dialog: EXT. FOREST
text: MATCH POV -- whatever it is looking down on Leo drops like a spirit through the trees. Branches whiz by. LEO GROWS IN FRAME, until --

dialog: A ferocious GORILLA lands in front of Leo. Bares its canines.

dialog: leo
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: Leo grabs a branch to defend himself. Holds it like a spear.
text: ATTAR reacts almost with surprise. Then fury. With a fierce growl Attar SNAPS the branch in two. HEFTS Leo INTO THE AIR and HURLS him. Leo flies backwards. Hits the ground. Stunned.
text: Attar turns his attention to the other humans. He signals a LINE OF GORILLAS behind him. High-pitched HORNS ring out.
dialog: EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
text: ATTAR takes out a BOLA with heavy stones affixed to make it spin quickly. Whips it over his head -- unleashes it.
text: The Bola cuts the air with a frightening shriek. It catches a HUMAN MALE and wraps tightly around his legs.
dialog: TWO GORILLAS race forward and tie the captured human arms-over-head to long poles.
dialog: new angle
text: MORE GORILLAS charge in from the other side with lightning speed. Dragging a long NET affixed with hundred of small BELLS; the Apes shake it rhythmically -- scaring the humans, driving them on.
dialog: NEW ANGLE
text: Other soldiers dash across the tree branches with incredible speed and balance as if walking on air. They leap down on the terrified humans.
dialog: on leo
text: He staggers to his feet -- starts to run. Looks over his shoulder. As the NET closes in on Leo he's able to fall into a small ditch and roll UNDER it.
dialog: EXT. FOREST - follow leo
text: He runs the other way. Cutting in front of him is a stocky Human (GUNNAR) trying to flee with a LITTLE HUMAN GIRL (5) in his arms.
text: RACK FOCUS -- BEHIND GUNNAR -- TWO GORILLAS chase him down. One GORILLA plucks the child from his arms. The OTHER GORILLA knocks him forward. APES swarm over him.
text: KARUBI and DAENA lead the humans through a stand of small saplings. The APES sweep across ripping the trees out of the ground by their roots.
dialog: CLOSER ON KARUBI -- breathing hard, afraid, listening closely.
text: But ATTAR attacks like a force of nature, graceful with his power, unrestrained with his speed. The humans in his way are overwhelmed. Only Karubi and Daena are left at large from this group.
text: NEW ANGLE: a slight BOY (BIRN, 15) eludes several APES. Feral and wild, he is very agile. But he doesn't see an APE HANGING ONTO A TREE A LIMB. THE APE SNAGS BIRN WITH HIS FEET. Wrenches him into the air.
text: KARUBI circles back to try and rescue the Boy. Two more APES drop down -- slam him to his knees. Daena is bowled over. Karubi covers her with his body as a NET envelops them.
dialog: EXT. FOREST - leo
text: kneels behind a tree stump to catch his breath. Several APES drag human BODIES away. Leo tries to take this all in.
text: AN APE ON HORSEBACK crashes through the brush dragging two HUMANS behind. Leo waits til the Ape rides by --- then launches himself at the APE RIDER. Grabbing onto the reins, swinging himself up and KNOCKING THE APE off his mount.
dialog: Leo flips onto the horse. Tries to ride through the attack.
dialog: EXT. FOREST/LAVA TREE LINE - widen to new pov

dialog: ATTAR is directing the loading of the carts. The humans are literally THROWN inside.
dialog: We see DAENA tossed inside one cart. Then GUNNAR, BIRN. And finally, KARUBI, who's been beaten severely.
dialog: find leo
text: in a group of a dozen other HUMANS. An APE binds Leo's hand tightly. Suddenly all the HUMANS BOW THEIR HEADS, cower, turn their eyes to the ground.
dialog: LEO'S POV: the SUN enshrouds a DARK SILHOUETTE MOVING TOWARDS THE CAPTIVES.
dialog: ATTAR comes to attention -- with obvious pride at the success of the hunt.
scene_heading: REVEAL AN APE IN A GLITTERING GOLD UNIFORM RIDING A MASSIVE BLACK CHARGER. This is THADE, GENERAL OF THE APE ARMY.
dialog: Leo reads the reactions: a sense of glory from the Apes; intense fear from the Humans.
text: PUNCH CLOSE ON THADE AS HE WHEELS HIS HORSE AROUND AND MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH LEO. Leo is the only human staring right at THADE.
text: Thade's reaction is lightning quick: in a blur he's off his horse and in front of Leo. Grabs Leo by the hair. In a fury.
dialog: thade
dialog: This one looked at me.
dialog: CLOSE ON LEO: his bewilderment takes a new twist. The APE SPOKE ENGLISH.

text: A collage of old and new. Great stone buildings draped with bright tapestries, narrow streets and wide public spaces, busy with commerce and filled with APES.
text: SEVERAL OLD APES at a stone table argue over a game of chance. Several smoke from a hookah like object.
dialog: A GROUP OF FEMALE APES haggle with a FRUIT VENDOR.
text: ONE YOUNG APE plays a long flute like instrument for his friends. (This could be subtly evocative of the melody we heard on the Oberon.) A FEMALE APE passes by a drops a coin in his hat.
dialog: A CHIMP carves caricature-like HUMAN DOLLS out of wood.
dialog: ANOTHER APE JUGGLES USING HANDS -- AND FEET.
dialog: And in the most menial tasks we can see HUMANS -- carrying goods, pulling vehicles, chained. In all senses -- animals.
dialog: pan across
dialog: Most of the civilian APES ignore the CARTS.
text: Except for a group of YOUNG GORILLA KIDS who are playing a soccer like game (in this game, however, they use their prehensile feet to manipulate the ball). Several YOUNG APES rush up and throw a volley of stones at LEO'S CART.
dialog: INTO FRAME -- a FEMALE CHIMP (ARI) rushes to stop them.
dialog: ari
dialog: Stop it. You're being cruel. ... Open your hands.
dialog: When the kids hesitate, she slaps their hands. The stones fall. Leo reacts --
dialog: arI (CONT'D)
dialog: Who told you you could throw stones at humans?
dialog: one gorilla kid
dialog: My father.
dialog: ari
dialog: Then you're both wrong. And you can tell him I said so.
dialog: They run off. One GORILLA KID turns and sticks out his tongue.
dialog: one gorilla kid
dialog: Human lover.
dialog: Ari scowls at him -- they scurry away.
dialog: NEW ANGLE as ARI's friend, another FEMALE CHIMP (LEETA) comes up.
dialog: leeta
dialog: Do you always have to be so intense? I thought we're going shopping.
text: But Ari is staring as the carts pass her by. The humans wretched behind bars. CLOSER ON ARI -- her eyes well with tears. LEO makes EYE CONTACT with Ari for one second.
dialog: Ari hurries after the carts.
dialog: leeTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Ari. ... You're going to get in trouble again.
dialog: EXT. CITY OF THE APES - CONTINUOUS - stay ON THE CARTS
text: The other Humans all keep their heads down. Silent. Leo looks at ONE HUMAN MALE, clearly dead. No one reacts to the body.
text: Leo catches the young boy, BIRN, staring boldly at him. Through the layers of dirt Leo can sense his intelligence.
dialog: widen
text: The CARTS suddenly veer to the side of the road. A PROCESSION OF APES in what looks like MONK'S ROBES, faces wrapped in scarves, shuffle by in single file chanting.
text: ATTAR moves towards the Monks. They stop and give Attar their blessing. He bows his head, closes his eyes. We can sense his deep spirituality.
dialog: Leo crawls over to one HUMAN MALE face in his hand.
dialog: leo
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Where am I?
dialog: He moves away from Leo. Leo tries a frightened HUMAN FEMALE.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)
dialog: ... What is this place?
text: CLOSER: the FEMALE looks quickly at Leo, eyes impossibly wide, too scared to speak. Then turns her face away.
dialog: INTO FRAME: KARUBI, pulls leo back. Whispers urgently.
dialog: karubi
dialog: Head down. Mouth shut. You'll get us all killed.
text: Karubi looks around to make sure no Ape has heard them. Daena glances at Leo. Leo decides he'd better bide his time. He kneels down with the others.
dialog: ATTAR shouts and the CARTS move on.
dialog: WIDEN: AS THE CARTS TURN UNDER A GREAT STONE ARCH.
dialog: CLOSE ON A HOODED FIGURE
text: happily slapping a small sap in his palm as he waits in the center of a walled QUADRANGLE. LIMBO (ORANGUTAN) throws back his hood as --
dialog: CHAPTER 8: THE SLAVE TRADER
dialog: ext. ape city - limbo's quadrangle
text: The Human CARTS come to a stop. Limbo strides forward. Looks over the humans. Turns to an APE SOLDIER.
dialog: limbo
dialog: Are you trying to put me out of business? These are the skankiest, scabbiest, scuzziest humans I've ever seen.
dialog: ape soldier
dialog: You don't want them?
dialog: liMBO
dialog: I'll take the whole lot. I'll have to make it up on volume.
dialog: Limbo pays the SOLDIER; turns to his HANDLERS.
dialog: limbo (CONT'D)
dialog: Get 'em out, get 'em cleaned!
text: LEO peeks up as the CARTS are overwhelmed by large GORILLA HANDLERS wearing GERM PREVENTION MASKS. It happens quickly: Cages thrown open. Humans dragged out. Men and women separated. Cries and shouts. The humans keep heads down.
dialog: Karubi has to be pulled away from Daena.
dialog: kARUBI
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Don't be afraid.
dialog: daena
dialog: I'll find you ...
dialog: Limbo appears IN FRAME suddenly.
dialog: LIMBO
dialog: Very touching. Really. I can't see for the tears in my eyes.
text: He drags Daena by the hair into FEMALE PEN. Karubi struggles to reach his daughter. One HANDLER almost breaks his arm hurling him into the cage. Karubi shouts, collapses in pain.
dialog: Children are pulled from their Mothers. Put in separate pens.
text: LEO is thrown in the MALE PEN with Gunnar. Amazed at what's happening around him. Birn bites the hand of one HANDLER. LIMBO appears -- grabs Birn, shakes him hard, and tosses him in. Leo helps the boy to his feet.
dialog: limbo (CONT'D)
dialog: How many times do I have to tell you? Wear your gloves when you handle humans.
dialog: thade (os)
dialog: Are you softening, Limbo?
dialog: LIMBO spins to see THADE -- mounted, followed by ATTAR. Limbo turns from tyrant to toady in a second.
speaker_heading: tHADE (CONT'D)
dialog: You used to hack off a limb.
dialog: liMBO
dialog: Yes, General... but unfortunately he's worth more intact.
dialog: Attar goes to the cage and spots Leo.
dialog: attAR
dialog: Don't turn your back on this one. He's feisty.
dialog: Karubi watches Leo closely. Limbo talks quickly trying to suck up to Thade.
dialog: limbo
dialog: These the ones raiding the orchards, sir? I know an old country remedy that never fails. Gut one and string the carcass up ...
dialog: THADE
dialog: The human rights faction is already nipping at my heels.
dialog: limbO
dialog: Do-gooders. Who needs them? I'm all for free speech... as long as they keep their mouths shut.
text: Thade stops by a PEN with the HUMAN CHILDREN. WIDE-EYED, terrified. Thade looks them over.
dialog: thADE
dialog: I promised my niece a pet for her birthday.
dialog: limBO
dialog: Excellent. The little ones make wonderful pets... but make sure you get rid of it by puberty. If there's one thing you don't want in your house it's a human teenager.
text: ON LEO: he watches A YOUNG APE and HER APE MOTHER walk over to the pen. Limbo quickly points out a few little Girls.
dialog: limbO (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyone you want, sweetheart.
dialog: Like a kid in a pet store, the LITTLE APE looks over the children. Points at the 5 YEAR OLD GIRL we saw earlier.
dialog: liMBO (CONT'D)
dialog: Excellent choice.
text: ATTAR grabs the petrified LITTLE HUMAN GIRL and pets her head like a puppy -- sets her in the LITTLE APE's arms. Her Ape mother puts a leash on the Human Girl's neck as they leave.
text: IN THE FEMALE PEN -- the Little Girl's Human MOTHER stares at the ground blankly. Her eyes dead.
dialog: Daena watches them take the Little Girl. We feel her rage.
dialog: Thade turns his horse to the gate. Limbo can't resist one last fawning word.
dialog: liMBO (CONT'D)
dialog: They say if you piss along the fence line it keeps them away from the crops.
dialog: thADE
dialog: (stops him with a growl)
dialog: Close enough. You stink of humans.
dialog: He gallops off. LIMBO frowns, lifts his arm and sniffs.
dialog: EXT. LIMBO'S QUADRANGLE - another angle
dialog: As Thade and Attar ride off we see ARI hiding behind the gate. Leeta is very nervous.
dialog: leeTA
dialog: No way I'm going in there. It's disgusting.
dialog: Ari isn't paying attention to her. She moves closer to the entrance.
dialog: Ari
dialog: What's disgusting is the way we treat humans. It demeans us as well as them.
dialog: Leeta grabs her hand.
dialog: leETA
dialog: Ari... we should go home.
dialog: ari
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Then go home.
dialog: CHAPTER 9: A NEW OWNER
dialog: return to ext. limbo's quadrangle
dialog: Leo moves round the PEN watching -- not sure what's next.
dialog: limBO
dialog: Get 'em marked. I've got orders to fill.
dialog: TWO HANDLERS heft BRANDING IRONS from a large STONE FIRE PIT.
text: LEO'S POV: they use poles with wire loops at the end to grab DAENA by the neck. Drag her to a WOODEN POST. Then the Apes uncover her shoulders.
dialog: Karubi is enraged -- shakes his cage.
dialog: kaRUBI
dialog: No.
dialog: Limbo makes a funny face -- pretends he's scared. Teasing Karubi. The other Apes all laugh.
text: CLOSE ON DAENA: as the BRAND is pressed deep into her flesh. (THE BRAND IS FAINTLY EVOCATIVE OF THE ICON FROM THE OBERON.) But Daena does not scream. Her eyes burn with defiance. She's thrown back.
text: TWO APES come for LEO. He digs his heels in but they easily drag him to the post. One HANDLER quickly jabs the white hot IRON. Leo twists himself and KICKS IT OUT OF THE APE'S HAND. Limbo is furious.
dialog: limbo
dialog: Do I have to do everything myself?
dialog: He reaches out to pick up the BRANDING IRON.
dialog: EXT. LIMBO'S QUADRANGLE - CONTINUOUS - widen
text: ARI comes exploding INTO THE QUADRANGLE. She moves so quickly Limbo can't react at first. Opens a cage, knocks over a table, and finally grabs the BRANDING IRON and hurls it aside.
dialog: limbo
dialog: Oh, no, by Semos, not you again.
dialog: ari
dialog: I can not stand idly by while humans are being mistreated, tortured...
dialog: Leo watches Ari. Karubi and the others rush to the bars.
text: Ari dashes past Limbo to the FEMALE PENS. TURNS THE LOCKS AND THROWS OPEN THE GATES. Before the women can escape an APE HANDLER appears -- the women retreat back in the cage.
dialog: LIMBO grabs Ari. She twists away.
dialog: limbo
dialog: The only reason I put up with your nonsense is because of your father.
dialog: ari
dialog: If you want me to stop, give up your bloody business.
dialog: ON LEO: watching Ari carefully.
dialog: limBO
dialog: Hey, I do the job nobody else wants. I don't see any of you bleeding hearts spending all day with these dangerous, dirty, dumb beasts ...
dialog: ARI
dialog: They're not dumb. They can be taught to live with us ... and I'm going to prove it.
text: LEO reaches out for a CHAIN snaked in the dirt -- suddenly whips it around the foot of his HANDLER. Yanks him off balance. His SPEAR flies from his hand. Leo grabs it. Points it right at Ari's neck.
dialog: limbo
dialog: There's your 'proof'. Now I'll have to put him down.
dialog: Karubi and Daena watch intently.
dialog: widen
text: Leo wraps an arm, around Ari; tries to maneuver her to the gate. The HANDLERS surround them. Offering a low growl. Leo looks over at the gate. He knows he won't make it.
text: CLOSER: LEO LOCKS EYES WITH ARI. Ari is thrown by the intimacy of this act. No human has ever dared look her in the eyes this way. LEO LEANS INSIDE THE 'SPACE' BETWEEN HUMANS AND APES. HE SPEAKS INTENSELY.
dialog: leo
dialog: Please ... help me.
dialog: Ari is startled, frozen.
dialog: ANGLE
text: DAENA realizes the HANDLERS have been distracted by Leo. The DOOR TO THE FEMALE PEN is still open. She suddenly breaks out and runs for the gate. Limbo knocks her down hard. Turns furiously to Ari.
dialog: limbo
dialog: Look what you've started. Now I'm getting a headache.
dialog: Leo starts to back up, pressing the spear to her neck.
dialog: leo
dialog: Get back.
dialog: Limbo raises his hands, as if he's scared.
dialog: limBO
dialog: Oh, please, please don't hurt her.
text: Leo keeps his eyes on Limbo's hands -- and doesn't see LIMBO USE HIS FOOT to reach up and grab the spear. In one second he wallops Leo. Stands over him.
dialog: limBO (CONT'D)
dialog: Who needs this aggravation. Hold him.
dialog: Limbo hefts the spear. Ari makes her choice --
dialog: arI
dialog: Sell him to me.
dialog: limBO
dialog: Are you crazy? He's wild...
dialog: (re: Daena)
dialog: ... they're both wild.
dialog: arI
dialog: Then I'll buy them both.
dialog: Limbo freezes -- a look comes over his face. Nothing gets his attention like money. Leo and Daena exchange a look.
dialog: liMBO
dialog: That would be expensive ... very expensive.
dialog: ari
dialog: I'm sure we could come to a deal.
dialog: Limbo scratches his head. He can't resist.
dialog: arI (CONT'D)
dialog: Deliver them to my house.
dialog: liMBO
dialog: I'll have to mark him first.
dialog: In one quick thrust Limbo BRANDS Leo.
dialog: CHAPTER 10: THE DINNER PARTY
dialog: WIDE SHOT: EXT. CITY OF THE APES - NIGHT
dialog: The evening darkens as the MOONS rise above the city.
dialog: ext. ari's house - night
text: High-walled gardens strung with red lanterns. Tapestries billow in the night breeze. We HEAR LOUD VOICES.
dialog: ari'S VOICE
dialog: Father, please, I'll pay with my own money.
dialog: int. ARI'S kitchen - night
dialog: Ari chases her Father (SANDAR, chimpanzee, hair streaked with gray) into the kitchen.
dialog: sanDAR
dialog: Your 'own money' is going to make a pauper of me. ... Where are they?
text: KRULL (a large, elder silverbacked Gorilla) points. On the other side of the room Leo and Daena kneel on the floor with TWO OTHER HUMANS (TIVAL and BON). Sandar groans when he sees them.
dialog: Tival and Bon rise immediately. These 'house humans' are well-groomed, wear nice robes.
dialog: krULL
dialog: (to Leo and Daena)
dialog: Rise when your master enters.
text: Daena scowls -- doesn't move. Krull yanks her up. Leo stands and faces the old chimp.
dialog: saNDAR
dialog: Semos, help me, wild humans in my house.
dialog: ari
dialog: (re: Leo)
dialog: This one seems different.
dialog: saNDAR
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: How different could he be? You can't tell one from the other.
text: Leo looks up at Ari, meets her eyes again. Looking right at her. She is flustered, turns away.
dialog: O.S. They HEAR the sound of VOICES. Sandar is flustered.
speaker_heading: saNDAR (CONT'D)
dialog: My guests are here. Keep the savage ones out of sight ... especially from General Thade.
dialog: Ari reacts --
dialog: arI
dialog: Father ...
dialog: saNDAR
dialog: And you'd better be nice to him.
dialog: Sandar runs out. Ari looks at Leo -- runs after her father.
dialog: ext. ARI'S DINING PATIO - NIGHT
dialog: A long table and garlands of fruit and flowers. A party of APES engage in small talk.
dialog: at the front door
dialog: Sandar exchanges ape touches with SENATOR NADO (an elderly orangutan) AND HIS WIFE NOVA (a young CHIMP).
dialog: sanDAR
dialog: Good evening Senator Nado, you look lovely tonight.
dialog: nOVA
dialog: I'm having a bad hair day.
dialog: She sighs and strokes the fur on her face.
dialog: naDO
dialog: (rolls his eyes)
dialog: Yet she spends a fortune grooming herself.
dialog: nova
dialog: And I'm worth every penny.
dialog: She strokes her old husband quickly and runs ahead of him inside.
dialog: FIND ARI WITH LEETA: in elegant embroidered robes.
dialog: leeTA
dialog: Thade is powerful and aggressive ... what else could you want in a male?
dialog: arI
dialog: Someone I can respect ... and who respects me.
dialog: leETA
dialog: Don't play so hard to get. Say 'yes' to him and you'll be invited to every exclusive party in the city.
dialog: ari
dialog: How many silly parties can you go to?
dialog: leETA
dialog: How many are there?
dialog: Krull appears ringing a small bell. Sandar sweeps through.
dialog: sandAR
dialog: Please, everyone, sit.
dialog: int. ARI'S kitchen - same time
dialog: At the sound of the bell Tival and Bon carry wooden trays of food upstairs.
text: As soon as they leave Leo jumps up, tests a WINDOW with wooden shutters. Won't budge. Leo turns to Daena.
dialog: leo
dialog: How the hell did these monkeys get this way?
dialog: Daena just stares --
dialog: daena
dialog: What other way would they be?
dialog: leo
dialog: They'd be begging me for a treat.
dialog: daENA
dialog: (confused, looks at him)
dialog: What tribe do you come from?
dialog: leo
dialog: It's called the United States Air Force. And I'm going back to it.
dialog: Krull suddenly appears.
dialog: krULL
dialog: Finish your work... no talking.
text: Krull grabs another tray of food and leaves. Leo waits, then picks up a tray -- peeks up the stairs.
dialog: EXT. ARI'S DINING PATIO
text: The APES are seated at a long table. Sandar at the head. Ari across from Leeta. The CHAIR next to Ari is STILL OPEN.
dialog: nado
dialog: We just returned from our country house in the rain forest.
dialog: Krull offers food to each guest.
dialog: sANDAR
dialog: And how was it?
dialog: noVA
dialog: Bor-ing.
dialog: naDO
dialog: I find it relaxing ... being away from the frantic pace of the city.
dialog: noVA
dialog: I wanted to go out. But there was no place to go ... nothing but trees and rocks. All you did was nap.
dialog: NADO
dialog: Exactly. A bit of time away from politics is what is needed for a weary soul like me.
dialog: ON LEETA AND ARI
dialog: whispering.
dialog: ari
dialog: Look at the old fool ... he left his wife and children for her ... a chimp half his age. Now he can't keep up.
dialog: leETA
dialog: But he's worth a fortune.
dialog: back to nado
dialog: He reaches for Sandar. Gives him a gentle touch.
dialog: nadO
dialog: We used to lose ourselves for days in the forest when we were young. Now I can barely climb a tree.
dialog: saNDAR
dialog: It's trite but true. Youth is wasted on the young. Now that I have so much to do ... I'm exhausted. ... Still, some nights I dream of hurtling through the branches...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: How did I get so old so fast?
dialog: thade (o.s.)
dialog: Living with your daughter would age any ape quickly.
dialog: They all turn as THADE ENTERS THE PARTY WITH ATTAR.
dialog: ari
dialog: Quick. Switch seats.
dialog: leeTA
dialog: No, he's here to see you.
scene_heading: THADE WAITS FOR KRULL TO PULL OUT THE CHAIR. KRULL DOESN'T MOVE. ATTAR HURRIES TO HOLD THE CHAIR FOR THADE. WE CAN SENSE ENORMOUS HOSTILITY BETWEEN THADE AND KRULL.
dialog: Thade sits next to Ari. Sandar shoots Ari a look which says 'Please don't be rude.'
dialog: sANDAR
dialog: You are too long a stranger in our house.
dialog: thADE
dialog: My apologies, Senator. I stopped to see my father.
dialog: sandar
dialog: How is my old friend doing?
dialog: THADE
dialog: I'm afraid he's slipping. I wish I could spend more time with him... but these are troubled times. Humans infest the provinces...
dialog: ari
dialog: Because our cities encroach on their habitat.
dialog: THADE
dialog: They breed quickly while we grow soft with our affluence. Even now they outnumber us ten to one.
dialog: nOVA
dialog: Why can't the government simply sterilize them all?
dialog: NADO
dialog: The cost would be prohibitive. ... Although our scientists do tell me the humans carry terrible diseases.
dialog: ari
dialog: How would we know? The army burns the bodies before they can be examined. ...
dialog: Ari turns to Sandar for support.
dialog: ari (CONT'D)
dialog: Father.
dialog: saNDAR
dialog: At times, perhaps, the senate feels the army has been a tad... extreme ...
dialog: thADE
dialog: Extremism in defense of Apes is no vice.
text: Senator Nado is about to bite into a piece of fruit. ATTAR growls -- they all freeze. Attar closes his eyes and prays.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: We give thanks to you, Semos, for the fruit of the land. Bless us, Holy Father, who created all Apes in his image. Hasten the Day when you will return ... and bring peace to your children. Amen.
text: All the guests quickly say 'Amen.' Attar looks over at Krull, uncomfortable under the glare of the old silverback.
dialog: int. aT the top of the stairs
dialog: Leo is looking for a way out when an APE SOLDIER sees him and pushes him into the --
dialog: EXT. ARI'S DINING PATIO
text: Thade notices LEO ENTER THE ROOM. Leo has no choice but to pretend to serve. He tries hide his face from Thade. Thade sees LEO serving from the tray.
dialog: thADE
dialog: What is this beast doing in your house?
dialog: Ari exchanges a look with her father.
dialog: ari
dialog: He'll be trained as a domestic.
dialog: thade
dialog: Your ideas threaten our prosperity. The human problem will not be solved by throwing money at it. The government tried once and all we got was a welfare state that nearly bankrupted us.
dialog: Attar
dialog: And changed the face of the city.
dialog: leeTA
dialog: I think the city has about as much diversity as I can handle.
text: Ari glares at Leeta. She holds up her EMBROIDERED SCARF.
dialog: ari
dialog: This garment was made by one of my humans.
dialog: Ari smiles at BON, who averts her eyes nervously.
dialog: arI (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you deny the skill? Isn't it obvious they are capable of a real culture?
dialog: thADE
dialog: Everything in 'human culture' takes place below the waist.
dialog: The guests all laugh.
dialog: nado
dialog: Next you'll be telling us that these beasts have a soul.
dialog: arI
dialog: Of course, they do.
dialog: Attar
dialog: The senator's daughter flirts with blasphemy.
text: Thade and Attar exchange a look. Thade grabs Leo powerfully. Knocking the tray and its food to the floor.
dialog: THADE
dialog: Tell me. Is there a soul inside you?
text: CLOSE ON LEO -- on the floor. He sweeps up the food. EVEN CLOSER: ON A SMALL PRONG the apes use as a fork. Leo slips it into his shirt. Thade pushes Leo away. Holds his HANDS UP with disgust.
speaker_heading: tHADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Quick, a towel. ...
dialog: The guests all laugh at Leo. Ari's had enough. She stands.
dialog: ari
dialog: You're all cruel and petty ... and I've lost my appetite.
dialog: A quiet embarrassment in the room as Ari storms away from the table.
dialog: Sandar seems embarrassed -- he gestures to Thade: 'Go after her.'

dialog: I know how apes 'reason.'
text: BON, Ari's servant, stands meekly behind her. She looks quickly at Tival then bows her head.
dialog: leo
dialog: Is there another way out of the city?
dialog: Ari reacts. Leo can see it in her eyes right away -- she knows something. Krull tries to stop her.
dialog: krull
dialog: Do not get involved with these humans.
dialog: Leo steps closer to Ari -- it unnerves her. He speaks quickly, forcefully.
dialog: leO
dialog: Why did you save me? Why'd you take the chance?

text: CLOSE ON ARI -- her mind racing. They can HEAR the howls of ape patrols echo across the city. Finally, Ari makes her decision.
dialog: ari
dialog: When I was little I found a way to sneak outside the city walls. Where no one could find me. I can lead you there.
dialog: krULL
dialog: If you are caught even your father won't be able to protect you.
dialog: ari
dialog: You know what the soldiers will do to them.
dialog: krULL
dialog: Your Father did not order it.
dialog: ari
dialog: He didn't forbid it, either.
dialog: The old Gorilla cannot refuse her. He looks them over.
dialog: krULL
dialog: This human child cannot survive the journey.
dialog: ARI
dialog: My servant woman will hide her in my house.
text: Gunnar glares at Bon as she steps forward. Ari reaches for the LITTLE HUMAN GIRL. Daena steps back.
text: Daena can't bring herself to let go. Karubi surprises them all by taking the Little Girl from Daena. Karubi hands her to Ari.Bon moves off quickly, disappearing into the shadows.

dialog: widen
dialog: They turn a corner.
dialog: KARUBI'S POV: AT THE FAR END OF THE STREET
dialog: Several DARK SHAPES appear. Krull quickly pulls Ari into the shadows.
dialog: PUNCH IN CLOSE - ATTAR
dialog: Too late. He sees Ari with the humans. Attar lets out a terrible roar.
dialog: krULL
dialog: They've seen us.
dialog: CLOSE ON KARUBI: He touches Daena gently.

dialog: Hurry.
dialog: When she realizes what he's doing --

dialog: ext. in the street - FOLLOWING KARUBI
dialog: Karubi charges forward straight at Attar.
dialog: ON ATTAR
dialog: He flashes his canines at Karubi.
dialog: closer - karubi
text: running through his pain. He grabs a heavy wooden TOOL left by a doorway and wields it like a spear. With a warrior's cry Karubi attacks Attar.
dialog: ATTAR merely puts out his arm to deflect the blow. With dazzling power he hurls Karubi to the ground.
dialog: KARUBI lays stunned for a second. He pushes
dialog: himself to his knees. Looks UP to see Attar standing over him. Ape
dialog: Soldiers encircle him.
dialog: Attar
dialog: Why do you not tremble before me?
text: To Attar's dismay a smile play across Karubi's face as he recalls Leo's words.
dialog: kaRUBI
dialog: I'm done being scared.
text: CLOSE ON ATTAR -- surprised at the heroism of this human. The nobility in Karubi's eyes freezes him. He can't quite bring himself to kill him.

dialog: HIS HANDS.)
dialog: ext. moving through the shadows - same time
text: Leo, Ari, Krull, Daena and the others HEAR the heart-rending last CRY of Karubi. Daena tries to break away to go to him. But Krull stands in her way like a stone wall. Daena struggles ineffectively against his strength. Krull hands her to Leo.

dialog: tHADE
dialog: Where are the other humans?
dialog: atTAR
dialog: This way ... they can't have gone far.
dialog: at the end of the street
text: The soldiers fan out. But there is no sign of the humans. Attar sniffs the air, looks around, surprised.
dialog: attAR (CONT'D)
dialog: They've disappeared.
dialog: thADE
dialog: Ring the city. Block every gate. ... When you find them, kill them all. But keep the troublemaker alive. I must talk to him before he dies.
dialog: Attar hesitates; this is very hard for him to say.
dialog: Attar
dialog: Sir... the Senator's daughter is with them.
dialog: Thade reacts --
dialog: thADE
dialog: They took her?
dialog: attAR
dialog: She is helping them. I saw her myself.
dialog: Thade is thrown by the news -- but he recovers quickly and puts a 'spin' on Ari's involvement.
dialog: thADE
dialog: She had no choice. She was terrified. They threatened her life. I will report the matter to the senate myself.
dialog: (then)
dialog: They'll beat their chests and ask for my help.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: They are weak without you, sir.
dialog: thaDE
dialog: Has she taken the old silverback with her?
dialog: Attar is unhappy about the answer he must give.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: thADE
dialog: I trust that will not be a problem for you.
dialog: Thade stares intensely at Attar.

dialog: SUDDENLY IT SHATTERS. KRULL powers through -- his old body still prodigiously strong compared to humans.
dialog: The humans stop to catch their breaths.
dialog: Last, Ari steps out. She sees Daena, face streaked
dialog: with tears, staggered by her father's death.
dialog: ari
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Your father was a brave man.
dialog: Daena focuses her rage on Ari.
dialog: daENA
dialog: You know nothing about my father.
dialog: Daena flies at Ari. With stunning speed Ari flashes her canines and slaps Daena to the ground.
text: In a moment humans separate from apes. Krull roars and shields Ari -- who's already regretting what she's done.
dialog: Leo helps Daena to her feet.
dialog: daENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let ... me ... go.
dialog: She breaks free of Leo and runs off powerfully into the forest.
dialog: Ari looks back at the city -- and the life she has
dialog: put in jeopardy.
dialog: krULL
dialog: Move quickly ... Thade will be after us.
dialog: Krull turns to close up the TUNNEL DOOR by moving a massive ROCK in its place.
dialog: Ari and Leo run off.
dialog: stay with leo and ari
dialog: leo
dialog: He's no servant.

dialog: BEHIND him: BIRN continues to be his shadow. Birn smiles at Leo. Leo
dialog: doesn't want to deal with him.
dialog: widen
dialog: ARI streaks past them all easily. She looks back to make sure Leo can see her.
dialog: Leo and the other humans stop to catch their breaths. Ari lopes back hardly winded.
dialog: Tival immediately offers her fruit and water.
dialog: Daena and Gunnar watch.
dialog: gunnar
dialog: Look how they pamper her.
dialog: Ari hears them, pushes the food away.
dialog: ari
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: daENA
dialog: Apes are always fine ... as long as you have humans to serve you.
dialog: Leo looks back to see if they're being followed.

dialog: krULL
dialog: If this is some human trick, I will kill you.

dialog: CHAPTER 16: BACK TO THE POD
text: POV -- BURNT TREETOPS MARK A CHARRED TRAJECTORY FROM THE SKY INTO THE FOREST WHERE LEO CRASH LANDED. It's unmistakable that something powerful went into the water.
dialog: leO
dialog: This is where I flew in ...
dialog: ARI AND KRULL are not sure what to make of all this. The others are confused and unsettled by this startling image.
dialog: ari
dialog: You caused this?
dialog: 
dialog: leo
dialog: My retro-burners ...
text: Birn's eyes are wide. Leo's excitement infects him. Gunnar pushes forward to Daena. He won't admit it -- he's spooked.
dialog: guNNAR
dialog: The soldiers will be hunting us. We can still make it to the mountains.
dialog: Daena touches a scarred tree.
dialog: daeNA
dialog: I don't understand. You fell from the sky?
dialog: leo
dialog: With my ass on fire.
dialog: Krull gives Ari a very skeptical look.
dialog: ari
dialog: I'm sure he'll explain everything.
dialog: kruLL
dialog: How can you explain what can't exist?
dialog: LEO
dialog: I'll tell you what 'can't exist.' You. Talking monkeys. This whole place.
dialog: Leo traces a streak of black soot leading deeper into the bog. Krull STOPS Ari from following.
dialog: leO (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: ari
dialog: Apes cannot swim. We will drown in deep water.
dialog: Daena glares at Ari.
dialog: daenA
dialog: That's why we pray for rain every day.
dialog: But Ari follows Leo anyway. Leo spots an OIL SLICK.
dialog: leo
dialog: There's where I went in.
dialog: 
dialog: Before they can react -- Leo DIVES INTO THE BOG AND DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE WATER.
dialog: ON THE BANK: the others wait. No idea what to
dialog: think. Birn stands on the edge. The silence unsettles them. No sign of
dialog: Leo. Finally, Ari looks at Daena --
dialog: ari
dialog: How long can a human hold his breath beneath the water?
dialog: Birn looks at Deana -- Is Leo in trouble? Daena dives in. Ari is taken back by her power and grace in the water.
dialog: EXT. UNDERWATER - FOLLOW DAENA
text: she swims powerfully. Pulls apart a curtain of weeds. REVEALING: THE POD. Daena is amazed. She runs her hand along the surface.
text: PUSH EXTREME CLOSE: THE EMBLEM OF THE OBERON ON THE POD. THE LETTERS 'USAF'. INTO FRAME -- LEO swims OUT of the pod carrying a METALLIC BOX. They turn to swim back.

speaker_heading: LEO (CONT'D)
dialog: How come there's two monkeys down there?
dialog: They all react --
dialog: krULL
dialog: Someone else knows about you.
dialog: CLOSER: LEO URGENTLY UNPACKS THE BOX
dialog: Removes a LAPTOP-SIZED DEVICE. While Leo works to set it up BIRN rummages through the BOX.
text: Out comes: COMPASS, FLARE, MRE'S (FIELD RATIONS), THERMAL BLANKET, CORD, MEDICAL KIT. Birn passes around the supplies; the others examine them, not sure what they're for.
dialog: Gunnar tears open the FIELD RATIONS. The contents spill to the ground.
dialog: Leo's box suddenly SQUAWKS to life. The humans
dialog: jump back.
dialog: ari
dialog: What is it?
dialog: leo
dialog: It's called a 'Messenger'...it keeps an open frequency with my ship so I can talk to them.
dialog: ari
dialog: It can 'talk'?
dialog: leo
dialog: With radio waves.
dialog: (off their confused look)
dialog: Invisible energy that floats all around us.
dialog: krULL
dialog: This is sorcery.
dialog: LEO
dialog: Not sorcery, science. ... I just have to monkey with it a little.
dialog: Ari and Krull react.
dialog: A LOUD PIERCING TONE startles them all. Ari and
dialog: Krull cover their ears. Leo is electrified.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)
dialog: Contact.
text: Birn creeps forward to peek at the machine. ON THE 'MESSENGER' SCREEN: a digital SWEEP shows Leo's POSITION and the POSITION of the responding beacon. Leo's face lights up brightly.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus. They're already here.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE ON ARI -- amazed.
dialog: daENA
dialog: You'd better warn them about the apes.
dialog: leo
dialog: Better warn the apes about them. We're in control now. We're the 800-pound gorilla.

dialog: It's time you told us the truth. ... Who are you?
dialog: CHAPTER 17: LIMBO INTERVENES
dialog: PUSH IN CLOSE ON LEO AS HE TURNS TO THEM --

dialog: birn
dialog: Is it far?
dialog: leo
dialog: Past any star you can see at night.
dialog: An impossible concept. CLOSE ON ARI: her look reveals how much Leo has taken hold of her imagination.
dialog: tival
dialog: Your apes permit you to fly?
dialog: leo
dialog: Our apes live in zoo's... They do what we tell them. ...
dialog: Leo quickly closes up the Messenger.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)

dialog: leo
dialog: (re:gun)
dialog: You saw what it did to the tree.
text: Limbo's men are as loyal as he is honest; they disappear into the trees. Limbo freezes. Gives a meek smile. Quickly helps Birn to his feet.

dialog: You're not hurt. You're young...

dialog: ext. ape enCAMPMENT - night
dialog: Brightly colored tents billow in the wind off the river.
dialog: by a campfire - a group of ape soldiers
dialog: are gambling. ONE APE throws down a large PLAYING CARD.
dialog: INSERT PLAYING CARD: THE FIGURES ARE APES IN ANCIENT COSTUMES
dialog: FIRST ape soldier
dialog: Semos smiles on me. I win again.
text: He reaches for the pot. A SECOND APE SOLDIER stops his arm.
dialog: second ape soldier
dialog: You win too often. What have you hidden up your sleeve?
text: It immediately gets tense. The FIRST SOLDIER pulls back the sleeves of his uniform. One hand, the other hand. Grins -- nothing there. Reaches for the pot again. He's stopped again.
speaker_heading: second aPE SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: All of them...
text: He forces back one pant leg. Nothing in that foot. Tries the other. PUNCH IN CLOSE: THE FIRST APE HOLDS A CARD WITH HIS FOOT.
speaker_heading: second aPE SOLDIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Cheater!
text: He knocks the soldier back. In a second they start to fight. A LOUD GROWL MAKES THEM STOP. They turn to see --
dialog: attar on horseback
text: having just come into camp. He has clearly covered a great distance. He rides right up to them and kicks over the cards. The soldiers jump to their feet.
dialog: attar (o.s.)
dialog: Who is in charge here?
dialog: ANGLE: Rushing out of a TENT: the APE COMMANDER, quickly buttoning his uniform.
dialog: ape commander
dialog: I am, sir. ... They didn't tell me you were coming.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: This camp is a disgrace.
dialog: The Commander is terrified. Attar dismounts.
speaker_heading: ATTAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Some humans have escaped.
dialog: apE COMMANDER
dialog: If they come this way we'll crush them.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: These humans are different. They travel with apes.
dialog: The Ape Commander hesitates, then laughs --
dialog: atTAR (CONT'D)
dialog: You find this amusing?
dialog: apE COMMANDER
dialog: (stops)
dialog: No, sir.
dialog: Attar looks around at the mountains.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: I'm assuming command. I will personally make sure this camp is prepared.

dialog: CHAPTER 21: FIRE AND WATER
dialog: ext. horse pen - night
text: Leo holds a DUN COLORED STALLION. They watch him grab a fistful of mane and hop on. The humans are all amazed. Leo wheels the horse round.
dialog: leo
dialog: Who's next?
dialog: The others hang back. Too afraid to join him.
dialog: leo (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I guess we're saying good-bye here.
dialog: Ari takes a hesitant step forward.
dialog: daENA
dialog: You can't go, you're afraid of water.
dialog: arI
dialog: You can't go, you're afraid of horses.
dialog: Leo rides between them.
dialog: leo
dialog: (to Daena)
dialog: You want to ride? Grab a fistful of mane and hold on.
dialog: (to Ari)
dialog: You want to cross the river? Horses are great swimmers. They'll carry you across. ...
dialog: KRULL APPEARS OUT OF THE DARKNESS.
dialog: krull
dialog: You're assuming the soldiers won't tear you to pieces. ... I've just seen Thade's greatest warrior ride into the camp.
dialog: leo
dialog: Sounds like he scares you.
dialog: krULL
dialog: He does. I trained him myself.
dialog: limBO
dialog: Well, good luck, have a pleasant ride. Obviously, I can't go... so if you don't mind ...
dialog: He holds out his shackles. Leo surprises everyone by unlocking them.
dialog: daENA
dialog: You're letting him go?
dialog: The shackles fall -- Limbo sighs, rubs his wrists.
dialog: Leo
dialog: No. He'll ride with us.
dialog: LIMBO
dialog: There is no way...
dialog: ARI
dialog: (over)
dialog: And if you try to get away, I will tell Thade we bribed you to help us.
dialog: limbo
dialog: I'll deny it.
dialog: KRULL
dialog: A very large bribe.
dialog: Ari and Krull grin at him. Limbo explodes.
dialog: limbO
dialog: The whole thing's suicide. Ride through an army encampment? Only a human would think this could work.
dialog: lEO
dialog: Attitude is the first human freedom.
dialog: Leo reaches into the Messenger Box, takes out the FLARE GUN.
dialog: ext. ape encampment - night
dialog: close on an altar - inside a tent
text: kneeling on a small woven tapestry. Eyes closed. Candles illuminate a small ICON of SEMOS emerging out of PARTING CLOUDS. Attar waves his hands over the smoke. Bows his head.
text: A LOUD WHOOSH -- and the tent is bathed in LIGHT. Attar OPENS his eyes.
dialog: ext. tent - around the camP
dialog: Attar rushes out to see the soldiers staring at the sky.
dialog: IN THE SKY - A BLINDING LIGHT
text: Actually, an Army FLARE, raining down on them. CLOSE ON ATTAR -- he cocks an ear -- listening intently.
dialog: OVER HIS SHOULDER: STAMPEDING INTO VIEW -- HORSES
text: CLOSER -- Leo leads the group. Birn and Daena right behind. Tival, Gunnar, then Krull and Ari. Finally, Limbo -- holding on for dear life.
dialog: widen
text: Leo has let the extra horses run with them. The Apes dive out of the way as the horses stampede THROUGH THEM. Tents are pulled down. Equipment crushed. The sheer arrogance of Leo's maneuver leaves Attar stunned.
dialog: CLOSE ON LIMBO
text: as he rides holding on tightly. He kicks the horse so it veers away towards the APE SOLDIERS.
dialog: limbo
dialog: Help, help. Don't hurt me. I'm on your side.
text: But to Limbo's surprise the APE SOLDIERS answer with a barrage of FIREBALLS. One nicks Limbo's arm. Limbo is stunned. An APE SOLDIER charges Limbo with a spear. Limbo can't get his horse to move.
dialog: INTO FRAME -- LEO whacks Limbo's horse. It carries Limbo to the river.
text: Leo leans down to grab a BURNING LOG and ignites one of the APE TENTS. The fire spreads like dry grass. Whipped by the wind. ONE APE runs out of a tent with his FUR ON FIRE.
dialog: Leo charges for the river.
dialog: EXT. THE river - night (continuous)
dialog: Deep and wide.
dialog: PAN UP TO -- the HORSES REFLECTED IN THE WATER.
dialog: leo
dialog: Drive them across!
text: Daena feels the power of her horse as it splashes into the water. Birn has a big smile on his face as his horse lunges through the river. Tival grips the mane tightly as his horse goes in. Finally, Krull's horse carries him in.
dialog: EXT. APE ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: FIND ARI -- lagging far behind. Her eyes wide with terror. Using all her will to fight the panic building up inside.
dialog: ATTAR -- sees Ari.
dialog: WIDEN
text: Before Ari reaches the river Attar hurls his Bola -- it wraps around the horse's front feet and brings it down. Ari flies off rolling across the ground.
dialog: LEO sees Ari fall. He turns his horse and races for her.
dialog: EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS
text: Daena, Birn, Gunnar and Tival emerge on the opposite bank. KRULL appears behind them. He falls from the horse. Looks for Ari. Runs back to the water's edge.
dialog: pov - on the other side
text: Krull can see Ari head for the rocks. She starts to climb. The apes are moving out of camp towards her. Krull is enraged he can't protect her. Let's out a fierce roar.
dialog: CLOSE ON ATTAR -- he HEARS Krull. They lock eyes across the river. It makes Attar hesitate for just one moment.
dialog: find leo
text: He rides for the rocks and leaps from his horse. Scrambles up to Ari. Grabs her hand.
dialog: leo
dialog: You have to swim.
dialog: Ari can't bring herself to enter the river. Her instinctual aversion is just too strong. Her eyes are wide with terror.
dialog: LEO'S POV: rushing out of the night all he can see is Attar's eyes.
dialog: ari
dialog: I can't.
dialog: leo
dialog: I won't let go of you.
text: Attar arrives just as ARI AND LEO LEAP OFF THE ROCKS INTO THE RIVER and DISAPPEAR beneath the dark water.
dialog: The apes hurl fireballs after them but they only hiss and turn to steam in the river.
dialog: ext. across the river - night
text: Krull is still at the water's edge when Ari's HORSE emerges riderless. Krull is shaken to the core.
text: Finally, Limbo rides up. Falls to the ground soggy and miserable. Still reeling. He looks at the small burn on his fur. Whimpers as he licks it.
dialog: Gunnar comes up with the shackles.
dialog: limbo
dialog: No, no, wait, there's no need now.
dialog: gunnar
dialog: Says who?
dialog: Limbo gestures angrily across the water.
dialog: limbo
dialog: Says them. They tried to kill me...
dialog: (touches his wound again)
dialog: ... like I was nothing but a miserable...
dialog: daENA
dialog: Human?
dialog: guNNAR
dialog: He's a liar and a coward.
dialog: PUSH IN ECU ON LIMBO -- he's too smart not to understand what this all means. His usual bravado melts away.
dialog: limbo
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Please, I've nowhere else to go.
dialog: Tival steps in front of Gunnar, helps Limbo to his feet.
dialog: tival
dialog: Then you belong with us.
dialog: GUNNAR
dialog: We're the only ones who made it. I say we should to stick to our own kind.
dialog: Daena isn't sure what to do. She gives way to her doubts. Looks at Krull.
dialog: daeNA
dialog: It's no use. Nothing will ever change.
dialog: Birn suddenly sprints towards the water. They all turn --
dialog: EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS - angle - staggering out of the river
dialog: Leo carries Ari on his back. Ari's claws dig tightly into his shoulder.
dialog: It is a potent vision that contradicts the core reality of their planet -- and their races.
dialog: HOLD ON DAENA'S reaction as the others rush down to help them. Leo sets Ari on the ground.
dialog: Krull takes Ari's hand. She knows how worried he was about her. She strokes his fur, comforting him.
dialog: angle
dialog: Daena pushes through to Leo. Looks at his shoulders. Ari's claws have left deep cuts.
dialog: daENA
dialog: She hurt you.
dialog: Daena slaps a clump of wet leaves on the wounds.
dialog: leo
dialog: She was holding on pretty tight.
dialog: She begins to rub his shoulders. Slowly, deeply.
dialog: daENA
dialog: I know. I've seen the way she looks at you.
dialog: leo
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: She's a chimpanzee.
dialog: daENA
dialog: A female chimpanzee.
dialog: Leo is freaked out by the conversation. Daena rubs harder.
dialog: leo
dialog: Ow...
dialog: daENA
dialog: These are Goma leaves.
dialog: leo
dialog: And they're supposed to help?
dialog: Now she's really working the shoulder.
dialog: DAENA
dialog: First your body will tingle, then you'll feel very dizzy...
dialog: Leo looks at her confused.
speaker_heading: dAENA (CONT'D)
dialog: ... and if you don't start growing fur everywhere ... you'll be healed.
text: CLOSE ON LEO -- as he realizes she's been teasing him. Daena laughs, and the other humans join in. Leo knows the joke's on him. Leo and Daena look at each other. She has a wickedly defiant look on her face.
text: PAN ACROSS TO ARI -- who reacts to their intimacy. She gets up quickly. Bounds across to them.
dialog: ari
dialog: The apes will head down river til they find a crossing. We should keep moving.
dialog: Leo stands. Daena locks eyes with Ari.
dialog: daena
dialog: You've recovered quickly.
dialog: Tival signals Leo; points to the cliffs.

scene_heading: ATTAR STANDS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE HEADQUARTERS. THADE ENTERS FROM INSIDE. THEY WALK AND TALK:
dialog: thaDE
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: Attar is ashamed to look at Thade.
dialog: attAR
dialog: They crossed the river.
dialog: Thade's voice is quiet, intense.
dialog: thADE
dialog: You didn't stop them?
dialog: attAR
dialog: They were carried by horses.
text: Attar can hardly bear the silence while Thade glares at him. It seems an eternity -- until Thade finally speaks, his anger now building.
dialog: thADE
dialog: Horses?
dialog: Attar
dialog: Yes, sir. Our horses.
text: WE SEE THADE'S ESSENTIAL APE NATURE TAKE OVER. HE MOVES QUICKLY, LEAPING UP THE WALLS, PULLING DOWN TAPESTRIES, SWINGING UP TO THE OVERHEAD CHANDELIER.
text: HE DRAWS HIS SWORD, AND WITH ONE FORCEFUL MOVE. CUTS DOWN THE CHANDELIER. IT CRASHES TO THE GROUND CARRYING THADE DOWN WITH IT AND BURSTS INTO FLAMES.
dialog: THADE MOVES THROUGH THE FLAMES AND MOUNTS HIS HORSE. HE TURNS TOWARD ATTAR, TAKES A BREATH, CALMS HIMSELF.
dialog: Thade looks into Attar's eyes. His rage melts as quickly as it came on.
dialog: thaDE
dialog: Forgive me? I'm not angry at you. ... My father has been taken from me.
dialog: He embraces Attar emotionally. Attar consoles him.
dialog: atTAR
dialog: He was a great leader. ... Your family are direct descendents of Semos. Now it is time for you to lead.
dialog: Thade looks at Attar -- steadfast, loyal as always, then composes himself.

dialog: No question, he's army. I know the type.

dialog: You'd never be able to go home again.

dialog: pan across - DAENA is WATCHing THEM
text: as she sits with the other humans grabbing food, shoving it to their mouths as quickly as they can. Daena watches Ari break her food into small pieces; it seems refined, elegant.
dialog: Daena looks down at her hand. Drops her food. Breaks off one small bit. Mimics Ari.
dialog: tival

dialog: thADE
dialog: A trade?... That's what you're proposing. Yourself for the humans. ... Even when you were young you took in stray humans. Your family always indulged your every whim.
dialog: Thade reaches out -- Ari tenses. Thade picks a fleck of dirt from her fur.
dialog: thADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now look at what you've become.
dialog: Ari knows this is her last chance. She has nothing else to offer; so she falls to an ape pose of submissiveness.

dialog: CLOSE ON ATTAR -- as he whispers a single word.
dialog: atTAR

dialog: Can it be true?
dialog: thADE
dialog: They'd make us their slaves. ... Bring me the gun.
