scene_heading: INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: You seemed to have trouble last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Let me just set the record straight
dialog: about last night. Hurting my mother
dialog: was a mistake and I hate myself for
dialog: it, and I hate my illness and I
dialog: want to control it. My father, on
dialog: the other hand, had no trouble
dialog: slapping the shit out of me last
dialog: night, which I did not return
dialog: `cause I could've killed him and I
text: didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
dialog: You don't think I could've beat the
dialog: shit out of him? I mean....
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: He was scared for your mother and
dialog: you hurt him as well.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?
dialog: And I think he probably just tried
dialog: to do his best.
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Pat, you have to have a strategy. I
dialog: told you earlier. You need to
dialog: recognize these feelings coming to
dialog: you, otherwise you will be sent
dialog: back to Baltimore. So when you get
dialog: these feelings, you need to get to
dialog: a quieter place, and be at peace
dialog: with yourself, however you can.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yeah, but that's easier said than
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: You have to do it. You have no
dialog: choice. Excelsior.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a
dialog: letter I want you to give Nikki,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Why?
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Because you have a restraining
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: PAT
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: What good are you, man?
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Why did you have this overwhelming
dialog: urgency to see your wedding video
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Oh, I don't know, because I'm
dialog: married and I haven't seen my wife
dialog: in eight and a half months?
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Maybe you think that Nikki's not
dialog: around and Tiffany's an attractive
dialog: girl and if you get drawn towards
dialog: Tiffany, you will spoil your
dialog: chances of getting Nikki back to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't
dialog: think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki
dialog: because Tiffany's a slut.
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Why is she a slut?
speaker_heading: PAT
text: After the dinner at Ronnie's, she
dialog: said, quote, "We can go to the back
dialog: house and you can fuck me as long
dialog: as we turn the lights out."
dialog: Unquote. And she still wears her
dialog: wedding ring. So she's a loyal,
dialog: married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Maybe she just needs a friend and
dialog: she thought if she offers you sex,
dialog: it will be easier for you to become
text: friends with her.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: She said she's not a whore anymore,
dialog: but she likes that part of herself
dialog: along with all the other parts of
dialog: herself and can I say the same?
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Can you?
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Is that....? You're asking me,
dialog: you're really asking me that
dialog: question?
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: With all my crazy sad shit? What,
dialog: are you fucking nuts?
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Pat, the silver lining thing is
dialog: yours. I'm just giving back your
dialog: words to you. This "crazy sad
dialog: shit," as you call it, made you a
dialog: happier, calmer person with a
dialog: beautiful positive philosophy of
dialog: going outdoors, working out, and
dialog: reading books.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: No, not the books.
speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: You said Nikki's friends with
dialog: Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
dialog: you become friends with Tiffany,
dialog: Nikki will think that you're a
dialog: kind, generous, large-hearted
dialog: person, who helps people in need,
dialog: who is basically thriving. So if
dialog: you help Tiffany, it will be good
dialog: for you.

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I wouldn't actually call the

speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: And the so-called incident with the

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yeah. That was a thing with my

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: But you would do it?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I'd have to be careful. I'm already

speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: She told you what to do?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I
dialog: talked like this. Made me feel like
dialog: such a pervert. Maybe we should
dialog: change the subject.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I don't mind it.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: You don't, do you.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: No. But then people were getting
text: into fights in the parking lot at
dialog: work, and in the bathroom...and the
dialog: boss called me in to his office and
dialog: tried to pin it all on me. So I
dialog: accused him of harassment and then
dialog: they fired me, sent me home and put
dialog: me on some meds.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I get it. The song that was playing
dialog: when my wife...was in the shower
dialog: with the history teacher...
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I heard about that.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: ...it was my wedding song and when
dialog: I hear it, I go kinda crazy.
dialog: Sometimes I hear it when it's not
dialog: even playing.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yeah. So they put me on medication,
dialog: which I feel ashamed of.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: So I know.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: You do.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I just gotta get a strategy, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: We'd better get back to the letter.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: What if you told Nikki when
dialog: Veronica was in the bathroom?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Yes. Yes, that could work. I love
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PAT

speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I kinda got that feeling, yeah.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a
dialog: test. How did I do? I think I did
dialog: pretty well.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Yeah, she said you were cool,

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: "Basically"? Was I some percentage
dialog: not cool?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: No, she said you were cool, but you

speaker_heading: TIFFANY

speaker_heading: TIFFANY

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: "Sort of like you"? I hope to God
dialog: she didn't tell Nikki that.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Because, it's just not right,

dialog: like that. Especially after all the
dialog: shit you just told me.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: You think that I'm crazier than

speaker_heading: ROMANTIC-
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: -and that maybe in the future if

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Can we do something else besides

speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I'm good with a hammer. You want me
dialog: to fix something?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: A deal is a deal.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I know. Okay. I was just suggesting
dialog: that maybe there's a better
dialog: scenario.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Why don't you walk towards me like
dialog: I'm Nikki. And the only way to
dialog: convey how much you've missed me is
dialog: by your walk. By your slow walk.
dialog: You can't talk.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I'm not doing it.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Only walk. Do it.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: No. That's stupid.

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: We were married for three years and
dialog: five days, and I loved him. But for
dialog: the last couple months, I just
dialog: wasn't into sex at all. It just
dialog: felt like we were so different and
dialog: I was depressed. Some of that is
dialog: just me, some of it was he wanted
dialog: me to have kids and I have a hard
dialog: enough time taking care of myself.
dialog: I don't think that makes me a
dialog: criminal. Anyway one night after
dialog: dinner, he drove to Victoria's
dialog: Secret at King of Prussia Mall and
dialog: got some lingerie to get something
dialog: going. And on the way back, he
dialog: stopped on 76 to help a guy with a
text: flat tire and he got hit by a car
dialog: and killed. And the Victoria's
text: Secret box was still in the front
dialog: seat. (pause) That's a feeling.

speaker_heading: PAT

dialog: This gives us a chance to

dialog: restraining order until I feel
dialog: safe. I must admit you sound
dialog: terrific and I'm happy that you are
dialog: feeling so positive and becoming a
dialog: more loving and caring man, which I
dialog: always knew you were. I was moved
dialog: to read about `Excelsior' and your
dialog: belief in happy endings. I am also
dialog: moved by your act of love to read
dialog: the books I have taught at the high
dialog: school. I'm sorry you find them so
dialog: negative, but I disagree. I think
dialog: they are great works of art that
dialog: reflect how hard life can be and
dialog: they can also help kids prepare
dialog: themselves for the hardness of
dialog: life. In spite of all these
dialog: positive developments, Pat, I have
dialog: to say if it's me reading the

dialog: prove you are ready to resume our

dialog: thinking that we might both be

speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: PAT SR.

dialog: Be quiet, shut up. You already did
dialog: enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do
dialog: you say? My birds, Benjamin

speaker_heading: DOLORES

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: PAT SR.

dialog: Even with the ten points I give

dialog: coward, you won't take the ten.
dialog: Plus, are you listening, plus
dialog: whatever their score is at the
dialog: dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's
dialog: that? Tiffany, what's that?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: What? No, no, no, no.
speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: They go by the Philadelphia rules.
dialog: Each dancer is scored on a scale of

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Okay, score is from one to ten,
dialog: right? And you guys are how good?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: We suck.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: And how are the people you're

text: Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
speaker_heading: PAT

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: A lot better. So if I was to say

dialog: would be really very generous,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: No, no, that would be amazing if we
dialog: got five. Let's not get away--
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Oh, come on, we can get a five out

speaker_heading: DR. PATEL
dialog: Will somebody please explain to me

speaker_heading: RONNIE
