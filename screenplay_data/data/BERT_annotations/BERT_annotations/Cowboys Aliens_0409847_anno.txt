speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
text: SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE:
scene_heading: 1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
text: We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
text: Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...
scene_heading: A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
text: Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
text: a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
text: A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
text: beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
text: A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
text: baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
dialog: But.
text: The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
text: LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
text: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!
text: THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND
text: HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts
text: to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
text: Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
text: superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
text: WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
text: And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE
text: DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING
text: FLEEING PEOPLE.
text: Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
text: open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
text: faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
text: THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
text: baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:
dialog: C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY
text: burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
text: Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
text: We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
text: MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
text: COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
text: the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
text: .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
text: this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
text: A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
dialog: surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
text: And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
dialog: shield his eyes... but STOFS:
text: A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
text: beautiful. SMILING.
dialog: The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
text: The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
text: toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.
text: THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
text: THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
text: Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --
speaker_heading: WES CLAIBORNE
dialog: Howdy.
speaker_heading: (NO RESPONSE)
dialog: We're riding towards Absolution. You
dialog: know how far west we are?
dialog: The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.
speaker_heading: LUKE CLAIBORNE
dialog: Maybe he's a dummy.
text: Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --
speaker_heading: WES CLAIBORNE
dialog: There a reason you don't wanna answer my
dialog: question, friend?
text: And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --
speaker_heading: MOSE CLAIBORNE
dialog: Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
text: he's been shot.
speaker_heading: LUKE CLAIBORNE
dialog: Bet he's a chain jumper.
text: Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
dialog: Let's bring him with us.
text: Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
text: scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --
speaker_heading: WES CLAIBORNE
dialog: Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
text: round and start walking.
text: But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
text: steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --
speaker_heading: WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dead or alive, no difference. I said
speaker_heading: WALK OR--
text: THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
text: forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
text: MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
text: As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
text: SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
text: Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
text: his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:
speaker_heading: LUKE CLAIBORNE
dialog: -- P-please, God -- d-don't --
text: -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
text: Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
dialog: knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
dialog: This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
text: seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
text: his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
text: The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
text: on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
text: it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --
scene_heading: "TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY
scene_heading: OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP
scene_heading: -- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP"
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: (a hoarse whisper)
dialog: Absolution...
scene_heading: SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
text: With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
text: third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
text: sees the dog following...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Get outta here. Leave me alone.
text: But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
text: turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
text: VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
text: A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
text: Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
text: dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
text: His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
text: looks at the dog and says --
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: Stay.
text: The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
text: moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
text: uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
text: then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
dialog: Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Palms to heaven, Friend.
text: The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: Been shot.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Only two kinds of men get shot --
dialog: criminals and victims.
dialog: (steps forward; hard)
dialog: Which one're you?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: don't know.
text: Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
text: he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Got a name, son?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: Don't know that either.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: What do you know?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: (a beat; then)
dialog: ... English.
dialog: Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER
text: A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
text: Meacham's studying The Man's wound:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
text: Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
dialog: (off The Man's look)
dialog: Means somethin' burned it half closed.
text: The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
text: over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
text: twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
text: strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
dialog: The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
text: Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Try'n hold still.
text: He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
text: slightly, but bears the pain.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd you ride in from?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
text: West. Woke up in the desert.
dialog: Looking up at the sun like I'd been
dialog: dropped outta the sky.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Seems I remember a story about that
dialog: happening once... fella by the name of
dialog: Lucifer.
speaker_heading: (GRINS)
dialog: How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for
dialog: short.
text: But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
text: his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: That blood yours or somebody else's?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
text: Three men rode up. Drew on me.
speaker_heading: (STILL CONFUSED)
dialog: My hands... moved on their own.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: Anything else you wanna confess to while
dialog: you got my attention?
dialog: And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: Everything that happened before I woke
dialog: up...
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: It's gone.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
dialog: your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
dialog: bein' said...
text: Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
dialog: brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I seen bad men do good things and good
dialog: men do bad things. Whether you end up in
dialog: heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
dialog: it's yours.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You just got to remember what it was.
dialog: The Man considers. Darkly --
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: What if I don't want to remember?
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
speaker_heading: (BEAT; GRINS)
dialog: Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
text: On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
text: MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
text: the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
dialog: confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!
text: WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see
text: A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Their leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard --
text: he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE --
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER! ONLY
text: CLAIM TO LAND AROUND HERE'S THE ONE WITH
dialog: HiS NAME ON IT!
text: The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another
dialog: Molotov, aiming for the SALOON --
text: But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: Percy! N2t the saloon!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why the goddamn hell not?!
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: Cause your dady said so.
text: Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES
text: -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
text: OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:
scene_heading: INT. MEACHAN'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple
text: blankets as he moves past The Man --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: You wanna help or are you just gonna
dialog: stand there and burn?!
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - PORCH - CONTINUOUS
text: FRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church,
text: Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: All right, folks -- don't panic! Get
dialog: inside and you'll be fine... C'mon...
text: Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the
text: street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Put it out before it gets goin'!
text: ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire
text: brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --
speaker_heading: THE GENERAL STORE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the
text: roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps:
text: A KID. 11. Rough n' tumble. And right now, mouth full of
text: LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS:
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Just tryin' to save the candy.
dialog: (SWALLOWS, worried now)
dialog: You one of my Pa's hired guns?
text: Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
text: He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Who the hell're yam?
dialog: Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Nobody is right. You think you can just
dialog: collect your fifty dollars and ride off?
dialog: You signed up for the wrong side, boy.
text: The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
speaker_heading: PERCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell you what. You get down on your
text: knees and kiss my boot.
text: The Man's eyes narrow --
speaker_heading: PERCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You do that and I'll let you run back to
dialog: wherever the hell you came from so you
dialog: can tell whoever you see...
dialog: (cocks his gun)
scene_heading: Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: You want me to kiss your boot?
text: Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Tongue's just fine if you're feelin'
dialog: amorous. Don't hold ba --
text: THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick
text: move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE!
text: Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
text: moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Kiss this, you sonofa --
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO (O.S.)
dialog: -- PUT IT DOWN !
text: -- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!!
text: -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a
text: SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Wherever you came from? Go back.
text: Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG
text: MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:
speaker_heading: GREAVEY

speaker_heading: PERCY

text: OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde!
text: SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and
text: handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Emmett -- you all right?
text: The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly:
dialog:

speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Pardon my boy, mister. He can be
dialog: excitable.
dialog: (puts out his hand)
dialog: Kyle Taggart.
text: The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: . Luke.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of
dialog: fifty dollars, actually.
dialog: (off The Man's look)
dialog: Our advert? The telegram?
dialog: The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
dialog: Could use a man like you in case any of
dialog: 'em come back...
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: -- I'm just passing through.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Fair enough. You don't mind spending the
dialog: night, bank opens in the morning... I'll
dialog: get you your money then.
dialog: (nods down the street)
dialog: Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria
dialog: I sent you.
text: The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns
text: to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
dialog: You here with the prospector woman?
text: The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: woman?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Yup. Real looker. Came into town

text: ON THE MAN. His first real LEAD.
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: Maybe.
text: And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense
dialog: tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...
speaker_heading: DEPUTY WADE
dialog: Somethin' wrong, Kyle?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: What's that French sayin' where you swear
dialog: you seen someone before?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY WADE
dialog: Don't speak French.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: No... you sure's hell don't.
text: Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CATTLE RANGE - MAGIC HOUR
text: 300 head of CATTLE under a blood red sky -- BOOM DOWN to THREE
text: RANCH HANDS by a fire. One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE;
text: call him ROY CLANTON. The other two trade glances, nervous:
speaker_heading: RANCH HAND #1
dialog: Should take it easy there, Pal --
speaker_heading: RANCH HAND #2
dialog: Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink

speaker_heading: ROY CLANTON

dialog: (rises; grabs his
speaker_heading: CROTCH)
dialog: Gotta see a man about a buffalo...
text: He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More
text: THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and --
text: A COW'S PULLED INTO THE AIR BEHIND THEM BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE,
text: JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING! Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of
text: FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:
speaker_heading: RANCH HAND #1
dialog: You hear that?
speaker_heading: RANCH HAND #2
dialog: Hear what?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
text: ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER.
text: MANY OF THE SWSSHS. The men slowly turn toward the sound as --
text: ALL AT ONCE, HUNDREDS OF COWS FLY OFF INTO THE SKY!
speaker_heading: RANCH HAND #1
dialog: SWEET JESUS!!!
text: THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN
text: SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND --
text: ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his
text: pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE. So are
text: the COWS. PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.
scene_heading: INT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT
text: THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the

text: She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The
text: Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: We have customers.
text: And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the
text: back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!!
text: Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
text: The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:
speaker_heading: ATTICUS
dialog: That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who
dialog: took out Percy Dolarhyde.
text: Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before
text: sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria
text: rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: I'm looking for a woman.
text: She gestures to the WHORES --
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What kind?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: This kind.
text: He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Never seen her before. But she is

dialog: (pours him whiskey; then
dialog: one for herself)
dialog: Here's to you finding her, Senor.
text: ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK
text: glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:
speaker_heading: MARIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You have any idea what kind of mess you
dialog: just stepped into?
scene_heading: THE MAN IN BLACK
dialog: No. But I figured I'd be safe in here
dialog: seein' as how that boy I tossed off his

text: Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then:

text: HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Everyone inside! GO GO GO!!
text: Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --
scene_heading: EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: JAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But
text: reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing
text: it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ."
text: Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's
text: incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it
speaker_heading: CRASHES INTO:
scene_heading: INT. MEACHAM'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
text: The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL
text: breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER --
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS
text: As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT --
text: disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS
text: UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens.
text: ... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT
text: SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears...
dialog: And all... is... STILL.
text: As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN
text: SUCKED INTO THE SKY.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
text: From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the
scene_heading: cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What
dialog: just...?
text: MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones.
text: JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down
text: to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are
text: the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Who the hell're ?
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: He's the one who caged Percy.
text: Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: -- why're you asking m&amp;?!
text: Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: This! Where'd you get this?! It was
dialog: shooting the same light beams they were --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Let go of my wrist.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you
dialog: tell me what the he--
text: KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the
text: church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out
text: of the church stumbles...
text: AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted --
text: limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
text: Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES:
text: WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---
scene_heading: SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO --
text: ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE
text: then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE
text: DIRT. Holy SHIT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
text: Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by
text: SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She
text: EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
text: converge around the corpse:
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Is it... dead?
text: Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: . The hell j,,a it?
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (O.S.)
dialog: A demon.
text: They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Revelations 16:14: "For there are
dialog: spirits of demons, showing signs."
dialog: (points to the alien)
text: Escaped from hell itself.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those
dialog: bracelet things too!
text: Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
text: ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as
text: EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
text: What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado
text: bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: I think... it's comin' from somewhere
text: inside it.
text: People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near-
text: hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
dialog: more BRAVADO than actual courage:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Only one way to find out. We need to cut
text: it open.
speaker_heading: (TO DOC)
dialog: You're a doctor. Got a bone saw?
text: DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: . Are you... serious?
dialog: (looks to them all)
dialog: WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Wake u Those things took your wife --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I KNOW THAT!!
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Well this one here's our only chance of
dialog: findin' where they went.
text: That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the
text: thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...
speaker_heading: DOLLARHYDE
dialog: So you got a bone saw or don't you?
scene_heading: INT. GOLD LBAP SALOON - DAY
text: THUD! The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and
text: Meacham. As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings
text: -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Stay outside. You're not welcome in
dialog: here!
text: Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --
speaker_heading: DOLARRYDE
dialog: I own more of this town than any man in
dialog: it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn
dialog: please. And for the record? You ain't
dialog: welcome in my country, Mexican.
text: Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Whatever troubles you had don't mean a
dialog: damn thing against the ones we got now.
dialog: We wanna see our way through 'em, your
dialog: guns better start pointing in the same
dialog: direction, Goddammit.
text: Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS.
text: Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE.
text: Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
text: muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
text: his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE
text: SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
text: SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
dialog: Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open... am
dialog: I going to burn for it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
text: Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: That should cover ya.
text: ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning
text: blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Excuse me.
text: B GH! He PUKES on the ground.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Jesus, Doc!!!
text: Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: This is not normal. I'm entitled to
dialog: vomit. We should XU be vomiting.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Just cut, Lardass.
text: Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --
scene_heading: VRRRRZ -- CUTS THROUGH THE STERNUM -- ORANGE BLOOD SPRAYING --
text: and... SHUNK! Doc looks up at Jake, gestures to the carcass:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Senor? A hand?
speaker_heading: (TO DOLARHYDE)
dialog: You too, maricon.
text: The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
text: Everyone turns away, scowling, Emmett wafting the air:
speaker_heading: EMMETT
text: Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Emmett.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Sorry, Father.
text: Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Chet wall's partially collapsed... no
dialog: familiar organs of any kind...
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: 'course they're not familiar. Just look
dialog: at this th--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN
dialog: Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws
text: from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
text: alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Spinal reflex.
text: And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
text: Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Something on your neck. Hold still.
text: Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
text: and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be damned... gold.
text: They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath
dialog: 'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: Down here too.
dialog: (looks to Dolar)
dialog: This much ore... could only have come
text: from a digging in a mine.
text: That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up
text: to see Jake READING her in this moment.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
text: In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in
text: time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Gimme my scalpel.
text: In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he
text: pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
text: dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
text: -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the
text: light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion.
text: Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Nothing, just pulled it off --
text: He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: Only works when it's touching the
dialog: creature.
text: Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: I think... it's a compass. Look:
dialog: (fiddles with tweezers)
dialog: No matter how you move it, it points in
dialog: the same direction.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
text: Compasses point north. That's west.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: (realizing; to Jake)
dialog: West's where 141 came from.
text: ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: If you're right, what's it pointing to?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: The rest of 'em.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Be my guess.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Then that's where I'm goin'.
text: He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: One of my ranchers said my herd
dialog: disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten
dialog: minutes ago, I figured him for a liar.
dialog: (SNAPS barrel closed)
dialog: Nobody takes my cattle.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Your b was taken too.
dialog: A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION?
text: But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: I noticed.
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: What if they're already dead?
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: They're not dead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Kid's right. If all they wanted was to
dialog: kill us, they would've.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Looked to me like... they were ropin'
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Means they need 'em for something.
dialog: Whatever it is, we can either stand here
dialog: guessin'... or go find out.
text: His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks
text: at each other, working up the courage to face what they know
text: they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: If she's alive -- if there's even a
speaker_heading: CHANCE --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Lord hates a coward... but our bullets
dialog: were useless against those things. Other
dialog: than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and
dialog: outnumbered.
text: As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has
text: been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy
text: to potential savior in a heartbeat.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You got everything to do with it. If you
dialog: can remember where you got that thing --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I remember you all wantin' me on the end
dialog: of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin'
dialog: here's got nothin' to do with me.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You sure. about that?
text: He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay
dialog: to debate it -- turns to go --
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Mr. Lonergan? Sir?
text: The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.
speaker_heading: EMMETT (CONT'D)
dialog: My mother died last year. My Paw... he's
dialog: all I got.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
text: And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere
dialog: near you, your Pa... or anyone else in
dialog: this goddamned town.
text: OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:
scene_heading: EXT. SALOON - NIGHT
text: Jake moves FAST past blown-out STOREFRONTS as Ella PURSUES:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That's it? You're just gonna run away?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, Sister. I'm walking away.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Well s w.
text: As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the
text: back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --
speaker_heading: JAKE ELLA
dialog: SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp.
text: Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's your damn problem?!
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You're comin' with us.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw
dialog: that rock I swear I'll--
text: WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: If you're walkin' away from here, what
dialog: the hell're you walking tsQ?
text: That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And
dialog: that's the last thing he's gonna admit --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady?
dialog: 'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like
dialog: suicide to me.
text: -- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I... just wanna help these people.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw
dialog: your face light up the minute you knew
dialog: that thing might lead you to gold.
text: And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: It's not gold I want, you dumb
dialog: sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And what's that?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Remange.
text: Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She
text: stares at him, DEAD ON:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver
dialog: dollar... its what you want, too.
text: With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face
text: knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (V.0.)
dialog: Was the Devil come to Absolution... come
dialog: to drag our town down to hell...
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS - AS DUSK TAI .t $. TQ .NIGItT:
text: Though BURNING EMBERS, Emmett helps a LITTLE GIRL pull her half-
text: burnt DOLL from the rubble...
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: but our town's not just a buncha
dialog: buildings, Brothers and Sisters --
dialog: Nossir. Our town is fie. Good, God-
text: fearing souls. Pure and hopeful. And
dialog: the devil can't never take that away...
text: Ella and Doc tend to WOUNDED PEOPLE in a triage area as...
text: Meacham finds his overturned PULPIT. Determination in his eyes,
dialog: he pushes it UPRIGHT:
scene_heading: AND NOW WE CATCH UP TO WHERE MEACHANL'S VOICE 1S_CQMING FRUM:
text: He's standing on the pulpit in the rubble, his words a
dialog: sermon/call-to-arms -- every survivor GATHERED AROUND:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: In times of darkness, God asks that we
dialog: come together so we may stand and fight.
dialog: So we're goin' after our kin. Any of you
dialog: aren't able or prepared, no shame in it.
dialog: Head up to Fort Huachuca, join up with
dialog: the garrison there and pray... Rest of us
dialog: ride out at sun-up to recover that which
dialog: we have lost.
scene_heading: SUNRISE: Pistol chambers SPINNNN -- rifles are COCKED --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Thy will be done, Lord, and there's an
text: amen behind it.
dialog: Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn
text: scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
text: Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
text: CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
text: DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Somebody got something to say?
text: His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and
dialog: Meacham climb onto the wagon:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
speaker_heading: (THE ALIEN)
dialog: Sure we need to bring that thing along?
text: Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the
text: COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: If this arrow points me back to Maria?
dialog: Yeah -- J'm sure.
text: Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
dialog: around his back:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the
dialog: only master bowman in my archery club.
dialog: Won the county tournament by shootin' a
text: flipped nickel at 50 paces.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Somethin' tells me these things don't
dialog: carry nickels, son. Answers's no.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: You want me to ride off with the
dialog: chickenshits, then double back, be happy
dialog: to. But let's just skip that part and
dialog: get to it, Padre.
text: And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Go fill your canteen, dammit.
text: He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
text: mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
text: Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: C'mon, Happy.
text: But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking
text: up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh shut up.
text: Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
text: VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: I was ridin' into town to kill you for
dialog: what you done to my son. You owe me your
dialog: life, Boy.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Ride with us, we'll call it square.
text: His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You that fast?
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
speaker_heading: FAST ENOU--
text: -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having
text: drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square.
text: In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point
text: made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
text: drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
text: Follow him. Soon as he's got his back
dialog: turned... kill him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: Shit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: "Do it." Finally
text: Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
text: JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and
speaker_heading: Doc on the WAGON:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Figure out which way you're headed yet?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: West. Saguaro Pass.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: That's not what I meant.
text: The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off.
text: Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT PLAINS
scene_heading: JAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT:
text: A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through
text: plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN:
text: "SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
text: Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
text: CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY
text: A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in
text: Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to
text: the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER:
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
text: Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
text: DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
text: Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:
text: MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&amp;
text: FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him --
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: You shouldn't have.
text: She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's
text: talking to JAKE.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Got you somethin' else.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
text: CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
text: A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Where'd you get this?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Where do you think?
text: The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
text: TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Your boys '11 come after you.
scene_heading: ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Let 'em come.
text: She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
dialog: Tender. Soulful.
text: But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
text: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.
text: The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch
text: slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
dialog: REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman?
text: Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:
text: ONE OF THE GOLD COINS
text: EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand
text: questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and --
text: MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the
text: floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY
text: -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: What's happening?!!!
text: WINDOWS EXPLODE! THE ROOF'S RIPPED AWAY BY SOME NSANE VACUUM
text: FORCE AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CRASHES IN! The Woman SCREAMS and --
text: KA-CHINNNG! A STEEL COLLAR SHOOTS DOWN FROM THE LIGHT, CLAMPING
text: AROUND HER NECK! A CABLE SNAPS OUT FROM IT AND WHIPS UPWARD,
text: PULLING HER INTO THE LIGHT --
text: She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them!
text: JESUS!! Jake draws his pistol and FIRES!
text: The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its
text: huge, elongated skull... making it look like a SILHOUETTED
dialog: It QIAï¿½1.-L 2 A T EI! R HEADDRESS!
text: Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it
text: raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a
speaker_heading: BLASTER --
text: JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his
dialog: side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --
text: THE PULSE PASSES THROUGH JAKE AND HITS THE WOMAN SQUARE IN THE
text: C-Mr-M. She 's HURLED backward into the wall, Jake. CRIES OUT:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Alice!
text: As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE,
text: clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
text: As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck --
text: Catches his breath. ROCKED. Sees "Alice's" BLOOD STAIN on the
text: wall. His shaking hand reaches out, brushes over it...
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying out the name)
dialog: "Alice"...
text: Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All
dialog: he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this
text: revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE.
text: Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then--
scene_heading: SUDDENLY -- INSTINCT -- JAKE SENSING SOMETHING IS HERE -- GRABS
text: A CHIMNEY STONE AND SPINS, HURLS IT...
text: AT COLORADO, IN THE DOORWAY BEHIND HIM AIMING A GUN:
text: The stone HITS Colorado as he FIRES, the bullet tears PAST Jake
text: -- as Colorado recovers, Jake BODYSLAMS HIM -- the GUN goes
text: flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the
text: other side -- aaballs-out. messy. close-quarter death match --
text: Jake takes a PUNCH -- Colorado LOOPS an arm around his throat,
text: YANKS -- they TUMBLE/SLAM to the floor, Jake LANDING on top of
text: Colorado who holds the arm lock, CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach --
text: fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT
text: He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS
text: aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and
text: Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS
text: the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes:
text: ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad
text: he can taste it... but something's HOLDING HIM BACK -- GRITS his
dialog: teeth, COCKS the trigger and:
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY
text: -- we CUT WIDE on the cabin as a GUNSHOT CRACKS. A flock of
text: BIRDS screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAY
text: The rest of our people RIDE along, following the ever-tilting
text: HOLOGRAPHIC ARROW, their COMPASS, floating from the dead alien's
text: eye in the back of the wagon.
text: Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA. COCKY SWAGGER:
speaker_heading: GREAVEY
dialog: So... what's a pretty lady like y--
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: -- you finish that sentence, I shoot you
dialog: in your beef whistle.
text: Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes
text: DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:
speaker_heading: GREAVEY
dialog: Ma'am.
text: And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your
dialog: father just take my money?
speaker_heading: EMMETT
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What money?
speaker_heading: UOLARHY DE
dialog: offered him a thousand dollars to leave
dialog: town. He could's taken you outta harm's
dialog: way, relocated... found you a new momma.
text: And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Is it true Percy's momma died givin'
dialog: birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
text: Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Then maybe you should use that thousand
dialog: dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
text: Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and
text: UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but
text: it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Madre Dios...
text: And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's
dialog: reacting to --
scene_heading: AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even
text: Dolarhyde looks nervous now:
speaker_heading: DOLARYHYDE
dialog: What the... hell is it?
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: It was Winfield's Landing.
text: They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN:
dialog: Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
dialog: ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?
speaker_heading: GREAVEY
dialog: You tryin' to tell me those... things
dialog: pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
text: And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
text: BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
text: SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
text: tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
dialog: the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: That can't be good.
text: The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND
scene_heading: PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Scatter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: -- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over
text: rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
text: They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
text: DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
text: It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
text: TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
scene_heading: GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
text: The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
text: and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Should we... open it?
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: -- oops --
text: -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a
text: Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks --
text: then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
text: the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
text: BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
text: FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:
dialog: A COW. YES, A COW.
text: Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
text: connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
text: Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":
speaker_heading: GREAVEY
dialog: Boss... it's one'a yours.
text: Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
text: Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
text: with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: This was stuck down its throat... to help
dialog: it breathe. That means they wanted to
dialog: keep it alive, Emmett.
dialog: (forces a small smile)
dialog: I'm sure your father is fine.
text: But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Why'd they dump it?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Whatever they needed from it, they
dialog: must've got.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving.
text: She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
text: DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK
text: Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a
text: HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK:
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Ho-ly shit.
text: BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
text: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
text: facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
dialog: desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER
text: TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides
text: around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: "Colorado Queen."
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: The river's two hundred miles from here.
text: But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In
text: fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
text: over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile --
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
text: COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
text: to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
text: the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Your man got it in his head that he was
dialog: s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his
dialog: ear 'til he says sorry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
text: As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar
text: notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks
text: up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Why'd you let him live?
dialog: Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Gonna need him.
text: He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice boat.
dialog: (then... SNIFFS)
dialog: What's that smell?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That'd be me.
text: He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why're you blue?
speaker_heading: ELLA
speaker_heading: (DRYLY)
dialog: Cause I missed ya.
text: Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: We better keep movin'.
text: A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til
text: it passes.
dialog: (to Colorado; fucking
speaker_heading: WITH HIM)
dialog: How's that sound, Nat?
text: Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
text: Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: Too hard tracking anything in the rain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
text: Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now
text: in QUESTION. The tide IS turning against the rancher.
scene_heading: EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - NIGHT - LATER
text: RAIN POURS on the overturned boat. Horses tethered. The ALIEN
text: CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
text: WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on
dialog: it, longer than we're comfortable.
scene_heading: INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER... except the
text: chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
text: Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
text: window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
text: Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
text: WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: COLORADO
dialog: (low, eyes averted)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE COLORADO
dialog: Lemme clean it for you or
dialog: it'll get -- -- I'm fine.
text: Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Say it.
speaker_heading: COLORADO
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Is Percy worth dyin' for?
text: Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: He's my son.
speaker_heading: (POINTED)
dialog: I take care of my kin, Nat.
text: ON COLORADO as that lands. Clearly, there's something here...
text: a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
text: WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
text: Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.
text: Looks over and sees... EMMETT, huddled in a corner. CRYING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: ON DOLARHYDE. The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the
dialog: fact Dolar might have a conscience makes him ANGRY too. Low:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Kid.
text: Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a drink and shut p.
text: He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As
text: Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --
scene_heading: INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Meacham has set out TIN PANS under holes to collect RAIN WATER.
text: Dumps a pan into his CANTEEN as Doc enters with COFFEE for him:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (re: the tin plates)
dialog: We brought enough water.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'.
text: Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Padre... Maria came to see you in
dialog: confession every Sunday. It seemed...
dialog: she had a lot to talk about.
dialog: (beat, this is hard)
dialog: Was she having an affair?
text: Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: You know I can't say.
dialog: And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: The last thing I said to her... I...
dialog: (shakes his head; then)
dialog: Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I
dialog: don't want to die angry.
text: Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on
dialog: you once we get her back. 'Til then?
dialog: (bit of a grin)
dialog: Don't die.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS --
scene_heading: INT. RIVERBOAT - COMMODORE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the
text: floor. Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure
text: she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
text: Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of
text: this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
text: . until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss-
text: crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
text: She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
text: the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face... then: A MATCH
text: ignites behind her. She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts
text: with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's
text: desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You missed a spot.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: The hell,-re- you doing here?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mindin' my own business.
dialog: (snaps out the match)
dialog: Then you decided to take a shower.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Why didn't you say anything?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Givin' you privacy.
text: She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues
text: to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
text: Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a
text: bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: . she's pretty.
dialog: (Jake says NOTHING)
dialog: Who was she?
text: Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: only thing I know's her name was Alice...
speaker_heading: (THEN; DISTANT)
dialog: And she's dead.
text: Ella looks up at him. INTO him --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Maybe you loved her.
text: Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: All you women are the same -- Always
dialog: wanna make it about Goddamn "love."
speaker_heading: ELLA
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same.
dialog: There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he
dialog: connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't matter.
text: She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: So what dj= matter?
text: Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips,
text: the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What matters is I find the thing that
dialog: killed her.
dialog: (dark as hell)
dialog: And make it pay.
text: And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his
speaker_heading: BRACELET:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd you see this before?
text: A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie.
dialog: But he cuts her off --
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've
dialog: asked me if you didn't recognize it.
text: Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Those things... they the ones who put
dialog: those marks on your back?
text: She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and
text: ANGER at what was done to her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: They took my people. Destroyed where I'm
dialog: from.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever
dialog: since, town to town. Best I figure,
dialog: they're hidin' in a mine.
text: Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead
dialog: of throwin' rocks at me --
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: -- what, you would've stuck around?
dialog: Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away
dialog: from what you had to do, any more than I
dialog: could've stopped these people from going
dialog: after their kin.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and
dialog: we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
text: Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So that's the only reason you wanted me
dialog: to come with you? Cause of my gun?
text: There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, not your gun.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What you do with it.
dialog: Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately
text: and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION.
text: Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS...
text: Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something
text: outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as:
scene_heading: INT. STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the
text: rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret
text: conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: GREAVEY
dialog: What the hell're we doin' here? We
dialog: should be ridin' in the opposite
dialog: direction of those things --
speaker_heading: COBBETT
dialog: We do that, the old man's likely to shoot
dialog: us himself. Only way outta this is --
text: And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:
speaker_heading: GREAVEY
dialog: . what's that smell?
text: -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY

text: to Dolar -- who's suddenly, surprisingly, PROTECTIVE of Emmett:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Get behind me, Boy --
text: THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the
dialog: ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: RUN, KID! GIT!
text: Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps
text: FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and --
text: THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH! HURLS Dolar aside --
text: THROUGH THE FIRE -- embers catch CURTAINS and FLAMES SPREAD --
text: COLORADO races in, throws a TOMAHAWK -- it PINS the alien's claw
text: to the wall, the monster SHRIEKS as Nat draws a PISTOL but --
text: The alien SPITS A STICKY RESIN GOB -- it HARDENS, pinning NAT'S
text: hand with the pistol to the wall in return. He STRUGGLES as the
dialog: alien ADVANCES --
text: BOOM! The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as
text: a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid
text: FIRING -- the monster SCREECHES and leaps down, DISAPPEARING
dialog: through the hatch where Emmett fled --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. RIVERBOAT BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: -- DROPPING onto the floor -- as we WHIP TO Jake racing in from
text: around a corner -- but suddenly: THE ALIEN BURSTS FROM THE HATCH
text: BEHIND EMMETT, SWEEPING HIM UP IN ITS CLUTCHES:
text: Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The
text: Alien but the creature CUPS a hand around Emmett and LIFTS HIM
text: off the floor, a TALONED FINGER pressed to the boy's THROAT:
text: STANDOFF. ELLA rushes in. The creature sees her -- HISSES --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't know if you understand me... but
dialog: you hurt that boy and I hurt you.
scene_heading: CLOSE, EMMETT -- MUFFLED, TEARS LEAKING FROM HIS TERRIFIED EYES:

scene_heading: OF IRON, IMPALING HIM --
speaker_heading: MEACHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: ! ! !
text: The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Easy, now... Don't move, dammit --
speaker_heading: (TURNS; SHOUTING)
dialog: DOC -- GET IN HERE NOW!
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Go after the boy... then you get our
dialog: people back...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS--
scene_heading: But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:
speaker_heading: MEACHAM
dialog: Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able
dialog: to say it again --
dialog: (pulls Jake CLOSE)
dialog: God don't care who you were, Son... only
dialog: who you Mg.
text: ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: JAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M!
text: But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM

scene_heading: EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - DESERT - NIGHT
text: The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains

dialog: Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy
text: atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD

speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO

speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed
dialog: the kid.
text: ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX

text: The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches

text: The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and

dialog: It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it
dialog: as... THE SLAVER.
text: It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something
text: that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed:
text: A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE
text: WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at --
text: EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM! But... the whip DOESN'T cut him,

dialog: and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right

text: One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss

speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: Hey --- ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and

speaker_heading: HUNT (O.S.)

dialog: What the hell happened to you?!?
text: Hunt nods over his shoulder --
speaker_heading: HUNT
dialog: He did.
text: The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
text: rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:
speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: well, shit.
text: It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
text: whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
text: gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is
dialog: the man in charge. Dismounts:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
text: Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:
speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: We're fixin' to rob us a train in about
dialog: twenty minutes and you come ridin' in
dialog: like nothin' ever happened?
speaker_heading: (FUCK YOU)
dialog: No. Lonergan. I ain't happy to see you.

speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not

text: The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.
speaker_heading: BRONC
dialog: But Jake... you-- you said you didn't
dialog: wanna be in charge no more.
text: And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the

speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: They're not going anywhere with you.

dialog: You got some balls on you -- walkin'
dialog: outta here a week ago sayin' what you
dialog: said and doin' what you did and then
dialog: ridin' back in here and givin orders.
dialog: Just who the hell do you think you are?
text: The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
text: right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
text: a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.
speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
dialog: So. Are you her?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Am I who?
speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: The whore Jake quit this gang for.

text: ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That a fact, Boys?
text: But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:
speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: Put your guns on the whore. He so much
text: as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
text: AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
text: the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Call her a whore again, that'll be the
dialog: last word you ever say.
speaker_heading: CREEK JOHNSON
dialog: You ain't in no position to make threats,
dialog: asshole. Hunt: take his gun.

speaker_heading: HUNT
dialog: Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.

text: The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no
text: choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY
text: THE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE
text: -- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND,
text: cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
text: THE LOGS START ROLLING OFF THE TOP. CRASHING DOWN ON THE
text: SPEEDER. It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert!
text: ON JAKE. He picks himself up, WINCING. Sees the SMOKING WRECK
text: in the distance. Starts to limp, then RUN --
scene_heading: EXT. CRASHED SPEEDER - CONTINUOUS
text: Jake APPEARS through the smoke. No sign of The Slaver. Then --
text: FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward. Though WOUNDED, the alien
text: is SCALING a rock-face. Turns... a look that says "Next time."
text: Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a
text: bracelet. When the smoke clears:
text: ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake
text: REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms.
text: She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Ella...?
text: Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's
text: true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his
text: dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as...
text: HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado,
text: Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Aw no... is she --?
text: Jake looks up -- unhinged --
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: We need to get out of here NOT.
speaker_heading: JAKE NAT COLORADO
dialog: Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam --
dialog: -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory!
dialog: They catch us, they'll kill u--
text: THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground
text: inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND
dialog: THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as --
text: APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett
dialog: to the ground --
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody move.
text: Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM.
text: Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA MOUNTAINS - TWILIGHT
text: The sun DIPS behind the mountains... NIGHT FALLS...
scene_heading: INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE. Still. Beautiful. FIND JAKE, on
text: his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him. An INDIAN
text: WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES.
text: Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him.
dialog: Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I remember now.
speaker_heading: (THEN; SOFTLY)
dialog: I-- I did love her.
text: And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of
text: EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as
dialog: his eyes WELL:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: She was like you. Seemed to think I was
dialog: a good man.
dialog: (finally, voice almost
speaker_heading: CRACKS)
dialog: But I couldn't save either of you.
text: A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT' D )
dialog: Where's the good in that?
text: His eyes CLOSE. Too much.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, Ella.
text: And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES
text: roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:
scene_heading: EXT. APACHE ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
text: BAN! Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF
text: APACHES. GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH! A
dialog: PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being
text: dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: HEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH--
text: -- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS
text: THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan.
dialog: Those things... were lookin' for her.
dialog: Had a picture and everything.
text: That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What d'you mean... 'a picture'?
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Floatin', like that arrow thing we found
text: in its eye.
text: Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS
text: and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark,
text: wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his
text: prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: COLORADO
dialog: "Kill them. And make it quick."
text: Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move
dialog: for them, MENACING --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Now'd be a good time to use your gun
dialog: bracelet, my friend.
text: But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him.
text: His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE.
text: Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the
dialog: braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --
speaker_heading: DOLARRYDE
speaker_heading: (SUBTITLED)
text: SOP. DON'T DO THIS.
text: SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides
dialog: Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA
text: ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: How is it that you speak our language?
speaker_heading: UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Because I'm a damn genius.
dialog: Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS
dialog: given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Forget about quick. Make him feel it.
text: The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Two hundred head of cattle!
text: Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a
dialog: here in a day's time if you let me go.
text: ON GREY WOLF. Considering this.
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: And how do I know you'll come back?
dialog: Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
dialog: You can keep my associate here. if I
dialog: don ' t come back, you can kill him.
dialog: Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell
text: these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches
dialog: Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Why should I believe that you even care
dialog: about this man?
text: Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Because he's my son.
dialog: Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado
dialog: with those unyielding eyes --
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Is this true?
text: And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:
speaker_heading: COLORADO
dialog: Yeah... he's my father.
text: REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
text: Three hundred head.
text: Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's
text: eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Two fifty.
text: HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Cut him loose.
dialog: The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Hey! What about =?!?
text: ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: What about you, kid?
text: And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind...
dialog: GONE. And now, it's back to business --
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Kill all of them except the half-breed.
text: Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a
text: Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with
text: lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT.
text: And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:
text: FWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN
scene_heading: TO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS --
text: ELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI
dialog: Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly
text: close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely
dialog: feminine, yet... ALJM.
text: PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons
text: as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS
text: to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she
dialog: looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: . what... happened?
text: ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: You... died.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
text: Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her.
speaker_heading: ELLA
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY; CAUGHT)
dialog: . oh.
dialog: OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain --
scene_heading: INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT
text: A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark
text: breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever.
scene_heading: EXT. TEEPEE - NIGHT
text: Ella emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee.
text: HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes
dialog: a step TOWARD him:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: If I'd told you on the boat, you never
dialog: would'a trusted me --
text: -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he
dialog: isn't showing it:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: .. What?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: When you were playin' possum. Did you
dialog: hear what I mid?
dialog: He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it,
text: something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No. I was mendin'.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's like sleep.
text: His eyes narrow, trying to understand:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How's it you look like one of us?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I can look like whatever I want to.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So you can't die?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Sure I can. If my heart stops beating...
dialog: just like you.
speaker_heading: .JAKE
dialog: You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're
dialog: one'a them.
dialog: we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So
dialog: desperately wants to reach him...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different
dialog: place.
dialog: He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either
dialog: way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The one that took you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It killed her.
text: That LANDS on her. Knowing and painful.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: They call him The Slaver. He's the one,
dialog: gave me the scars. Broke me. And made
dialog: me watch... while he killed my family
dialog: too.
text: Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the
text: sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:
scene_heading: EXT. BOX CANYON - RIM - NIGHT
text: A SANDSTORM... through which a GHOSTLY FIGURE materializes...
text: THE SLAVER. Moving with angry purpose toward the CANYON BLUFF.
text: As he looks down into it, we hear the SOUNDS of MACHINERY below.
dialog: But we DO__QT.YET_ REVEAL what it_ is__ he sees.
text: He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of
scene_heading: TWINKLING STARS ---
speaker_heading: ELLA (V.0.)
dialog: For every drop of light in the sky,
dialog: there's another world. Filled with
dialog: life...
scene_heading: EXT. APACHE CAMP - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
text: Ella's in front of the campfire, surrounded by EVERYONE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Our race was first to map the stars...
dialog: that's why they came for us. Took our
text: planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered
dialog: anyone who fought hack. Ones who
dialog: survived were turned into slaves.
dialog: Trackers.
text: She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate
dialog: SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: They brought me aboard one of their scout
dialog: ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to
dialog: find other planets like mine. Planets
dialog: they can take... people they can enslave.
dialog: As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first
dialog: to understand...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: X lead 'em here.
text: Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I never wanted this.
dialog: (an EMOTIONAL beat)
dialog: But they got... ways. Of making you do
dialog: things.
text: Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of
text: TORTURE. She pushes it away -- staying strong:
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Been tryin' to make it right... tried to
dialog: blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all
dialog: their fuel, then escaped down here.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: 'Cept it didn't work... damn thing
dialog: survived.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Where is it.
text: Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to
text: that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure,
dialog: they'll find enough fuel to leave by
dialog: tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring
dialog: back the others.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: "others"?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: The whole fleet. They'll take what they
dialog: need. Everyone on this planet. Anything
dialog: too weak to survive... they'll toss.
dialog: Like that cow.
dialog: Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: What'd you mean, they're looking for
dialog: "fuel"...?
text: And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Gold. That's why they're in a mine.
speaker_heading: ELLA
speaker_heading: (NODS, solemn)
dialog: . wherever it is, that's where you
dialog: escaped from -- and it's the only way
text: back up to the ship.
speaker_heading: (STEPS CLOSER)
dialog: Even with your memory wiped, your
dialog: instincts kicked in --
speaker_heading: (HIS BRACELET:)
dialog: That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet
dialog: reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it
dialog: reacts. Somehow you took it off one of
dialog: 'em... don't you remember any of it?
text: ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and:

text: One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to

text: That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON --
text: the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven --
text: JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I remember seeing a tower... made of
text: stone... on the rim of a canyon...
text: Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated
text: gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: What? What's he sayin'?!?
text: Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:
speaker_heading: COLORADO
dialog: That rock you're talkin' about... he-
dialog: knows where it is.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT
text: The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - SOMEWHERE
text: CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we

text: the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE:
speaker_heading: PERCY DOLARHYDE
dialog: H-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?!
text: -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE:
dialog: 
dialog:

text: A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular
text: beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
text: Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED
text: from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE:
scene_heading: DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE
dialog: KYLE!!!!
text: ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging
dialog: our men across the cavern where we reveal...
text: . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
text: Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating

text: An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_

text: The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares.
text: Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT
text: CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their
text: throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID.
text: This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the
text: COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert.
text: More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS.
text: We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING
text: HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process.
text: All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp
text: behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear
text: retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON RIM - DANN
text: Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf
text: looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates:
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe.
text: As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's it.
text: As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that
text: MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
text: What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below,
text: amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this
text: fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly
text: bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun.
text: DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for
text: GOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING.
text: Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS.
text: ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort.
text: Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:
speaker_heading: GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
dialog: The Kiowa... they were taken too.
text: Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a
text: CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of
text: the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Transports. Way they get people and gold

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Place is crawling with those things.

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: EMMETT

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: This.
text: An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time...
text: they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs.
text: Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Somethin' funny?
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: Yeah... that you whites finally know what

text: Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a
dialog: knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
text: he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You told me your daddy's all you got
dialog: left. Want me to save his ass?
dialog: Then park yours right there on the
dialog: ground, you little shit. Got me?
dialog: Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Yeah. I gotcha.
text: Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Stay with the kid, Happy.
text: The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
text: on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'll get your father back. Bastard still
dialog: owes me fifty dollars.
text: The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK.
text: Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount Â»p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
text: WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll be ready?
dialog: Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn.
text: And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays
text: just between the two of them:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: That's a nice thing... what you said to
dialog: the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say
dialog: you got yourself a sweet side.
text: She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: There's nothin' sweet about me. I told
dialog: that kid what he needed to hear so he
dialog: wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care
dialog: about is killin' that thing.
text: And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I don't believe that.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Well believe it. I was playing a part.
dialog: (straight at her)
dialog: Just like you were.
text: He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally

scene_heading: EXT. DOLARHYDE'S RANCH - DAY
text: THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS
text: near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut:
text: A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out.
scene_heading: INT. SERVANTS' QUARTERS - DAY
text: The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier
text: is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as --
text: Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the
text: doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE:
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the
text: FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar
text: REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill
text: out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Need it to save Nat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
dialog: And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Is he okay?
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: He's gonna be.
text: A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde
text: veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to
text: him... and TOUCHES his face.
dialog: And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
text: MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't let anything happen to him,
dialog: Jenny.
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Come back to me.

dialog: and push through the water...
scene_heading: INT. LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS
text: Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES
text: from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team
text: creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You and Percy're brothers, huh?
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: ... half.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So... your momma and Dolarhyde---
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO

speaker_heading: JAKE

scene_heading: EXT. FORT HUACHUCA - MORNING

text: .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon:
speaker_heading: OUTLAW
speaker_heading: BRONC!
text: BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of
text: the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As
text: he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:
speaker_heading: HUNT
dialog: One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with!
text: Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns
speaker_heading: BRONC
dialog: The hell you want?
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: It's about what you want.
text: He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste
dialog: of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen.
dialog: It's all yours if you help me get my boy
dialog: back.
text: The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:
speaker_heading: BRONC
dialog: Who's got your boy?
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Well, there's the rub.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I got two.

text: PRODS. The mares REAR and WHINNY.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We're never gonna get close to that ship.
text: Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER

speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It

speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: Just thinkin' the same thing.
text: The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at
text: the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM --
text: The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER
text: and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.
text: The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern --
dialog: And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run,

scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - MINI CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: ELLA

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Into what?!?

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - DAY
scene_heading: THE TRANSPORT SHUTTLE KAMIKAZES THROUGH BI-SECTING TUNNELS:

speaker_heading: ELLA

scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - OVER THE CANYON - CONTINUOUS
text: The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake
text: fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as --
text: The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD.
text: As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER CLOUD LAYER - CONTINUOUS
text: The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...
speaker_heading: THE ALIEN SCOUT
text: -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye
dialog: of a hurricane.
text: ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.
dialog: Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sheee-it.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS
text: The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing

text: Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE
text: HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start
dialog: SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
text: But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow

scene_heading: EXT. ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS
text: They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount
text: SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:
scene_heading: ,INT. CANYON TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
dialog: That's the point!
dialog: And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
text: BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN
text: from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade
text: CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
text: A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES
text: RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
text: An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking

text: The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets

speaker_heading: ELLA
text: Hug the wall.
text: Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: When they come at us, aim for their
dialog: heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure.
text: He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:
speaker_heading: JAKE

scene_heading: AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of

text: Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE.
speaker_heading: ELLA
speaker_heading: Ï¿½CIDYAPLQLWJJ
text: -- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS
text: overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons

speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: We can't let that thing see us or they'll
dialog: know we're here.
text: She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP
text: leading to a series of CORRIDORS. She starts to MOVE --
speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: This'll take us to the bridge --
text: But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Slaver's up there--?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I sure as hell hope not.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Then I'm not goin' with you.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find

speaker_heading: ELLA'S FURIOUS:
speaker_heading: ELLA

scene_heading: INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS
text: JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE -- fritzing as he

scene_heading: INT. SCOUT SHIP - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS
text: Jake has moved out into the corridors -- blaster ready -- eyes

speaker_heading: JAKE
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY; HARD)

speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Told you: I take care of my kin.
dialog: Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever

text: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits
text: open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces
text: hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming:
text: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to

text: CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One
text: LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:

text: A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!
scene_heading: SEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!!
text: The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER
text: RETJff&amp;H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from

scene_heading: INT. SCOUT SHIP - TURBOLIFT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
text: Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING
text: with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: -- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust
text: of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes:
scene_heading: INT. SCOUT SHIP - JUNKPILE CARGO HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
text: -- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As
text: Jake pushes through, the air clears a little...
text: His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees:
dialog: Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the
dialog: tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they
dialog: found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE
text: in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front
text: facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED
text: AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
dialog: along with it all.
text: A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
text: Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting
text: fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like

text: A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons...
text: 5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as...
text: THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@--

text: Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
text: His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Drop the woman. We both know this ain't
dialog: about her.
text: But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
dialog: Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: She says you're as bad as they come.
text: Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say
dialog: the same about me.
text: A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)

text: The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly

dialog: Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile.
text: THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching.
text: JAKE -- his hand is still.
text: A PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND --

text: and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and --
text: ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS
text: ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS
text: the captor with a SHOT to the temple --
text: Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE
text: FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building
text: walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: BEHIND YOU!!!
text: Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Stay down.
dialog: Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS
text: THEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM.
text: The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a

text: Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail
text: of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner...
text: Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- you alright?
text: In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship
dialog: on the ground soon, we're all dead...
dialog: (tries to STAND, WINCES)
dialog: Get me over to that turbolift.
text: He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her

speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Put me inside.

dialog: And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Goddamnit.
text: -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control
text: pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward. She half-grins

scene_heading: THE FOUR MEN -- PINNED BEHIND THE ROCK EMBANKMENT:

speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Alright, listen -- you slide your finger

speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We're going down fast.
text: She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The

text: A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS
text: QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No matter what.
text: Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a

text: Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into

text: Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH
text: MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK
text: CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E.
text: The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP

scene_heading: INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver

text: Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS
text: and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain
dialog: and looks down to see --
text: ONE OF HIS OWN "ICE TACKS" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Go to hell.
text: THE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER
text: FREEZES TO GREY STONE. EXPLODING IN A MILLION PIECES!!!
text: Jake DROPS, GASPING. Revenge fulfilled. Painfully starts
text: CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck --
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

dialog: as_it crashe _down!
scene_heading: INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the

dialog: heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I lied.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: ... I know.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: No, I heard what you said when I was

speaker_heading: ELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You are a good man. At least... to me.

scene_heading: EXT. BADLANDS - THE BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS
text: THE SHIP PLUNGES INTO THE CANYON AND CLEAR THROUGH THE ALIEN
scene_heading: FORT, RIPPING IT INTO TIDAL-WAVE MOUNDS OF SHRAPNEL... CHEWS UP
text: A HALF-MILE BEFORE SLOWLY COMING TO A FINAL, WRENCHING... STOP.
text: The frame is WHITE with dust and SUNSHINE. As from the ether
dialog: comes...
text: EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his
text: shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them
text: PROUD WARRIORS. Staring in awe at:
text: THE CRASHED ALIEN SHIP. DUG DEEP INTO THE CANYON FLOOR.
text: Something starts to rain down. Looks at first like glitter...
text: until we realize it's GOLD DUST.
text: From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING
text: HOOVES as... ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT. Then, slowly...
text: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING
text: UP. White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES.
text: DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n--
text: THERE she is, his BELOVED MARIA, stumbling weakly toward him as
text: tears runs down her cheek. He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every
dialog: inch of her face as...
text: EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: PAW!!!! PAW!!!!
text: The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart
text: stares back in a daze --
speaker_heading: EMMETT (CONT'D)
dialog: It's me -- it's Emmett.
text: And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's
text: eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father
dialog: again as --
text: THE TOWNSFOLK OF ABSOLUTION AND THE APACHES FIND EACH OTHER.
text: Families, lovers, friends... reunited.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: COLORADO
text: Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of
text: Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...
speaker_heading: A VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Nat?
text: Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a
text: dream. Sees his father on the ground...
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: What... happened?
dialog: And all Colorado can say is...
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO
text: He's dead.
text: That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Who's gettin' the ranch?
text: ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE
text: BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:
speaker_heading: NAT COLORADO PERCY
text: YOU SONOFABITCH! HE JUST STOP! NAT, STOP!!!
dialog: SAVED YOUR WORTHLESS LITTLE
speaker_heading: LIFE!
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: No one's gettin' my ranch.
text: Stunned, Colorado GRINS. Percy spits blood, points accusingly --
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Paw, he--
text: Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:
speaker_heading: PERCY (CONT'D)
dialog: OW!!! What'd you do that for?
speaker_heading: UOLARHYUE
dialog: For being an ungrateful little bastard.
dialog: Now shake your brother's hand and thank
dialog: him for saving your ass, cause it's more
dialog: than you ever would'a done bjM.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado. Grudgingly reaches out a
dialog: hand. So does Nat. As they SHAKE --
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's better.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But
text: she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: . what is it?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft.
text: That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon.
text: HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
text: We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until
text: Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY
text: A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
text: GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
text: We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
text: APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
text: in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!!
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: -- what? What'd I dQ?
scene_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT
dialog: Get outta the road before
dialog: you're run down! If your (overlapping)
dialog: momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the
dialog: street she'd roll over in her
dialog: grave and shoot lightnin'
dialog: bolts outta her eyes," I know,
dialog: I know!
text: He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Kid's got a mouth on him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY WADE
dialog: Well, Kyle, considering he saved your
dialog: life, guess you'll just have to grin'n
dialog: bear it.
text: Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Woodrow.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Kyle.
text: Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go_ _on.
text: Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
dialog: I've signed it over to the township of
dialog: Absolution.
dialog: (off Taggart's LOOK)
dialog: Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
dialog: expansion's in both our interests. Needs
dialog: the Sheriff's signature to be official.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Fifty miles west of here is where the
dialog: goldmine is, Woodrow.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: That so.
text: With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: What's this about twenty percent going to
dialog: the Apaches?
text: Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
text: rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
dialog: is to buy 'em.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: Since when'd you worry about pissin'
dialog: anyone off?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Just sign it, Goddamnit.
text: With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
text: flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF TAGGART
dialog: I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
dialog: but I know you'd just be insulted.
speaker_heading: DOLARHYDE
dialog: Damn right.
text: Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
text: UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
text: being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
text: other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:
speaker_heading: DOC MARIA
dialog: SHH! The workers will hear
dialog: us!!! Let them hear!
text: As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
text: his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Look at the inscription.
text: He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
text: SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Shut up and kiss me.
text: She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY
text: A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
text: bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for
text: Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY
text: In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
text: through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: EXT. RIM OF CANYON - DAY
text: As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
text: outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
text: He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
text: Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
text: the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
text: with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Second damn time that dog ran off on me.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Second time he brought me to you.
text: Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
text: it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
text: glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
text: and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like you got everything set.
text: Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly
speaker_heading: DISAPPOINTED:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Where you headed?
speaker_heading: JAKE
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: Got some messes to clean up.
text: But she looks at him. fEADI.NG liim. wryly:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Messes.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: ... Yep.
dialog: (then; off her look)
dialog: What.
text: She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: I think you're ridin' off cause you're
dialog: just scared of what'll happen if you
dialog: stay.
text: An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
text: horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And what's gonna happen?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
text: She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: You know.
text: A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
dialog: But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
text: quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
dialog: anybody, Ella.
text: A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
text: slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
text: noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
dialog: Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down
dialog: there. Give it a look-see.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (his eyes narrow)
dialog: What's 'phenomena'?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Big storms in places that don't get big
dialog: storms.
text: ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
dialog: though he plays it down:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You goin' down there yourself?
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: Why? You worried about me?
dialog: You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
dialog: just fine.
dialog: (then; tips his hat)
dialog: Be seein' you around.
speaker_heading: ELLA
dialog: goodbye, Jake.
text: He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
text: trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
dialog: be an idiot." Jake glances over --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.
speaker_heading: (BARK, BARK)
dialog: Go on, GET.
text: He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
text: Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
dialog: chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
text: But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
text: TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
dialog: between them.
text: Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
dialog: effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Abilene happens to be on my way.
text: He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
text: THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
text: around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop smiling, Goddammit.
text: He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
text: look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
text: The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
text: canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
dialog: DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
scene_heading: ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
text: THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...
text: THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL
text: EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.
text: Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
text: nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
text: As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and
text: Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
text: Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
