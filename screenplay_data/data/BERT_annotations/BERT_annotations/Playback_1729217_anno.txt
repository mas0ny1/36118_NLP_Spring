scene_heading: EXT. OPEN LANDSCAPE WITH RAILROAD TRACKS -- DAY
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: A STREAMLINER coming TOWARDS CAMERA which is off to one
text: side of tracks. The landscape has pine and fir trees and
text: is a northern Washington landscape.
text: As the streamliner passes, the CAMERA PANS around following
text: it and stops. The streamliner tears off into the distance
text: and in the foreground is WE SEE a RAILROAD SIGN --
dialog: "EVERETT WASH"
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. STREAMLINER IN MOTION - CORRIDOR -- DAY
scene_heading: SHOWING OPEN DOORS OF FOUR ROOMETTES
text: Through the windows can be seen the landscape through which
text: the train is passing. In the first roomette, counting from
text: the left, is a well-dressed, rather wise-looking FEMALE,
text: young, smart. She is making up her face.
text: In the second is a middle-aged couple, a CANADIAN
scene_heading: IMMIGRATION INSPECTOR and a CANADIAN CUSTOMS INSPECTOR.
text: In the third, BETTY MAYFIELD is seated near the window,
text: turning over the pages of a magazine. She is about 27 years
text: old, beautiful, blonde, and has a remote troubled
text: expression, as though her thoughts were far away.
text: The fourth is empty. There is a man's suitcase in evidence
text: on the seat. LARRY MITCHELL enters from the left. He is
text: tall, good-looking, young, with superficial charm and rather
dialog: too much self-assurance.
text: He glances in at the woman in the first roomette, stops in
text: the door and leans against it.
text: We MOVE IN so this scene becomes a SHOT of a single
text: roomette. OVER SCENE is HEARD the voices of the Canadian
dialog: Immigration Officer.
speaker_heading: CANADIAN OFFICIAL (O.S.)
dialog: Good afternoon. You name, please.
speaker_heading: PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: George Olson.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to the unknown
dialog: woman)
dialog: Better stop while it's still
dialog: perfect.
text: She looks up at him with a slow stare.
speaker_heading: CANADIAN OFFICIAL (O.S.)
dialog: And where were you born, Mr. Olson?
speaker_heading: PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: Waukegan, Illinois.
speaker_heading: UNKNOWN WOMAN
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Is there something I can do for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: There are a lot of things you could
dialog: do for me.
speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION INSPECTOR (O.S.)
dialog: And this is your wife, Mr. Olson?
speaker_heading: PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: Yes. She was born in Waukegan,
dialog: too. Same as Jack Benny, you know.
speaker_heading: OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Jack Benny?
speaker_heading: UNKNOWN WOMAN
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Well, there is something you could
dialog: do for me.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'd be delighted.
speaker_heading: UNKNOWN WOMAN
dialog: You can move to one side. So my
dialog: husband can get in.
text: Mitchell glances back, then moves to one side with a smile.
text: He is quite unperturbed. A rather decrepit MAN creeps past
text: him into the roomette with the unknown WOMAN. She gives
text: Mitchell a quick flashing smile. Mitchell grins, turns
dialog: away.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK AND PANS HIM PAST THE NEXT ROOMETTE
text: We now see the IMMIGRATION and CUSTOMS OFFICIALS and two
scene_heading: MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGERS.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
dialog: (to Olson)
dialog: Any firearms? Dutiable articles of
dialog: any kind, Mr. Olson?
text: Olson shakes his head.
text: CAMERA PANS Mitchell past this door to the door of better
text: Mayfield's roomette. He leans in this as he did in the
text: unknown Woman's roomette.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Would you care to see the Seattle
dialog: paper?
text: Betty turns slowly, stares at him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: My name's Larry Mitchell. I live
dialog: in Vancouver.
text: Betty says nothing.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Same as an hour ago. Remember?
dialog: I'm the steady type.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: I'm afraid there's nothing I can
dialog: do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
text: CAMERA NOW HAS MOVED IN CLOSE enough to exclude the other
text: roomettes completely.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You could tell me your name. And
dialog: where you're going.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How far does this train go?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Vancouver, B.C.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm going to Vancouver, Mr.
dialog: Mitchell.
text: She picks up a magazine and opens it, ignoring him.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: O.K. Be rugged.
text: He turns, starts out, then looks back at her.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You're next for the Immigration
dialog: and Customs. I trust your papers
dialog: are all in order.
text: Betty looks up quickly and cannot conceal a startled
text: expression. Mitchell reacts.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK as he comes out into corridor, looks
text: towards the roomette in which the officials are, then turns
text: towards the next roomette and goes into it. Fusses with
text: his suitcase.
text: CAMERA PANS across to the officials coming out of Olson's
text: roomette. As they come out of Olson's roomette.
scene_heading: CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
dialog: I hope you will enjoy your stay in
dialog: Canada, Mr. Olson.
speaker_heading: OLSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Canadian officials then go on to Betty's roomette, enter.
scene_heading: CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
dialog: Your name, please.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Betty.. Mayfield.
dialog: There is a perceptible hesitation which immigration
text: officials notices.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Betty Mayfield. Miss or Mrs.
text: Mitchell is seen in his roomette, standing near the door
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Miss Mayfield.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: And where were you born, Miss
dialog: Mayfield?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: New York, City.
text: The official is a little suspicious. He looks down at
text: Betty's hands which are clasped in her lap.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: I see you are wearing a wedding
dialog: ring.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I've been married. My Husband..
text: (she breaks off and
dialog: bites her lip)
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Then I take it Mayfield was not
dialog: your married name?
text: He is very polite, but is building up to asking for some
text: identification papers. One this cue, Mitchell comes out of
text: his roomette, crosses, enters Betty's roomette.
scene_heading: CAMERA MOVES IN
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I've wired ahead to--
text: He breaks off, turns to Inspector, recognizes him.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Inspector Gillette, Isn't it? I'm
dialog: Larry Mitchell. We've met before,
dialog: several times.
text: He takes out wallet and holds it out to Inspector.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I cross the border so often I carry
text: an identification card.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: (glancing at card)
dialog: Yes, I remember you, Mr. Mitchell.
dialog: (glancing at Betty)
dialog: You know this lady?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Very well. Since 1940, at least.
dialog: I met her--let me see--it was New
dialog: York City, wasn't it Betty?
text: Betty nods silently. Inspector turns back to her, handing
text: Mitchell's wallet back.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: How long do you expect to be in
dialog: Canada, Miss Mayfield?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh.. a month.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: (making up his mind)
dialog: Thank you. I hope you have a
dialog: pleasant trip.
text: He turns away, starts out.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS INSPECTOR
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Any firearms? Dutiable articles of
dialog: any kind?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
dialog: Thank you.
text: He marks her baggage.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to Customs Inspector)
dialog: My suitcases are open in the next
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS INSPECTOR
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Anything dutiable, Mr. Mitchell?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No. Nothing.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS INSPECTOR
dialog: Thank you.
text: Custom Inspector goes out. Mitchell sits down, looks at
text: Betty coolly. She avoids his eyes.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Better get rid of the wedding ring.
dialog: That's what threw him.
text: Betty looks out of the window, says nothing.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Trouble?
text: Betty turns her head and looks at him without speaking.
text: Her face is empty of expression.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Or Reno?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: They always throw them off the
dialog: bridge there, I've heard.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Where are you staying in Vancouver
dialog: Royal. It's pretty crowded you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Is it? I expected to go to the
dialog: Vancouver Royal. Should I have a
dialog: reservation?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'll make one for you.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I live there.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (doubtfully)
dialog: Well..
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: A very small service. It doesn't
dialog: even ask for thanks. How long for?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I really don't know.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Indefinitely?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (with a shrug)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (eyeing her
dialog: thoughtfully)
dialog: You don't know.
text: He turns and goes. She looks after him, puzzled and rather
text: attracted. Then his mood passes and she relapses again
text: into her listless, hopeless manner. She reaches for the
text: magazine and starts to leaf through its pages indifferently,
dialog: as we

scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL -- DAY
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: It is a massive brick and sandstone building, set in
text: beautiful gardens which slope down towards Puget Sound.
scene_heading: CLOSER SHOT - THE ENTRANCE
text: A taxi drives up, Larry Mitchell and Betty get out, PORTER
text: comes forward, takes their luggage etc. Larry pays taxi
text: and they start in through entrance.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY - THE DESK -- DAY
text: Larry and Betty come up to it, BELLHOP carrying luggage.
speaker_heading: HOTEL CLERK
dialog: Good afternoon, Mr. Mitchell.
dialog: Have a mice trip? Glad to see you
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Fine, thanks. This is Miss Betty
dialog: Mayfield. You have a reservation
dialog: for her.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Miss Mayfield. Yes, indeed. A
text: balcony room on the top floor,
text: Magnificent view. Nothing above it
text: but the penthouse.
text: He pushes registration pad towards Betty, and she signs.
text: Mitchell turns, looks out across lobby. A malicious smile
dialog: move his lips.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL'S POV
text: One side of the lobby is a glassed-in-terrace. It is tea
text: time and a couple of large tea wagons are being pushed
text: around among the guests by FOOTMEN in uniform. With each
text: tea wagon are two neat MAIDS, who set out cups, pass
text: sandwiches, cakes, etc., While the FOOTMAN pours the tea.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: A tea wagon beside a table at which sit MR. CLARENDON and
text: MARGO WEST. Mr. Clarendon is elegant, white-haired,
text: aristocratic-looking, a cane and spats type. Margo is
text: handsome, thirty-ish, almost overpoweringly well-dressed.
text: Obviously money, obviously been around. Margo is studying
text: her face in a pocket mirror. Tea wagon and maids move away.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I'm getting positively haggard.
dialog: In a couple of years people will
dialog: be describing me as well preserved.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: I see out friend Larry Mitchell is
dialog: with us again.
text: Margo's hand stops in mid-air, holding mirror. She looks
text: up slowly.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I couldn't care less.
text: Just the same, she sees in which direction. Clarendon is
text: looking and starts to turn.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: And with a very beautiful girl, if
dialog: my eyes don't deceive me at this
dialog: distance.
text: Margo reacts and swings around, CAMERA PANNING.
text: Larry and Betty have turned away from the desk and are
text: going towards elevators, BELLHOP behind them. Larry is
text: bending towards Betty intimately. Margo turns back to
text: Clarendon. Her face is frozen with a controlled emotion.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I don't think I want any tea.
text: She picks up her bag and stands up. Goes out of shot.
text: Clarendon looks after her with a malicious smile.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - MARGO'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Its is very spacious, obviously expensive. It is empty at
text: the moment. Margo unlocks door from outside, comes in,
text: shuts and cocks door, walks swiftly into room, throws her
text: bag viciously on the desk, yanks her hat off, throws it on
text: chair. She goes over to the balcony window, takes cigarette
text: out of box on the desk, her hand shakes as she lights it
text: with lighter. She puffs at it furiously, looking out of
text: window. After a moment, she snubs out in an ashtray, moves
text: across to telephone, picks it up.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mr. Larry Mitchell, please
dialog: (a beat, she changes
dialog: her mind)
dialog: No, never mind.
text: She puts telephone back in cradle and goes back to cigarette
text: box, lights another cigarette in the same nervous, jerky
text: manner, and puffs again. There is a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. She
text: spins around, walks quickly to door, throws it open.
text: Mitchell comes in. She says nothing as he moves in past
text: her. She shuts the door.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'm afraid you're not very glad to
dialog: see me, Margo.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (between her teeth)
dialog: With your charm? How could I help
dialog: it? Have a nice trip?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: So-so.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Who's the girl?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: She's just a girl I met on the
dialog: train. You don't mind do you?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (tartly)
dialog: Why should I mind?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You shouldn't. You washed me up
dialog: very thoroughly.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't
dialog: easy. But you are helping me.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (staring at her)
dialog: Margo, darling. You washed me up.
dialog: Remember? We're just friends. You
dialog: wanted it that way.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (ignoring this)
dialog: She's very beautiful. She's much
dialog: younger than I am. And she's rich,
dialog: I hope.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Rich? I haven't the faintest idea.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You ought to know why.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I don't. My hunch is she's just
dialog: torn up an unhappy marriage. I was
text: able to do her a small favor.
speaker_heading: MARGO
text: Splendid. Now she can return the
dialog: compliment.
text: She crosses the desk, gets bag, gets keys out, unlocks the
text: desk drawer and jerks it open, takes something out and
text: turns, holding it in her hand. Two checks.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: She can give you enough money to
dialog: cover these... and the other bad
dialog: checks you've given me.
text: Mitchell comes up to her slowly, looks down at the checks.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I hoped to get enough to cover
dialog: them before they cleared. I wasn't
dialog: lucky.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You know what would happen to you
dialog: if I turned these over to the
dialog: police?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I have a rough idea.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You'd go to jail. For a long term.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Correct. I couldn't even afford to
dialog: pay a lawyer to defend me.
text: A beat. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What'll we do about it, Margo?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: She is much younger than I am.
dialog: That's something I'm going to have
dialog: to get used to. Isn't it, Larry?
dialog: They'll all be much younger than I
dialog: am. Here.
dialog: (she holds out the
dialog: checks)
dialog: Tear them up.
text: He takes them, puts them in his pocket and stands there
text: looking at her. A sob catches in her throat.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I guess I'm still in love with
dialog: you, Larry. What an idiot!
text: He reaches to take her in his arms. First she pushes him
text: off, then yields. He pulls her close and kisses her. Then,
text: as they come out of the kiss,
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I've always been a heel. I guess I
dialog: always will be.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You don't have to make a pose of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It's the only pose I have left.
dialog: I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have
dialog: my hotel bill.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (a little sharply)
dialog: I seem to recognize this routine.
text: First the kiss then the touch.
dialog: (she makes a hopeless
dialog: gesture.)
dialog: Oh, what's the use. You're you.
text: She turns and moves towards the desk.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I only have a couple of hundred.
text: She picks her bag up, holds it out. He comes up beside
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I seem to remember that you like
dialog: to help yourself.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (taking the bag)
dialog: That's not very kind.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Kind or not kind. What's the
dialog: difference? It always ends up the
dialog: same way.
text: He gives her a twisted smile, opens the bag, rummages
text: through it, opens the zipper pocket inside and comes out
text: with some currency and looks over, puts it in his pocket.
text: Puts the bag down on the desk, glances into the open drawer.
text: His look becomes fixed.
text: MITCHELL'S POV (what he sees), SHOOTING DOWN INTO THE
text: DRAWER, is a small, pearl-handled automatic, lying in the
text: corner. Mitchell's hand goes down into it, takes the gun.
text: TWO-SHOT of Margo and Mitchell as his hand comes up with
dialog: the gun.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (almost amused)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What does it look like?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: How long have you had it?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Years, why?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It's against the law to cross the
text: border with a gun. The Canadian
dialog: police might like to know about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: You already have the checks,
dialog: darling.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I didn't mean it that way
text: (he puts the gun
text: back in the drawer,
dialog: pushes the drawer
dialog: shut.)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's
text: throwing a party up in his penthouse
dialog: this evening. Take me?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: How about your new friend?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: I told you she's just..
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (cutting in sharply)
dialog: A girl you meet on the train.
dialog: Excuse my bringing it up again.
text: (she glances at her
dialog: wrist watch)
dialog: Be back in an hour. Right?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MARGO
text: In an hour, Larry.
text: Mitchell stares at her levelly for a moment, then goes
text: without a word.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MARGO'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Mitchell has just closed the door, stands with his hand on
text: the knob, a smile playing across his features. He starts
text: to whistle as he walks down the corridor. He takes a little
dialog: dance step perhaps, this is to indicate that his whole
text: attitude with Margo is just part of an act. He stops beside
text: the big sand jar, lights a cigarette, drops the match in
text: the jar, takes out the money from Margo's bag, flips it
text: with a smile on his face, puts it back in his pocket, takes
text: out the two checks Margo gave him, tears off the signatures,
text: places checks in his pocket, tears the signature fragments
text: into small pieces, drops them into the jar, goes on
text: whistling.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - DESK AND ELEVATOR BANK -- DAY
text: A couple of GUESTS at the desk. A CLERK is handing out
text: mail. CAMPBELL, the manager, is standing to one side. The
text: elevator comes down. Mitchell comes out, crosses to the
text: desk and addresses Campbell.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: Mr. Mitchell.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (airily)
dialog: A little something on account
dialog: perhaps?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Rather more than a little something,
dialog: Mr. Mitchell.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I'm afraid this is all for the
dialog: moment.
text: Campbell picks up the money, counts it, puts it down.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I think we'd better discuss this
dialog: in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the
dialog: sun will shine even brighter. Be
dialog: grateful for small mercies.
text: Campbell shrugs, reaches for the money.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Oh, I forgot. I have a dinner
dialog: engagement. Excuse me.
text: He removes a couple of bills from the money.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
text: He puts money in his pocket, turns away. Campbell looks
text: after him with cold anger. Mitchell dodges back into
text: elevator just as it is about to start up.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Hat and suitcase in sight. Light is on in the closet. Betty
text: is inside closet, hanging up clothes. As she comes out,
text: switching off light, DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. She opens door,
text: Mitchell breezes on past her. She registers annoyance,
text: then closes door. Mitchell crosses to the open French door
text: of the balcony.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Nice room. Balcony and everything.
dialog: Lovely view too.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Very nice Mitchell turns.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No thanks?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (same voice)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Suppose I hadn't known that
dialog: immigration inspector? Hadn't put
dialog: in a good word for you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm supposing.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I think you're a nice girl. I like
dialog: you. But I can read signs if the
dialog: print is large enough. It was your
dialog: manner more than the wedding ring
dialog: that bothered the inspector. A
dialog: sort of tenseness, as if you were
text: afraid of something.
text: Betty just goes on looking at him.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I have a darned good idea you're
dialog: name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: How about taking to Uncle Larry
dialog: into the old firm? He's a useful
dialog: guy to have on your side.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (no answer)
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (slight change of
dialog: pace)
dialog: Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not
dialog: suggesting you murdered anybody,
dialog: you know.
text: Betty reacts. He sees the reaction. His smile broadens.
text: Then very casually,
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Dine and dance tonight? I've got
dialog: fifty bucks to throw away.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not tonight.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm not in the mood for dining and
dialog: dancing.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: We have some nice places around
dialog: Vancouver.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm sure you have.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (puzzled a little)
dialog: Well, how about a breeze up to the
dialog: penthouse about six o'clock? A
dialog: friend of mine is throwing a
text: cocktail party up there.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I haven't been invited.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Nobody gets invited to Clark
dialog: Brandon's parties. They just go.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Perhaps I'd better get you
text: straightened out, Mr. Mitchell.
dialog: You've been rather nice to me, in
dialog: a couple of ways. And I'm grateful.
dialog: But I don't think this entitles
dialog: you to put me on a leash.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
text: Betty crosses to the door and opens it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm awfully sorry, but I'd like to
dialog: take a bath and get freshened up.
text: Mitchell hesitates, then comes across slowly to the door.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: The brush-off, huh?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm trying very hard to be polite
dialog: about it.
text: Mitchell grins, then suddenly reaches for her and kisses
text: her. She doesn't struggle, is quite impassive. After a
text: moment he let's go, steps back.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Don't I even get my face slapped?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (indicating the
dialog: open door)
dialog: Would you mind?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (a little puzzled,
dialog: confused by her
dialog: attitude)
dialog: Okay. You win.
text: HE STARTS OUT, TURNS TO SAY,
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: If you change your mind about the
dialog: cocktail party, or anything else,
dialog: give me a buzz.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: If I change my mind.
text: He goes. He closes the door. CAMERA MOVES IN ON HER FACE.
text: She wipes off her lips with her handkerchief, almost in an
text: absentminded way. The kiss didn't mean anything to her,
text: one way or another. There is great loneliness in her eyes.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
dialog: Showing a lot of activity, etc.
text: The time is 6:00 P.M. Approximately, but this is June in
dialog: Canada and broad daylight, and will be for several hours
dialog: yet.
text: In the background Betty comes in through glass doors from
text: the garden terrace, walks slowly across the lobby. People
text: are looking at her with interest, specially the men. As
text: she reaches the elevator bank, she glances off to one side,
text: past the desk. Her look becomes fixed.
text: CAMERA PANS AROUND TO SHOW A NEON SIGN "TAVERN" this side
text: of an archway and people going in.
text: She turns away from elevator, starts in that direction,
text: passes on beneath sign.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - TAVERN -- NIGHT
text: As Betty come in, stands looking around. It is lighted
text: somewhat dimly. There are a number of small tables,. There
text: is a bar but it is only for the use of the waiters. Betty
text: looks around for a vacant table, then starts moving along
text: looking for one. None empty, but at one sits a MAN alone.
text: He is about 35, clean fine drawn type, with a saturnine
text: expression. He glances up. Betty meets his eyes, starts to
text: turn away. Man indicates the chair opposite him. His manner
text: of doing this is so completely indifferent to her as a
text: person, that she hesitates.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: You can have the table yourself,
dialog: if you'd rather. I'm only killing
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, please.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Sit down then. We often have a
dialog: double up here.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I see.
text: She pulls the chair back, sits down. Brandon sits down. He
text: lights a cigarette, doesn't offer her one. She is watching
dialog: him, a little puzzled, probably has had very few experiences
text: of men not trying to pick her up in such circumstances.
text: Betty looks around at the scurrying WAITERS who pay no
text: attention to her yet.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (calling out sharply)
dialog: Oh waiter.
text: WAITER turns, sees him, immediately comes to stand at his
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Brandon, without speaking, indicates Betty. Waiter turns
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, Miss.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only.
dialog: Canadian law.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Beer?
dialog: (she shrugs)
dialog: Well, all right.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Beer or ale, Miss?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ale. I don't mind.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Right, Miss.
text: He turns away. Brandon is smiling at her faintly, She meets
text: his eyes, smiles back.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Brandon)
dialog: Your liquor laws..
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: Disgusting, aren't they? If you
dialog: really want a Martini, I know where
dialog: you can get one.
text: Betty looks inquiringly at him and doesn't speak.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: A fellow named Brandon has a
text: penthouse here. He's holding open
dialog: house. I was up there. Too noisy.
dialog: Bored.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (indifferently)
dialog: It might be worth a Martini to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't need it that badly. I don't
dialog: enjoy crashing other people's
dialog: parties.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: It's open-house. No crashing
dialog: involved. Anybody in the hotel's
dialog: welcome.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What did you say his name was?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow
dialog: about my age. Lot of money... that
dialog: he didn't make. Former American.
dialog: Now naturalized in Canada. Social
text: standing indeterminate. Manners
dialog: not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You don't sound as if you liked
dialog: him very much.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: No.. not very well. And I like his
dialog: friends even less. But..
text: (he waves his hand
dialog: indifferently)
dialog: If you really want a good dry
dialog: Martini..
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: As I said before...
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens
dialog: to be held to everything I've said
dialog: before, wouldn't you?
text: Betty suddenly laughs. The waiter brings the glass and the
text: bottle of bass ale, sets them down in front of her. Brandon
text: makes a motion and the waiter goes away without collecting.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're not paying for this. It's
dialog: quite enough that you let me sit
dialog: at your table.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I never pay for anything. They
dialog: just keep me here to amuse the
dialog: guests.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And do you amuse the guests?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No.
dialog: (indicating her
dialog: bottle of ale)
dialog: Are you really going to drink that
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're drinking it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (indicating his
dialog: almost untouched
dialog: glass)
dialog: I can be talked out of it. As a
dialog: matter of fact, I'd like a dry
dialog: Martini myself.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Would it make you anymore amusing?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Whatever you say.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (standing up and
dialog: putting money on
dialog: the table)
dialog: I don't know you and you don't
dialog: know me. I made a reasonably polite
dialog: suggestion. But I'm sure you'd
dialog: rather be alone.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I hate to be alone. But I've heard
dialog: all the approaches there are...
dialog: even yours.
text: Brandon turns back, stares down at her coldly.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Neatly said...but to the wrong
dialog: man. The trouble with pretty girls
dialog: is that they can't imagine anyone
dialog: thinking of anything else but the
dialog: fact they are pretty girls. I get
dialog: tired of it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (directly)
dialog: Do you think I don't?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (interested)
dialog: Thanks for the fresh air. That
dialog: felt good.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (standing up and
dialog: taking her bag)
dialog: You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He doesn't even know half the people
text: who come up to drink his liquor.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY/PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
text: An elevator comes up. Brandon and Betty come out. There is

text: elevators. They cross. Brandon opens the door casually,
text: without bothering to ring, users Betty in.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A big room, with French doors opening on a large terrace.
text: A few couples are dancing outside on the terrace and a few
text: more inside the room. There is a portable bar at one side
text: of the room and two WAITERS behind it. The dance music is
text: coming from a large Radio-Phonograph. Brandon and Betty
text: come in. Brandon shuts the door. There are eighteen or
text: twenty people around, with the usual alcoholic glitter in
text: their eyes and the usual strident voices and exaggerated
dialog: laughter.
text: CAMERA PANS BRANDON AND BETTY OVER TOWARDS THE BAR,
text: DISCOVERING Mitchell leaning against it, staring morosely
text: into a drink. He drains the last of it.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to bartender in a

dialog: Another.
text: BARTENDER takes a glass. Brandon and Betty come up to the

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: This lady would like a dry Martini.
dialog: So would I.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: He turns away. Mitchell looks up, sees Betty, reacts.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Well well. Baby wouldn't come with
dialog: me. Where did you pick her up?
text: Brandon glances from Betty to Mitchell puzzled, shrugs.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: The liquors lovely. The rest of
dialog: the party you can have.
text: He moves towards Betty, puts an arm around her. Betty rises
text: tries to pull away.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What's the matter, baby. Don't you
dialog: like me anymore?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Lay off, can't you?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Lay off what? This is my new girl
text: friend. Met her on the train.
dialog: She's very fond of me. Love at
dialog: first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
text: Brandon reacts. There is a certain contempt in his look at
text: Betty now. Bartender serves drinks impassively. Mitchell
text: grabs his, gulps half of it down. Betty quietly releases
text: herself and moves away from him.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: And I'd begun to think this was my
dialog: lucky day.
text: A liveried HOTEL SERVANT COMES INTO SHOT.
speaker_heading: SERVANT
dialog: (to Brandon)
dialog: You're wanted on the telephone,
dialog: Mr. Brandon. Mrs. West.
text: As the Servant says "Brandon", Betty reacts.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (to servant)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (to Betty with brutal
dialog: sarcasm)
dialog: If you are a friend of Larry
dialog: Mitchell's I'm sure I leave you in

dialog: Mitchell? Oh yes, he's here.
dialog: (he smiles a little
dialog: grimly)
text: He came up alone, but it seems he
text: has a new girl friend with him
dialog: now.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Don't be theatrical, Margo. What
dialog: do you care about Mitchell? Come
text: on up and have a drink.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - MARGO'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Margo on the phone.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (in a flat voice)
dialog: I haven't any intensions of being
dialog: theatrical. Of course I'll come
dialog: up. Goodbye.
text: She hangs up, stand for a moment, staring at nothing, then
text: she turns, picks her wrap out of the chair, puts it on,
text: crosses to the desk for her handbag. She opens the bag,
text: pauses, then in SLOW MOTION, pulls open the drawer of the
dialog: desk.
text: CAMERA IN CLOSE, studies her face as she looks down into
text: the drawer of the desk, which we do not see. But we already
text: know there is a gun there. Her body is quite motionless,
text: her expression frozen. When she moves we do not see whether
text: she takes the gun out of the drawer or not. We HEAR the

scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR IN MOTION UP -- NIGHT
text: A quiet, gentlemanly-looking MAN is leaning against the
text: back wall of the elevator, wearing a trench coat and a
dialog: soft hat. He is a homicide dick named KILLAINE, but you'd
text: never think that to look at him. Elevator stops, doors
text: open, and Margo enters.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR BOY
dialog: (very polite)
dialog: Did you have a nice day, Mrs.
dialog: West?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I had a rotten day, if its any of
dialog: your business.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR BOY
dialog: I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. West.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Don't let it break you up.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR BOY
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't do that, Mrs. West.
text: The man chuckles, Margo looks around at him.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What's so funny?
text: Killaine wipes the smile off his face.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (imitating boy)
dialog: I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. West.
text: As she stares at him, he takes his monocle out of his
text: pocket, polishes it, sticks it in his eye.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Oh, the Coldstream Guards.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Don't you take your hat off in
dialog: elevators?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: I never wear a hat.
dialog: (his face changes
dialog: to consternation)
dialog: Oh, so I am. I forgot.
dialog: (he takes his hat
dialog: off)

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Are you always this witty?
text: Killaine laughs as the door opens. Brandon stands in it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON

dialog: Mrs. West.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (not looking at
dialog: Killaine)
text: Fascinated.
text: Her eyes roam the room. She picks out Mitchell. Her
text: expression freezes.
speaker_heading: MARGO'S POV
text: WHAT SHE SEES -- Betty is sitting in her chair in a corner
text: and Mitchell is standing over her, his hand on the back of
text: the chair. Her expression is wooden. His is a mixture of
text: insolence and pleading.
text: CAMERA RETURNS TO MARGO, BRANDON AND KILLAINE as they cross
text: to the bar.
text: At the same time Mitchell leaves Betty, also crosses to
text: the bar, reaches it about the same time as Margo. Margo
text: gives Mitchell a long, cool, empty stare. Mitchell smiles

dialog: Martini.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (to Killaine)
dialog: You, Killaine?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Scotch and plain water, I think.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (not looking at him)
dialog: Warm water, no doubt.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: A private joke.
text: He gets the monocle out and sticks it in his eye again.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: It goes with this... cold houses
dialog: and warm drinks...the effete
dialog: Englishman.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You're not English.
text: Bartender serves drinks. Margo puts her bag down on the
text: bar. It makes a heavy CLUNKING SOUND. KILLAINE'S eyes go
text: to it, without too much expression. Mitchell reacts more.
text: To him the clunking sound has a meaning. He starts to reach
text: for the bag. Margo pointedly moves it away from him.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to Margo thickly)
dialog: I'm sorry. I forgot about calling
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: It's quite unimportant, Mr.
dialog: Mitchell. After all, you got what
dialog: you wanted.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Be nasty.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I have no intension of being nasty,
dialog: Mr. Mitchell.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: In that case, there's someone here
dialog: I'd like to introduce to you. Over
dialog: there.
text: Margo looks towards Betty. She reacts.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (almost to herself)
text: She is beautiful. And young.
text: (she turns back to
dialog: Mitchell)
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (aggressively)
dialog: I say YES!
text: Margo quietly turning her back on him and reaching for her
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You're not the type to be masterful,
dialog: darling. It takes character.
text: Mitchell reaches for her shoulder and spins her around,
text: causing her to slop some of her drink out on the bar.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (with sudden deadly
dialog: sweetness)
dialog: Of course, darling. Anything you
dialog: say.
text: She goes off with Mitchell. Killaine looks after then
text: puzzled. Brandon is indifferent.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That's what I like about cocktail
dialog: parties. Everyone is so perfectly
dialog: natural.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How's life treating you?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: The usual grind.
speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (staring at her)
dialog: You're very attractive, my dear.
dialog: And you look very unsophisticated.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Unsophisticated?
dialog: (he laughs nastily)
dialog: If I knew about this babe...
text: Betty stands up quickly.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I think I'd like to dance.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Why certainly, baby.
text: He puts his arm around Betty and dances off with her,

text: CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as they dance.
text: They pass Mr. Clarendon, who is sitting as usual with his

dialog: attention to anything.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Mitchell as
dialog: they dance)
dialog: Please be a little more careful
dialog: how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: How careful should I be?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't like being referred to as
dialog: babe, or addressed as baby. I don't
dialog: like your possessive attitude, nor
dialog: your hints of secret knowledge. In
dialog: fact, to be very frank, Mr.
dialog: Mitchell, I don't think I like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Maybe you're going to have to like
dialog: me.
text: He disengages her left hand enough to hold it up and look
text: at it.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You've shed the ring, haven't you?
dialog: Took my advice. That's the girl.
dialog: Keep right on taking my advice and
dialog: we'll get somewhere.

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I think you're drunk.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Just drunk enough.

text: He pushes her head back father and kisses her solidly on
text: the mouth. She finally breaks away from him with flashing
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What's the matter, baby? Don't you
dialog: like being kissed?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (with cold fury)
dialog: Next time you try that, Mr.

dialog: then very pointedly)
dialog: ..don't. I'm warning you.
text: BRANDON AND MARGO COME INTO SHOT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find
dialog: yourself a nice secluded park bench.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (airily)
dialog: Did I do something wrong?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I wouldn't know. Just do it
dialog: somewhere else. There is such a
dialog: thing as good manners.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: How would you know, Brandon?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: Want to walk out... or get thrown
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
text: The two men glare at each other. Mitchell finally shrugs
text: then goes towards the door.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (to Brandon, quietly)
text: It takes two to clinch. Clark.
dialog: Nice to have seen you.
text: She starts towards the door. Brandon hurries quickly to
text: open it for her. She goes without looking at him, her mouth
text: tight. He shuts the door, looks back towards Betty, who
text: has remained standing perfectly still. She takes a
text: handkerchief out of her bag and scrubs her mouth off as
text: Brandon comes back to her. Clarendon stands up slowly.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (to Betty, offhand)
dialog: Dance?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: (to Brandon)
dialog: Where I come from, Mr. Brandon,
text: the host tries to protect his guests
dialog: from insult.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I stopped him.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: And if he fails, he at least has
dialog: the good manners to apologize.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't exactly regard Larry
dialog: Mitchell's pick-ups...
text: Clarendon turns back on him. Then--
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: (to Betty, with
dialog: courtly gesture)
dialog: We haven't been introduced. But if
dialog: you'll overlook that, I'm sure
dialog: that between us we can contrive a

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (smiling at him
dialog: warmly)
dialog: Thank you very much.
text: They go towards the door side by side.
text: Brandon turns and CAMERA PANS HIM BACK TO BAR where Killaine
text: has remained motionless, his drink untasted.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Would it have helped if I'd knocked
dialog: him down?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Hardly. Who's the girl?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Somebody Mitchell picked up on the
dialog: train. I don't even know her name.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: She doesn't look like a girl who
dialog: would let herself be picked up on
text: a train.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That's what I thought, at first.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Maybe somebody else ought to have
dialog: thrown this party.

text: The double doors at the back are closed and a BAILIFF stands
text: with his back to them. Suddenly, one of the doors is pushed
text: open, almost knocking the Bailiff out of the way.
text: He turns angrily as HENRY KINSOLVING enters. The Bailiff

dialog: the Jury.
text: ELIZABETH stands up slowly and turns towards the Jury, who
text: do not look at her. They stare somewhere over her head.
text: The Clerk turns back to the Jury.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Gentlemen of the Jury, have you
dialog: reached a verdict?
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: (standing)
dialog: We have.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: And what is your verdict?
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: We the Jury, find the Defendant,
dialog: Elizabeth Kinsolving, guilty of
dialog: murder in the first degree.
text: There is a surge of noise in the well of the court. The
text: Judge raps sharply with his gavel. A couple of PRESSMEN
text: start to get up, then look back and see that the doors are
text: guarded and sit down again. The Prosecutor looks grimly
text: satisfied; he glances at the DEFENDING COUNCIL with a half
text: smile. Defense Counsel, whose name is LEAMINGTON, is shocked
text: and pale. Elizabeth shows no reaction at all. Henry
text: Kinsolving draws his mouth a little tighter, and there is
text: a gleam in his eye. The Spectators look, for the most part,
text: very satisfied. Leamington comes to his feet.
speaker_heading: LEAMINGTON
dialog: (in a strangled
dialog: voice)
dialog: Motion to pool the Jury, if it
dialog: please the Court.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: So ordered.
text: The Clerk now proceeds to poll the Jury, saying "Juror No.
dialog: 1 what is your verdict?" And the Juror answering "Guilty
dialog: of murder in the first degree." "Juror No. 2, what is your
text: verdict?" Etc. This is covered by a series of CLOSE UPS
text: all answer clearly until the Clerk comes to Juror No. 7,
text: who mumbles in a low voice.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to Juror No. 7)
dialog: Speak a little louder please.
text: Juror No. 7 is staring hard at Elizabeth. His face is
text: twisted with emotion. He is the only Juror who has looked
text: at her. He swallows, doesn't answer, then his eyes go to
text: Henry Kinsolving. Henry Kinsolving glares at Juror No. 7.
text: Juror No. 7 wilts.
speaker_heading: JUROR NO. 7
dialog: (thickly and
dialog: hesitatingly)
dialog: Guilty of murder in the first
dialog: degree.
text: The Clerk completes the polling of the Jury, then turns to
text: the Judge. The Judge nods and Clerk sits down. The courtroom
text: starts to get noisy again, and the Judge uses his gavel.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Order in the Court!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The Court now has a statement to
dialog: make.
text: He glances towards Elizabeth, who is still standing rigidly.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Please sit down, Mrs. Kinsolving.
text: Elizabeth sits, and clasps her hands in front of her.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: This court, like most courts, has
dialog: occasionally been guilty of judicial
dialog: error. Prior to the commencement
dialog: of this trail, Mr. Leamington, as
dialog: attorney for the Defendant, made a
dialog: motion for a change of venue on
dialog: the ground that a fair trial could
dialog: not be had by this Defendant in
dialog: this jurisdiction. Most of you
dialog: know why this motion was made.
dialog: The Defendant was alleged to have
dialog: been tried and convicted in the
dialog: columns of the daily newspaper
dialog: owned by her father-in-law, Mr.
dialog: Henry Kinsolving, and as a result
dialog: public opinion was said to have
dialog: been prejudiced to the extent that
dialog: it was doubtful twelve Jurors could
dialog: be found with open minds. This
dialog: Court regretfully denied the motion.
dialog: It did not believe that a Jury
dialog: with open minds could not be found.
dialog: The members of this Jury declared
dialog: on oath that their minds were open.
dialog: The Court had no reason at that
dialog: time to disbelieve them.
text: The Judge looks at the Jury sternly, and they react in
text: various ways. The Judge's eyes go to Henry Kinsolving, who
text: stares back at him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Elizabeth Kinsolving has been tried
dialog: and found guilty of murder of her
dialog: husband, Lee Kinsolving. Lee
dialog: Kinsolving was the only son of our
dialog: most prominent citizen. Mr.
dialog: Kinsolving controls, or is said to
dialog: control, our leading bank, many of
dialog: our business enterprises and our
dialog: only daily newspaper. He affords
dialog: employment to a large number of
dialog: our citizens. His influence on our
dialog: affairs is very great.
dialog: (dramatic pause)
dialog: Perhaps to great.
text: There is an upsurge of noise in the Court and the Bailiff
text: shots for order. Prosecutor jumps to his feet.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Your Honor, I protest that
dialog: statement!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sit down, Mr. Prosecutor. Your are
dialog: out of order.
text: Prosecutor swallows, looks back at Henry Kinsloving, shrugs
text: and sits down again. Leamington is leaning forward with a
text: gleam in his eye. Elizabeth is still deadpan.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: We all new Lee Kinsolving well, We
dialog: watched him grow up. We observed
dialog: that he was proud and hot tempered,
dialog: and had a strain of arrogance, not
dialog: unlike others of his family.
text: He looks meaningfully at Henry Kinsolving.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: From this town Lee Kinsolving went
dialog: to fight for his country. And to
dialog: this town, before he went overseas,
dialog: he brought the wife he had married
dialog: up North. To us he returned a war
dialog: hero badly wounded, condemned for
dialog: the rest of his life to wear a
text: heavy brace around his neck.
dialog: Competent medical testimony has
dialog: shown that without that brace a
dialog: very slight movement might have
dialog: been enough to snap his spinal
dialog: cord. This injury humiliated and
dialog: embittered Lee Kinsolving, made
text: him morose and violent, and perhaps
dialog: caused him to drink to excess. The
dialog: Defendant has admitted that there
dialog: were bitter quarrels between herself
dialog: and her husband. Such a quarrel
dialog: took place on the night of his
dialog: death, Upon the manner of that
dialog: death this entire proceeding rests.
text: The Judge pauses and looks out over the courtroom, which
text: is very quiet now, He pours himself a glass of water and
text: takes a drink from it.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: In my summing up to the Jury I
dialog: emphasized that the case for the
dialog: prosecution was, as so many murder
dialog: cases are, purely circumstantial.
dialog: It was alleged that while Lee
text: Kinsolving slept, perhaps in a
text: drunken stupor and perhaps not,
dialog: the Defendant removed the neck
text: brace from his neck and jerked his
text: head sufficiently to rupture the
dialog: spinal cord and cause death. It is
dialog: admitted that the Defendant was
text: found holding the neck brace in
text: her hand, and bending over her
text: husband's body, which was lying on
dialog: the bed. Not in the bed, mind you,
text: but sprawled across it. The
dialog: Defendant has testified that lee
dialog: Kinsolving himself removed the
text: neck brace to torment her, as it
dialog: were, with the great danger in
dialog: which this placed him. Then he
text: started to walk towards her, holding
text: the brace in his hands, and that
text: being unsteady on his feet, he
dialog: stumbled and fell backwards across
dialog: the bed. And this fall broke his
dialog: neck, although at the time she did
dialog: not know it. She has testified
dialog: that she picked the brace up from
text: the floor and was about to attempt
dialog: to replace it on his neck when her
text: father-in-law entered the room and
dialog: found her in that position.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: By its verdict the Jury declared
dialog: that Elizabeth Kinsolving's account
dialog: of the death of her husband to be
dialog: impossible of belief.
text: The Judge sips a little more water, then continues.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
text: In all murder trails, a motion by
dialog: the Defense for a directed verdict
dialog: of acquittal before the case goes
dialog: to the Jury is more or less
dialog: automatic. It is usually
dialog: perfunctory, and for that reason
dialog: immediately denied. The laws of
dialog: this state, and a few other
dialog: jurisdictions, confer upon a Court
dialog: a right to reserve its ruling upon
dialog: such a motion until after the Jury
dialog: has rendered its verdict. In this
dialog: proceeding, I, as presiding Judge,
dialog: availed myself of this power. I
dialog: most honestly hoped that the Jury
dialog: in this case might act as
dialog: impartially as it declared itself
dialog: to be.
text: The Prosecuting Attorney again jumps to his feet, then
text: changes his mind, sits down with a frustrated angry
text: movement. Kinsolving is leaning forward, glaring. The Jury
text: are now very uncomfortable. The is a BUZZ OF NOISE and the
text: Bailiff again shouts for order.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Let me remind you that a Jury is
dialog: the sole Judge of fact, and further
dialog: let me remind you that the Jury
dialog: must judge all the facts. It may
dialog: not select nor create nor change
dialog: facts. It may only interpret them.
dialog: It may not declare something
dialog: impossible which in fact is merely
dialog: extremely difficult to believe.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Impossible is a very big word.
dialog: (another beat.)
dialog: If we believe Elizabeth Kinsolving's
dialog: sworn testimony, we must also
dialog: believe that Lee Kinsolving
dialog: performed an act which was almost
text: certain to cause his death. It is
dialog: difficult... very difficult to
dialog: believe. But is it impossible? Are
dialog: we sure that he knew it would cause
dialog: his death? Or that in his then
dialog: state of mind, he even considered
dialog: the consequences at all? Many people
dialog: have attempted suicide as a result
dialog: of domestic quarrels. Not all have
dialog: succeeded, nor meant to succeed.
dialog: And surely not all those who did
dialog: succeed... fully intended to. Not
dialog: all knew what they were doing and
dialog: those who did know, there were
dialog: surely a few whose desire to hurt
dialog: others overcame their fear of
dialog: hurting themselves. We cannot
dialog: know what was in Lee Kinsolving's
dialog: Mind. Therefore, some element of
dialog: doubt must infallibly remain. It
dialog: was not necessary for this Jury to
dialog: declare its belief in the
dialog: Defendant's innocence, nor to
dialog: declare its that Lee Kinsolving by
dialog: accident or his own intent. It was
dialog: necessary for the Jury to admit to
dialog: themselves, as reasonable men, the
dialog: possibility.... however slight...
dialog: that Elizabeth Kinsolving's story
dialog: was true. This possibility the
dialog: Jury has refused to admit.
dialog: (dramatic pause)
dialog: It therefore becomes my duty to
dialog: declare that such a possibility
dialog: does in fact exist... and the Jury's
dialog: refusal to recognize it was a
dialog: failure to exercise it proper
dialog: function.
text: A rising, antagonistic sound begins to surge from the
text: spectators and Henry Kinsolving comes to his feet, slowly
text: and rigidly. The Judge ignore him and looks straight at
text: the foreman of the Jury, and speaks the rest of his speech
text: in a clear, ringing, dominating voice.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The Court therefore rules that the
dialog: motion of the Attorney for the
dialog: Defense for a directed verdict of
dialog: not guilty be now granted. The
dialog: verdict of guilty brought by this
text: Jury is herby set aside, and a
dialog: verdict of not guilty is to be
text: entered on the record.
dialog: (his voice bow rises
dialog: almost to a shout)
dialog: And the Defendant, Elizabeth
dialog: Kinsolving, is here with discharged
dialog: from custody of the Sheriff of
dialog: this county.
text: PANDEMONIUM and UPROAR in the Court. The Bailiff shouts
text: for order. The Judge stands slowly, looks a moment out
text: over the Court, then looks at Elizabeth, smiles at her
text: faintly, turns, and starts back towards his chambers.
text: CAMERA PANS over to Henry Kinsolving. He stands like a
text: statue, an icy rage, his face working, while behind him
text: the noise of the spectators goes on. Kinsolving turns his
text: head towards Elizabeth, then moves stiffly over to her.
text: CAMERA PANNING, he comes over to her. Leamington, the
text: Defense Attorney, and the matron are standing beside her.
speaker_heading: KINSLOVING
dialog: (with restrained
dialog: fury)
dialog: For four years I endured your
dialog: presence in my house, although I
dialog: well knew you were no fit wife for
dialog: my son.. That he had married in
dialog: haste, and that he would repent it
dialog: bitterly if he survived the war. I
dialog: had no thought that he would die
dialog: under his own roof, nor that the
dialog: reward of my patience would be to
dialog: stand beside his grave. I have
dialog: done my best to avenge him. So far
dialog: I have failed. But I have not
dialog: finished. You are free to go where
dialog: you will, but there will be another
dialog: day of reckoning, somewhere,
dialog: sometime. And when that day comes,
dialog: I will be there. And that time you
dialog: will not escape.
text: Elizabeth's eyes widen with horror. In the background the
text: crowd is still roaring, like peals of thunder.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE TO ELIZABETH'S EYES as at the
text: beginning of this flashback.
scene_heading: FLASH FORWARD:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: CAMERA WITHDRAWS and find her sitting up in bed in the
text: ROYAL HOTEL. THUNDER is pealing outside, but now more
text: distantly. There is a sudden downpour of RAIN. Betty sweeps
text: the bedclothes aside. Reaches for a robe, and crosses to
text: close the French doors. Over her shoulder we see a portion
text: of the small balcony, a chaise, and as Betty starts to
text: close the door, she stops frozen. There is someone lying
text: on the chaise. She starts out into the rain.
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BALCONY -- NIGHT
text: As she comes out, approaches the chaise, leans down, the
text: rain beating on her. She shakes the shoulder of a man on
text: the chaise. He doesn't move. One of his hands drops limply
text: and swings a little. Horror shows in Betty's eyes. She
text: reaches out and touches the man's face and WE SEE for the
dialog: first time that this is Larry Mitchell, and we realize
text: that he is dead.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PORTER'S DESK/CORRIDOR/MAIN FLOOR --
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: The NIGHT PORTER is seated at his desk, reading a paper.
text: He is a middle-aged man in uniform and military bearing,
text: with a row or ribbons across his chest. Probably, in order
dialog: of seniority, a Military Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, the
dialog: Long Service Medal, and two or three campaign ribbons.
text: Betty, now fully dressed, COMES SLOWLY INTO THE SHOT and
text: stops by his desk. Porter lays down his paper and stands
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Good evening, Miss.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How soon can I get a plane to
dialog: Seattle?
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: I'm afraid there's nothing more
dialog: tonight, Miss. Unless you charter
text: a plane.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How long would that take?
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Well... they have to service the
dialog: plane... and get a pilot down to
dialog: the field, unless there's one
dialog: hanging around there still... and
dialog: then they have to get the
dialog: immigration officer...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Immigration Officer?
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Crossing the border this time of
dialog: night they're a bit particular.
dialog: You'd have to prove your identity,
dialog: you know... unless you've got a
dialog: passport. They might even want to
dialog: know why you're in such a hurry.
dialog: (he grins)
dialog: Otherwise they might think...
text: He breaks off, staring at her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: They might think I was running
text: away from something.
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Possibly, Miss.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Thank you very much.
text: She turns and exits. CAMERA FOLLOWS HER ALONG. She turns
text: the corner by the elevator bank, starts into the elevator.
text: Brandon is standing there in a light overcoat, with his
text: hat in his hand. She get's in without noticing him.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR IN MOTION UP -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Leaving us so soon, Miss Mayfield?
text: She realizes his presence.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't blame you.. For running

text: Betty reacts sharply, controls herself, says nothing.
text: Elevator stops, doors open.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR BOY
dialog: Good night, Miss.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Good night.
text: She starts out. Brandon after her.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR BOY
dialog: This isn't the penthouse floor,
dialog: Mr. Brandon.
text: Brandon keeps going.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
text: Betty is walking quickly down the corridor towards her

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Miss Mayfield...
text: Betty stops turns, and he comes up to her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I know it's a littler late for an
dialog: apology.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (in a strained, un
dialog: natural voice)
dialog: Much too late.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Don't take it so big... it isn't a
dialog: tragedy.
text: Betty goes into a peal of hysterical laughter, Brandon
text: grabs hold of her arm and shakes it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What's the matter with you?
text: Betty stops laughing just as suddenly as she began.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You said it wasn't a tragedy.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What's funny about that? If you
dialog: pick up people like Larry Mitchell
dialog: other people are bound to get funny
dialog: ideas about you. The world is full
dialog: of Larry Mitchells.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There's one less tonight.
text: Brandon reacts. Silently she holds out a key. He takes it.
text: It's a tabbed hotel room key.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: DOOR OPENS
text: Brandon comes in, stands aside as Betty comes in. He shuts

speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Out on the balcony.
text: CAMERA PANS Brandon across the room to the balcony door,
text: he steps out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BALCONY -- NIGHT
text: Brandon enters. He goes quickly to chaise, stares down,
text: bends, appears to pick something up. What is it not seen.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Betty is standing motionless in the middle of the floor.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: Through the heart, apparently.
dialog: Very little blood. What's the story?
text: Betty looks him straight in the eye.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There isn't one.. That anyone would
dialog: believe. I went for a walk after
dialog: dinner, down to the ocean...alone...
dialog: I came up and went to bed. I didn't
dialog: sleep very well. Then there was a
text: thunderstorm. And it began to rain.
dialog: I went across to close the French
dialog: door. That's the first time I saw
dialog: him out there.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He got in here how?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not with my consent, strange as it
dialog: seems. I don't know how he got in.
dialog: I don't know anything.
text: Brandon brings his hand up.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Ever see this before?
text: Betty looks down. In his hand is an automatic with a pearl
dialog: handle.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No. And I've never fired a gun in
dialog: my life, Aren't you supposed not
dialog: to touch it?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Sure... but somebody always does..
text: He puts the gun down on the table carelessly, gets out a
text: cigarette case and offers her one. She takes it and he
text: lights it for her. Her hand is shaky. Their faces are very
text: close together. He holds the lighter close to her eyes.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Lovely eyes... honest eyes..
text: The light goes out.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: They'll know whether he killed
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How did you meet him?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: On a train. He said he lived here,
dialog: and he offered to make a reservation
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Nice of him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He knew the immigration officer.
dialog: He eased himself in.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He was a great boy for that. What
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That's all there is.
text: Brandon takes her by the shoulders and pulls her close,
text: looking into her eyes.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: They're still honest eyes... but
text: there's something behind them.
text: He pulls her closer, about to kiss her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Go ahead...if you want to. It
dialog: doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'd rather wait until it does
dialog: matter.
text: He lets go of her and starts across the room, picks up
text: telephone. Brandon turns with the telephone in his hand.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You tried to run away.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There wasn't any plane.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It's always a mistake to run away.
dialog: Always.

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Brandon is standing at the French window, a cup of coffee
text: in his hand. CAMERA PULLS BACK AS his eyes go over to Betty
text: who is in a chair with an untouched cup of black coffee on
text: the table beside her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (going towards her)
dialog: Want a spike in it?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (without looking at
dialog: him)
dialog: No thanks.
text: Her voice and expression are dead and exhausted. CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK FURTHER to SHOW Margo and Clarendon sitting
text: across the room from Betty. Margo is staring at Betty with
text: cold hostility. She is wearing slacks, but otherwise dressed
text: with care and finish. Clarendon is fully dressed and has
text: his silver-topped cane between his legs, but has slippers
text: on his feet.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You make friends quickly, don't
dialog: you, Clark?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: And without much discrimination.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Leave that one lay.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: They still hang women in Canada,
dialog: I've heard.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
text: So much less refined than frizzling
text: them in the chair.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Oh, shut up!
text: (she looks down at
dialog: his feet)
dialog: You haven't even got your spats
dialog: on.
text: Brandon crosses to coffee table, picks up coffee pot and
text: goes to Margo with it.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Think I'll have trouble staying
dialog: awake?
text: Brandon fills her cup silently. Margo chokes. Bites on her
text: handkerchief hard. She controls herself.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I'm sorry. This thing has just
dialog: knocked me silly. How long do we
dialog: have to wait for this police
dialog: character?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Until he comes. He's a nice guy.
dialog: You've met him.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: That comedian?
text: Betty looking across at Brandon with sudden interest.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Don't let the eyeglass fool you.
dialog: That's what it's for.
text: DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. Brandon crosses to open door. A plain-
text: clothes Dick named HANDLEY is standing there.
speaker_heading: HANDLEY
dialog: You Mr. Brandon?
text: Brandon nods.
speaker_heading: HANDLEY
text: Inspector Killaine's compliments.
dialog: He'll be up in another ten minutes.
text: Brandon nods again, and as Handley starts to turn away,
text: Brandon starts to close the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BALCONY -- NIGHT
text: Portable lights have been rigged up and a POLICE
text: PHOTOGRAPHER is taking photographs of the body. As he
text: finishes, a sheet is thrown over it and the photographer
text: starts to dismantle his equipment and pack it up. A couple
text: of PLAIN-CLOTHES MEN are standing around, and one of them
text: named GORE, a detective sergeant, a big sore-head who
text: doesn't like anybody. As the photographer extinguishes one
text: of the lights and starts to wind up the cord, Gore looks
text: off and scowls.
text: Killiane ENTERS SHOT briskly. He is wearing a trenchcoat
dialog: and no hat.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: You in charge here?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: So it seems Sergeant.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant,
dialog: but once in a while...for moral
dialog: purposes...you might address me as
text: "Inspector". In moments of extreme
dialog: desperation, you might even call
dialog: me "sir".
text: He goes over to the chaise, lifts the sheet off corpse,
text: looks down, replaces sheet, comes back to Gore.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I knew him. He was easy to dislike,
dialog: poor chap.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: They tell me he'll be a great loss
dialog: to the liquor trade. This Mayfield
dialog: girl...
text: He breaks off as Killaine reacts
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: ... I supposed you knew her, too,
dialog: Inspector.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I've met her.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: It's her room. She only got to the
dialog: Hotel this afternoon,. With him.
dialog: (he indicates body
dialog: on chaise)
dialog: I guess he took too much for
dialog: granted. Here's the gun.
text: He takes it out of his pocket and holds it out on a
text: handkerchief. Killaine takes the gun from him, handkerchief
dialog: and all.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?
dialog: (he looks a little
dialog: closer)
dialog: No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
speaker_heading: GORE
text: Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun.
text: U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it.
text: It was on a table in there.
text: He nods towards room. Killaine frowns.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Nobody's been questioned yet. You
dialog: noticed the wound entry?
text: Killaine nods.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Much too low for a suicide. Not
dialog: conclusive, of course. But a woman
dialog: of ordinary height, standing rather
text: close to a tall man, such as he
dialog: was...
dialog: (indicating corpse)
dialog: ...would be apt to shoot him about
dialog: where he got shot.
text: Killaine nods again.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Then there's the shell.
text: He takes out a small envelope, hands it to Killaine.
speaker_heading: GORE
text: This make of gun throws a shell
text: backwards, high, and to the right.
text: The chaise is only about four feet
text: from the wall.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: So the shell ought to have gone
dialog: over?
speaker_heading: GORE
text: Unless the gun was slanted up.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: So the wound and the shell give
dialog: you the same answer.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Right. A clean deduction from
dialog: observed facts. They've got to be
dialog: simple once in a while, Inspector.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: I've always looked forward to it.
dialog: All right, let's get him out of
dialog: here and tidy up.

speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: I'd take a look in her clothes

text: Killaine nods and exits scene.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Killaine enters from the balcony then stands a moment,
text: looking around, crosses to dressing table, looks down, and
dialog: we SEE traces of fingerprint powder on the toilet articles
text: and bottles. He doesn't touch anything. He crosses to
text: closet, opens door. A light goes on inside. He starts in.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S CLOSET -- NIGHT
text: Killaine examines several garments, takes a sports coat
text: off hanger, opens it up at lining. His looks becomes fixed
text: and intent. He reacts. (What he sees is that the sewed-in
text: label has been removed from the garment.) Slowly he replaces
text: the coat, then takes down another garment, goes through
text: the same performance. He whistles very softly between his
text: teeth, stands a moment with a puzzled expression on his
text: face, replaces the garment. Exits closet. Light goes out.

scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LOBBY -- NIGHT
text: As elevator come up, Killaine exits elevator, crosses,
text: presses buzzer beside Brandon's door. Brandon opens it,
text: Killaine nods to him, passes him on the way in.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As Killaine enters, stops, looking around.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,
dialog: Mrs. West, Mr. Clarendon.
text: He turns to Betty.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Miss Mayfield. There's not much I
dialog: can do tonight. But there is one
dialog: thing.
text: He moves across to Clarendon, takes gun and handkerchief
text: out of his pocket and holds it so only Clarendon can see
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen
dialog: this before?
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know
dialog: much about..
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Recently, then.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Thank you.
text: He moves to Margo, holds gun in front of her.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Mr. West?
text: Margo's eyes go down very slowly. She stares at the gun
text: for a long moment before speaking.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (in a choked voice)
dialog: I never saw it before.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Positive?
text: Margo lifts her face to him and nods.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Yes, I've seen it before.
text: Killaine reacts sharply. Killaine catches the reaction
text: with the corner of his eye, but appears not to pay any
text: attention. Brandon obviously does see the reaction.
text: Killaine turns back to Brandon.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside
dialog: the chaise, I picked it up. Don't
dialog: ask me why. I ought to know better.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Quite sure you had no motive?
text: Killaine glances sidewise at Betty.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Could be.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I rather thought so. And before
dialog: that, had you ever seen the gun?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No.
text: Margo is seen to react with great relief which she tries
text: to conceal. Killaine gives another quick sidelong look.
text: Brandon has continued to watch her.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (to Brandon)
dialog: It was lying where on the balcony?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: Near his right hand. About a foot
dialog: away. Perhaps more. Good heavens,
text: one doesn't use a tape measure.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: We do, when we get the chance.
text: Killaine turns so that he faces Margo and Clarendon.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I needn't keep you any longer, Mr.
dialog: Clarendon.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Thank you. It is rather late...
dialog: and I'm not young anymore. Good
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: Not quiet yet.
text: He crosses and opens door. Clarendon goes out. Killaine
text: shuts door, goes to Margo.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You knew Mitchell pretty well,
dialog: didn't you, Mrs. West?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I was in love with him... which
dialog: shows you the quality of my brains.
dialog: (bursting out--
dialog: looking at Betty)
dialog: Why don't you ask her about the
dialog: gun?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I shall. From your knowledge of
dialog: Mitchell, would you say he would
dialog: be likely to commit suicide?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Anybody could commit suicide, if
dialog: he felt low enough. I've felt it
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Then why not give Miss Mayfield
dialog: the benefit of the doubt?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I'd be delighted to... anytime you
dialog: can show me the doubt. I'll wrap
text: it up in tissue paper and put a
text: Christmas seals on it for her.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
text: Margo flounces to door, jerks it open before anybody can
text: get there to hold it for her, and goes out, banging the
text: door after her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How about a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: No thanks. I had some. How would
dialog: you like to take a walk for, say,
dialog: half and hour?
text: Brandon glances at Betty, then back at Killaine, Shrugs.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: All right.
text: He crosses, gets hat and coat, goes to door and out.
text: Killaine turns to Betty.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't know her.. or particularly
dialog: want to.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You probably know the type. You
dialog: find them in hotels and resorts
dialog: all over the world. They always
dialog: have clothes, and money, and usually
dialog: have had three or four husbands.
text: They dress and enamel themselves
dialog: with great care. They worry a great
dialog: deal about those little lines at
text: the corner of the eyes.. And they
dialog: demonstrate their incompetence at
dialog: the art of living bet getting mixed
dialog: up with people like Larry Mitchell.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Tell me about yourself, Miss
dialog: Mayfield.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I was born in New York City. I
dialog: grew up. And here I am.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'll have to know a little more
dialog: than that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm sorry, that's all there is.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Miss Mayfield, the humor of the
dialog: situation escapes me. Within 24
dialog: hours I shall know officially
dialog: whether Mitchell was murdered.
dialog: Privately, I'm quite sure of it
dialog: now. It happened in your room, and
dialog: you came to Vancouver with him..
dialog: At any rate, he made your hotel
dialog: reservation.. And you arrived
dialog: together. Here in this room he
dialog: behaved nastily to you, and you
dialog: said something to him which might
dialog: be taken as a threat. A few hours
dialog: later he was found dead on your
dialog: balcony. Would it be too much too
dialog: suggest that all these circumstances
dialog: taken together are a little
dialog: suspicious?
text: Betty doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Please answer my question.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You didn't ask a question. You
dialog: made a speech.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That's an evasion and you know it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It is?
text: Their eyes meet in a long stare.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - MARGO'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: There is some moonlight. In the foreground, the back of a
text: man seated in a chair. Door opens, Margo is silhouetted
text: against corridor light. She switches light on, shuts door,
text: turns, and reacts violently. Clarendon is sitting in chair
text: with his cane between his knees. CAMERA PANS her over to
dialog: Clarendon.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (tensely)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: I don't think you locked your door.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss
text: Mayfield left her door unlocked.
dialog: Or if she didn't, there's a passkey
text: on every floor in the linen room.
text: The head porter has a passkey. The
text: bell captain has a passkey. The
text: hotel's full of passkeys.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Passkey?
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: Or--since one is a well-known and
dialog: respected guest--one could go to
dialog: the desk in the lobby and say "Miss
text: Mayfield seems to have lost her
dialog: room key--have you another"? They
dialog: always have another.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Don't be a fool. I loved him. He
dialog: wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: And now that he's safe from all
dialog: other women, you can go on loving
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You nasty, sardonic--
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: Sardonic, if you will my dear.
dialog: Bust nasty. You lied about the
dialog: gun.
text: Margo reacts, shocked. Clarendon gets slowly to his feet.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: I'm a very observant man. You had
dialog: something in your bag this
dialog: afternoon, Something that causes
dialog: you to hold it in a particular
dialog: way. Something that made a
dialog: particular sound when you put it
dialog: down on the bar. You went out with
dialog: Mitchell. None of us ever saw him
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: That's not enough.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: I saw your face this evening when
dialog: the detective showed you the gun.
dialog: You lied. It was obvious.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: He saw my face too.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: So he did--but he hasn't told you
dialog: what he saw. I have.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: They'll arrest that girl.
text: Everything points to her.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: Convenient, isn't it?
text: He starts towards the door.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: One of these days, you're going to
text: wake up in the middle of the night
dialog: and find that you've cut your
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: How clumsy. I'd never forgive
dialog: myself. Good night my dear.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You could have got in that room,
dialog: just as you got in here. How do I
dialog: know you didn't kill Larry?
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: With what motive?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Nastiness. You're nasty with words.
dialog: Why wouldn't you be nasty with
dialog: deeds once in a while? You hated
dialog: him--and I know why.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: He was very easy to hate. If you'll
dialog: look in your mirror, when you are
dialog: in a better temper- you'll know
dialog: why.
text: Margo just stares at him.
speaker_heading: CLARENDON
dialog: Very silly of me, isn't it? I'm
dialog: not as well-off as I was once- and
dialog: I'm used to my little comforts.
text: He exits. Margo looks after him, thunderstruck.
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - TERRACE -- NIGHT
text: Killaine is standing at wall, looking out over view. He is
text: smoking. He points up with cigarette.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That star up there is Alphard.
dialog: "The lonely", they call him. I
dialog: wonder why he's lonely? Perhaps
dialog: he's a policeman--a celestial
dialog: policeman?
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Betty, who is staring at him.
text: He turns slowly.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Well, that's not getting us
dialog: anywhere. You won't tell me who
dialog: you are, or give any account of
dialog: yourself. You won't even give me
dialog: your address in the United States.
dialog: Why? Unhappy marriage?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Who told you I was married?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: There's the clear mark of a wedding
dialog: ring on your finger.
text: She turns, walks abruptly away, then back into the living
text: room. Killaine follows.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As Killaine enters. Betty is already inside. She sits down.
text: BETTY.
dialog: I want a cigarette.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: The room's full of cigarettes.
dialog: But of course one would have to be
dialog: handed to you.
text: He goes to her, takes out sliver case, and opens it. She
text: takes one, is about to return the case to his pocket when:
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Let me see that.
text: He holds case out to her. There is an inlaid design on it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Your family coat of arms, Mr.
dialog: Killaine?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (crossly)
dialog: Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Stop saying you're sorry. I want
dialog: information, not regrets.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Would you be satisfied if I said I
dialog: shot him?
text: Killaine jerks the wrapped gun out of his pocket and thrusts
text: it in front of her.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: What this?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Where's you get it?
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: A graduation present.
text: Killaine puts the gun back in his pocket.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That's a rather inferior grade
dialog: humor. But since you're being so
dialog: frank, would you mind telling me
dialog: why all the labels have been removed
dialog: from your clothes?
text: Betty is jarred. She doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: An unhappy marriage hardly seems a
dialog: sufficient reason for that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why don't you arrest me and be
dialog: done with it.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I probably shall--after I've
dialog: tortured you a little more.
text: SOUND OF ROOM DOOR OPENING OFF: Killaine looks towards it.
text: Brandon comes in and shuts door, throws hat and coat to
dialog: one side.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How are you two getting along?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Delightfully. Every time Miss
dialog: Mayfield says something, I know
dialog: less than I did before.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Well, I may as well knock off for
dialog: tonight.
dialog: (turns to Betty)
dialog: Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let
dialog: me thank you for your cooperation.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There's one thing I may as well
dialog: tell you. You'll find it out anyhow.
dialog: I tried to run away--when I found
text: him out there on the balcony. There
dialog: wasn't any plane.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You didn't have to tell him that.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Why not?
text: He picks up his trench coat and starts to put it on.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Especially as I already knew it.
text: He goes out. They watch him leave. As the door closes,
text: Brandon turns to Betty.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Bad?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Bad enough.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He could hardly help suspecting
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That's putting it mildly.
text: She walks across to French doors and stands looking out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (over shoulder)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (looking at watch)
dialog: Quarter after one. Why?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There's a lot of night left to
dialog: live through.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: So there is. You don't want to go
dialog: to bed. I don't want to go to bed.
dialog: Let's go somewhere and hear some
dialog: music--have something to drink--
dialog: something to eat--even dance.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Dance? Tonight?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Let's not pretend Mitchell meant
dialog: anything to either of us.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Certainly not to me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Just who are you, anyway?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You, too?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: My name is Betty Mayfield. I was
dialog: born, and I am here. Message ends.
dialog: That's what I told him. He didn't
dialog: like it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'm different. I like it fine.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY/DESK/ELEVATOR BANK -- NIGHT
text: Killaine is standing at the desk, holding a registration
text: card in his hand. A clerk is across the desk from him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Nice writing--but no information
text: (he hands the card
dialog: back to clerk)
dialog: I didn't expect any.
text: Elevator comes down, doors open. Betty and Brandon come
text: out. Killaine turns, sees them. Brandon crosses to Killaine.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Miss Mayfield would like a little
dialog: fresh air. Any objections?
text: Killaine shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: In case you want to have us
dialog: followed.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Well--good night.
text: Killaine looks past him at Betty. Their eyes meet. Killaine
text: turns away quickly. Brandon rejoins Betty and they start
text: out of scene.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY -- NIGHT
scene_heading: TRACKING SHOT - BRANDON AND BETTY WALKING
text: Lobby is very empty. A short, thick-set MAN is trimming a
text: cigar in a chain. They pass in front of him. He looks up,
text: stares hard at Betty. Betty meets his glance, looks away
text: quickly. CAMERA STOPS AND HOLDS ON SEATED MAN. He looks
text: after them, puts away his pocket knife, lights cigar
text: leisurely, stands up, goes after them.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - WATERFRONT -- NIGHT
text: Mooring slips on one side, below a sea wall. On the other
text: side, a row of nondescript buildings, a few which have
text: electric signs, one of them an old-fashioned winking
text: electric sign. It is a run-down neighborhood and tough.
text: Brandon's convertible enters shot, pulls over to curb in
text: front of blinking sign.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
text: Sign is now seen to be "CHARLIE'S" but the "R" is half
text: out, dead bulbs. Car stops, Brandon and Betty get out.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - CHARLIE'S BAR -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: BRANDON AND BETTY ON SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHARLIE'S.
text: Betty is shivering.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Cold?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Is this the best you can do?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: At this time of night. It's not as
dialog: bad as it looks.
text: A little reluctantly, she crosses sidewalk with him, they
text: go into swinging double doors. As the doors open, sounds
text: of very bad dance music is heard. Doors swing shut again.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK AND PANS SLOWLY ACROSS THE STREET, as
text: the nondescript little car with dim lights comes up to
text: curb and stops some way behind Brandon's convertible. Lights
text: go out, and the short, tick-set man from the lobby of the
text: hotel gets out of car, walks along to Brandon's car, leans
text: in, pokes a small pencil flash at the registration on the
text: steering post, takes out a notebook, makes a note in it,
text: puts notebook and flash away, crosses to swinging doors,
text: starts in.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S BAR - UPSTAIRS DINE AND DANCE ROOM -- NIGHT
text: The decor is strictly Gas-house Gothic. There are booths
text: like horse stalls, also round scarred tables and hard
text: chairs. The dance band on plain wooden platform, composed
text: of five old young men, plays moodily and contemptuously.
dialog: There isn't a thing in the joint that could be damaged by
text: being dropped out of a third-story window. At one table
text: sits a NAVY SAILOR across from a BLOUSY GIRL. There is an
text: empty glass in front of him. He sits very straight, vacant
text: eyed, stupid drunk. A chunky grim-looking character in a
text: dinner jacket comes by table, pauses to glance at sailor,
text: makes a signal to girl, who nods. CAMERA PANS him across
text: to booth in which Brandon and Betty have just sat down.
text: The MAN in dinner jacket is MAGRUDER. He owns the joint.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: Nice to see you, Mr. Brandon--and
dialog: the lady. What'll you take?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (glancing at Betty)
dialog: Scotch?
text: Betty nods lifelessly; to Magruder.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Scotch. The kind you buy, Magruder,
dialog: not the kind you make.
speaker_heading: MAGDRUDER
dialog: Only the best for you, Mr. Brandon.
text: He signals a waiter, goes out of shot. Band starts to play.
text: Betty looks out of booth.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - BRANDON'S POV - WHAT HE SEES
text: Three couples start to lumber around the small dance floor.
text: The air is heavy with smoke. The soused sailor and blousy
text: girl come dancing into foreground. Sailor is dancing with
text: all the grace of a rhinoceros.
speaker_heading: BLOWSY GIRL
dialog: What you need is a drink, big boy.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: (suddenly pushing
dialog: her away)
dialog: Aw, go blow your nose.
text: He starts back to table. Girl shrugs resignedly, goes after
dialog: him.
scene_heading: BRANDON AND BETTY
text: She is staring horrified at this.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why did you bring me to such a
dialog: place?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (casually)
text: There isn't anywhere else.
text: Waiter comes up and serves drinks. Brandon tastes it to
text: make sure he gets what he orders, nods his head. Betty
text: seizes glass almost convulsively and takes a long swallow.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Want to dance?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Dance? Here?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (staring at him)
dialog: They know you here--know your name.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I know everybody. I don't look at
dialog: half of life, just the nice half,
dialog: I look at all of it.
text: Betty finishes off her drink, then in a reckless, half-
dialog: wild voice,
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: All right, then, let's dance.
text: They get up out of booth and about to start dancing when
text: Betty's gaze becomes fixed on something across the room.
scene_heading: BRANDON'S POV - WHAT HE SEES
text: Thick-set MAN from the lobby sitting alone at a table with
text: a bottle of beer in front of him. He is staring over at
dialog: Betty and Brandon.
text: BACK TO BETTY AND BRANDON
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That man over there. He was in the
dialog: hotel lobby.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (he looks across)
dialog: I didn't notice him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: We walked right passed him. He's
dialog: following us.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Killaine's not that sort of guy.
dialog: He said no--he meant no.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Then he's got to be a detective.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Couldn't be.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Then he's--
dialog: (she breaks off,
dialog: stares rigidly)
text: Brandon looks at her curiously, not getting it. Betty
text: swallows and then gets her voice.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Take me out of here, please. Right
dialog: away.
dialog: (Brandon just keeps
text: looking at her.)
dialog: If you don't I'll go alone.
text: Brandon reaches for her coat, puts it around her, throws
text: some money on the table. They start across room. Brandon
text: deliberately steers past the thick-set man, who is pouring
text: himself a glass of beer. He doesn't even look up. Brandon
text: and Betty reach the top of the stairs. Brandon looks back.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Quite sure you saw him in the hotel
dialog: lobby?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Absolutely sure.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: (his eyes narrow a
dialog: little)
dialog: We'll find out.
text: He turns, takes Betty's arm, they start down the stairs,
text: CAMERA PANS OVER TO MAN. He now looking after them with
text: half smile on his face. He lifts his glass of beer in
text: salute, drinks it down, stands up.
text: FOOT OF STAIRS JUST INSIDE SWINGING DOORS
text: It is pretty dark. It is not a solid stairway, there is a
text: space behind it. Brandon notes this.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You go out and get in the car.
text: Betty hesitates, then starts out. Brandon looks back
text: upstairs. SOUND OF DESCENDING STEPS OVER SHOT. Brandon
text: goes quickly around stairway almost out of sight. Thick-
text: set man comes down the stairs. He is now trimming another
text: cigar. As he reaches the bottom of stairs, he stops, takes
text: out a match, and is about to strike it then Brandon steps
text: out. The man looks at him unemotionally, cigar and match
text: in midair.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: The light's bad in here, but I
dialog: seem to remember the face. What
dialog: was the name?
text: Man smiles, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: All right, let's see the buzzer.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What's a buzzer?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: So you're not a cop.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Me a cop? What made you think that,
dialog: Mr. Brandon?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Who told you my name?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I've got good ears.
text: Brandon steps up close to him, grabs the lapels of his
text: coat, and twists a little.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: How are your teeth getting along?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: The new ones are fine. The last
dialog: set I had gave me all kinds of
dialog: trouble.
text: He looks down at Brandon's hand, holding the lapels of his
dialog: coat.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What's this in favor of?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't like to be tailed. The
dialog: lady I'm with doesn't like to be
dialog: stared at. To put the matter in a
dialog: couple of nutshells, I don't like
dialog: you.
text: Still smiling, the man brings his knee up hard. Brandon
text: reels away from him, groaning, doubles up against the wall.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You wanna get tough, Mr. Brandon,
dialog: you gotta know the technique.
dialog: Next time, turn a little sideways,
dialog: get your hip in the way. See what
dialog: I mean? Good night.
text: He goes through the double doors. CAMERA STAYS ON BRANDON.
text: He straightens up slowly, gets out handkerchief, mops his
text: forehead. He has been hurt pretty badly. After a while, he
text: stiffens himself by main force, walks to door, pushes it
text: open, starts out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
text: He stands, breathing hard, looking off.
scene_heading: BRANDON'S POV - WHAT HE SEES
text: Thick-set man is getting into his car. He starts it up,
text: turns the light on, turns and goes out of shot.
scene_heading: BACK TO BRANDON
text: He crosses sidewalk slowly to his convertible. Betty is
text: waiting in it. Without a word, Brandon goes around, gets
text: in behind the wheel. He sits there with his hands on the
text: wheel, taking deep breaths.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Who is he?
text: Brandon turns his head slowly to look at her. He speaks a
text: little quickly, still in pain.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He's a fellow with a very hard
dialog: knee, and he knows how to use it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You don't know who he is?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't
dialog: have kneed me.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: He was following us--but he's not
text: a policeman.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: All right--following me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No matter. There's nothing I can
dialog: do about it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Anything I can do about it?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Take me home--and forget you ever
dialog: saw me. That's a silly remark isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Try not talking.
text: He puts an arm around her and pulls her close to him as if
text: to kiss her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It still doesn't matter if I kiss
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nothing matters.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No use waiting, then.
text: He kisses her on the mouth, hard. She doesn't resist and
text: she doesn't respond. He pulls his head away.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That's the second round I've lost
dialog: tonight.
dialog: (he moves and winces)
dialog: That fellow hurt me.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: So have I.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: From you, I like it.

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Good morning. Can I do something
dialog: for you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.
dialog: (slight pause)
dialog: Purely as a matter of routine, I
dialog: want to ask the name of your bank.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Bank?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (very smoothly)
dialog: Merely for our records, Miss
dialog: Mayfield. It's usual for the guests
dialog: who come here for the first time.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (opening her bag)
dialog: I'm carrying quite a large sum in
dialog: Travelers checks. How much of a
dialog: deposit would you like?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I wouldn't dream if questioning
dialog: your credit. Purely a matter of
dialog: routine, for the hotel records.
dialog: Just the name of your bank--
text: He breaks off, glances over to one side.
scene_heading: CLOSE REVERSE SHOT - BETTY
text: She notices the glance and turns her head, looks off in
text: the same direction, reacts, looks back at Campbell.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: The Hotel records, Mr. Campbell?
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - CAMPBELL AND BETTY
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: I'm afraid I've been clumsy. Please
text: overlook it, Miss Mayfield.
text: With a quick nod Betty turns away. CAMERA PANS her over to
text: extreme end of desk. Killaine stands there idly, with an
text: elbow on the desk. Betty comes up to him. She is angry.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm
dialog: sorry I can't give you the name of
dialog: my bank--because I have no bank at
dialog: the moment.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That was a crude trick.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: They're all crude, when they don't
dialog: work. Had breakfast?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Care for a stroll outside?
dialog: Beautiful morning. The air is like
text: wine, the sky is a deep blue.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You must come from pretty far South.
text: She bites her lips.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: FLorida?
speaker_heading: BETTY

text: OFF. Brandon enters shot, goes across to desk.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Morning. Any calls?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Reed would like you to call
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: All right. Get him.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: And there's a Mr. Goble to see
dialog: you. Says his business is personal.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Who's Goble?
text: CAMERA PANS OVER TO MAN with glasses. He puts his newspaper

speaker_heading: BACK.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm Goble.
text: Brandon looks at him. Nothing in his face shows recognition.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I'd like a few words with you, in
dialog: private.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'm not interested in blind dates.
text: Goble takes his glasses off, puts then away, and stares at
text: Brandon, who reacts just enough to show he has recognized
text: Goble. During this, secretary has dialed
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mr. Reed, please, for Mr. Brandon.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Very well. Have him call. Mr.
text: Brandon is in his office now.
dialog: (she hangs up)
text: Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr. Brandon.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (to Goble)

dialog: follow.
scene_heading: INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY
text: Brandon round desk, takes off hat, stands looking down at
text: some letters on his desk. DOOR CLOSES BEHIND Goble, who
text: has entered. Goble crosses calmly to chair, sits down.
text: Brandon gets cigarette out and lights it with desk lighter,
text: without offering Goble one, and blows a little smoke.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: All right. Talk it up.
text: Goble gets a card out of his wallet, hands it across.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Martin Goble. Insurance Adjuster."
text: He drops card on desk, smiles.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Nice friendly approach you've got.
dialog: Goble. I could hardly walk when I
dialog: got out of bed this morning.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: You asked for it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'm still asking. What do you want?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I'm not sure I want anything from
dialog: you. You might want something from
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Name it.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Information--protection--you might
dialog: even want to hire me to go home
dialog: and listen to the radio. That's
dialog: the funny part of my business--
dialog: once in a while, I get hired not
dialog: to work.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Nice girl you were with last night.
dialog: Known her long?
text: Brandon picks the card off the desk, tosses it into waste
dialog: paper basket.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Private eye?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: You guessed it. The card's phony.
dialog: I got plenty of 'em. Different
dialog: names, different jobs. I work out
dialog: of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do
dialog: anything. All it takes is the
dialog: folding.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What are your rates?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: $40 a day and expenses. Expenses
dialog: run pretty high on a case like
dialog: this. I'm a long way from home. I
dialog: don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd
dialog: need about $500 for a retainer.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were
dialog: with last night. You haven't hired
dialog: me yet. Mr. Brandon.
text: Brandon moves quickly around the desk, grabs Goble, and
text: jerks him to his feet.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (with cold savagery)
dialog: That's a nice hard knee you've
dialog: got, Goble. How'd you like to trade
dialog: it for a broken neck?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Quit trying to scare me, Mr.
dialog: Brandon, I'm neurotic.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't know whether to knock your
dialog: teeth down your throat--or call
dialog: the police--or just give you twenty
dialog: bucks to go out and buy yourself a
dialog: clean nose.
text: Brandon hurls him away. Goble staggers back, without losing
text: his balance. He smiles. Brandon stares back at him savagely
text: for a moment, then goes back around his desk and sits down.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: You hurt my feelings. I ought to
dialog: raise the price to be a thousand.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: If I call the police, your price
dialog: will go down to a minus sign.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Bluff. You've waited too long.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: For five hundred, what do I get?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I go home and paint the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: For two hundred?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I stick around and wait for the
dialog: five hundred.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You mentioned information.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Sorry. Another client paid for
dialog: that. You can hire me not to use
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: A thousand.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: (hesitates--then)
dialog: Got it on you?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Got the information on you?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Get it in half an hour.
text: Brandon takes out his wallet, takes some bills out of it,
text: throws then across the desk.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: There's two hundred. I'll meet you
dialog: in an hour--where we met last night
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Why not here?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't like your perfume in my
dialog: office. Make it somewhere else if
dialog: you don't like Charlie's.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Charlie's suits me fine. I don't
dialog: scare.
text: He reaches for the money, stands up and puts it in his

speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: You pay the check, you pick the

dialog: Steveston's over there. Coast Guard

dialog: (points to right)
dialog: There's the Yacht Club, and beyond
text: it, the docks. The over on the
dialog: other side of the inlet, there's
dialog: Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000
text: feet high. There's a restaurant on
dialog: top of it. Very nice restaurant.
dialog: (he turns to Betty)
dialog: I'm sorry we couldn't have met in
dialog: pleasanter circumstances, Miss
dialog: Mayfield.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: We wouldn't have met at all.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: True. I was a bit irritable last
dialog: night. I apologize.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You were a galahad, compared to
dialog: some cops I've known.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (pouncing--but very
dialog: quietly)
dialog: You've had dealings with the police
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Who hasn't--one way or another?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: But not in the investigation of a
dialog: major crime, I hope.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Is it a crime?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell
dialog: was murdered. There are a lot of
dialog: reasons.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Was he very drunk when you last
dialog: saw him?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You were there when I last saw
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'd like to believe that. It's not
dialog: too easy.
text: Betty says nothing. Killaine looks away again.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I've been talking to the Immigration
dialog: Inspector who passed you across
dialog: the border. He was a little
dialog: suspicious of you. Mayfield isn't
dialog: really your name, is it?
text: Betty looks straight ahead, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'll find out, you know. Perhaps
dialog: not today--perhaps not tomorrow.
dialog: But in the end, I'll find out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: The police always do, don't they?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You've has an experience that you
dialog: don't want to talk about. An unhappy
dialog: marriage, for example.
text: Betty turns away quickly.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I wouldn't make you talk about it.
dialog: My job is the death of Marry
dialog: Mitchell. Why can't you give me
dialog: your confidence?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You--or the Vancouver Police
dialog: Department?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: We try to be decent.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're a police officer. A very
dialog: nice one--but you have a job to
dialog: do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and
dialog: it's your job to keep me there.
dialog: Don't go considerate on me. I might
text: start to bawl.
text: Their eyes meet in a long look.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You won't tell me who you are?
dialog: You won't even give me a chance to
dialog: help you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nobody can help me. You, least of
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: If I understand what you meant by
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You understand perfectly.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Then there isn't much I can do, is
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There isn't anything you can do.
text: He moves towards her, then turns abruptly and goes.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE -- DAY
text: Chairs are piled up on the tables. A MAN with a mop is
text: going over the floor. STEPS ARE HEARD. Goble, the private
text: eye comes into the SHOT slowly. His eyes are very wary. He
text: has a hand in his pocket.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I came here to see Mr. Brandon.
speaker_heading: MAN WITH MOP
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Brandon. I was to meet him here.
speaker_heading: MAN WITH MOP
dialog: Okay. Ask the boss.
text: He jerks his thumb backwards, and Goble moves off in that
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE - DOOR OPENING/SMALL DARK HALL -- DAY
scene_heading: CAMERA FOLLOWS GOBLE
text: Though open door. He stands a moment, looking along the
text: hallway, listening. There is no sound at all. He reaches a
text: door CAMERA PANS AROUND to show small plate on the door
text: with the word MANAGER. Goble listens again, takes the gun
text: out of his pocket, looks at it, puts it back, keeping his
text: hand on it, opens the door, and stars in.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE - MANAGER'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: It is what you would expect. Magruder is at a desk, doing
text: some bookkeeping work. He looks up indifferently as Goble
speaker_heading: ENTERS.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: The joint's not open, Mac. Who's
dialog: Brandon?
text: Goble comes up to the desk.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: I have an appointment with him,
dialog: right here, right now.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: Go live in a tent.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: It'll be a tough dollar when guys
dialog: like you learn the alphabet.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Talk English. How do I know you're
dialog: you?
text: Goble reaches a hand into his pocket, throws a card on the
text: desk. Magruder picks it up, reads it.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: Mr. Brandon couldn't be here. He
dialog: might have left something for you.
dialog: What would it look like?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: One of those nice long manila
dialog: envelopes--sealed. Not too fat-
dialog: not too thin.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: What do I get for it?
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: You get it's brother.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: Sounds like a fair swap. Let's
dialog: take a look.
text: He jerks open the drawer of his desk. Gobble stiffens,
text: his hand on the gun. Magruder takes out a long sealed
text: envelope, throws it on the desk.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: I need a receipt. Sign your name
text: across the flap.
speaker_heading: GOBLE
dialog: Open it and count it.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: When you sign for it, you count
dialog: it. It's your dough.
text: He picks up a desk pen, holds it out. Goble hesitates,
text: then takes his right hand holding the gun out of his pocket,
text: lays the gun down on the desk beside the envelope. He
text: takes the pen, leans down to write. At that instant,
text: Magruder lunges up swiftly, grabs Goble's right wrist with
text: his left hand and jerks him forward hard. Goble tries to
text: reach the gun with his left hand. Magruder grabs an old-
text: fashioned round ebony ruler up off the desk and smacks
text: Goble's hard on the head with it twice. Goble sprawls
text: across the desk, limp. Magruder takes the gun, puts it in
text: his pocket, picks up the envelope, tears it open, and shakes
text: out the money, counts it.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: Eight hundred bucks. Ice cream
dialog: for dinner.
text: Magruder picks the gun up, balances it on his hand.
text: MOVE IN ON THE GUN
text: It is a .32 caliber revolver, with part of the barrel sawed
text: off to make it a belly gun. It has no front sight.
text: Magruder stares down at it. PULL AWAY as he turns, pulls
text: open desk drawer, puts gun in it, shuts drawer. He rounds
text: the desk, reaches inside Goble's pocket, pulls out a thick
text: manila envelope, stands looking down at it, speculating,
text: tries the flap to see if it will come loose.
text: MOVE IN TO SHOW THERE IS NO WRITING ON THE ENVELOPE
text: He picks up the envelope which contained money. It is
text: also manila and about the same size. With a quick decision,
text: Magruder tears open GOBLE'S ENVELOPE, draws out a sheaf of
text: blank paper. Magruder whistles lightly between his teeth,
text: turns his head to state at Goble who is still limp, sprawled
text: across the desk.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You had it coming, didn't you,
dialog: baby?
dialog: (reaches across,
dialog: shakes Goble's
dialog: shoulders)
dialog: Come on. You're not that sick.
text: Goble does not respond. Magruder pulls his head and
text: shoulder up on the desk. The head sags to one side.
text: Magruder presses a thumb against one of Goble's eyeballs.
text: No reaction. Magruder bends close, stares, and is suddenly
text: stiff with fear.
speaker_heading: MAGRUDER
dialog: (hoarsely)
dialog: Don't tell me you had a glass head,
dialog: baby. Oh no--not in your business.
dialog: How could you live so long?
text: He lets go of Goble who sways sideways in the chair, his
text: head hanging like that of a broken doll. As Magruder stares
text: down at him, with very much the sort of frozen horror as
text: we saw on Betty's face when she found Mitchell's body on
dialog: the balcony.

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (startled)
dialog: How did you know?
dialog: (Killaine smiles
dialog: slightly, doesn't

dialog: Clarendon.
dialog: (Killaine still
dialog: doesn't answer)
dialog: You cops never tell anybody
dialog: anything, do you.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Other people always know so much
dialog: more than we know--so much more
dialog: than they're willing to tell us.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: It was Clarendon. He knew I had
dialog: the gun in my bag.
dialog: Killaine just stares
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You couldn't possible have traced
dialog: it this soon--not possibly.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Of course not. Thanks for telling
dialog: me. I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I am a fool.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That depends upon your motive.
dialog: You were in love with Mitchell,
dialog: weren't you?
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Yes--and he's already becoming
dialog: vague to me. Funny! Last night I
dialog: was furiously jealous. Jealous of
dialog: what? I out that gun in my bag
dialog: deliberately. Who was I going to
dialog: kill with it? A girl I didn't
dialog: even know? A man I knew to be a
dialog: thief and a forger? A half-man?
dialog: A gigolo? It's already ludicrous.
dialog: Love! What a comedy!
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You didn't play it for laughs last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Did you ever have a serious
dialog: operation?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Mortar shells are not funny, either.
speaker_heading: MARGO
text: At first, it doesn't hurt at all.
dialog: That's shock. Then it hurts
dialog: terribly--you wouldn't believe
dialog: such pain could exist--and six
dialog: months later you can't remember
dialog: what pain felt like.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It hasn't taken six months this

speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: Not if it clears the air.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: It does. May I go now?
dialog: (she stands up)
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Perhaps a rich widow would have
dialog: solved all his problems.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Now, you're being beastly.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Sure. You didn't come here in
dialog: person just to tell me about the
dialog: gun. You wanted me to be looking
dialog: across the desk at you while you
dialog: talked about Mitchell.
dialog: (he pauses; Margo
dialog: nods--admiration
dialog: in her eyes)
dialog: If I believe you, it would be
dialog: psychologically impossible for you
dialog: to have killed him last night.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: And if you didn't believe me?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You would still have planted
dialog: information that Clarendon knew
dialog: about the gun--and not as an
dialog: accusation, but in the process of
dialog: defending yourself by making a
dialog: confession. Very neat. Good

text: comes to a door, stops.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT OF DOOR
scene_heading: It is lettered SUPERINTENDENT J. McKECHNIE.
text: Killaine KNOCKS, then starts in without waiting for an
dialog: answer.
scene_heading: INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MCKECHNIE'S OFFICE --
speaker_heading: DAY
text: McKechnie is at his desk. He is a military-looking Scotch-
text: Canadian, with a white mustache. Beside the desk sits an
text: elderly, prim-looking man in a dark suit with a black tie.
text: Killaine comes up to desk.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell,
dialog: Senior. Young Mitchell's father.
dialog: He just flew in from Toronto.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: How do you do, sir.
text: Mitchell nods.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: I've explained the situation to
text: Mr. Mitchell up to a point. Now
dialog: about this Mayfield girl?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: She's a suspect, naturally. But
dialog: not the only one.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: She's the only one who had a dead
text: man in her room. The only one who
dialog: won't give an account of herself.
text: The only one who tried to run away.
dialog: And the only one, so far, I've
dialog: been told, who went to such lengths
dialog: to disguise her identity that she
dialog: even removed the labels from her
dialog: clothes. What more do you want?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL, SR.
dialog: She should have been arrested last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: That's as may be.
dialog: (to Killaine)
dialog: We've ample grounds to detain her
dialog: for questioning. You can't deny
dialog: that, surely.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: I hear she's a very pretty girl.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Which forces me to arrest her
dialog: against my better judgment.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Aye. You have a point there.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL, SR.
dialog: If so, I must say that it escapes
dialog: my attention. It is my son who
dialog: has been murdered. He was not
dialog: always a good son--but he was my
dialog: son. I want his murderer punished.
dialog: The girl's obviously a criminal of
dialog: some sort. Otherwise, she'd give
dialog: an account of herself. Arrest
dialog: her, and you'll find out soon
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (eyeing Killaine)
dialog: I think he's right.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Am I to interpret that as an order
dialog: to arrest Miss Mayfield?
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: When I give an order, you'll not
dialog: need it interpreted.
text: (glances up at clock
dialog: on wall)
dialog: You have an hour to make your mind
dialog: up.
dialog: (he turns to
dialog: Mitchell, Sr.)
dialog: Well, are ye satisfied, Mr.
dialog: Mitchell?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL, SR.
dialog: I'll be satisfied when my son's
text: murderer is convicted and hanged.
dialog: (pause--his
dialog: expression softens
dialog: a little)
dialog: You've given this young man a very
dialog: difficult choice.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Aye. That was the point you said
dialog: you didn't get.
text: (he turns back to
dialog: Killaine)
dialog: That's all.
text: (makes a gesture of
dialog: dismissal)
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: He turns. We PAN HIM TO THE DOOR, he starts out.
scene_heading: INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR -- DAY
text: Killaine comes from Mckechnie's office. Starts back to
text: towards his own office.
text: Another plain clothes cop, DRISCOLL, is walking towards
text: Killaine. They meet just outside Killaine's office.
text: Driscoll is a tall, solemn-looking Irishman.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: May I have a moment, Inspector?
text: Killaine stops.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: The Harbor police have just picked
text: up a dead man out of the water.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Floater?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: Not a floater. Only just dead.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (starting to turn
dialog: away)
dialog: You're the waterfront specialist.
dialog: Find out about it. I've got a
dialog: murder to investigate.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You have two murders to investigate.
text: This man's head was beaten in.
text: And there's nothing in his pockets.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: Drunk-rolling job. They hit him
dialog: too hard.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (annoyed with his
dialog: manner)
dialog: I've been on the waterfront detail
dialog: for twelve years. This man hadn't
dialog: been dead an hour. He wasn't killed
dialog: last night. He was killed today.
dialog: In broad daylight. That's no drunk-
dialog: rolling job.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (starting to turn
dialog: away again)
dialog: Let me know when you've identified
dialog: him
text: Driscoll gives him a somber look and starts to leave.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: And don't get too logical, Driscoll.
dialog: In police business it doesn't work.
dialog: I wish it did. But it doesn't
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: I'm an Irishman, sir. An Irishman
dialog: is always logical.
text: Killaine frowns, then starts into his own little office.

text: the other direction, along the sidewalk. In the background,
text: SOME TRAFFIC NOISE, and far off, BLAST OF A TUG WHISTLE.

text: and their band is a piper's band, in kilts. What is taking
text: place is a guard mount. The old guard is stood at attention

text: while the new guard stands at attention, its band silent.
text: The old guard will then be halted, and faced towards the
dialog: new guard, and will present arms. Then it will march off
text: behind its band, while the kiltie guard is called to
text: attention and presents arms. The outgoing and incoming
text: officers of the day will salute each other. As the old
text: guard marches off, their band will stop playing, and the
text: pipers will march and start playing the bagpipes. This
text: will continue while the new guard is inspected. The new
dialog: guard will be marched will be marched off behind the pipes,
text: and the ceremony is over. This is the background of the

dialog: of it will be heard always, louder, not so loud, not loud
dialog: at all, according to what is going on and how far off the
dialog: bands are.
text: Betty is staring through the railing as the drum and bugle

speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'll take over now. Wait for

text: He starts walking CAMERA WITH HIM, comes up with Handley,
text: leans against the railing beside him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'm relieving you, Handley. Carry
text: on with Gore at the hotel.
text: Handley gives Killaine a curious look.
speaker_heading: HANDLEY
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: He goes out of shot. Killaine watches him, then moves
text: along the railings (the guard mount ceremony is continuing
text: all this time), comes up beside Betty.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: This isn't a very good place to
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't want to talk.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I've come here to arrest you for
dialog: murder.
text: DRUM AND BUGLE MUSIC IN BACKGROUND STOPS.
speaker_heading: VOICE OF COMMAND
dialog: (over scene -- very
dialog: sharp and military)
dialog: Guard HALT!
text: A SOUND OF STAMPING FEET, THEN SILENCE.
speaker_heading: VOICE OF COMMAND
dialog: Right TURN!
text: A SOUND OF FEET, A STAMP, A SLAPPING OF HANDS AGAINST RIFLE
text: SLINGS as guard brings its arms to order. Betty turns her
text: head to look at Killaine.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I expected nothing else.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I might be able to save you. If I
dialog: knew enough.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You wouldn't even try
dialog: (Killaine reacts,
dialog: hurt)
dialog: There must be some copper in you,
dialog: or you wouldn't be an inspector.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: There must be-- but when I'm with
dialog: you I can't find it.
speaker_heading: VOICE OF COMMAND
dialog: (over scene)
dialog: Guard, Present ARMS!
text: APPROPRIATE SOUNDS ARE HEARD, THEN A ROLL STARTS ON THE
speaker_heading: TAP DRUMS.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (turning and looking
dialog: through railing)
dialog: Everybody loves a guard mount--
dialog: except the guard.
dialog: (looks back)
dialog: My boss gave me an hour to make up
dialog: my mind. The time's almost up.
text: For the first time in the scene, Betty turns and faces
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'm about to be very silly. A man
text: passes a girl on the street--a
text: very lovely girl--his eyes meet
text: her eyes, and something reaches
text: out and takes hold of his heart--
text: and then she goes on and is lost
text: in the crowd--and he says to
dialog: himself, "There goes my lost love"--
dialog: and it's true--if he never sees
dialog: her again, it's still true. Of
text: course, after a while, he forgets--
dialog: or almost forgets--because after a
dialog: while we forget almost everything.
dialog: (Betty is silent,
dialog: staring at him)
dialog: But this man is a copper. He gets
dialog: orders--routine orders--to go to a
dialog: place and investigate a murder--
dialog: and everything points to a certain
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Points very straight to her.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: He looks at the girl, looks into
dialog: her eyes--
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What does he see?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: Palm trees against a sunset--waves
text: breaking on a coral reef--the Taj
dialog: Mahal by moonlight--roses in an
dialog: English garden, just after a shower--
dialog: (he grins wryly)
dialog: Clichés, one and all--but good
dialog: ones, with a lot of mileage left
dialog: in them--there's one thing he does
dialog: not see--murder--and murder was
dialog: what he was sent to find. Pretty
dialog: ridiculous, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Very ridiculous.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That's my hard luck--I'm man enough
dialog: to tell you about it--and not be
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What do your friends call you?--
dialog: The ones that know you well?--and
dialog: like you very much?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: They call me Jeff.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and
dialog: get it over with?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: Not quiet yet.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We know who the gun belonged to.
dialog: Margo West. She told us this
dialog: morning.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It doesn't mean much. Mitchell
text: took it away from her. He had a
text: habit of going through her bag.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: So Mitchell had handled it.
text: Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.
text: (he glances at her)
dialog: There's no indication you handled
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I always wear gloves when I shoot
dialog: people. A bad joke--but better
dialog: than tears.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (glancing at his
dialog: watch again)
dialog: Time's up. I'm off the case.
dialog: (he takes a deep
dialog: breath)
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: They'll only find someone else--
dialog: who won't be so kind.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That's something I can't spare
dialog: you. But I won't do it myself.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Because you think your in love
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'm enough of a copper to do my
dialog: duty. My boss made it tough for
dialog: me. If I don't arrest you, I've
dialog: gone soft. If I do, it's to save
dialog: my face. I don't play those rules.
text: He breaks off. PIPE MUSIC SOUNDS OVER SCENE. Killaine
text: raises his voice.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I can't answer that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What will they do to you?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: That's they're business. Can I
dialog: drop you somewhere?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're still a police officer,
dialog: Jeff.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I saw you send those two men away.
dialog: I know they were watching me.
text: Killaine stares at her silently.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What are you going to do--toss
dialog: your job into Puget Sound? Because
dialog: I make you think of magnolias? I
dialog: thought policeman was something
dialog: like a soldier. That his duty
dialog: came first. However much he might
dialog: happen hate it.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (steadily)
dialog: I've been a soldier too. There is
text: a difference. A policeman, like a
dialog: judge, has a right to disqualify
dialog: himself on proper grounds.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What proper grounds?
dialog: (pause, Killaine
dialog: doesn't answer)
dialog: You can't be in love with me. You
dialog: hardly know me. I'm not in love
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But even if you were in love with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (almost rudely)
text: There's an empty taxi across the
dialog: street. If you're so anxious,
dialog: take it. He'll know the way to
dialog: the police headquarters.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You do things the hard way, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not sometimes. Always. Just
dialog: because it is the hard way. You're
dialog: that kind of man, Jeff.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Goodbye, Betty.
text: Betty doesn't answer. She shakes her head slightly, stands
text: with a little smile on her face. He turns, goes quickly
text: out of scene. The guard mount ceremony ends. The crowd
text: begins to break up. Betty glances across the street, then
text: starts out.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- AN EMPTY TAXICAB, THE FLAG UP
text: The driver is parked by the curb. He has been watching
text: the guard mount and is ow waiting for a fare. He sees
text: one, gets quickly out of the cab, opens the door as Betty
text: COMES INTO SHOT. She gets into the cab.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Where to, Miss?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Downtown somewhere--anywhere.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Right you are, Miss.
text: Shuts a door, starts around his car, as we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MCKECHNIE'S OFFICE --
speaker_heading: DAY
text: McKechnie behind his desk. Killaine standing across from
text: him. (We enter the middle of scene)
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Are you a policeman or a soft-headed
dialog: nincompoop?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: A little of both, sir, and perhaps
dialog: not quiet enough of either.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: It won't look pretty good on your
dialog: record, Killaine. Where's the
dialog: girl now?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I don't know, sir.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Well, find out. Who's covering
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Nobody's covering her, I detached
dialog: the officer assigned to that duty.
text: McKechnie comes slowly to his feet. His voice is very
dialog: quiet, and very dangerous.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
text: This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I disagree, sir. As Inspector in
dialog: charge of the case I have the right
dialog: to form that opinion, the right to
dialog: act on it.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Ye have, have ye?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: We lifted seven fairly good prints
dialog: from Miss Mayfield's toilet
dialog: articles. Washington ought to
dialog: teletype us within a few hours.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (in the same deadly
dialog: quiet voice)
dialog: And in the meantime this girl goes
dialog: where she pleases, does what she
dialog: pleases?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: McKechnie's eyes go down to his desk. His hand goes over
text: slowly to a yellow telegraph form, face down. He turns it
text: over, then lifts it and reads in a quiet, measured voice:
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (reading our loud)
dialog: "Superintendent J. Mckechnie,
dialog: Vancouver Police Department.
dialog: Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your

dialog: (McKechnie looks up
dialog: and meets Killaine's
dialog: eyes)
dialog: Have ye any comment, Killaine?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Identification on possible, Sir.
dialog: Not conclusive.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (reading out loud)
dialog: "Superintendent J. McKechnie,

text: (he holds up the
dialog: other telegram and
dialog: looks at Killaine)
dialog: And exact correspondence, Killaine.
text: Killaine stands white and silent.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (dropping the F.B.I
dialog: telegram and
dialog: continuing to read
dialog: the other)

dialog: (slowly McKechnie
dialog: drops this wire on
dialog: top of the other --
dialog: to Killaine)
text: She bleached her hair, or course.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Would your sensibilities be
dialog: offended, if I sent out a general
dialog: alarm to pick up this girl?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I think you'd be entirely justified,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (with a sudden roar)
dialog: But you still think she's innocent.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I do.
text: he reaches into his pocket, takes out his badge, places it
text: on the desk, on top of the two telegrams
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I think you'd like to have this.
text: McKechnie looks down at it without expression, speaks very
dialog: slowly,
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: I believe you won decorations during
dialog: the war.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Two.
text: McKechnie picks up the badge and holds it on the flat of
text: his hand, looking down at it.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: There are people in this world who
dialog: don't think a police badge is a
dialog: badge of honor. I'm not one of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Nor I. This is why I gave it to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (same tone)
dialog: You're a young man. You're
dialog: romantic. You think a pretty face
dialog: and a clean conscience go together.
dialog: You think a soft voice means a
dialog: soft heart. You'll grow out of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Not too far, I hope.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: (suddenly very
dialog: Scotch, the harsh
dialog: and eloquent
dialog: Covenanter)
dialog: This badge is not an old newspaper
dialog: you can cast down on the desk. It
dialog: is not a thing you can give up as
dialog: of no value. It may be taken from
dialog: you--and you may die defending it.
dialog: But you'll not use it to make cheap
text: dramatic gesures with.
dialog: (pause; Killaine is
text: rocked back on his
dialog: heels)
text: It's a naked steel of the sword of
dialog: Justice. Put it back in your pocket
dialog: and hold tight to it--and someday
dialog: you might grow into a worthiness
dialog: ye lack now.
text: Killaine reaches out and takes the badge. He looks down
text: at it, his face bitter and ashamed.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Get out of here!
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: What are my orders, sir?
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: You think I'm wrong about this bit
dialog: of a girl. Go out and prove it
dialog: against me!
text: Killaine steps back, salutes, wheels about and exits scene.
text: McKechnie looks after him, expressionlessly. The door
text: CLOSES off. He presses a button. A uniformed OFFICER
text: enters, McKechnie holds the two telegrams toward him.
speaker_heading: MCKECHNIE
dialog: Condense these for an immediate
text: all-stations pick-up order.
scene_heading: INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - KILLAINE'S OFFICE --

scene_heading: CAMERA MOVES TO AN OVER-THE-SHOULDER SHOT
text: He moves the mirror back until his face is seen in it.
text: There is a bitter smile on his mouth.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Kid Galahad. The Knight of the

dialog: We are now
text: PULLED BACK INTO A WIDER SHOT
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Got a moment, Inspector?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I've got a year. Or a second.
dialog: I'm not sure which.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You told me when we'd identified
dialog: this fellow--
text: Killaine nods.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: We've done that. He's a San
dialog: Francisco private eye. Name Martin
scene_heading: J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials
dialog: in his hat and for once he lived
dialog: where he bought it. Goble and
dialog: Greer is the firm name.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (still a bit nasty)
dialog: Swimming with his hat on? That's

speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I understand. Pity to mess up a
dialog: nice clean boat.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (registering
dialog: controlled anger
dialog: at Killaine's manner)
dialog: I got through to Greer, his partner
dialog: in the detective business. Greer
dialog: won't give out.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (leaning back in
dialog: his chair, half-
dialog: closing his eyes)
dialog: I'd suggest a telegram. Something
dialog: like this: Chief of Police, San
dialog: Francisco. A licensed private
dialog: detective named named Martin J.
dialog: Goble, address so-and-so, has been
dialog: found murdered within our
dialog: jurisdiction. His partner, name
dialog: something-something Greer, refuses
dialog: to give us any information.
dialog: Correction. Refuses information
dialog: necessary to our investigation.
dialog: Can you assist? Signed Detective
dialog: Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver,
dialog: British Columbia, Police.
dialog: (Killaine opens his
text: eyes, looks at
dialog: Driscoll)
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Send that?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (indifferently)
dialog: Would you?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: If you're asking my opinion, no.
dialog: I'd read it to Greer over the phone.
dialog: Ask him if he had any objections.
text: Killaine stands up, glances at his wristwatch.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if
dialog: it's important.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: How important would it have to be?
dialog: It's only murder, Inspector.
text: Killaine goes close to him, suddenly smiles.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: The Super's just given me the
dialog: sweetest dressing down I've ever
dialog: had. I'm still reeling from it.
dialog: And believe me, I had it coming.
dialog: I apologize. What you think is
dialog: important--I think is important.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (answering his smile)
dialog: Thanks, Inspector. What are your
dialog: orders about this wire to San
dialog: Francisco?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Men like you don't need orders.
text: He turns, exits scene. Driscoll is now smiling broadly.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: The door opens, Brandon comes in, crosses in the direction
dialog: of the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Brandon comes in from the living room, crosses to wall
text: safe. His expression is tight, business-like, his movements
text: quick, as if he had a lot to do and didn't intend to waste
text: any time. Opens wall safe, takes a wad of currency from
text: it, stuffs currency into breast pocket, re-locks safe. A
text: door buzzer SOUNDS to the door of his apartment. Brandon
text: reacts, starts to exit.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Brandon enters from bedroom. Door buzzer SOUNDS again.
text: He picks up his hat and coat, goes to door, opens it.
text: Killaine come past Brandon into room, closing the door.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Time for a little chat?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Thanks. I don't mind.
text: Brandon throws hat and coat on couch, crosses to liquor
text: cabinet, begins to mix a couple of drinks; his back is now
text: turned to Killaine, who saunters across room to French
text: doors, exits terrace. Brandon turns with the glasses in
text: his hands, then starts after Killaine.
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE TERRACE -- DAY
text: Killaine is standing against the wall corner, looking down
text: at the point where the terrace overlooks Betty's balcony.
text: Brandon enters from living room carrying glasses, reacts
text: again, controls himself, crosses to Killaine.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Here you are.
text: Killaine turns, takes a glass.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Thanks. Lovely view you have,
dialog: haven't you?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I never notice the view after the
dialog: first week.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I would. Fancy waking up every
dialog: morning with that in your lap.
text: (he gestures towards
dialog: the view)
dialog: Wonderful thing, money is. Remember
dialog: what Somerset Maugham said about
dialog: it ?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I wouldn't know.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: "Money is a sort of sixth sense
dialog: that gives meaning to all the
dialog: others." Very appealing, especially
dialog: to a poor man.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Could we discuss that some other
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: How long since you saw her?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: A couple of hours.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I have a warrant for her arrest.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That must hurt.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I've always thought you were a
dialog: pretty nice guy, Brandon. I'd
dialog: like to go on thinking so. If you
dialog: tried to help her get away--
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Would that make me a heel?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You'd be breaking the law.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Doesn't answer the question.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: The only answer I have for you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You passed up a dozen chances to
dialog: arrest her. What toughened you
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Information.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Don't kid me. You don't think she
dialog: murdered Mitchell.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: It could have been an accident.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That COULD BE TOLD.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Not if she knew she wouldn't be
dialog: believed.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Your concentrating too hard,
dialog: Killaine. What about Margo West?
dialog: She had a motive. I guess you
dialog: know by this time whose gun it
dialog: was?
text: Killaine nods.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: And old man Clarendon? He had a
text: motive, too. Margo and her money.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Mitchell was killed down here.
dialog: (he points)
dialog: How could Clarendon get in to do
dialog: it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Or Margo for that matter.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How could Mitchell? After that
dialog: act he put on up here, is it likely
dialog: she'd let him in?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: She didn't have to. He could have
dialog: climbed down from here.
text: Brandon looks down over the wall. He turns, deadpan.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Mitchell was too drunk.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Or just drunk enough. He was with
dialog: her when she registered. He knew
dialog: where her room was. You were out
text: most of the evening. There was a
dialog: lot of mess to clean up . Waiters
text: coming and going, the door standing
dialog: open. Suppose Mitchell came in to
text: grab a drink for himself, then
dialog: wandered out on this balcony, then
dialog: realized betty's balcony was just
dialog: below yours.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale,
dialog: Killaine.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You don't buy it. Okay. So I
dialog: still want Betty Mayfield. Where
dialog: is she?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No idea.
text: Phone rings off, in the living room.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Excuse me. My phone.
text: He turns, exits scene. Killaine stands a moment, looking
text: down from the edge of the terrace, then follows Brandon.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: Brandon is just lifting the receiver.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Hello.
text: His expression tightens, he glances quickly towards the

text: the living room. Brandon turns his back to Killaine.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Sorry. It's not very convenient

text: OUT a deadpan, nondescript-looking MAN who might be a
text: dick as he stands up from a chair, crosses towards phone
text: booths, CAMERA WITH HIM. Phone booths are all full. He
text: stops before a booth, through the glass door of which Betty
text: can be seen on the phone. She catches his eye, turns away
text: quickly. The Man nonchalantly lights a cigarette, leans
text: against the booth.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (into phone in booth)
dialog: I had no right to call you anyway.
dialog: I've made you enough trouble. I--

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't think that's on the market
dialog: anymore. I'd like something much
text: closer to the water.
text: Killaine is listening, but he does not look up.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Cant be too close for me. Right

dialog: me. Anything else listed?

scene_heading: BETTY ON PHONE
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (into phone, low

dialog: Before.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You're probably mistaken about
dialog: that. Let's get together sand
dialog: talk it over. There's always a
dialog: solution to these problems. But
dialog: it must be near the water. Quite
dialog: near--
dialog: (pause)

text: then turns.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM NEAR BETTY'S PHONE BOOTH -- DAY
text: The Man is standing there, smoking. Betty opens the door,

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to man)
dialog: I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
text: He has his hand on the knob of the booth door, holding it.
text: He smiles quickly
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Don't give it a thought, Miss.
dialog: Matter of fact, waiting is my trade.
text: A BIG WOMAN pushes past them, starts to leave herself into
text: the booth he is about to enter. The man reacts smoothly.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (to big woman)
dialog: Pardon me, Madam. Is that your
dialog: handkerchief?
text: He points to a spot on the floor behind her. She steps
text: back and turns. He glides into the booth, draws the door
text: shut, winks at Betty through the glass. Betty hides her
text: face as she turns away. The Big Woman is furious.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: He has just left the phone and crossed to make another
text: drink, Killaine tosses the magazine aside and stands up.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: No more for me, thanks. Remember
dialog: what I said. I can't interfere
dialog: with the law.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Where would she go, anyway. Don't
dialog: tell me you haven't got her covered.
text: Killaine just looks at him, then nods, turns away.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Mitchell was a heel. We both know
dialog: that. Why take it for granted
dialog: that somebody in the hotel knocked
dialog: him off?
text: Killaine doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You forgetting the gag line,
dialog: Killaine. The police don't take
dialog: anything for granted.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'm afraid they do. Far too often.
dialog: So long.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Wait a minute. I'll go with you.

scene_heading: BRANDON AND KILLAINE
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (casually)
dialog: You do a lot of real estate trading,
dialog: Brandon?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Now and then. Mostly just for the
dialog: fun of it.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I tried it once. I lost my shirt.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (with a faint smile)
dialog: I buy my shirts by the dozen.
dialog: Fortunately.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (glancing at the
dialog: elevator operator)
dialog: Where did it all come from? Or is
dialog: that a permissible question?
text: Elevator stops. OTHER PEOPLE get in. Elevator starts
dialog: down again.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - BY ELEVATOR -- DAY
text: Elevator reaches lobby floor, doors open, people come out.
text: Killaine and Brandon separately. Brandon first. He waits

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I had a father who knew how to
dialog: steal.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You asked me where it all came
dialog: from.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Oh. That was just one of those
dialog: idle questions. One doesn't expect
dialog: an answer.
text: Brandon nods, turns towards the desk, Killaine following.
text: Campbell the manager, is behind the desk, and a clerk.
text: The clerk, seeing Brandon, reaches mail out of the box,
text: hands it to Brandon, who stands looking over.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (to Campbell)
dialog: I think I'd like to take another
text: look at Mr. Mitchell's room.
text: Brandon glances at him quickly, then back to his mail.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I don't know why. As a matter of
dialog: fact, I don't know anything.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (polite but rather
dialog: cold)
dialog: It's about time you did--know
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I agree with you perfectly. But
dialog: when did time ever help a fool?
text: Brandon gives another quick glance, then strolls off along
text: the lobby towards the main Hotel entrance, still looking
text: at his mail as he walks. Killaine looks after him.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Killaine goes over to where Handley is sitting, drops into
text: a chair beside him, takes out his crested cigarette case,
text: takes a cigarette, then with an after-thought, offers case
text: to Handley, which brings then close together, as Handley
dialog: takes cigarette.
speaker_heading: HANDLEY
text: Nothing. She hasn't shown.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Check the boat?
speaker_heading: HANDLEY
dialog: Gore's out doing it now.

text: pits cigarette case away.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (pretending to stifle
dialog: a yawn)
dialog: Must be almost tea-time
dialog: (moves to get up)
dialog: I'll be in Mitchell's room.

text: SOUND of a car coming up behind her. SOUND indicates it
text: is breaking to stop. Betty becomes rigid, then very slowly

speaker_heading: BRANDON (O.S.)
dialog: Hop in.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Showing Brandon's convertible, Brandon leaning out. Betty
text: crosses the sidewalk, gets into the car. HOLD ON THE CAR
text: as it starts up, SHOOTING FROM A NATURAL ANGLE.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I hated to go to that place. I
dialog: almost went to the police station
dialog: instead.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No percentage in that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: They're going to arrest me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I know. Killaine has a warrant.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (as the car turns
dialog: into Ford Street)
dialog: I have my own warrant. Stop a
dialog: minute, please.
text: Brandon looks at her, puzzled, brings the car to a stop;
text: sits staring at her. Background of harbor ships, Betty
text: draws something out of her pocket--a paper--and hands it
text: to him. He takes it, opens it, reads it aloud, in a low
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (reading aloud)
dialog: "Dear Inspector Killaine: This is
dialog: goodbye. You were right, I had a
dialog: secret. You were right, I changed
dialog: my name. I tried to hide from the
dialog: past and I walked into almost the
dialog: same situation that I had run away
dialog: from. I didn't kill Larry Mitchell,
dialog: but I can't prove it. I couldn't
dialog: prove it the other time, either.
dialog: Where I am going, nothing has to
dialog: be proved. There's a lot of water
dialog: between Vancouver and the U.S.A.
dialog: In that, and in you. Vancouver
dialog: has been kind to me. I think you
dialog: will understand. Betty Mayfield.
text: Brandon stops reading, his face is tight, and grim. Slowly
text: he refolds the note and turns to look at Betty.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: If you meant it, you wouldn't show
dialog: it to me, Betty.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Or am I supposed to deliver it to
dialog: dear Inspector Killaine?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (in a half-wild
dialog: tone)
text: Wrote it in the waiting room of
dialog: the Hudson Bay Store. With
dialog: somebody's Pekingese trying to
dialog: climb into my lap. Perhaps you're
dialog: right. Perhaps I didn't mean it.
dialog: All I know is that I'm licked.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (very slowly)
dialog: There's a lot of water between
dialog: Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note
dialog: is a suicide note. After you're
dialog: gone where would they look for
dialog: you?
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Why would they look for you?
text: Darkness, and open water, and a
dialog: fast cabin cruiser. And I have a
dialog: pocket full of money. And if I
dialog: helped you, I'd be committing a
dialog: crime, or so they tell me.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That wasn't why I called you. Why
dialog: did I hope--when I hadn't any right
dialog: to hope?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How bad is it? Bad enough for--
text: (he taps pointing
dialog: to the note)
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes. I've never been very far
dialog: from it, for a long time. Will
dialog: you do something for me?
text: Brandon nods.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Take me where I haven't the courage
dialog: to take myself.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How bad is the other thing? The
dialog: secret?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I was tried for murdering my
text: husband. Guilty. The judge set
dialog: the verdict aside. There was one
dialog: man on the jury--
dialog: (she pauses, shakes
dialog: her head)
dialog: --but he was afraid. They were
dialog: all afraid--of my father-in-law.
dialog: That man followed me last night--
dialog: he came from him of course. My
dialog: father-in-law will never give up.
dialog: Never. He promised me that.
dialog: (she laughs a little)
dialog: So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As
dialog: far away as I can get from North
dialog: Carolina. And it happens all over
text: again. Almost the same thing.
dialog: Almost the same way. Do you wonder
dialog: about this--
text: She reaches to take the note from his hand. He pulls it
text: away from her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: This is the ace, Betty. But not
dialog: of spades. They'll find out about
dialog: the other. They might know already.
dialog: And when they get this--
text: (he holds up the
dialog: note again)
dialog: What would they look for? Where?
dialog: Out there somewhere?
dialog: (he points towards
dialog: the open water
dialog: beyond the ships)
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: They'll look for you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I run over to Victoria. Play some
dialog: golf with some people I know. Do
dialog: it all the time. That's why I
dialog: have a cabin cruiser. Custom-
dialog: built.Forty knots. Mr Clark Brandon
dialog: an almost gentleman of almost
dialog: complete leisure. Member of six
dialog: golf clubs. Broke 70 once on the
dialog: Shaughnessy Heights Course. You
dialog: have to be good to do that, And if
dialog: you look out of a front window of
dialog: the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in
dialog: a few hours you can look right
text: down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the
dialog: Valkyrie. Came alone? Sure. He
dialog: always comes alone. Mr Brandon's
text: a rather lonely man.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: (staring at him,
dialog: fascinated)
dialog: And Betty Mayfield--
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and
dialog: nowhere. Of course she might have
dialog: run away--if she knew how. And
dialog: where to go. She might have dyed
text: her hair. Bleached it before
dialog: probably.
dialog: (Betty nods)
dialog: And changed her name again. But
dialog: look at this note.
dialog: (he holds it up)
dialog: And look at her room in the hotel.
dialog: Her stuff is all there. Hasn't a
dialog: rag except what she stood up in.
dialog: You don't run away like that. Not
dialog: if you are young and beautiful.
dialog: No chance.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (catching a little
dialog: enthusiasm from
dialog: him)
dialog: But that's what I'm doing. Couldn't
dialog: they think of that?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: If they had any reason to. Why
dialog: make it tough for themselves? Why
dialog: go to all that trouble? Here's an
dialog: open book. Close it. No reason
dialog: to keep it open. She was a nice
dialog: girl, anyway. And perhaps she
dialog: didn't kill him on purpose. Perhaps
dialog: she didn't kill the other one.
dialog: You never know. Give her the
dialog: benefit of the doubt. Leave her
dialog: stay where she is. Close the book.
dialog: Finis.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Killaine...
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: The best interference runner we've
dialog: got. He thinks he's in love with
dialog: you--and he's a gentleman. Come
dialog: here, baby.
text: He pulls her towards him, holds her in his arms, and kisses
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'm not. Or I wouldn't be doing
dialog: this right now.
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Even if I didn't like you, I'd
dialog: have to do it. Like the guy that
dialog: was dealt thirteen spades in a
dialog: bridge hand. Or filled an ace-
dialog: high flush. You couldn't get him
dialog: out of that game to give him the
dialog: Pulitzer Prize.
text: They pull apart. Brandon starts the car again. As it

dialog: All we have to do is call the San
dialog: Francisco Police and get numbers
dialog: for his guns. For the love of the
dialog: Saints, Magruder, if you're going
dialog: into the murder business, why don't
dialog: you learn a few rules? You must
dialog: have been pretty desperate to move
text: him out of here in broad daylight.
text: Magruder reacts. This one catches him right square on the
text: point of the chin.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don't you know we have people down
dialog: in the district working for us?
dialog: They might look like tramps to
dialog: you, and some of them are. But
dialog: they have eyes.
speaker_heading: MAGDRUDER
dialog: (hoarsely)
text: The guy pulled a gun on me. I
dialog: thought it was a stick-up. I hit
dialog: him with a sap. Why wouldn't I?
dialog: Maybe I hit him too hard, and it
dialog: scared me. I wanted to get him
dialog: away from here. A guy like me
dialog: don't always get believed by guys
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You had over sixteen hundred dollars
dialog: in your pocket, a thousand of them
text: in twenty-dollar bills. With a
dialog: kind of new look about them at
dialog: that. Would you be interested in
dialog: what I think about this, Magruder?
text: Magruder doesn't answer. He is beginning to look very
text: groggy.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (sharply to the
dialog: other dick)
text: Hold him. He's trying to sag on
dialog: us.
text: The other dick straightens Magruder up, pushes him against
text: the wall. Magruder's eyes are rolling in his head.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (mercilessly)
dialog: This man Goble rented the car,
dialog: gave a false name. He had no
dialog: licence, no identification. But
dialog: he put up a sufficient deposit.
dialog: He was a suspicious man. He was
text: on a dubious errand. He had a gun
dialog: in his pocket and I'm thinking one
dialog: of these manila envelopes--
dialog: (he points to the
dialog: waste basket)
dialog: Contained those sheets of blank
dialog: paper which he was going to sell
dialog: for money. And get out before
dialog: anybody looked at what he'd sold.
dialog: You had the money, Magruder. But
dialog: you didn't give it to him. You
dialog: killed him instead.
text: Magruder starts to sag again.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (more gently)
dialog: Perhaps you didn't mean to kill
dialog: him. But here he was dead, and
text: his car was outside in the street.
dialog: So you brought it around to the
dialog: alley and you carried the man down
dialog: to it, and you drove him away.
dialog: And what happened to him after
dialog: that, nobody knows until he was
text: picked out of the water of the
text: Sound, dead. But not long dead.
dialog: Where did you leave the car,
dialog: Magruder? Who helped you? What
dialog: boat did you have?
text: (pauses. His voice
dialog: changes to a dry
dialog: business-like tone
dialog: addressing the
dialog: other dick)
dialog: All right. Take him in. Set him
dialog: down. Give him what he wants to
dialog: make him comfortable. And get a
dialog: stenographer. And warn him. And
dialog: don't rough him. He's a nice little
dialog: man. All he wants is to collect
dialog: his thoughts. And then he'll tell
dialog: us the whole story in his own words.
dialog: (his voice becomes
dialog: positively corny)
dialog: Won't you, Magruder, darling?
text: Magruder pitches forward to the floor in a dead faint.
text: The two detectives stand looking at him.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (somberly)
dialog: He'll be giving the priest a bad
dialog: time, this one. Maybe You'd better
dialog: call an ambulance. He might have
text: a wonky ticker.

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Do you have to leave the note?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: It's the frame on the picture.
dialog: But not if you say so.

text: Betty doesn't touch it.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'd still go through--even if I

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VANCOUVER ROYAL HOTEL - MITCHELL'S ROOM -- DAY
text: A handsome table radio, Gore standing beside it. The
text: continuation of broadcast in previous scene, without break,
dialog: but with a difference in tone, due to the different
dialog: instrument.
speaker_heading: VOICE (FROM RADIO)
dialog: Outlying cities and towns please
text: rebroadcast. Coast Guard stations
dialog: please rebroadcast. Suspect may

text: Gore reaches across, shuts the radio off, turns, CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK TO A WIDER SHOT OF MITCHELL'S ROOM which is not
text: typical, not very expensive hotel room, but with some
text: personal furniture such as table lamps, a shelf of books,
text: a few indications that this has become the home of someone.
text: Gore moves towards the bed, Killaine is going through the
text: contents of a suitcase. He has underwear, shirts, socks,
text: etc., spread out all around the bed cover.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: She didn't seem the type to lam
dialog: out--even if she got the chance.
dialog: That stuff was all gone through
dialog: last night. Anything special you're
dialog: looking for, Inspector?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'll know when I find it.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: I guess I'm just ballast around
dialog: here.
text: Killaine doesn't answer. He straightens up with a very
text: fancy thin gold cigarette case in his hand. He opens it.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: You get those from rich women--if
dialog: you are the kind of guy Mitchell
dialog: was.
text: Killaine dumps the cigarettes out of the case and holds
text: the inside against the light. His gaze becomes fixed.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Gigi, huh? Sounds French--one of
dialog: those fancy ladies. Must have
dialog: been very fancy, if he scratched
text: her phone number in gold.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (ignoring him,
dialog: speaking to himself)
dialog: Market... It seems to me that's a
dialog: San Francisco exchange.
scene_heading: INT. BEER TAVERN - BASEMENT -- DAY
text: Brandon is seated at a small table, with a bottle and glass
text: of beer in front of him. He takes Betty's suicide note
text: out his pocket, reads it.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN ENOUGH TO SHOW WHAT HE IS READING

text: puts it away in his pocket, glances at his wrist watch,
text: stands up, starts out of scene, leaving beer almost
text: untasted.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROYAL VANCOUVER HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- DAY
text: As Killaine comes in He moves noiselessly around the room,
text: glancing at this and that, goes closet, comes back with an
text: over-night case, which he puts on the bed. It is locked.
text: He gets out a bunch of keys, tried two or three, opens it.
text: He searches inside the over-night bag and comes up with a
dialog: packet of travelers checks.
text: CLOSE ON THE PACKET OF TRAVELERS CHECKS TO SHOW THE

scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- DAY
text: As Brandon comes down off ladder and Betty comes up
text: companionway.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: Killaine's wise. We can't wait
dialog: any longer. Here, put this on.
text: (he opens locker,
text: picks out an oilskin
dialog: coat, hand sit to
dialog: her)
dialog: But stay out of sight until we
dialog: clear the harbor. I'll tell you
dialog: when.
dialog: (gets another oilskin
text: out of the locker,
dialog: puts it on himself)
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Killaine's wise to what?
text: Without answering, Brandon slips past her, down
text: companionway.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- DAY
text: As Brandon enters, peeling off his overcoat and jacket,
text: tosses overcoat and hat aside, opens locker with push-back
text: door, hangs jacket up inside, takes out a heavy sweater
text: which he slips on, then a seamen's pea-jacket which he
text: also puts on. He reaches far in and comes out holding a
text: .38 automatic, slips it into the inside pocket of the pea
text: jacket, pulls locker door closed, starts out.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- DAY
text: Betty has put on her oilskin coat as Brandon comes up
text: companionway, slips behind the wheel and starts the motors.
text: He yells something at her, but the roar of the motors drowns
text: it out. He points. She nods, goes back down companionway.
text: Brandon casts off, cruiser starts to back out of the slip.
scene_heading: EXT. YACHT ANCHORAGE -- DAY
text: Cruiser backs in towards CAMERA, swings around, starts in
text: a wide curve towards the harbor entrance, moving very fast.

scene_heading: INT. ROYAL HOTEL - OUTSIDE BRANDON'S PENTHOUSE -- DAY
text: Elevator comes up, opens, Campbell and Gore come out.
text: Campbell crosses to penthouse door, presses bell, then
text: turns to Gore.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm getting a little tired of this,
dialog: Sergeant. Mr. Brandon's a valued
dialog: guest in this hotel. We've known
dialog: him for a long time. I don't like
text: this prowling into people's rooms.
text: He presses the bell again.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: How many people in your hotel know
dialog: a man was murdered here,
dialog: Mr.Campbell? Apart from you and
dialog: the people questioned?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (shortly)
dialog: None, as far as I know.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: And you don't like our methods,
dialog: huh?
text: Campbell gives him a look, takes out the passkey, and
text: unlocks door, starts in. Gore moves past him, turns and
text: blocks him.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: That's all. Thanks, Mr. Campbell.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I insist--
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: That's all. Thanks, Mr. Campbell.
text: He pushes the door shut, pushing Campbell out with it. He
text: puts on the night latch, grins and starts across living
text: room to French doors to terrace.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE VANCOUVER ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM - BALCONY --
speaker_heading: DAY
text: Killaine standing, looking up at end wall towards the wall
text: of the penthouse terrace. He looks down at the chaise on
text: which Mitchell's body was found. He goes to it, wheels it
text: over so it is close to the end wall. His eyes measure the
text: distance from the chaise up to the top of the parapet wall
text: of the penthouse terrace. Gore appears IN THE SHOT ABOVE.
text: He looks down.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (calling up to him)
dialog: I'm coming up.
text: He goes down to the corner of the balcony wall, steps up
text: on it, steadying himself with a hand against the steep end
text: wall. He turns his body so that he is standing sideways,
text: rather unsteadily, and reaches up. His hands are about
text: two feet short of being able to reach the top of the wall
text: at which Gore stands. Killaine gathers himself for a jump,
text: springs, catches the top of the wall with one hand, swings
text: outwards, glances down.
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: Sheer drop of 100 feet to the stone terrace outside the
dialog: hotel lobby.
scene_heading: ANGLE UP SHOWING KILLAINE DANGLING BY ONE HAND FROM TERRACE
speaker_heading: ABOVE
text: Gore reaching down for him. Killaine's body swings in
text: again. With a jerk he gets the other hand up, laboriously
text: pulls himself up, and walks up the wall, CAMERA FOLLOWS
text: HIM. Gore reaches to help him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (tightly, straining
dialog: with effort)
dialog: I'm all right.
text: He gets a leg over the penthouse wall, breathing hard.
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE BALCONY -- DAY
text: REVERSE SHOT ANGLE DOWN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE TERRACE TO
scene_heading: THE VIEW BELOW
text: Gore is standing by the wall, Killaine astride of it. He
text: gets over to the balcony floor, stands up, wipes his hands
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: That's pretty risky business,
dialog: Inspector.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Somebody did it twice last night--
text: in the dark.
text: He points down. Gore looks over the wall, downwards.
text: WHAT HE SEES.
text: Portion of Betty's balcony and the chaise almost directly
text: below him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE (O.S.)
dialog: Once to put that in the position
dialog: where it is now. And the second
dialog: time to move it where we found it.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - KILLAINE AND GORE
text: On the balcony.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Not too hard, is it?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: (staring at him)
dialog: Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: There wasn't any motive...let's
dialog: try out the act.
text: Gore steps back. Killaine puts his hand in his pocket and
text: brings out a gun, which looks very like the death gun.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I have a gun. It's not loaded.
dialog: Pretend it is. I'm drunk. I took
text: the gun away from Margo West. Now
dialog: I've said something to you that
dialog: you don't like. I don't like the
dialog: look in your eyes, either. I've
dialog: pulled the gun. Take it away from
dialog: me. And while you're taking it
dialog: away from me, it goes off. Ready?
dialog: Gore nods.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Let's go.
text: Gore suddenly swarms him. There is a brief sharp struggle.
text: Gore gets his hand over the gun. It goes down as they
text: fight for it. Gore turns it in toward Killaine's body.
text: There is a sharp click. Gore steps back with the gun in
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Was that about the right angle?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Where's the shell?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Should be over there.
text: Points to the angle of the wall.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Pick it up. Put it in your pocket.
text: Gore pretends to do so.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: The same with the gun.
text: Gore puts the gun in his pocket.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You've got a dead man on your hands.
dialog: You killed jim--even if it wasn't
dialog: murder. What are you going to do
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: If I've got any sense I'm going to
dialog: call headquarters.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: They'll probably believe you. But
dialog: they'll want to know what you were
dialog: fighting about. Why Mitchell had
dialog: a gun. You'll tell them a simple
dialog: story. They'll pretend it sounds
dialog: all right to them. Now you're
dialog: headquarters. How does it sound
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Before I took the story and closed
dialog: the case, I'd want to know a lot
dialog: more about these people. I'd want
dialog: to know just about everything about
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Exactly. Now I'm the killer. And
dialog: there's something I don't want you
dialog: to know. Something that would
dialog: destroy my comfortable life, rob
dialog: me of my friends, my position.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Assume there is something to hid.
dialog: I go to a lot of trouble. What do
dialog: I do? What would you do?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Do I know who lives down there?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You can find out.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Do I know that she's out of the
dialog: room? Likely to be out of it for
dialog: some time?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You can find out the first part.
dialog: The second part you have to take a
dialog: chance on.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Pretty big chance, huh?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: You've got a dead man on your hands.
dialog: Like this.
text: He allows himself to collapse down on the floor, against
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Right--
text: He bends down over Killaine, gets a fireman's lift on him--
text: get's him up, drapes him over the wall, half on one side
text: and half on the other, his head and shoulders on the inside.
text: He straightens up, takes a firm grip on Killaine's wrists,
text: and eases him down over the wall. Gore's head and shoulders
text: follow until he is lying across the wall on his stomach.
scene_heading: ANGLE UP - UPWARD REVERSE SHOT FROM BETTY'S BALCONY
text: Showing Killaine's body dangling directly over the chair.
text: Gore comes as far down as he can. Killaine has only a few
text: feet to fall. Killaine looks down, then up at Gore.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Let go.
text: Gore releases his wrists. Killaine sprawls down on the
text: chaise, almost rolls over it, saves himself, lies down on
text: his side. Gore climbs over the wall, lowers himself, hangs
text: by his hands, looks down, lets go with one hand, drops,
text: lands rather heavily on the balcony near the chaise, goes
text: down on his hands and knees. He stands up, dusts himself
text: off, lifts the chaise with Killaine on it, and wheels it
text: about six feet away to the position where it was found
text: with Mitchell's body. Killaine stands up off the chaise.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Next?
text: Gore reaches into his pocket, takes out the gun and a match.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: (holding the match
dialog: up)
dialog: This is the shell.
dialog: (tossing it over in
dialog: the corner)
dialog: What about the gun?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Well. What about it?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: I've handled it. Mitchell's handed
dialog: it. If I wipe it off, no suicide.
dialog: If I take it out and lose it, no
dialog: suicide. If I leave it here....no
dialog: suicide.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: I've got to find a way to handle
text: it, openly. Like Brandon.
text: Killaine nods.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: (doubtful again)
dialog: How did he know he'd get the chance?
dialog: He couldn't have arranged it.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: He could have tried. If he was up
text: there in the dark, listening, he'd
dialog: know when she came home, know when
dialog: she found Mitchell dead, know what
dialog: she did about it. If she
dialog: telephoned, he'd probably hear
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: And she did give him the chance,
dialog: the way it worked out.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: If she didn't--if luck was against
text: him--he wipes the gun off, reaches
text: the wall up there--drops it on the
dialog: chaise.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: No suicide.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Did we ever really think it was
dialog: suicide?
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: You win, Inspector. You win all
dialog: along the line. Why didn't we
dialog: think of Brandon before--or did we--
dialog: some of us.
dialog: (pause, then
dialog: answering himself)
dialog: Yeah. Of course you did. When a
dialog: suspect thinks he's safe, you go
text: on letting him think he's safe.
dialog: Wait for a mistake.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: And a motive--which we haven't
dialog: got. So this could all be a dream.
text: Gore nods silently. Killaine reaches in his pocket, takes
text: out Mitchell's thin gold case, opens it, looks down.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Market one-eight-four-two.
text: He looks up at Gore.
speaker_heading: GORE
dialog: Greer and Goble in the Call
dialog: Building, San Francisco. Just
dialog: like you thought...Two murders in
dialog: two days. Different places,
dialog: different methods, different people.
dialog: Nothing connects them, but a
dialog: telephone number.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: A think wire---but very, very
dialog: strong. Let's get out of here.
text: As they start out.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE SEA - OPEN WATER -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: Cabin cruiser coming into SHOT at high speed.
scene_heading: CLOSER SHOT - CABIN CRUISER
text: Brandon is behind the wheel, Betty beside him. She is
text: looking back over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: See anything?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I can still see the shoreline.
text: The moon is rising.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: There would be a moon tonight.
text: Betty shivers a little.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Cold?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Frozen.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Go down into the cabin and get
dialog: yourself a drink. Careful how you
dialog: go, we're hitting the swell now.
text: Betty starts to move from the seat towards the companionway.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- NIGHT
text: As Betty comes in. The cruiser has begun to pitch and
text: roll. She makes her way along the cabin. The cruiser
text: gives a lurch, Betty is thrown off balance. She grabs a
text: door handle. Door is pulled open. Clothes are seen hanging
text: inside. The cruiser gives another lurch and Betty is thrown
text: the other way, almost into the closet. Her hand plunges
text: in among the clothes. Her expression shows she has touched
text: something that startles her.
text: SHOT REVEALING INSIDE THE CLOSET
text: Betty separates clothes and we SEE an empty gun holster
text: hanging on a hook against the back wall of the closet.
text: She stands motionless, staring at it, then notices Brandon's
text: jacket hanging untidily on a hook with the inside pocket
text: exposed and a corner of her own suicide note showing.
text: CLOSE ON THE INSIDE OF THE JACKET POCKET AND THE EXPOSED
text: CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE. BETTY'S HAND ENTERS THE SHOT
text: and she draws the envelope from the pocket.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- NIGHT
text: As Betty closes the closet door, crosses to bunk. The
text: cruiser is pitching. She stands holding the suicide note
text: envelope finally turns it over, draws out the note, replaces
text: it. Then with a quick movement, she starts towards
text: companionway.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON BACK TOWARDS THE BOILING WAKE
text: Brandon is staring straight ahead of him, tight-lipped.
text: There is a DISTANT SOUND OF A PLANE. Brandon looks up,
text: searching the sky without changing expression. Betty comes
text: back up the companionway, sits down in a corner of the
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I decided I didn't want a
dialog: drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Wonder what?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: If you're doing all this just for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That, and the fun of it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I thought you had to be back to
dialog: the hotel. To leave my--my note.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That's right.
text: Silently, Betty takes out the note and holds it towards

scene_heading: PLANE NOISE.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: See anything up there?
text: As betty looks up, he lets go of the wheel, and makes a
text: sudden grab for the wrist of the hand holding the note.
text: There is a short, sharp struggle. Brandon has the note.
text: The wheel swings wildly and the cabin cruiser keels over
text: into a hard turn. Brandon thrusts the note into his pocket,
text: grabs the wheel, wrenches it around, gets the cruiser going
text: on course again. Betty leans in a corner of a seat, away
dialog: from him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Funny, I never thought of you that
dialog: way. You were so close too. We
dialog: were all pretty stupid about you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: Including Killaine.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Including Killaine...I still can't
dialog: think of you that way.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (staring straight
dialog: ahead)
dialog: I told you my father died in jail.
dialog: He stole a fortune. Most of it
dialog: pretty dirty money. I don't care
dialog: to have that known.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (same tone)
dialog: Larry Mitchell found out. So you
dialog: killed him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: In a way.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: If it was an accident, you could
dialog: have told the truth.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: So could you. But our records
dialog: were a little against us.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What your father did doesn't condemn
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Nobody believed I wasn't in on it.
dialog: I was just a dumb-smart collage
dialog: boy, and he was my father. I
dialog: thought it was a legitimate
dialog: business. He was a politician,
dialog: with fingers in a lot of pies. I
dialog: never saw the pies. They had names.
dialog: For the record. Innocent names.
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: You know where that kind of money
dialog: comes from, don't you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: The money that makes you Mr. Clark
dialog: Brandon. Let's you live in a
text: penthouse, on top of the Vancouver
dialog: Royal. Lets you own a cruiser.
dialog: Lets you do as you please, go where
dialog: you please. You big, open-handed,
dialog: generous guy. That's the kind of
dialog: money it takes, isn't it?
text: The PLANE NOISE is a little LOUDER. Brandon looks up at
text: it without much interest, then looks at Betty.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It buys things, just like any other
dialog: kind.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That man that was following us
dialog: last night--he didn't come back
dialog: this morning. I'm beginning to
dialog: wonder about him, too. Was he
dialog: really following me--or you?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No. I paid him off.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He'll come back...They always come
dialog: back when you give them money.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Not this one. And not Mitchell.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (recoiling)
dialog: You-killed-him?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (with a twisted
dialog: smile)
dialog: Magruder obliged me. No use my
dialog: saying it wasn't planned that way.
dialog: I had to clean up. I'm not a dumb-
dialog: smart college boy anymore.
dialog: (he takes a deep
dialog: breath)
dialog: Nobody in the world would believe
dialog: I didn't plan the whole thing.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I guess I'm a little screwy. Maybe
dialog: I could believe it. Should I try?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Don't go soft on me, baby. I've
dialog: got your note in my pocket. You
dialog: wrote it, all by your own self.
dialog: And I have to use it. It has to
dialog: be found in exactly the right place.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: So that I will never be found.
text: Brandon turns his head and stares full at her. He swallows.
text: He can't speak.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - I-BUREAU - PROJECTION ROOM --
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: The room is dark except for a strong white light over a
dialog: desk.
text: In the background there is a projection screen and a
text: comparison projector. The police technician is bending
text: over the desk looking at something through a magnifying
text: glass, as Killaine enters.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Got anything on the Goble case
dialog: yet?
text: The Technician puts down a magnifying glass.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Yes, I think so. Here are two
text: glazed manila envelopes.
dialog: (he holds them up)
dialog: One is the bag type. The other
dialog: one had the money in it. Don't
dialog: ask me how I know. I know.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'm interested in who handled it.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Four different people, Inspector.
dialog: Three men and a women. I've made
dialog: slides for two. They handled both
text: envelopes.
text: He fits two slides into the projector and switches on the
text: light. Focuses a couple of separate images on the screen.
text: One is a complete fingerprint, the other a portion such as
text: would be made by a tip of a finger.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: Goble. Second finger on left hand.
text: On the left, the morgue print. On
text: the right, print lifted from the
dialog: envelope.
text: He turns another knob and the two fingers draw together,
dialog: overlap, and coincide, so that the incomplete image
text: disappears altogether.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: No doubt about that one.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: How about Magruder?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: He checks too.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
text: That leaves two strangers.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: So far.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Try Betty Mayfield. The Mitchell
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Mayfield? She fit into this?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: She might.
text: Technician opens a file drawer and takes out a fingerprint
text: card. Lays it on the desk and picks up the magnifying
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: You'll have to take my word for
dialog: it. We don't make slides until we
dialog: have perfect prints for comparison.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: I'll take your word.
text: The Technician places another card beside the one he took
text: from the drawer, bends over, examines them through the
text: magnifying glass, straightens up and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Not a chance. Whorl and plain
text: arch. Different as salt and sand.
text: Killaine puts his hand in his pocket and takes out another
dialog: fingerprint card.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Try this one for the second
dialog: stranger.
text: Technician takes the card, looks at it, pushes the other
text: cards to one side.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Gun permit, huh?
dialog: (he lines up two
dialog: cards, studies
dialog: them)
dialog: Another Whorl--man size.
text: He studies the prints a moment longer, then faces Killaine.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: This gun permit was issued to Clark
dialog: Brandon?
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: The card says so, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: Brandon handled the money envelope.
text: Killaine turns instantly, and starts out, CAMERA FOLLOWING
text: As he opens the door, he meets Driscoll coming in. Driscoll
text: backs away, Killaine exits.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - I-BUREAU - CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: What's the face for, Driscoll?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: Magruder's conked out. Adrenaline
dialog: injections, oxygen tent. He may
dialog: come out of it and he may not. As
dialog: a source of quick information, we
dialog: can't forget him.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: We don't need him.
text: He opens door of I-Bureau.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Go on in. See what they've got.
dialog: All I need now is a warrant and a
text: pair of wings.
text: He goes out of SHOT quickly. Driscoll looks after him,
text: then starts into I-Bureau.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COAST GUARD STATION - STEVENSTON, B.C. -- NIGHT
text: There is an armed guard at the entrance and a Canadian
text: Coast Guard flag flies over the building. A Vancouver
text: police car drives up at high speed and squeals to a stop
text: beside the sentry. Killaine leans out of the window, shows
text: the sentry his badge.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Inspector Killaine. Vancouver
dialog: City Police. Commander Goodwin's
dialog: expecting me.
speaker_heading: SENTY
dialog: Very good, sir.

speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX - AT BERTH -- NIGHT
text: Engines idling. A rating stands by to cast off. Killaine
text: and a Coast Guard officer come rapidly down ramp, jump on

text: without torpedo tubes, moves off from berth, picking up
text: speed rapidly.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN WATER - VALKYRIE -- NIGHT
text: Traveling at high speed in open water.
text: PLANE NOISE high overhead.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: Brandon at wheel. Betty pressed into corner of a seat
text: watching him. Spray drifts over them.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- COAST GUARD PLANE IN FLIGHT
text: A converted Hudson bomber.
text: CLOSER ON THE PLANE
text: The pilot and co-pilot can be seen through the Plexiglas.
text: They are searching the water below with their eyes.
scene_heading: INT. HUDSON BOMBER - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
scene_heading: SHOOTING PAST PILOT AND CO-PILOT
text: Pilot pushes the wheel forward and the plane goes into a
text: steep dive.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT FROM PILOT'S ANGLE
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: The cabin cruiser is seen far below, moving fast through
text: the water. Or rather its wake is seen. The cruiser itself,
text: at this height, is almost invisible.
scene_heading: INT. HUDSON BOMBER - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: Betty is looking up at the plane. Brandon reaches inside
text: his coat. His hand comes out with a heavy automatic, which
dialog: we have seen before.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: Get down in the cabin, Betty.
text: Her eyes go down. She sees the gun, reacts. A bitter
text: smile moves her lips.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Why? To love ten minutes longer?
dialog: And in the meantime, protect you?
dialog: (her voice becomes
dialog: taunting)
dialog: Why don't you shoot me now and get
dialog: it over with--
text: she looks up towards the PLANE NOISE.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: If you think you have the time.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT BEHIND BRANDON
text: A fog bank about a mile ahead.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (as if to himself)
dialog: Always some fog out here.
text: He looks up in the direction of the PLANE NOISE which is
dialog: increasing.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: There better be.
scene_heading: INT. HUDSON BOMBER - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: SHOT THROUGH THE PLEXIGLAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS OF THE PILOT
scene_heading: AND Co-PILOT.
text: The cruiser down on the water is getting rapidly larger,
text: but still cannot be seen who is in the cockpit, or even
text: how may persons. The co-pilot puts a pair of binoculars
text: to his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: Brandon with one hand on the wheel, the other holding the
text: gun. He is staring up towards the plane. Betty is not in
text: the cockpit. Brandon turns towards where she was, reacts
text: sharply, seeing she has disappeared. An expression of
text: frustration and despair shows on his face for a moment.
text: The NOISE OF THE PLANE in the power dive becomes furiously
text: LOUD. Brandon's head goes around again.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE -- THE PLANE DIVING DIRECTLY ON THE VALKYRIE
text: Brandon sees it. It dives down almost into the CAMERA.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT -- FROM WATER LEVEL
text: The Valkyrie and the plane. At the last moment, the plane
text: pulls out of the dive, only thirty or forty feet above the
text: Valkyrie, and goes into a climbing bank.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - VALKYRIE - SHOOTING FROM BEHIND
text: The fog bank is dead ahead. The coast Guard plane is
text: climbing off to the left. The Valkyrie reaches the fog
text: bank, plunges into it, and becomes invisible.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT IN FOG -- NIGHT
text: Brandon is steering straight ahead. He reaches to cut off
text: the engines. The Valkyrie slows down. Betty's head emerges
text: from the companionway. Her eyes meet Brandon's. Brandon
text: is silent.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You hoped I'd jumped overboard,
dialog: didn't you?
text: Brandon does not answer, just stares at her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But I wouldn't make it that easy
dialog: for you.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - BRIDGE OF LYNX
text: Coast Guard Lt. in command. Killaine beside him, a talker

speaker_heading: TALKER
dialog: (into his mouthpiece)
text: Bearing one-three-five.
dialog: (to Coast Guard
dialog: officer)
dialog: Bearing one-three-five, sir.
text: Coast Guard officer nods.
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
dialog: (to helmsman)
dialog: Get it?
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: One-three-five, sir.
text: He turns his wheel a little. The Lynx changes course,
text: heeling over. Coast Guard officer puts binoculars to his
text: eyes, wings them in a slow arc. They come to a stop, fixed.
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: There!
text: Killaine follows his pointing finger.
scene_heading: WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT ACROSS OPEN EMPTY WATER - A FLARE
text: HANGING IN THE SKY AND FALLING
text: As it falls, it is swallowed in a bank of fog.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: (tensely)
dialog: Fog!
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
dialog: We got a lot of it out here.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: Brandon will have counted on that.
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
dialog: No doubt. We have something he
dialog: may not have counted on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CLOSE SHOT -- CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE IN FOG -- NIGHT
text: NOISE OF THE PLANE overhead, loud but diminishing. Brandon
text: sits listening, his hand on the wheel.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (contempt in her
dialog: voice now)
dialog: You'll never make it. You've out-
dialog: smarted yourself.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: I'm still on course to Victoria.
dialog: Nobody saw you get on board, nobody
dialog: seen you since.
text: The Valkyrie has now stopped on the swell. It rocks a
text: little. There are confused NOISES in the distance. PLANE
text: NOISE, possibly some other kind of ENGINE NOISE. In the
dialog: fog you can't tell what it is.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You didn't leave the note.
text: Brandon puts the gun down close to his body, and pats his
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It wasn't the time or place. Don't
dialog: worry about the note, baby. I'm
dialog: playing for my neck now.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And I'm begging for my life--and
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Mine?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes. Yours. You haven't murdered
dialog: anybody. You killed Mitchell.
dialog: Wasn't that an accident? It must
dialog: have been. If you kill a
dialog: blackmailer, you kill him dead--so
dialog: that he can't talk anymore.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Mitchell was dead enough.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And that nasty man that followed
dialog: us last night. You didn't kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Who'd believe it but you? I took
text: him out to sea and threw him in
dialog: the water. Even if they find him,
dialog: what connects him with me?
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Magruder does.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You think Magruder wants to hang
dialog: beside me?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But the next one is murder. First
dialog: the little step, then the longer
dialog: step , and then the step you can
dialog: never take back. You could tell
dialog: about Mitchell. You could tell
dialog: about Magruder--and the detective.
dialog: It would hurt, but you could do
dialog: it. You could never tell about
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Would I want to?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Every day of your life you'll want
dialog: me. You'll never get over it.
dialog: Every time you see your face in
dialog: the mirror--
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (with a sudden burst
dialog: of fury)
dialog: Shut up! Cut it out! Even if I
dialog: have to kill both of us--
text: He breaks off with a disgusted gesture. A faint smile
text: shows on Betty's lips.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT
text: Killaine and the Coast Guard officer are peering ahead
text: into the thick fog. The Lynx is just drifting. The
text: helmsman is standing on hand on the wheel. The Coast Guard
text: officer turns to the Talker.
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
dialog: Nothing yet?
text: The Talker shakes his head, then:
speaker_heading: TALKER
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: Just a minute, sir. I believe--
text: RADAR SCREEN BELOW THE BRIDGE
text: A blob of light takes the form in one corner of it. CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE THE RADAR OPERATOR. He reaches for
text: a mike.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Change course about five degrees
dialog: south
text: After a moment the blob of light on the radar screen moves
text: towards the center of the screen.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Your dead on now. Hold it there.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT
text: The four MEN on it are now tensely staring straight ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: Brandon is listening again. Far away there is a faint
text: SOUND OF DIESEL ENGINES, but growing rapidly louder. He
text: stands up and twists his body, still holding the gun, looks
text: back, then slips quickly behind the wheel again.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Radar.
text: He guns the motor and the cabin cruiser shoots forward
text: into high speed. Betty has to hang on. He swings the
text: cruiser around on another course and guns for it for all
text: its worth for a moment or two, then abruptly cuts the motors
text: again. Cruiser slows down, once more drifts. The ENGINE
text: SOUND has now stopped. Brandon turns to face Betty, who
text: is now standing up.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: This is it, Betty. They'll find
dialog: us again, fog or no fog.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (speaking slowly,
dialog: with difficulty)
dialog: If it has to be--do you mind if I
dialog: do it myself?
dialog: (pause, then quickly)
dialog: Oh, I don't mean with the gun.
dialog: This is no trick. When I wrote
dialog: that note you have in your pocket--
dialog: that was no trick either. It's
dialog: not so hard for me as you think.
dialog: I'm not crying about it, I've been
dialog: skating close to it for quite some
dialog: time. The water is cold down there--
dialog: (she gives a little
dialog: shrug)
dialog: But so is everything else. And
dialog: there's you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes. You. You're not really a
dialog: murderer yet.
scene_heading: QUICK SHOT OF RADAR SCREEN
text: A Blob of light slides into it from another corner.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: TALKER
dialog: (into his mouthpiece)
text: Bearing one-eight-one.
dialog: (to Coast Guard
dialog: officer)
dialog: One-eight-one, sir. Changed course
dialog: due South.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: (to helmsman)
dialog: One-eight-one..
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: One-eight-one, sir.
text: Helmsman swings the wheel around. The Lynx veers, heeling
text: over, comes level again.
scene_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT - DOWN ON LYNX (FROM HELICOPTER)
text: Following at an equal speed, then the Lynx gradually pulls
text: away into the fog and disappears. The NOISE OF ITS ENGINES
text: is still heard for a few moments.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: Still motionless on the water idling. There is a SOUND OF
text: THE CUTTER'S MOTORS, far off, but increasing. Brandon is
text: paying no attention. He is staring at Betty.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (thickly)
dialog: I'm not a murderer yet, you said.
dialog: Come here. Come closer. Let me
dialog: look at you.
text: Betty holds off, then slowly comes towards him along the
text: seat, until their faces close. He searches her eyes.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I think you mean that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Do you think I was faking?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (thickly)
dialog: If I did-I don't-now.
text: He puts his arms around her, pulls her close. There is
text: kind of wonder in his eyes. Hers stare back at him, calm
text: and level. He kisses her hard on the mouth, let's her go.
text: She pulls away from him, along the seat. She doesn't know
text: what to think of him. She is terrified, resigned, and at
text: the same time, he still has an attraction for her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: The kiss of death.
dialog: (laughs)
text: With a new twist.
text: He lifts the gun in his hand, looks at it, tosses it
text: overboard. He reaches inside his coat, takes out the
dialog: suicide note.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Dear Inspector Killaine. This is
dialog: goodbye. You were right. I had a
dialog: secret."
text: The DIESEL ENGINE SOUND has grown louder. Brandon looks
text: up from the note.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: A secret, Betty---as who hasn't
text: He crumples the note and envelope in his hand, drops them
text: over the side of the boat. Opens the engine full throttle
text: and the power of the cruiser almost tears it out from under
text: them. Betty is thrown violently against the seat. He
text: reaches out and straightens her up. There is a mad light
text: in his eyes. His face is no longer hard.
scene_heading: SERIES OF HELICOPTER SHOTS
text: Of the chase, alternating with the Cabin Cruiser and the
text: Lynx, as the Lynx gradually closes in. During these shots
text: Cabin Cruiser and the Lynx both come out of the fog bank
text: into moonlit water, but there is another fog bank half a
text: mile or so ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: SHOT FROM BACK OF CRUISER
text: The Lynx is moving up fast, and the Coast Guard officer
text: can be seen on the bridge, with binoculars to his eyes. A
text: rating, hanging on tight, is stripping the canvas off a
text: twin machine gun mount.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: (above the roar of
dialog: the motors)
dialog: Stand up! Let them take a good
dialog: look at you. Be sure they see
dialog: you. That fellow back there has
dialog: night glasses. Then jump---well
text: out to the side. Just as far as
dialog: you can.
text: Betty does what he tells her. She waves. There is an
text: answering wave from the bridge of the Lynx. We can't see
text: who's waving. Betty sets herself to jump. She tries to
text: speak to Brandon, but nothing comes out. There is a great
text: deal of NOISE from motors. Gravely, Brandon lifts his
text: hand and salutes her. She jumps.
text: FOLLOWING SHOT AS BETTY HITS THE WATER AND THE CRUISER
scene_heading: PULLS AWAY RAPIDLY
text: Towards another fog bank beyond the clear space.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
text: Full speed astern.
speaker_heading: TALKER
text: Full speed astern.
text: The cutter heaves on reversed engines, nearly stands on
text: its tail in the water, drifts past Betty, comes to a stop,
text: then moves forward slowly, swinging around to get close to
dialog: her.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: HIGH SHOT of Cabin Cruiser as it reaches the fog and plunges
text: into it. HELICOPTER WITH CAMERA plunges into fog at the
dialog: same time.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Stopped on the swell. Betty in the water, fighting her
text: way towards it. A life belt and rope are dropped neatly
text: beside her. She grabs it and is drawn towards the side of
text: the lynx. Coast Guard officer, Killaine, and a rating put
text: rope ladder over the side. Killaine starts down the rope
dialog: ladder.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT -- DOWN FROM THE DECK OF THE LYNX
text: Past Killaine on the rope ladder to water, as Betty is
text: pulled to foot of ladder. Killaine reaches down, gets her
text: hand. She grasps rope ladder, Killaine helps her up onto
dialog: it. Business of getting her on board cutter.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: Brandon staring straight ahead of him, gripping the wheel
text: hard, giving the cruiser everything it has, driving as if
text: he had a clear, open course. HEARS A FOGHORN, somewhere
text: of the fog. Cocks his head, tries to gauge the direction.
text: Turns the wheel a little.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX - DECK -- NIGHT
text: As Betty comes over the side, Killaine holding her up,
text: Betty is shivering with cold. The rating hauls up the
text: rope ladder and the life belt. Coast Guard signals the
text: bridge ad the Lynx starts moving ahead again.
scene_heading: COAST GUARD OFFICER
dialog: (to Betty)
dialog: Better get those wet clothes off
dialog: in a hurry, Miss. My cabin's at
dialog: your disposal.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much.
text: He salutes, turns away, after giving a quick look at
dialog: Killaine.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Killaine)
dialog: He could have killed me a dozen
dialog: times. You'd never have known.
speaker_heading: KILLAINE
dialog: We know everything.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (almost passionately)
dialog: No, Jeff. You don't. He's not a
