dialog: Second Draft of
dialog: A Screenplay
dialog: by
dialog: James Goldman
dialog: Revised 11th October
scene_heading: A_ WORD ABOUT CASTLES
text: THE LION IN WINTER was a special and peculiar sort of history
text: play. To make its style and intention clear on film, the look
text: of the castle where it occurs and the sense of castle life
dialog: need to be earthly real and, at the same time, strikingly
dialog: different from what we're used to seeing in King Arthur
dialog: movies.
dialog: Almost nothing is known about the castle at Chinon as it was
dialog: in Henry's time; and little enough is known about 12th century
dialog: castles in general. One thing is clear, however, and
dialog: important for our purposes: only that such castles looked
dialog: nothing like what we expect.
text: The stone fortresses that remain today were only the shell of
dialog: castles as they were lived in. Most of the shelter for most
text: of the staff, all of the workshops -- the armories, forges,
text: stables and so on -~ were made of wood. A castle courtyard
text: was a crowded, teeming, dirty place with much more wood than
text: stone to greet the eye.
text: A major castle, as Chinon was, was like a miniature town.
dialog: Everything necessary to the life of the establishment existed
text: inside the walls. Poultry, livestock, looms and tailors,
dialog: mills for grinding grain, vast storerooms, water wells, boot
dialog: makers, gardens -- everything vital to life under siege was
text: somehow packed in.
dialog: At special times, like the Christmas Court during which the
text: film occurs, the congestion was even worse than usual. All
text: guests, the visiting nobles and clergymen, traveled with
text: trains of varying size. So that, in addition to the usual
text: crowding, we find hundreds of soldiers and servants living
text: outdoors, jammed together in tents, huddling for warmth around
text: dozens of fires.
dialog: Living conditions, even for royalty, were crude and rough.
text: The castle rooms were spartan: a bed, a few chairs, chests for
text: age, clothes hung in the open on racks. Floors were
text: red with Straw which-was-swept.away and replaced only
text: occasionally. Interiors at high noon on a clear day were ~
text: always dark, illumination coming from extremely smoky torches
text: and candles. In winter, wind whistled through the open slit
text: windows and the place was freezing cold.
dialog: 
text: A lot of their habits seem oddly contradictory. In spite of
text: the cold, everyone from the King to his vassal slept naked.
text: In the midst of the general crudeness, nobles wore the most
text: exquisite fabrics ~~ cloths of gold and silver, delicate
text: brocades. Clothing was generally dirty and even at a
text: Christmas Court, nothing looked clean. Tables were set with
dialog: fine linen and napkins of a kind were used; yet most of the
dialog: eating was done with fingers. Sanitary conditions were
dialog: di
text: appalling. For some reason, castles, in addition to their
text: human tenants, were populated by hundreds of dogs.
dialog: All these things -- the grime and dirt and cold, the coarse-
dialog: ness and crudity of life in general -- are vital to the look
dialog: of the film. on the whole, there are few specific references
text: to these elements in the screenplay. Rather than clutter up
text: the goings on with data. It seemed better to suggest them
text: here and let the castle that the story moves in be imagined.
scene_heading: A_ NOTE ABOUT MUSIC
text: On the stage, Christmas carols were used for incidental music
dialog: in good effect. Carols used were from all periods. There is
dialog: something available through musical style -- using medieval
text: instruments to play 19th century tunes with contemporary
dialog: harmonizations -- that should have a considerable help in
text: letting an audience know that it's an odd and different kind
dialog: of history show that they're seeing.
dialog: The point to be made here is that the music is a useful and
dialog: important element. It wants to be crisp, clear, spirited and,
dialog: above all, distinctive; that is, it needs to have a sound we
dialog: haven't heard before. And because the style of the writing
text: involves a mixing of odd elements it seems right that the
dialog: freshness of musical sound should be achieved the same way.

text: excitement. The picture is frozen and the title
text: remains as we pull back enough to see bright blue i
text: sky, green field, with a festive Camelot-like
text: little tent in the distance. HENRY, we now see, is !
text: poised for dueling, sword in hand.
text: (HENRY is 50, an age at which, in his time, men
text: were either old or dead. Not HENRY. very nearly
dialog: all he ever was, he is enjoying that final rush of
dialog: physical and mental vigor that comes to some men

dialog: decline.

dialog: Come on. Come for me.

text: raining blow after blow. HENRY parries only, never
text: striking back, always retreating.
text: (They fight across the field. Suddenly, HENRY,
text: moving backwards, trips and falls. With a cry, his
text: OPPONENT charges at him. Effortlessly, HENRY
text: strikes his first blow. The OPPONENT'S sword flies
text: from his hand as he sprawls flat out on the ground.
text: HENRY bounds to his feet, moves to his fallen
text: opponent and looks down. i
dialog: 
text: (Cut to the OPPONENT from HENRY'S POV. It's JOHN,
dialog: his son of 16, who, in 18 years, was to become the
text: worst king in English history. Still pudgy with
text: baby fat, he has a round open face that is
text: enchanting when he smiles. He is frightened now
text: and shaken up.
text: (Cut to HENRY from JOHN'S POV. He glares down,
text: sword in hand. Then, with a quick, gruff smile he

dialog: not the set we're used to seeing - grandstands,

text: consisted of the broad, shallow mud trench that lay
text: between the inner and outer walls of a castle. It
text: is primitive and crude, not glamorous. The

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Does it matter? If they haven't yet, they will.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I want to reach a settlement. I left you with too little
dialog: earlier.
text: (PHILIP hands HENRY a glass, sits in the other
dialog: chair)
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Yes; nothing is too little.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm sorry you're not fonder of me, lad. Your father always

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: No wonder he loved everyone.
speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: PHILIP

dialog: They were boiling it in Ireland before the snakes left.

dialog: Well -- things look a little bleak for Henry, don't they.
dialog: You'll say yes to Richard when he comes; arms, soldiers,
dialog: anything he asks for.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I'd be foolish not to.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And withdraw it all before the battle ever started.

dialog: every war, you twisted every treaty, you played mock-the monk
dialog: and then you made him love you for it.
text: (He begins stalking toward HENRY)
dialog: I was there. His last words went to you.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: He was a loving man and you learned nothing of it.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I learned how much fathers live in sons. A king like you has

scene_heading: (Cut to PHILIP & HENRY, close up)

dialog: Why him? Why always him and never me?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: He was the oldest -- he came first.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Christ, Henry, is that all?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You went with Eleanor.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's not my fault. I won't be blamed.

dialog: There are pictures. She was prettier than you.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

dialog: In exchange for what?
scene_heading: (Cut to ELEANOR, close up)

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Like any thinking person, I should like to think there was -- I
dialog: don't care whose or which -- some God. Not out of fear: death
dialog: is a lark, it's life that stings. But if there were some God,
dialog: then I'd exist in his imagination, like Antigone in Sophocles'.
dialog: I'd have no contradictions, no confusions, no waste parts of
dialog: misplaced elements and then, oh Henry, then I'd make some
dialog: sense. I'd be a Queen in Arcady and not an animal in chaos.

dialog: I know -- and good God, look at them. Young Henry: vain,

dialog: possible. Suppose your first son dies, ours did -- it's
dialog: possible. Suppose you're daughtered next. We were -- that,
dialog: too, is possible. How old is Daddy then?

dialog: and you can blot him out and call me cruel. For these ten
dialog: years you've lived with everything I've lost and loved another
