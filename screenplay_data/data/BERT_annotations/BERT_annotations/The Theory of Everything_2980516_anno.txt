scene_heading: INT. EMPIRE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY (LATE 1980'S)
dialog: 
text: TWO BESPECTACLED EYES. Blinking. Alert. Male. Middle-aged.
text: Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN, middle-aged, (JANE
text: HAWKING) removing the glasses from his nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: The MAN's POV, as -
dialog: 
text: - his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are
dialog: removed.
dialog: 
text: - his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN's hands POLISHING his glasses
dialog: with a cloth.
dialog: 
text: - his BLURRY POV then shifts (as she steps aside) onto a
text: SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down.
dialog: 
text: - his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his
dialog: nose, and -
dialog: 
text: - with this, his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS, and the
text: SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY (10) playing
text: HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR.
dialog: 
scene_heading: - Beyond the BOY, TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin
text: (unceremoniously) to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony. They
text: lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes. One blows his
dialog: nose.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON: The eyes behind the glasses watching, his eyes
text: finally looking downward...as we hear a metallic CLICKING
dialog: sound - "CLICK, CLICK, CLICK..."
dialog: 
text: - ANGLE ON: HIS HAND, which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE...
dialog: 
text: - then on a COMPUTER MONITOR (mounted to the CHAIR), words
text: form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK'. The man
text: is at work, selecting LETTERS, then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU
dialog: ...making sentences by these means.
dialog: 
scene_heading: - OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS (ECUs) of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR.
dialog: 
text: We see...a TUFT of BROWN HAIR...his HAND on chair arm-rest
text: ...his FEET on a wheelchair's foot-rests...JANE's HANDS
dialog: arrange the BROWN HAIR...adjust his THIN ARMS...but never do
dialog: we see the full man, as -
dialog: 
text: - the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion
dialog: the PARTY forward.

dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON: the MAN's HAND, pushing a TOGGLE-STICK CONTROLLER,

dialog: motor.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMBRIDGE STREETS - DAY (EARLY-MID 1960's)
dialog: 
text: ...the FRONT WHEEL of STEPHEN's BICYCLE, SPINNING VERY VERY
dialog: FAST...
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN HAWKING (in his early 20s) and his friend, BRIAN
text: (same age), race each other recklessly through the NARROW,
text: WINDING LANES. It looks VERY DANGEROUS. They are neck and
dialog: neck. And they are loving it.
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN HAWKING, his face almost entirely covered with
text: spectacles and floppy hair, slight of frame, a velvet jacket
text: and velvet bow tie, eccentric-looking. STEPHEN is a fun-
text: loving, playful, active, young student.
dialog: 
text: BRIAN, STEPHEN's best friend. More interested in life than
dialog: studies, as we shall see.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN and BRIAN arrive at the party, dismount at speed and,
text: running to a walk, crash their BIKES into a HEDGE. BRIAN wins
text: the race, raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY. We
speaker_heading: follow them in...(CONTINUOUS SHOT)
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: ...STEPHEN and BRIAN enter, and the CAMERA finally follows
text: them into the main room of the PARTY.
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN and BRIAN come to a halt in the doorway as they
speaker_heading: OBSERVE -
dialog: 
text: - a CROWDED ROOM engaged in lively bubbly conversation. In
text: the background suitably elegant music plays.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: First to find a drink.
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN and BRIAN make their way through the GUESTS, looking
text: for the BAR. BRIAN eyes the PRETTY GIRLS he passes...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sure the secret of the universe
dialog: has something to do with sex. There
dialog: you go--why don't you do your
dialog: doctorate on that? The physics of
dialog: love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: More your field, I think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You'd better decide on your
dialog: subject. I'm serious--they'll boot
dialog: you out.
dialog: 
text: They reach the PUNCH-BOWL. BRIAN tastes the PUNCH with his
text: finger, and UNIMPRESSED, fills TWO GLASSES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A YOUNG WOMAN, JANE WILDE, (18) arrives at the door with her
text: friend DIANA. DIANA is unimpressed by the party.
dialog: 
text: JANE, shy, has her hair up in a fashionable bouffant roll.
text: DIANA is more vivacious, and touches up her lipstick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Scientists! Don't worry. We don't
dialog: have to stay long. Looks
text: mortifyingly dull.
dialog: (seeing a boy)
dialog: Oh, hang on--
dialog: (waves to the boy)
dialog: Be right back, okay? Okay?
dialog: 
text: JANE nods, as DIANA goes over to GREET the boy and then walk
text: off together with him into the crowd.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: JANE, marooned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: At the PUNCH-BOWL, drinking punch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I applied for a job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Civil Service.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, it's a back-up plan--in your
dialog: case not a bad idea. Did they
dialog: accept you?

dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: STEPHEN's POV of JANE, standing across the room,
text: now holding a WINE-GLASS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Unfortunately, that I'll never
dialog: know. Morning of their exam,
dialog: I...(smiles)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: - slept in. Well, thank Christ,
dialog: the world has lost a promising pay-
dialog: clerk.
dialog: 
text: BRIAN holds out a FULL PUNCH GLASS for STEPHEN but STEPHEN
text: still has his eye on JANE. BRIAN follows STEPHEN's GAZE as -
dialog: 
text: - STEPHEN and JANE's eyes meet. They hold this look, until
text: she shyly looks away.
dialog: 
dialog: BRIAN has observed this exchange.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (LATIN)
dialog: Quo est femella?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I was going to ask you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Actually--I think she's--yes--
dialog: Basil's sister. Wilde--Jane Wilde.
speaker_heading: (RUSSIAN ACCENT)
dialog: "So. You like for me I introduce?"
dialog: 
dialog: STEPHEN contemplates this, as we -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: DIANA changes the RECORD - to BOP JAZZ. GUESTS immediately
text: take the DANCE-FLOOR and start DANCING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA returns to JANE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: That's better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who is that guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (looking at Stephen)
dialog: Oh. He's strange, clever, goes on
dialog: Ban The Bomb marches.
dialog: (spying another boy)
dialog: Oh, there's David. Come on.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: BRIAN walks off to talk to another GIRL, while -
dialog: 
text: - STEPHEN, left alone, decides to slowly approach JANE. JANE
text: has hardly touched her wine. STEPHEN has a beer.
dialog: 
text: They look around the room together, and then -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Science?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Arts.
dialog: 
text: More silence. They look elsewhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: So what do you-?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What's a cosmologist?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: It's a kind of religion--for
dialog: intelligent atheists.
speaker_heading: (SUSPICIOUSLY)
dialog: You're not religious, are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: C of E. Church of England.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
dialog: - England.
speaker_heading: (SMILES CHEEKILY)
dialog: I suppose someone has to be.
dialog: 
text: JANE is not sure whether to take offence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So--what do cosmologists worship
dialog: then?

speaker_heading: (GRINS)
dialog: A single unifying equation that

dialog: universe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (AMUSED)
dialog: Really? So what's the equation?
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: That is the question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: The NEEDLE on the RECORD PLAYER now drops onto a ROLLING
dialog: STONES record - "TIME IS ON OUR SIDE"
dialog: 
text: Few people remain at the party now. The tables are empty -
text: the food is gone. The punch bowl is drained dry.
dialog: 
text: DIANA is still talking to DAVID, laughing.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: JANE, now listening intently to STEPHEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Why didn't you stay at Oxford?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: My finals papers were such a
dialog: shambles the examiners called me in
dialog: for a 'Viva' and I told them -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What's a viva?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
text: A mildly terrifying face-to-face
text: thingy. An interrogation.
dialog: So I told them that if they gave me
dialog: a 2nd class degree I'd stay with
dialog: them and do my research at Oxford,
dialog: but if they gave me the 1st I
dialog: needed to get into Cambridge, then
dialog: they'd never have to see me again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They gave you the 1st.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: They gave me the 1st.
dialog: 
text: JANE laughs. STEPHEN grins - it's a GREAT GRIN, as -

dialog: home.
dialog: 
text: DAVID and DAVID's HANDSOME FRIEND wait by the door. JANE
text: barely has time to speak before she is dragged away by DIANA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, I hope you find your
dialog: equation.
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN stands there, forlorn. But then JANE returns, stuffs
text: something in his hand, and then runs away.
dialog: 
text: It's a NAPKIN. On it - a PHONE NUMBER. He stares at it,
text: delighted, so much so that he taps one foot.

text: of mathematical problems to BRIAN, CARTER, ELLIS, REES and
text: several other YOUNG PHYSICISTS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIAMA
dialog: A little challenge for you all, as
dialog: you embark on your separate
dialog: doctoral journeys -
dialog: (handing paper to STEPHEN)
dialog: - whatever they may be, Mr Hawking -
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN looks up, winces, knowing he's way behind schedule.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Something to sort--the men from the
dialog: boys--the wheat from the chaff--
dialog: the mesons from the pi-mesons--the
dialog: quarks from the quacks--ten
dialog: questions--each more impregnable
dialog: than the last. Good luck. You'll
dialog: need it. Shall we say, Friday 3
dialog: o'clock?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (aside, gloomy,to STEPHEN)
dialog: This is going to hospitalize me.
dialog:

dialog: you got?
dialog: 
text: BRIAN goes to STEPHEN's desk, looking through papers to find
dialog: his answers. How many have you done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Morning, Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Afternoon, Stephen. Where are they?
dialog: Where are you hiding them? Your
dialog: answers.

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Brian, I have no idea what you're
dialog: talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: None.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You liar!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Later? You mean you haven't even

dialog: 
dialog: Beat.

speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sod off.
dialog: 
text: BRIAN exits, giving up on his pal. STEPHEN, hung-over, sits

dialog: 
text: He gets out of bed and turns on his ANCIENT TAPE-MACHINE.
text: WAGNER starts to play, loudly.
dialog: 
text: Later. Pouring milk into a cup of TEA, while listening to a
text: TAPED RECORDING of "THE RING CYCLE" by Wagner, and still in
text: his pyjamas, the dishevelled STEPHEN digs out the QUESTIONS
text: from a pile of TRASH on his desk. First he finds all manner
dialog: of chocolate wrappers, concert tickets, etc, until he finally
text: settles down with a clean pad and a pencil. He looks at the
text: clock. It reads -- 1:00PM. He sighs and looks out his window
text: at teeming university life, as he ponders.
dialog: 
text: He then starts to WRITE on a PAD, rapidly, effortlessly, the
text: CALCULATIONS pouring out of him, his writing hand adroit and
dialog: swift.
dialog: 
text: Distracted, he then reaches for his TEA and clumsily KNOCKS
text: THE CUP OVER. The tea washes over his only pad.
dialog: 
text: He hurriedly wipes it off, but it's too late. He looks around
dialog: for another pad, but to no avail.

dialog: Train timetables?
dialog: Stephen, these are totally
dialog: unacceptable--they expired a month

dialog: 
dialog: Laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Sorry. It's on the back. Had a

speaker_heading: REES

speaker_heading: (UNDERSTANDING THIS)

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JONATHAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
speaker_heading: HOWEVER --
dialog:

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Did you just say something?
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN decides not to respond.

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: You - are - welcome.
dialog: 
text: She smiles. She kisses him on the cheek, and then as she

speaker_heading: STEPHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: E-laine has offered to travel

speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (IMMENSELY HURT)
dialog: Will she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They said - two.
dialog: We've had so many.
dialog: 
text: The look in his eyes is his eloquent reply. Emotion overcomes

dialog: 
dialog: It's so sad and bizarre and they both realise it in this
text: moment. She tries to hide her tears by walking away from
text: him and turning her back, hiding her face.
dialog: 
text: STEPHEN watches her, as aware of the enormous significance of
text: this moment as she - then slowly - slowly - motors toward
text: her. He stops just behind her, then nudges her leg, ever so
text: gently, with his own lifeless foot, the way a pony will nudge
dialog: its familiar rider.
dialog: 
dialog: He clicks "PLAY" -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN

dialog: There ought to be something very
dialog: special about the boundary
dialog: conditions of the universe - and

dialog: there is no boundary? And there
dialog: should be no boundary to
dialog: human endeavour. We are all
dialog: different. There is no such thing
dialog: as a standard or run of the mill
