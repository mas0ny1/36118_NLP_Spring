text: Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47
text: The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
text: light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
text: dog and a young girl emerge.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Go on now Paul, don't be long.
text: The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
text: The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
text: the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
text: humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
text: reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
text: Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
text: bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
text: glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Paul... Paul?
text: The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Paul?!
text: The glow fades again.

scene_heading: EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY
scene_heading: GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
text: blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
text: is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
text: hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
text: a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
text: hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
text: Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
text: and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
text: As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
text: road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
text: way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
text: brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
text: the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
text: the blade. He nods appreciatively.

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Beautiful piece.
speaker_heading: VENDER
dialog: Damn straight. Practical

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: VENDER
dialog: $1,349.99.
text: CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Aren't you gonna get it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, it's rubbish.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY
text: We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,
text: passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a
text: line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What are you going to ask?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Do you feel that the killing of
dialog: Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,
text: invalidates Ripley's struggle at
dialog: the closed of the previous
dialog: installment?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I was going to ask that!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
speaker_heading: (IN KLINGON)
text: Tough tits four eyes.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Alright, next!
text: Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
dialog: pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL BIEHN
dialog: Hey there. Who's it to?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Graham.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL BIEHN
dialog: Graham.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Uh... are you... did you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL BIEHN
dialog: There you go.
text: SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL BIEHN
dialog: Hey there. Who's it to?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Clive.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL BIEHN
dialog: Clive.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Uh... are you... did you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL BIEHN
dialog: There you go.
text: SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I... I need to photograph him.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: You can take it from there.
text: CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
text: themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes
text: the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with
text: MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move
text: off, looking at their spoils.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
speaker_heading: (HIGH FIVING)
dialog: YES!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That was amazing. I was actually a
dialog: bit nervous.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Really? I wasn't.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good egg, wasn't he?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: She NEEDS to call me.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.
text: On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -
text: ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying
text: the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
text: rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
text: whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and
text: down, making sure everything is in order.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Looks good, right?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes, it's very impressive.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: It really does the image justice. I
dialog: never noticed the third tit.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: That was Graham's idea.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Ladies man, huh? You guys happy?
dialog: You got enough pens? You wanna
dialog: Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'll have a fat Coke please?
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: A fat what?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Coke.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Oh you man a FAT Coke.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Fat coke.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes please.

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: When do we start?
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Ten minutes ago.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Why is it so quiet?
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
text: Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main
dialog: pavillion.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I
dialog: wanted to find out if he actually
text: eats the brains.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: I can make a call.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: It'll pick up when he's done.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm nervous.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Don't be. The hard work's done, we
dialog: have a great story and as usual
dialog: your renderings jump from the page.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: All we have to do now is sit back
dialog: and enjoy.
text: A child approaches.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Queen Jelva welcomes thee.
speaker_heading: CHILD

scene_heading: Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER
text: They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE
text: looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
text: Three copies.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you
dialog: should have given her four.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's sick.
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yeah, but three copies?
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Better than Carl Weathers.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: YES!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Would you like a copy?
speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Are you nuts? My office is full of
dialog: junk.
text: The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Graham, I need a drink.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM
text: drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE
text: sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar
text: is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.

dialog: 7.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff
text: from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console
text: plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at
text: a map. Other maps are scattered about.
speaker_heading: CLIVE (O.S.)
dialog: It was like the Prancing Pony in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Nasty Hobbitses.
text: CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
text: towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly
text: incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs
text: on a black leather cord.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: They think they're so cool.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hey, are you excited about going to
dialog: Area 51?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Hell yes.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: 06.30 check out?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: A-ffirmative.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Three, two, one...
speaker_heading: GRAHAM CLIVE
dialog: Beep. Beep.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Good night, Graham.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good night, Clive.
text: They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
text: plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Are you asleep?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Shall we try and storm the Citadel
dialog: before we nod off?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Couldn't hurt could it?
text: We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
text: The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Cover me.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely
text: sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the
text: reception desk. His head hits the bell.
dialog: DING!
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
text: The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
text: across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
text: valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's not ours.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, that's ours.
text: A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
text: the range in its day. Still looks good.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Oh.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
text: the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
text: the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Fucking Borg.
dialog: (giving the finger)
dialog: Assimilate this!
text: The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
text: can be heard whooping within.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: INT. RV - MORNING
text: CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
text: black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
text: fusses with maps and provisions.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Breakfast?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Java. Straight up.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Any solids?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, let's punch through. Miles make
text: the eggs taste sweeter.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I love eggs!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on
text: the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
dialog: I need your map skills.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good job I pre-pared.
text: GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
dialog: (Chewie) seat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's a shame I don't have some
dialog: controls on this side. That way, I
dialog: could take over if you needed the
dialog: loo.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yeah, I could say "take the helm."
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: "Take the helm, number one."
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I
dialog: need a number two."
text: They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
text: his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: "Least I've got Cerebro, eh?
dialog:

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Impressive.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Most impressive.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: And let's not forget, we've always
dialog: got Analogue.
text: GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Not when we're driving Graham.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Sorry.
text: GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
text: percolator gurgles in the galley.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Sounds like coffee o'clock.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've
dialog: had my first cup of J.
text: GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
text: prawns. He inspects the shells.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Looks like a pile of dead droids.
text: A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
dialog: awkward.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You boys all set? Can I get you
dialog: anything else?
text: GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RV - DAY
text: They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Amazing, isn't it? There are
dialog: 295,734,134 people in this country
dialog: and we haven't seen a soul for a
dialog: hundred miles. Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What about that old woman on
dialog: crutches we saw hitchhiking?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Apart from her. I suppose that's
dialog: why they established the Dreamland
dialog: facility out here.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Far from prying eyes.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Did you know the site was selected
dialog: in the mid-1950s for testing of the
dialog: U-2 spyplane, due to its
dialog: remoteness, proximity to existing
dialog: facilities and presence of a dry
dialog: lake bad for landings?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Shall we have a bite before or
dialog: after we hit the Black Mailbox?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Before.
scene_heading: INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
text: customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
dialog: related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
text: speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
text: bumper stickers.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: "Watch The Skies" or "Alien
dialog: Onboard?"
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
text: looking back at PAT.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
dialog: "Alien Onboard."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Nice choice. So, where have you
dialog: boys come from?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: (MUMBLY)
dialog: San Diego.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Comic-Con?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How could you tell?
text: We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
text: the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Just a guess. My nephew launched a
dialog: comic down there a couple of years
dialog: ago. Sort of dramatized the
dialog: accounts of some of the folk we've
dialog: had in here.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Encounter Briefs?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: That's it. You heard of it, huh?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I've got all six.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Well whaddya know? Small world.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Do you get a lot of UFO types round
dialog: here?
text: We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
text: paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Some.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Have you ever seen one?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Really?! You've seen more than one
dialog: UFOs?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Well, I don't know what they were.
dialog: So as far as I'm concerned they're
dialog: unidentified and they were
text: definitely flying.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: And objects.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Damn straight. Whether or not they
dialog: were spaceships, I can't say.
dialog: Probably not, but I'd like to think
dialog: they were. Be a shame if we were
dialog: the only souls in the universe.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Did you now, it's estimated that
dialog: there are as many as 200 billion
dialog: galaxies in the observable universe
dialog: and each of those has approximately
dialog: 40 billion starts, around which
dialog: orbit countless planets and moons?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Makes you think though, don't it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Where is everybody?
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: You boys all set?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'd like a cup of coffee please.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Sure thing. How about you, sugar?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Can I have an E.T. malt please?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: You wanna sparkler in that?
text: GRAHAM smiles coyly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I'll take that as a yes.
text: She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
text: and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It's nice here, isn't it?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I think I might use the loo.
text: CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent
text: toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Yes dear, what can I get you?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Two beers.
speaker_heading: PAT
text: Coming right up.
scene_heading: INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING
text: CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
text: is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
text: mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: That is absolutely amazing!
scene_heading: INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING
text: CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up
dialog: into my palms.
text: CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
text: strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'm joking, of course. They have a
text: soap dispenser, shaped like an
dialog: alien's head. When you pump his
text: jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: (MUMBLING)
dialog: Clive...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It's hilarious.
text: GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What?
text: CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
text: CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.
speaker_heading: PAT (O.S.)
dialog: Here it comes!
text: GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
text: men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
text: drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
text: looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Okay then, beers for you gentleman.
text: A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
text: with a sparkler for the boys from
dialog: outer space.
text: The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: So, where you boys headed?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We're heading into Utah. Do
dialog: ourselves some hunting.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps
text: in front of the bangstick, right
dialog: Jake?
text: They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You got that right, Gus.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts
dialog: up quite a fight.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's what we're counting on.
text: They nudge each other and laugh.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I better make you something good
dialog: and hot. Long way to The Beehive.
text: PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and
text: fumbles for hi wallet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
text: He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
text: comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him
text: a wink. He leaves.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RV - EVENING
text: GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The
text: engine is running.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What took you so long?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I was putting the sticker on.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: They were an odd pair, weren't
dialog: they?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
text: CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: That wasn't their truck was it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING
text: The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln
text: Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his
text: rear view.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Nothing. How we doing?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We should be just about there.
text: They scan the roadside for a few seconds.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I've found it.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: THERE!!!
scene_heading: EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
text: moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door
text: opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
text: They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
speaker_heading: (REVERENTIALLY)
dialog: The Black Mailbox.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
text: the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It's amazing, isn't it? We're
dialog: actually here.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Area 51.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Dreamland.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The Groom Lake Military Test
dialog: Facility.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: MacArthur's Black Mile.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Is that a real one?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, I made it up myself.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Be great if we saw something.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by
dialog: a craft.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: That would be incredible. It just
text: sort of stops in the air and hovers
text: then just goes up really fast.
dialog: Whoosh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What would you do if they actually
dialog: landed?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Keep it together. First contact is
dialog: a big responsibility. They come in
dialog: peace, we go to pieces? That's not
dialog: how I roll.
text: CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What's wrong?
text: GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's them. They found us. I don't
dialog: know how but they found us.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Who? Who's found us?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The Libyans!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Run for it Marty!
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.
scene_heading: INT. RV - NIGHT
text: CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the
text: RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps
dialog: whoever it was turned doff.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Of course it's them. We're dead.
dialog: It's like Deliverance. They're
dialog: going to rape us and break our
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't want my arms broken!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: There's only one thing for it.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'm gonna have to fly blind.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
text: still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Probably best not to do that. I
dialog: couldn't really see anything.
text: They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
text: the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh God, oh God, oh God.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I need the toilet.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Me too.
text: The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
text: They're trying to overtake.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Don't let them get past.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Should I ram them?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What about the deposit?
text: CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
text: BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
text: avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
text: widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
text: bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
text: its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It wasn't them.
text: The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
text: CLIVE peer out of the window.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: We should see if they're okay.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I still need a wee.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I can hold mine.
text: GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
text: remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
text: Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: The bulb's gone in there.
scene_heading: EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
text: Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Hello?
text: They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Maybe you should call for help.
text: GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
text: sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
text: cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
text: black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I rather think these men need help.
dialog: Graham, give me the phone.
text: GRAHAM passes the phone over.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Seriously, I wouldn't do that.
text: GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
text: to his ear. We hear the operator.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: 911 Emergency. How may I direct
dialog: your call? Hello? Hello?
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
text: into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front
text: of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an
speaker_heading: ALIEN.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Put - the phone - down.
dialog: Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
text: backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
text: GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
text: speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What have you done to him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
text: I didn't do anything. He fainted.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes but you made him faint.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: I did not. Okay I did, but it's not
dialog: like i set my phaser to "Faint'.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You've got a phaser!?
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: No! Look, I need you to help. Can
dialog: you get this guy back onto your
dialog: wagon?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Are you going to probe us?
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: No! Where does that come from? Why
dialog: do people always assume we want to
dialog: stick something up their ass?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Don't you?
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: No. There's certainly nothing about
dialog: it in the encounter manual. As a
dialog: rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
dialog: people find it easier to deal with
dialog: earthly transgressions if they
dialog: suppress it with absurd fantasies
dialog: about alien probing.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: It's just a theory. Listen, focus
dialog: okay? I promise you I won't hurt
dialog: you, I just need your help.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You need my help?
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: How come I can understand you? Are
dialog: you using some sort of neural
dialog: language router?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: No, I'm speaking English you prick.
dialog: (off GRAHAM's expression)
dialog: Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Graham Willy.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's the writer, Clive Gollings.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Well, let's get Clive into the RV
dialog: and get going. I'll explain
dialog: everything on the way. Please.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: North.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Well, then we're gonna have to
dialog: hustle, aren't we?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: BUT-
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Look Graham, you're just gonna have
dialog: to trust me, okay?
text: GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
text: His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to
text: one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers
text: clasp together, pleading.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Please man, I need you.
text: GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Okay then.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: Great. Thank you.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: I'm Paul.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield
text: onto the recreational vehicle and
dialog: get the fuck off MacArthur's Black
dialog: Mile.
text: They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh man, has he...?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I told him he should have gone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Could have been worse. Know what
dialog: I'm saying?
text: They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
text: later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
text: He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
text: starts up and drives off.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
text: times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can I have this ham?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Uh... yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Great!
text: PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
text: wolfing it down hungrily.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Paul? Where am I going again?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I told you, North. Do you have a
dialog: map?
text: GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not when we're driving, Graham.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
text: The map disappears back up into the roller.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just head North. We need to get as
dialog: much distance as we can between us
dialog: and them.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Them? Who's them?
scene_heading: EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a
text: dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
text: man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
text: The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
text: pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
text: mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
text: Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A
text: SOLDIER approaches.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Talk to me.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
text: Three survivors, company men, hurt
text: but alive.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Anyone else?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: No sir.
text: ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: What's this?
text: The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
text: ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: No. It's neither of those things.
text: He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
text: side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
text: his car and hits a button on the dash.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What's the situation?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: We have a guest who's left the
dialog: hotel without paying, sir.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Damn it! Do you think he's "left'
dialog: left?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Doubtful. NORAD would have picked
dialog: up a bogie. Those guys can track
dialog: Santa. No sir, he's still here.
dialog: Question is, for how long?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't you think this is all a bit
dialog: of a coincidence?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I signed the red document this
dialog: morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's
dialog: odd that he chooses today to go
dialog: AWOL? How did he know?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Are you suggesting he has someone
text: on the inside.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Well he's definitely got someone on
dialog: the outside.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks...
dialog: among other things. I'd bet my left
dialog: nut that little bastard's hitched a
dialog: ride.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Lock down the area. Road blocks,
text: spot checks, the whole nine yards.
dialog: You're going to handle this
dialog: personally, Zoil. I want this
text: wrapped up before Letterman.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER
text: Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
text: Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
text: the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
text: notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
text: see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
text: bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
text: CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
text: skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: The bulb's gone in there.
text: CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
text: middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
text: PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I hate it when you get the closed
dialog: ones, right?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I usually bite them open.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Are you fucking insane? You gotta
dialog: tap "em and if they don't open you
text: throw them away.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's molluscs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: (NOTICES CLIVE)
dialog: Hello Clive! How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL
dialog: MAD, Graham. If that is your name?
dialog: You're happily sitting there
dialog: chatting to... to... that, like
dialog: it's the most natural thing in the
dialog: world. The two of you laughing away
dialog: like you haven't seen each other
dialog: since 1990.
text: PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CLIVE (CONT'D)
dialog: So forgive me if I seem a little
dialog: rattled but from where I'm standing
dialog: it would appear you are trading nut
text: knowledge with an alien life form.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: His name is Paul.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
dialog: Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
dialog: Reiser?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just Paul. You know, like Madonna
dialog: or Dracula.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Paul's from a small planet in the
dialog: northern spiral arm of the
dialog: Andromeda Galaxy.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No he is not!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I am man, seriously.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How could he possibly have
dialog: travelled that distance?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wormhole.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Balls! Graham, this isn't what it
dialog: seems. What about Ocham's Razor?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The hairdressers?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes, the old man who owns it told
dialog: me that, in unbelievable
dialog: circumstances, the most plausible
dialog: explanation is usually the truth.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And what's the most plausible
dialog: explanation, Clive?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: That you're a thin midget in an
text: alien costume.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There's no such thing as a thin
dialog: midget? Those guys are built. Have
dialog: you not seen The Station Agent?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He's right. I think that's less
dialog: believable than Paul being form a
text: planet in the norther spiral arm of
dialog: the Andromeda Galaxy.
speaker_heading: CLIVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh really?
text: With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
text: trying to gain a hold of a mask.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ow! Get off me!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You're not real. You're not real!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Get off me, you fucking psycho!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: EXCUSE ME!
text: CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
text: flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh shit!
text: CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
text: pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Where's he gone?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Maybe he beamed up.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: As if. We would have seen the
text: classic shimmer and hum.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good point.
dialog: BANG, BANG, BANG!
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an
text: AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from
text: the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: Where you boys from? Australia?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Britain.
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: Ah. G'day mate.
text: The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?
speaker_heading: CLIVE/GRAHAM
dialog: Comic-con.
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: You're a long way from San Diego.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: We were having a little drive.
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: AGENT 2 (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Haggard?!
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Yeah?
text: O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: These guys have met Michael Biehn.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: No shit! How was he?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: He was a good egg.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Very unaffected.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: That's nice to hear.
speaker_heading: (TO AGENT 2)
dialog: O'Reilly? Anything else?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: Just some pissy jeans.
text: HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
text: CLIVE look embarrassed.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Okay, you guys can go.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Thank you. May I ask what you're
dialog: searching for?
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Of course you may.
text: There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
text: and shaken.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Well, it's pretty obvious what
dialog: happened there, isn't it?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes, the government used some sort
dialog: of neurotoxic paint on the Black
dialog: Mailbox, which was white by the
dialog: way, and it caused us to suffer a
dialog: shared hallucination about an
dialog: alien. I mean, it's what we've
dialog: always wanted, isn't it?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I suppose so.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Than that's what happened.
text: PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: WRONG!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT
text: The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two
text: AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the
text: distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: INT. RV - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Where the hell did you go?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nowhere.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What, you went invisible?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's not invisibility per so. It's
dialog: more like what a chameleon does
text: with a little light blending thrown
dialog: in for good measure.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Like Predator?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Can you do it whenever you want?
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (PREDATOR VOICE)
dialog: Anytime...
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road
text: into the night.
scene_heading: INT. RV - DAYBREAK
text: CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat
text: eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes
text: on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You sure? How about a cup of
dialog: coffee?
dialog: (sees he's tempted)
dialog: Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice
dialog: cuppa J.
text: PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
text: he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, look who's up!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hello Paul.
text: GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Graham, there is a Grey in the
dialog: galley, making me coffee.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Did you want tea?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, I don't want tea.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, what's wried, Graham, is that
dialog: we have picked up an extra
dialog: terrestrial hitch hiker and you
dialog: seem completely fine with it!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He needs our help, Clive.
text: PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their
text: conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.
speaker_heading: PAUL CLIVE
dialog: You got it? Yes I've got it.
speaker_heading: PAUL CLIVE
dialog: It's hot. (slightly testy)
dialog: Thank you.
text: GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and
text: sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a
dialog: limb and say this is probably the
dialog: weirdest thing that's ever happened
dialog: to you. Am i right?
text: CLIVE doesn't deny it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And I appreciate the fact that I
dialog: have somewhat gate-crashed the
dialog: party here but, truth be told, I'm
dialog: in a hell of a pickle. I really
dialog: need your help.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Why us?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why not?
text: CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What about the RV? It has to be
dialog: back in two days.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Clive, he's an alien. A living,
text: breathing, alien.
text: CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand
text: gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I suppose we could phone the hire
dialog: company and get an extension.
text: PAUL looks super-pleased.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How did you get here?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Happens to the best of us.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Also, I'm a shit driver.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Roswell was a smoke-screen man,
dialog: designed to distract from the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: They invented a fake alien crash to
text: distract from an actual alien
dialog: crash?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What have you been doing here all
dialog: this time?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting
dialog: the shit. Advising the government.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Not just the government.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: CAPTION: 1980
text: A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and
text: chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a
text: cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on
text: the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.
speaker_heading: STEVEN SPIELBERG
dialog: ...I want him to have some kind of
dialog: special power, you know? Something
dialog: sort of messianic...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How about molecular revivification.
speaker_heading: STEVEN SPIELBERG
dialog: I don't know what that is.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Restoration of damaged tissue
dialog: through telepathic manipulation of
dialog: cellular intrinsic field memory.
speaker_heading: STEVEN SPIELBERG
dialog: I...uh...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Healing, Steven.
speaker_heading: STEVEN SPIELBERG
dialog: Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort
dialog: of thing? His little finger could
text: light up at the end and-
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You know what? Sometimes, less is
dialog: more.
text: The line beeps.
speaker_heading: STEVEN SPIELBERG
dialog: You got another call?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah I gotta take this man. It's
dialog: the fucking V guys again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
scene_heading: INT. RV - DAY
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You'd be surprised how much he's
dialog: influenced popular culture
dialog: generally over the last 60 years.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
speaker_heading: (TO GRAHAM)
dialog: How come you know so much?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We had quite a long chat while you
dialog: were unconscious.
text: CLIVE looks miffed.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: ...while you were asleep.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You want a bagel Clive?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Graham?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes please.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Go on then, I'll have half.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: You want anything on it?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Jam.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Jelly.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Gotcha.
text: PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I gave your jeans a swill and hung
dialog: them up.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Thank you. So, do you know where
dialog: we're going?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Just North. He said we had to make
text: a right at Utah.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Why can't he tell us?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He said it was a surprise.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Do you trust him, Graham? I mean,
dialog: is he Strider or Black Rider?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Strider, definitely.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You'd better be right. I don't want
text: to wake up and find him inserting a
dialog: probe into my anus.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's okay, he doesn't do that.
text: PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bagel time!
text: The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Fuel level's critical.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry, I had a warning light just
dialog: like that on my ship.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: For fuel?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anti-grav failure.
text: CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: There's a place called Ely five
dialog: miles from here. It's small but
dialog: there should be a gas station.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Roger that, number one.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
text: PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".
scene_heading: INT. RV - MORNING
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears
text: deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a
text: V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD
text: MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Paul, don't do that!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Here's what I need. Some organic
dialog: beef mince, organic pork, some
dialog: veal, red onions, pine nuts,
dialog: pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a
text: fistful of fresh basil and 3 war
dialog: ciabattas.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You know this is a gas station?
text: PAUL looks disappointed.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the
text: forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Ready.
text: HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: Get me some more peanut M&amp;Ms.
text: GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE
text: CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles
text: the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout
text: as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he
text: tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time
text: as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: After you.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Thanks.

text: Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: Coming... ready or not!
text: O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
text: ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Orange?
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Nice and juicy.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: I don't want to spoil breakfast.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Do you mind telling me what's going
dialog: on, Agent?
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: Just keeping ourselves occupied
dialog: sir. Things are pretty slow.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Where's the other one?
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: I don't know, let's see. Haggard?
text: HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on
text: the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a
text: snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Sorry, I was just... hiding.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I see. You fellas had much traffic
dialog: through here?
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
text: Just a big RV driven by a couple of
dialog: nerds.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Nerds, huh?
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and
dialog: met Michael Biehn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I've heard he's nice.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Good egg.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
text: Very unaffected.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Did you search the vehicle
dialog: thoroughly?
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Find anything?
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: Not really. Just Michael Biehn's
text: autograph and some pissy jeans.
text: Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Did you get the license plate?
text: HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Make?
text: More sheepishness.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: It was big.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I want everything you can remember.
dialog: Descriptions of the occupants,
dialog: height, hair, distinguishing
dialog: features. We can do it on the way.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: On the way?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: You're coming with me.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: What about the road block sir?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: It didn't work.

text: GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of
text: jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some
text: mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&amp;Ms.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Don't you think that's a bit much?
dialog: Put it all back. Except the
dialog: burrito... and the doughnuts... and
dialog: the chocolate milk. Let's just pay
dialog: for it and leave.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We need bulb for the toilet.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Essential only, Graham!

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: Who do you think I had in my office

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: No. The Secret Service.

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: They find out how you can afford a

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: Not yet. They're all over this
text: crash on the road up to Rachel.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No guns? Jesus Cheeerist.

scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING
text: The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear

speaker_heading: POLICE CONTROLLER
dialog: All units, be on the lookout for a
dialog: cream and brown Recreational
dialog: Vehicle, no plate number at this

scene_heading: INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER
text: PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&amp;Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM
text: drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It's find for you. You'll get
text: whisked back to whatever lab they
dialog: kept you in and we'll be arrested
dialog: for harbouring a fugitive and sent
dialog: to Guantanamo Bay.
text: PAUL laughs.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Why's everything so funny? They
dialog: think we're Muslims.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's their excuse for everything.
dialog: There are worse things you can be.
dialog: We had a Muslim guy at the base.
dialog: Systems analyst called Yusef. We
dialog: used to do karaoke on Tuesday
dialog: nights. You should'a heard him do
dialog: Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get
dialog: a chance to say salam alaikum.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Paul, the authorities know we're in
text: an TV.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We're hardly the only RV on the
dialog: road. Trust me, if we stay off the
dialog: highways, keep to the back routes,
dialog: we'll have a nice uneventful
dialog: journey.
text: BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.
text: GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
text: The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
text: The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road
text: lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fuck, that made me jump.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Ah yes, the waspish markings of a
dialog: Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What a waste.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Poor thing.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Nothing anyone could've done.
text: PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What are you doing?
text: PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
text: slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
text: its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
text: they are seeing.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's a miracle!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'll miss these.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Why would you do that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am
dialog: I?
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas
text: station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: By the time I got the bulletin,
dialog: they were long gone. Seemed like
dialog: nice fellas to me.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Is it true they was Muslims?
speaker_heading: STATE TROOPER
dialog: They said they were British.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I think you can be both.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Jesus Cheeeeerist!
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Agent Zoil?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Excuse me gentlemen.
text: ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Report.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: We've tracked them down to a gas
dialog: station in Ely.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: So why am I not witting with my
text: feet up, smoking a jay, watching
dialog: Erin Brockovich?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: We think he may be travelling in an
dialog: RV with two British men sir.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Goddamnit, I knew we should have

dialog: What are they, MI6?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on
text: the lamb from Comic-Con.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Shit. My sister's kid went to that.
dialog: Little Manga faggot.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I still think this stinks, sir.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much
text: of a coincidence. He sits tight for
dialog: 60 years and then suddenly now he
dialog: decides to take off. If he wanted
dialog: to go home so bad, he could've just
dialog: given us the slip when he was
text: playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Someone must have told him. We need
dialog: to find the rat.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Leave that to me. In the meantime,
text: if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.

speaker_heading: ZOIL

scene_heading: INT. RV - DUSK

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ask me when I've finished it.
text: CLIDE rubs his yes.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You tired, Sausage?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Don't call me Sausage in front of

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Sorry. Are you tired though?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Mummy, I am bushed.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What do you need?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Best case, I'd like a cold flannel
dialog: on my neck and an honest meal.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still
dialog: call you Big-Rig can't I?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck
dialog: with an RV park? We need somewhere
dialog: off the beaten track, n'est pas?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You read my mind.
text: GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
text: Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You want a cigarette?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No, thank you. I don't smoke.
text: PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating
dialog: the bird.
text: CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
text: coffee and a Honey Bun cake.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Honey Bun?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Could you unwrap it for me?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: By your command.

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let me ask you something. Are you
dialog: to...?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You know...
text: PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
dialog: various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay, that's great. I just
dialog: wondered. I'm cool with it.
dialog: Everyone's "bi' where I'm from.
dialog: It's all about the pleasure thing,
dialog: you know? We've evolved beyond
dialog: paranoid notions of gender
dialog: identity. I mean, procreation is
dialog: only the functional aspect of
dialog: sexual congress right? The human
dialog: race is fairly advanced but most
text: males still act like a cornered
dialog: tiger if you imply the like
dialog: "smoking the bone' and let's face
dialog: it they probably do. Look at single
dialog: sex, empirical institutions,
dialog: boarding schools, prisons, pirate
dialog: ships, places where the choice has
dialog: been removed, everyone's banging
dialog: everyone else and there isn't a
dialog: whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
dialog: out into the real world and guys
dialog: are getting smacked int he chops
dialog: for wearing pink socks. You think
dialog: you're so sophisticated because you
dialog: can distinguish yourself from your
dialog: own reflection but ultimately
dialog: you're part of a deeply neurotic
dialog: species and you'd all be a lot
dialog: better off if you stopped worrying
dialog: and learned to love the bum.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What are you trying to say?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe you should start smoking.

scene_heading: INT. RV - EVENING
text: Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
text: GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Great find, Graham.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I sourced a website listing off the
dialog: beaten track, North American RV
dialog: parks.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I really lucked out with you nerds,
dialog: didn't I?
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed

text: GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: It's awfully quiet.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Just the way we like it.
text: PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
dialog: the horn.
scene_heading: HOOOOOOONNNNK!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Stop doing that!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: CLIVE

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hello?
text: GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
text: twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She
text: wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares
text: at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton
dialog: John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is
dialog: $50 for the night, plus $10 for

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Uh, east... apparently.

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: England?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes. London.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I love London.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Have you been?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No. Did you know it was founded by

speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh. I'd love to go someday.

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That's my father. I'll come over

speaker_heading: CLIVE
text: Doors to manual and cross check.

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hmmm?

speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: BOO!
scene_heading: EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT
text: RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we

text: back, and goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
text: RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
text: From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a
text: police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We
text: perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: What took you so long?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I was just talking.

speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: Hook ups?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: Where they headed?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: East.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: Them California plates I saw?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes, but they're from London.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: London, Ohio?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, London, England.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: Where?!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: England, Papa. It's in North
dialog: Western Europe.
text: The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands

text: tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Europe? I'll give you Europe,

text: GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Willies!
text: PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's
dialog: my forte.
text: CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
text: mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and
text: slams the door of the RV behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT
text: CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his
text: tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes
text: nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello Clive. From the squirting of
text: the gas and the flicking of the
dialog: tongue, am I do assume you're a

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I am actually, yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I met him once.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He

speaker_heading: CLIVE

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Why did you come to earth?
speaker_heading: PAUL

text: aggressive invading force.
speaker_heading: CLIVE

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm fucking with you, man. I was on
dialog: a science mission actually.
dialog: Meteorological reconnaissance. We
dialog: were surveying atmospheric
dialog: conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class
dialog: planets. My specialist subject is

speaker_heading: CLIVE

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Mulder was right!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Mulder was my idea.
text: They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Would you like a go?
text: PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the
text: Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
text: RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
text: on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
text: pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
text: against the campfire. She frowns.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: RUTH!
text: RUTH backs away into the shadows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. RV - MORNING
text: It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
text: There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
text: emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: RUTH (O.S.)
dialog: It's Ruth.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
text: the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: May I come in?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes.
dialog: CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as
text: RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Was everything to your liking?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes, thank you.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Where's the other one?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: The other one?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It's okay, we don't charge by the
dialog: person. That was three pairs of
dialog: legs I saw last night cavorting
dialog: round the camp fire, right?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh the other one. Um...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm in the can. I ate a closed
dialog: mollusc.
text: PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
text: CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I like your shirt.
text: The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
text: the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Thanks. I got it at my church.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Why would Jesus want to shoot
dialog: Charles Darwin?
speaker_heading: RUTH
speaker_heading: (BRIGHTLY)
dialog: Because of his theories. Are you
dialog: men of God?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Would you like a coffee?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I suppose we're men of science.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: CLIVE-
text: RUTH narrow her eye.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: If we believe in anything it would
dialog: be macro evolution. Cause and
dialog: effect. The establishment of a
dialog: biological order from the maelstrom
text: of physical and chemical chaos.
text: RUTH looks scandalized.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Or it could be God. You just don't
dialog: know do you?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: God created the earth in six days
dialog: and on the seventh he rested.
text: PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Did you know that the universe has
dialog: been dated as being 13.5 billion
dialog: years old an that the release of
dialog: neutral hydrogen at the moment of
dialog: the big bang has enabled scientists
dialog: to do this with categorical
dialog: accuracy?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Not you!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The world is 4000 years old.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: Oh come on!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: PAUL-
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: Horseshit!
text: RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
text: unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and
text: CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Explain to me how something as
dialog: complicated as the human eye simply
text: comes into being.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, don't give me that old
dialog: irreducible complexity crap-
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: They eye is comprised of three
dialog: interacting parts. Remove any one
dialog: of them and it ceases to exist. It
dialog: has the precision and delicacy of a
dialog: pocket watch and, when the good
dialog: Lord permits, it works in perfect
dialog: harmony with its environment.
dialog: Something as functionally perfect
dialog: as that doesn't just occur without
text: the intervention of a guiding hand.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: But it didn't just occur did it? It
dialog: is the culmination of millions of
dialog: years of development across
dialog: countless species.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: Evolution baby.
text: RUTH screams and bangs the door.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It'd design!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: If He designed it, why didn't He
dialog: just make it one part and take the
dialog: whole weekend off?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nothing you can so or do can shake
dialog: my belief, or faith in the sure and
dialog: certain knowledge that God made
dialog: Heaven and earth and created us all
text: in His own image.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: (stepping out of the toilet)
dialog: Well then how do you explain me?
text: RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
text: up, her hair turns white. She collapses.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And that's Jenga.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What did you do that for?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't do anything, she fainted.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: She saw you!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh come on. Who's gonna believe
dialog: anything she says?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: The authorities will be on the look
dialog: out for exactly this sort of thing.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What, a delusional, one-eyed God
dialog: botherer?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Paul, right now they're going to
dialog: follow any lead they can get.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't think of that.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We could take her with us.
speaker_heading: PAUL/CLIVE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We're only going to be a couple of
dialog: days. We could let her go once
dialog: Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll
dialog: be fine once she gets to know us.
speaker_heading: PAUL and CLIVE consider this.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How am I going to get my passport
dialog: back?
text: PAUL vanishes.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: Leave it to me.
scene_heading: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
text: The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the
text: kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
text: He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he
text: spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
text: finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hallelujah.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: Ruth, what in the Lord's name-
text: MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for
dialog: a second.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Boo?
scene_heading: EXT. RV PARK - DAY
text: PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is
text: loading a shotgun.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: GO! GO! GO!
text: The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM
text: appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as
text: MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
text: arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
text: booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
text: RV careens off out of the trailer park.
scene_heading: INT. RV - DAY
text: Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,
text: GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Where am I?
text: PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, look who's up.
speaker_heading: RUTH
speaker_heading: DEMON!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Would you like a cup of tea?
text: RUTH starts to pray furiously.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm so sorry it had to be this way
dialog: Ruth. We're definitely not going to
dialog: hurt you and we'll let you go as
dialog: son as we can. We were just a
dialog: little concerned that you might
dialog: call the police.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You have been deceived. Deceived by
text: an agent of Satan himself.
speaker_heading: PAUL (O.S.)
dialog: You know I'm sitting right here?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He's not a demon Ruth, he's from
dialog: another world and we're helping him
dialog: get home. He's not evil. He's just
dialog: very rude.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How can he be from another world?
dialog: There is only one world. Our world,
dialog: created by God the Father.
text: PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look, if it makes you feel any
dialog: better, my existence only disproves
dialog: the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-
dialog: Christian God, as well as all
dialog: single earth theologies. Science
dialog: still hasn't categorically rule out
dialog: the notion of divinity, even though
dialog: evolutionary biology suggest the
dialog: non-existence of a creator by
dialog: probability alone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How could that possibly make me
dialog: feel any better?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Jesus Christ, I was just trying to
dialog: be nice!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I think what Paul's trying to say
dialog: is, just because there are other
dialog: inhabited planets, it's not the end
dialog: of the world.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: This isn't happening! You're a
dialog: hallucination. You're not real.
dialog: You're a test. A test from God.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You can't win can you?
text: RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
dialog: awful noise.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I can't drive like this. We'll have
dialog: to drop her off and take our
dialog: chances.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, for God's sake.
text: PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
text: forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
text: into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
text: cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
text: ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL
text: telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They
text: collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What did you do to her?!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I broadened her horizons.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Can you broaden mine?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, it's tiring.
text: GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Oh please.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come here then.
text: PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
text: fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh great! Everyone knows the
dialog: secrets of the universe apart from
dialog: me. He always knew what was going
dialog: on in Buffy before me because his
dialog: mum had cable.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can't I just tell you?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: No spoilers!
text: PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps
text: CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: (WEAKLY)
dialog: Maybe I should make that tea?
scene_heading: EXT. RV PARK - DAY
text: THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
dialog: I didn't call the government. I
dialog: called the po-lice.
scene_heading: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Given your description of the
dialog: intruder, the police felt your call
dialog: was perhaps better directed to us.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: And who are you?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Secret Service, sir.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: I knew it. You know that devil took
dialog: my Ruth.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: And Ruth's your daughter?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: That's right. Her Mama died when
dialog: she was born. I good as brought her
dialog: up by myself. Wasn't easy either.
dialog: Two mouths to feed and this place
dialog: to run.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I understand. Do you have a
dialog: photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?
text: MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered
text: photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes
text: intact and with dark hair.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: She's pretty.
text: MOSES snorts.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In
dialog: case she tries to contact you.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: I do...
text: ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his
text: satellite phone, moving into a different room.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: ...and she'll call me if she can.
dialog: Ruth's never really been outta
dialog: Carbon County.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: You say they went East?
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the
dialog: 191 after Flaming Gorge if they
dialog: ain't using the interstate, there's
dialog: been a rig spill just South of
dialog: Dutch John.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: So that means they'll be on the 44.
dialog: Only way to go.
text: ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Let's go. Haggard!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Tell me you're gonna kill that
dialog: thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Watch yourself now. I seen its
text: eyes. It's evil.
text: ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: God's speed, Mr. Zoil.
scene_heading: EXT. RV PARK - DAY
text: ZOIL's radio crackles to life.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD (O.S.)
dialog: Man, that way was one fat freak!
speaker_heading: O'REILLY (O.S.)
dialog: If I was that girl, I think I'd
dialog: rather take my chances with the
dialog: alien.
text: HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Can it, you two! How many times do
dialog: I have to tell you?
scene_heading: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
text: MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police
text: scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over
dialog: the radio.
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: We do not refer to the target as
dialog: "The Alien'.
text: MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He
text: glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying
text: in the foreground on the kitchen table.
text: We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
text: MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: INT. RV - DAY
text: CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wow.
text: Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,
text: looking out through the RV's windshield.
text: We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.
text: They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking
text: out across the vista.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There it is, boys. Wyoming.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Is that where we're going?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at
dialog: times like these you winder if the
dialog: intelligent design crowd aren't
dialog: onto something. I mean look at it.
dialog: Hey Ruth, get up here.
text: They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ruth!?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Someone should go after her.
dialog: Graham?
text: CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Graham!?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: RUTH is storming up the road.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Ruth!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Leave me alone!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Ruth, please stop, I've got shin
text: splints.
text: RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He can't be from space. It's not
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's
dialog: not just possible, it's probably.
dialog: There's probably millions of
dialog: intelligent civilizations.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: So, where is everybody?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Well, one of them is right there.
text: RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the
text: dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.
text: CLIVE is trying not to laugh.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Everything I've ever been told is a
dialog: lie. My purpose. My truth. All
dialog: false. DO you know how that feels?
dialog: To suddenly have nothing?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Just because your truth wasn't the
dialog: truth, it doesn't mean there is no
dialog: truth, Ruth.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I understand you're probably
text: feeling very confused right now.
dialog: Religious belief systems are
dialog: devised to give us context and
dialog: security. To stop us feeling lonely
dialog: and unimportant.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I do feel lonely and unimportant!
dialog: How can this all be an accident? It
dialog: doesn't make sense. Did you know
dialog: the reason we have solar eclipses
dialog: is because the sun is exactly 400
dialog: times bigger than the moon and the
dialog: moon is exactly 400 times closer to
dialog: the earth?
text: GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How can that be an accident.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it
dialog: probably is. That's the beauty of
dialog: the universe.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: But what's the point? If there's
dialog: nothing afterwards, what's the
dialog: point in living?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This is the point, Ruth. Right now.
dialog: This conversation. That tree, your
dialog: next cheeseburger. Life is a
dialog: miracle. People spend so much time
dialog: focusing on rescuing the princess,
dialog: they forget how much fun it is to
dialog: fight the dragon.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or
dialog: new, that stressed the magnificence
dialog: of the universe as revealed by
dialog: modern science might be able to
dialog: draw forth reserves of reverence
dialog: and awe hardly tapped by the
dialog: conventional faiths.'
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's
dialog: wonderful because it means we still
dialog: have things to learn. We still have
dialog: life to live.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I'm frightened.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: So am I, but it passes, sort of.
dialog: Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure
dialog: and I think you should come with
dialog: us. I know you feel confused and
dialog: lost but if you get back on board
dialog: that RV, you might just find the
dialog: very thing you're looking for.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I... I'm not sure.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I
dialog: can honestly say, I have never
dialog: talked to a woman for this long
text: without blushing.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That's so sweet.
text: GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.
scene_heading: INT. RV - DAY
text: GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased
dialog: with himself.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: She's going to be fine. I think
dialog: your hair looks good by the way.
dialog: You look like Storm.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Who's Storm?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: From X-Men.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Exactly.
text: RUTH goes to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: RUTH (O.S.)
scene_heading: AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!
scene_heading: EXT/INT. RV - DAY
text: The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,
text: RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.
text: GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on
text: the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.
text: CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just
text: behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns
text: round, she looks away.
text: PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
text: just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Small corrections! Small
dialog: corrections!
text: RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY
text: We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the
text: road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a
text: taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see
text: HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The
text: truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the
text: wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up
text: suddenly, looking rattled.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous
text: landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE
text: NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads
scene_heading: "LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL
text: leaps back and forth over the line.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock,
dialog: 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on!
dialog: It's fun.
text: We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the
text: road watching PAUL.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: This is the furthest I've ever
dialog: been.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out
text: of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's
text: pick up truck passes through shout; "Onward Christian
text: Soldiers' blares from the radio.
scene_heading: INT. RV - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs
text: back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her
text: Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt
text: emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You don't mind, do you, Graham?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It looks nice.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, we should stop for something
dialog: to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What's new, fatty?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I
dialog: happen to be very strong.
text: PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits
text: it onto the floor of the RV.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Pick that up then.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: So childish.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Maybe I should call Papa.
speaker_heading: PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Look, I've been missing for a whole
dialog: day. If he's called the police,
dialog: they'll be looking for us and if
dialog: they find us, this "amazing
dialog: adventure' is going to come to an
dialog: end real quick. I just need to tell
dialog: him I'm fine and that I'll be back
dialog: soon, okay?
text: PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right up top!
text: RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Too soon?
text: CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I did it!
scene_heading: EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk
dialog: to anyone unless you have to and
text: try to look inconspicuous.
text: Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.
scene_heading: HOOOOOOOONNNK.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I wish he'd stop doing that!
text: They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln
text: Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a
text: variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to
text: a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I won't be long.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: We'll order food and wait for you
text: at the bar.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Be careful.
text: RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she
text: passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each
text: other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and
text: CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Tap water.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
text: RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Ruth Behe?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Please hold, your call is being
dialog: diverted.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Wait, I...
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: Ruth Behe?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen
dialog: very carefully. You're in great
dialog: danger.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How did you...?
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: We know who you're travelling with
dialog: Ruth. I need you and your friend to
dialog: turn yourselves in.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What if we don't want to turn
dialog: ourselves in?
scene_heading: INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT
text: ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop
text: nearby. O'REILLY listens in.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Where are you? Where are you
dialog: headed?
speaker_heading: RUTH (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Look, I know you think you're doing
dialog: the right thing but I promise you,
dialog: I'm only thinking about you. And
dialog: Paul. You care about Paul, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RUTH (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know how I feel about him.
dialog: He's weird and also, rude.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Yes he is.
speaker_heading: RUTH (O.S.)
dialog: I asked him why he wore shorts and
dialog: he said if he didn't I'd see his
text: big spaceman balls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT
text: Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Who's there with you?
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: Ruth, please listen to me. Your
dialog: father is worried about you. We
dialog: want to get you home. I need you to
dialog: tell me where you are.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He showed me things.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: You're not still talking about his
dialog: balls, are you?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I... i just want to know what's
dialog: real. I'm confused. I... I...
text: RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD (O.S.)
dialog: WE GOT HER!
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: Damnit, Haggard!
text: RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she
text: may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into
text: two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, slow down there cyclops.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I need to get to my friends.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Why the hurry? You know I got a
dialog: friend with one eye who'd love to
dialog: meet you.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I happen to have two eyes actually.
dialog: I just have a severe stigmatism.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You should get that fixed up.
dialog: Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the
dialog: right light.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah, the dark.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Papa said the Lord would fix it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing
dialog: sweetheart.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No shit.
text: RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles
text: up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food,
text: RUTH returns from the Phone.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: How's your dad?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We need to leave now.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
text: We're still waiting on a wet fries.
text: The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Holy shit! It's the space faggots
dialog: that dinged the fuck-mobile!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps
dialog: we can exchange insurance details?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: These the "friends' you told us
dialog: about, baby?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes, they are.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Well whaddya know? Small world.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We were just leaving.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
text: JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Leave her alone!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: (timid but resolute)
dialog: He said, leave her alone.
text: At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a
text: tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately
text: spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their
text: attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM
text: grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through
text: the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and
text: comes face to face with her father.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: RUTH?!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: PAPA?!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Graham?
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: I'm taking you home.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I... I can't.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Don't talk back to me, girl!
speaker_heading: RUTH
speaker_heading: PAPA I-
text: A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
text: him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward
text: the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What about Papa?!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, we ain't finished with you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Graham, take Ruth into the RV and
dialog: lock the door. I don't want either
dialog: of you to see this.
text: CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
text: the face, he falls, nose bleeding.
text: They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The
text: MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL
text: stands silhouetted against the interior lights.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yo fucknuts!
text: The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
text: feet from them, their eyes bulge.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So, who wants to get probed first?
text: The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Ha! Only one of us fainted!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Tell me you got the food?
text: CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
text: Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It's them.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It wasn't my fault. They answered
dialog: the phone. He knew all about us.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Who? Who are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Get in the RV!
text: SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the
text: MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as
text: the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks
text: eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he
text: doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,
text: leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln
dialog: Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. RV - NIGHT
text: The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang
text: sit in silence for a while.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Was that your dad, Ruth?
text: RUTH nods.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: He was so angry.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He's always angry.
text: GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Are you alright, Ruth?
text: RUTH nods, still distant.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone
dialog: wanna take a walk?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I'm game.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You want to come for a walk, Ruth?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Thanks, but I think I'm going to
dialog: turn in. It's been a long day what
dialog: with meeting you guys, being
dialog: abducted by and alien and having my
dialog: whole belief system called into
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It was amazing though, wasn't it?
dialog: Remember when Paul said "Yo
dialog: fucknuts'? That was brilliant.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You gotta talk the talk, right?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What about when I got smacked in
dialog: the nose?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real
dialog: hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You
dialog: want anything Ruth?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, you go, I'll be fine. Here
dialog: Clive.
text: RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
text: words "JESUS SAVES'.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Thank you.
text: He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You can sleep in my bunk if you'd
dialog: like.
text: She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'd use a pen to push the tissues
dialog: off the bed. I've had a cold.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag
text: of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing
text: store. PAUL looks in the window.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey Graham. Check this out. What
dialog: d'ya think?
text: PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
text: child, displayed in the window.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'd look pretty hot, right?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Space cowboy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Steve Miller Band. I love that
dialog: song. Speaking of midnight tokers,
dialog: I got a littler herbal refreshment
dialog: in my pants. Do you guys partake?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shame. I get it from the military.
dialog: This is the shit that killed Dylan.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Bob Dylan's still alive.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Is he?
text: CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Let's party!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland
text: clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking
text: beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: So why "Paul'? It's not very, you
dialog: know, alien.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: P-o-o-u-r-l?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or
dialog: the little guy from Simon and
dialog: Garfunkel.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Paul Simon.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Paul Simon. Paul's not my real
dialog: name. It's a name I got given.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What's your real name?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You won't be able to pronounce it.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I can speak Klingon.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What a geek.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Come on, what's your real name.
text: PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's pretty good.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fuck you!
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Calm down, Rog.
text: More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You look like a poster on a
text: student's wall.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That was my gag! "Take me to your
dialog: dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.
dialog: Never saw a dime.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You never answered my question. Why
dialog: Paul? Who called you Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The little girl who found me when I
dialog: crashed. It was terrible actually.
dialog: I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
dialog: My ship sort of landed on it. When
dialog: the military arrived I was
dialog: delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
dialog: Paul?" It was the only English I
dialog: knew, because I'd heard the little
text: girl saying it over and over.
dialog: Spooks thought it was my name.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: She called her dog Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What happened to the little girl?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who knows? Never saw her again.
dialog: Think about her everyday though.
text: PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
text: takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
text: CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
text: governed by some kind of psychic link.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
dialog: in this situation Graham and I
dialog: would be looking up at the stars,
dialog: wondering about life on other
dialog: planets but we know now, don't we?
text: It's a bit of an anti-climax.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thanks a bunch, Hurley.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I don't mean that in a bad way.
text: They all scratch their noses.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Paul, can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Why are you in such a hurry to
dialog: leave?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I've outlived my usefulness.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There's only so much knowledge I
dialog: can share about the universe and
dialog: quantum theory and how to make a
dialog: really nice meatball sandwich. The
dialog: only thing I have to offer them now
dialog: are my abilities.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So the only way they're going to
dialog: get hold of them is by obtaining
text: some of somatic stem cells.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: So what, do they take a swab from
dialog: your cheek?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Negative.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Stool?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sadly, not that simple.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Believe me, a needle would be a
dialog: picnic compared to what they had in
dialog: store for me.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I don't follow.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Stem cells are multipotent.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Lineage defined?
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: The camouflage response, the memory
dialog: transfer, the revivification, they
dialog: all originate in my cerebellum. In
dialog: order to cultivate them in a
dialog: laboratory they would have to...
speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
dialog: Cut your brain out.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bingo! Fortunately, someone was
dialog: kind enough to give me the heads
dialog: up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,
dialog: when they were transferring me to
dialog: the medical facility and I noticed
dialog: the bumper sticker on your RV, I
dialog: figured you might be sympathetic
dialog: types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed
dialog: the wheel and took my chance.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I thought the crash was our fault.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well it was, kinda.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: So, you're saying if they catch
dialog: you...
text: PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
text: at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So tell me, are you guys virgins or
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
dialog: No.
text: They all cough.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Alright then, Clive, when was the
dialog: last time you got laid.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Three years ago you had sex with a
dialog: midget?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: She was an Ewok!
dialog: Sniff.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There are only two types of person
dialog: small enough to fit inside an Ewok
dialog: costume.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: She was a midget.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't believe you thought boning
dialog: a space bear sounded less
dialog: embarrassing than a person of short
dialog: stature.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I know. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Was it nice?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
speaker_heading: WONDERFUL
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You sly dog!
text: PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
text: beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three
text: friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of
text: control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - MORNING
text: The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the
text: smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.
text: His eyes open. He looks around.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We
dialog: fell asleep.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How did that happen?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry, I get this thing when I get
dialog: high. It's called "projective
dialog: empathy'. You feel what I feel.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Like in E.T.?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh, thank God. For a second there I
dialog: thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
text: The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
text: Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
dialog: town of last night has become very busy indeed.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Oh dear!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't walk through there.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How are we going to get back?
text: Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - DAY
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
text: is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
text: shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Maybe we should hold hands, so that
dialog: we look like a family.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's great! Two grown men who
dialog: look like sex offenders holding
text: hands with a child cowboy.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You could be a midget.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're obsessed with midgets!
text: They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Seem to be working, Clive. Clive?
text: GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
text: back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
text: SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
text: The tag reads "Genuine "BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Clive, no.
text: CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
text: behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
text: the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
text: and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
text: scanning the passers by.
scene_heading: INT. COMIC SHOP - DAY
text: GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Now's not really the time, Sausage.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: I must have it.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's very cheap. Are you sure you
dialog: don't want to save up and get a
dialog: proper on?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Oh, come on, we've got time.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RV - DAY
text: Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.
speaker_heading: KNOCK KNOCK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Where have you been? I was worried.
text: She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to
dialog: trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret
dialog: Service. Your wagon here matches
dialog: the description of a recreational
dialog: vehicle we're currently looking
dialog: for. May I ask, are you alone?
text: RUTH pauses a second.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes, I'm alone.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Do you mind taking a look at these
dialog: pictures?
text: ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
text: shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
text: of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Do you recognise any of these
dialog: people, Miss?
text: She lingers on the picture of herself.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Miss?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, sorry I don't.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Where are you coming from, Ma'am?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Christian ministry in Seattle. I've
dialog: been driving for 5 days.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Going far?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Austin.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Great town.
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: Oh yes. It has an impressive bat
dialog: population you know?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
text: Folks gather by the rive in the
dialog: evening to watch them fly out. Turn
text: the sky black. Quite a sight.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Uh-huh. Well, I really should be
dialog: getting along.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Of course. Thanks for your time,
dialog: Miss...?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
text: ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.
scene_heading: INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
text: blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
text: picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
text: like him. The comic is called "Encounter Briefs: Tales From
text: the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
text: realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
text: small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
text: cover of the comic and back at PAUL.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: Is that you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: It looks like you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Suppose it does. What's your name?
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: Keith Nash.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You on your own here, Keith Nash?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: My Mom's shopping for some new
dialog: jeans. She lets me wait in here.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sounds like a good Mum.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: Yes and no. What're you doing here?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My friend's buying a sword. He's a
dialog: grown man.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: What a nerd.
text: PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You an M&amp;Ms man, Keith?
text: PAUL produces his M&amp;Ms. He offers one to KEITH.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: I am but I shouldn't.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Strangers with candy, right?
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, we've got a lot in common. We
dialog: both like comics and M&amp;Ms. Guess
dialog: that makes us pals.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: Guess so.
text: KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&amp;Ms. They turn their
text: attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
text: called "G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike

text: KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
text: NASH calling from the street.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Catch you later, Keith Nash.
text: GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box
text: under his arm and a big grin on his face.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Keith Nash. How much was that?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: $299.99. It's made of a low grade
dialog: Turkish alloy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What did you get, speccy?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: X-Men action figure.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Jesus Cheeeerist.
scene_heading: EXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY
text: GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to
text: KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his
text: MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD
text: and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.
speaker_heading: MRS. NASH
dialog: Don't lie, Keith.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: I'm not lying.
speaker_heading: MRS. NASH
dialog: Oh, come on now, Keith. If you
dialog: carry on like this, you'll have to
dialog: come with me to Dress Barn.
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and
dialog: his name was Paul!
speaker_heading: MRS. NASH
dialog: Whoever hard of an alien called
dialog: Paul?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
text: HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY
text: stands nearby.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: What did you say, kid?
speaker_heading: MRS. NASH
dialog: Excuse me. Who are you?
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret
dialog: Service.
speaker_heading: MRS. NASH
dialog: Secret Service?!
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Kid?
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
text: He was in the shop.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Is he still in there?
text: KEITH shakes his head.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: Did he say where he was going?
text: KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the
text: PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in
dialog: the entirely wrong direction.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: South. Toward New Mexico, huh?
text: KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
text: meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the
text: street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: We've got him man! We're going to
dialog: get a fucking promotion.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: You did good kid. Want a candy?
speaker_heading: KEITH NASH
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Let's go.
text: The two agents rush off.
speaker_heading: O'REILLY
dialog: What about Zoil?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Screw Zoil!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends
text: down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now
text: stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking
text: hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up
text: the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up
text: is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber
text: towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: Where the hell do you think you're
dialog: going?
text: HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: We picked up a lead, sir. Little
dialog: kid in the town said he saw an
text: alien. Said he was heading toward
dialog: New Mexico.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: And you were just gonna take off?
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: Thought it best to take the
dialog: initiative, sir. We were going to
dialog: radio you.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Well now, that's mighty civil of
dialog: you. We have a chain of command. I
dialog: expect you to abide by it. Where
dialog: d'you say he was headed?
speaker_heading: HAGGARD
dialog: New Mexico sir.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Well, then let's move it.
text: They scramble.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting
dialog: ideas about your station again.
text: ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY
text: MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his
text: hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Zoil, what the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: ZOIL (O.S.)
dialog: They've double back sir. They're
text: heading toward New Mexico.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You better be right about this,
dialog: Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of
dialog: this shit. I want that little
text: fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
text: MOSES smiles darkly.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Looks like you're going the wrong
dialog: way, Agent Zoil. That's what
dialog: happens when you don't got the Lord
dialog: on your side.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large
text: roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK
text: WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.
scene_heading: INT. RV - DAYBREAK
text: The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and
text: PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is
text: holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He likes you, y'know?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Graham? D'you think?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What are you, blind?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What you got there, a stigmatism?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
text: RUTH nods.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You know you can get on operation
dialog: for that, right?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Papa said the Lord would fix it.
dialog: Guess that's not gonna happen,
dialog: seeing as we're living in a
dialog: gigantic godless universe, with no
dialog: hope of salvation.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, I don't know categorically
dialog: that it's godless. I just said
dialog: "probably'.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, that's a relief.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look, the way you're feeling now,
dialog: that's why religion appeared in the
dialog: first place. It's like existential
dialog: Prozac. Imagine being five year
dialog: sold and having no adults around to
dialog: tell you why it snows or what trees
dialog: are for. That's how it is for much
dialog: of humanity. Faith is a night-
text: light. It illuminates the scary
dialog: corners, fills the gaps, makes the
dialog: universe easier to comprehend.
dialog: Thing is, it's okay not to know
dialog: everything. I mean, who knows
dialog: what's really out there? Did you
dialog: know astrophysicists recently
dialog: identified the equation for the
dialog: creation of matter?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh. Well, then you get it, right?
dialog: If they have the theory, who's to
dialog: say at some point in the future
dialog: they won't put it into practice and
dialog: who's to say someone else didn't do
dialog: that 13.5 Billion years ago and
dialog: that's how the universe came to be?
dialog: Course, then we get the eternal
dialog: problem of who created the creator
dialog: but that's a whole other car park.
dialog: I think Shakespeare said it best.
dialog: "There's more in Heaven and earth
dialog: than is dreamt of in your
dialog: philosophy Horatio".
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What did you call me?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You
dialog: know, the Prince of Denmark?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Denmark has a municipal population
dialog: of 508,691.
text: PAUL blinks.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anyway, if there is a God, didn't
dialog: he create doctors and hospitals and
dialog: scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't
dialog: have to go round fixing people's
dialog: lazy eyeballs?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I suppose so.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: The eye is a delicate and complex
dialog: thing, Ruth. You should get it
dialog: taken care of.
text: RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,
text: just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: They're back.
text: PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the
text: RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What are you going to do with this?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Phone home.

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Satellite's come up with a data
dialog: analysis on all the traffic coming
dialog: out of Prospect in the last 5
dialog: hours. There was only one RV, and
dialog: guess what, nimrod?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: It wasn't going to New Mexico?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.
dialog: You better spin your ass around.
dialog: You got some serious catching up to
dialog: do. Don't make me come out there.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: No, sir. Where are they headed? If
dialog: we gun it, maybe we can get the
dialog: drop on their destination.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: They're on the 50, heading towards
dialog: Gillette.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: What else is around there?
speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's what you're going to find
dialog: out for me.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't just knock can I? What if
dialog: she's moved on and someone else
dialog: answers? I'm sick of people
dialog: fainting on me. I'll hang back with
dialog: my buddy Ruth, you two make first
dialog: contact. Just enjoy it.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: What shall we say if it's her?
dialog: We're here with the alien that
dialog: killed your dog sixty years ago?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Okay.
text: GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive
dialog: Gollings and this is my friend and
dialog: colleague, Graham Willy. We're from
dialog: England and we're here with the
dialog: alien that killed your dog 60 years
dialog: ago.
text: Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to
text: reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her
text: eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: What is this, some kind of joke?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: It's no joke.
text: PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello Tara.
text: TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Aw nuts.
scene_heading: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY
text: GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits
text: opposite, staring at PAUL.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Maybe I should make some tea.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Where are my manners? I never
dialog: really have guests. Nobody comes up
dialog: here. I go whole weeks without
text: seeing a soul.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are
text: sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.
text: PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can I do anything to help?
text: TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
text: PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: I've only just stopped believing in
dialog: you, y'know? Spent a very long time
dialog: trying to convince folk about what
dialog: happened that night. My parents, my
dialog: friends. Everyone thought I was
dialog: mad. They told me it was a meteor
dialog: that squashed little Paul. Took me
dialog: away and did tests they did, said
dialog: it was for cosmic radiation. They
dialog: said I was concussed,
dialog: hallucinating, but I knew you were
dialog: real. I pulled you from that
dialog: spaceship myself. Sat with you till
dialog: the men came and took you away. If
dialog: Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he
dialog: would have seen you too. They kept
dialog: telling me I'd imagined it but I
dialog: knew different. Pop tried to
dialog: understand but they filled his head
dialog: with "delayed this' and "post-
dialog: traumatic that'. He just used to
dialog: smile and say "there, there Tara'.
dialog: He got sick when I was seventeen
dialog: and died a few years later. I
dialog: inherited this place. Word got out
dialog: about my story not long after it
dialog: happened, so I didn't really have
dialog: any friends. Kids used to throw
dialog: stones at the house and call me
dialog: names. I just kinda retreated into
dialog: myself. I'd spend whole nights up
text: on the roof, staring at the sky,
dialog: hoping to catch a glimpse of you
dialog: again. I always believed that one
dialog: day you"d come back and here you
dialog: are.
text: The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Listen to me gabbing. Milk and
dialog: sugar?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: What for?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: For killing your dog and ruining
dialog: your life.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: That doesn't matter. Don't you see?
dialog: You're real. I was right and all
dialog: those folk that said I was crazy?
dialog: Well, they can all go fuck
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's good to see you, Tara.
text: The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas
text: canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Now, where do you suppose that came
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fuck a duck! Get out!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM/CLIVE
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: TARA

scene_heading: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY
text: The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and
text: continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back
text: door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL
text: vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand
text: across ZOIL's forehead.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Paul, wait-
text: A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent
text: and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Clive?
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: A little help?

speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Godammit Haggard!
scene_heading: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. CELLAR - DAY
text: The gang descend into a dim room. It is full of UFO

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not a fucking cent.
scene_heading: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY
text: ZOIL comes to. He sees HAGGARD at the cellar door. Screeching

scene_heading: EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: My weed!
scene_heading: EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY
text: ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder.

speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Damnit Haggard, wait!

scene_heading: INT. RV - EVENING
speaker_heading: CLIVE

speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)

scene_heading: EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What about the other one?
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I lost him when the ranch exploded.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been

dialog: man to climb the tower.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: I climbed up there in 1976. Thought

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We call them IFOs.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Cute.

scene_heading: EXT. SMALL ROAD - DUSK

scene_heading: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the

text: of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens
text: itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This is it.
text: PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his
text: back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'll miss these.
text: PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the
text: ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the
text: cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework
text: rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive
text: and bright red, it illuminates the tower.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Pretty.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We wait.
text: A light appears in the sky some way off.

scene_heading: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT
text: ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees
text: an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.
scene_heading: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a
text: deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait a minute...
text: A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into
text: the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by
text: the sight of a torch getting nearer.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well, whaddya know? Small world.
text: VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed
text: SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts
text: through the trees behind them.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
speaker_heading: PAUL!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Lorenzo?!
text: PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
text: bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
text: bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
text: bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
text: past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
text: ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
text: shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
text: leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
text: cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
text: shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
text: holding a smoking gun.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It was you! You told him. I
dialog: should've known.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've never made a mistake in your
dialog: life. That's why I put you in
dialog: charge of this fucking mission.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: He's my friend! I've known him for
dialog: twenty years. He introduced me to
dialog: my wife damnit!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You stupid son of a bitch. In five
dialog: years, you could have been where I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: I don't want to be where you are.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Too bad, seeing as I'm the one
dialog: hold'ng all the cards and when I
dialog: say "cards", I of course mean big
dialog: fucking gun.
text: VOICE points his gun at PAUL.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How'd you find me?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It was pretty easy once we got a
dialog: fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard
dialog: to figure out where you were
dialog: headed. You always did have a flare
dialog: for the dramatic.
text: PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Let's go.
text: TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
text: CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: He's not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Be honest with yourself, two
dialog: scoops. What is it that you think
dialog: you can possibly bring to the table
dialog: at this stage in the game?
text: CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
text: he holds it like a proud Samurai.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
text: Blind fury.
text: The blade falls off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Step aside, you fat nerd.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
speaker_heading: (IN KLINGON)
dialog: Graham, his this man.
text: CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
text: unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,
text: blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.
text: RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Leave him alone!
text: VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Leave her alone!
text: VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Leave them alone.
text: WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: You're not taking him away again.
text: He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thank you, Tara.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Don't mention it.
text: PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: The things I do for you, huh?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You know I appreciate it.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Do you have any idea how difficult
dialog: it was to catch you guys?
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Let me take a look at that. Ruth,
dialog: shine the torch down here?
text: RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
text: BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
text: see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
text: his eyes wide.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Noooooooooo!
text: GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
text: blood around her mouth.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: I...I never meant to shoot her. I
text: was aiming for the goblin.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: He's not a goblin he's from another
dialog: planet.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: But he can't be. He... he...
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He's an alien you stupid man! Oh
dialog: Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
dialog: I should have never persuaded you
dialog: to come with us.
text: RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What, and miss all this? Graham,
dialog: I've lived more in the last 48
dialog: hours that I ever did in that
dialog: trailer park. Isn't that what you
dialog: said living was all about? Right
dialog: now? This conversation? That tree?
dialog: My next cheeseburger? I'm not
dialog: afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
dialog: though. Hey, where is everybody?
text: RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
text: buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
text: with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
dialog: sorry.
text: A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
text: silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There is no way this thing isn't
dialog: gonna end happy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
text: PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
text: MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Get away from her! Don't you touch
dialog: my little girl.
text: CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
text: charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
text: watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
text: difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
text: both shining, healthy eyes.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Ruth, are you okay?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I think so. Is anyone hungry? I
dialog: really feel like a cheese burger.
text: Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
text: knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
dialog: to see PAUL.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: Thank you.
text: RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You can kiss me now.
text: They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Looks like the geek shall inherit
dialog: the earth.
scene_heading: CLICK CLICK.
text: The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I wouldn't say-
speaker_heading: SPLAT.
text: A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
text: shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Happens to the best of us.
scene_heading: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now
dialog: present.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
text: One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
text: from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
text: soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
text: their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
text: TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
text: them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm sorry I frightened you so much
dialog: your hair turned white.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You didn't frighten me. You freed
dialog: me. You helped me see the light.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (TO MOSES)
dialog: Take care of her big man.
speaker_heading: MOSES BEHE
dialog: I will sir. God be with you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Whatever dude.
text: They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
text: makeshift sling and shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.
dialog: Say bye to Karen for me.
speaker_heading: ZOIL
dialog: Safe trip Short Round.
text: PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
text: OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You can keep it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Cool. Okay.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What did you think?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although
dialog: you know what? Sometimes, less is
dialog: more.

speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: You are, and always will be, our
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come here you fucking geeks.
text: They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a self-sustaining light
dialog: orb. Might come in handy, you know,
dialog: if a bulb goes.
text: TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
text: drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: You coming?
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I ruined your life Tara. Think I
dialog: owe you a new one.
text: TARA takes PAUL's hand.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: I don't have my toothbrush.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Baby, where we're going, you won't
dialog: need teeth.
text: TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
text: the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
text: room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.
text: Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.
text: As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
text: CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
text: tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
text: CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
text: ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That was good, wasn't it?
scene_heading: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY
dialog: We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a

speaker_heading: PUBLICIST
dialog: Just one item per person please.

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
