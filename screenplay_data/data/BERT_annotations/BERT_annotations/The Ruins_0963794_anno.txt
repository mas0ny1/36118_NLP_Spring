scene_heading: FADE IN ON:
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - DAY
text: The hotel is six stories high, a wall of glass and stucco.
text: Beach chairs are arrayed around the pool's edge; sunbathers
text: lie sprawled across them. A short boardwalk leads toward the
dialog: Gulf of Mexico: the white sand, the blue water.
text: Four young Americans are encamped near the pool's edge;
text: they're all in their early twenties. AMY lies face down on a
text: chaise, eyes shut, a cooler beside her. She's petite, with
text: short blond hair, her skin pinkly sunburned.
text: ERIC sits in the chair beside her, studying the Cliff Notes
text: for The Canterbury Tales. He's leanly muscular, with dark
text: curly hair. Other Cliff Notes lie scattered beneath his
dialog: chair: Antigone, A Separate Peace, Hea rt of Darkness, 1984.
text: JEFF and STACY sit on the far side of the cooler; they're
text: playing gin. Stacy, too, is petite, with short hair, though
text: hers,. is dark. She's wearing a pale blue bikini, and has a
text: beer bottle in her hand. She looks a little bored.
text: Jeff is tall, scrawny. Like Eric, he has a pair of swim
text: trunks on, and is deeply tanned. He's very focused, frowning
text: down at his cards.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: We should play War. It's more fun.
text: Jeff takes a card from his hand, lays it down on the table.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That's not even a game.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Sure it is. I'll teach you.
text: She starts-to fold her hand,'but Jeff shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I know how to play. I mean it's
dialog: just chance--there's no skill
dialog: involved.
text: Stacy frowns down at her hand, silenced. She picks a card
text: from the deck, immediately discards it. Jeff snatches it up,
text: lays down one of his own. Stacy stares at it in dismay.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: But I keep losing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: 'Cause you're not concentrating.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I wouldn't have to concentrate if
dialog: we played War.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Exactly. So where's the fun?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'd win sometimes. It's not fun if
dialog: we both can't win.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But it's not winning if it's just
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Of course it is. If we flipped a
dialog: coin, and I called heads, and it--
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck..;this.. shit.
text: Eric throws the Canterbury Tales to the ground. Then he
text: rises, steps to the cooler, pulls out a beer, carries it back
text: to his chair. Stacy watches as he takes a long swallow.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Maybe you should just be honest,
dialog: sweetie.
text: Eric doesn't even glance at her. He sips his beer again.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: You could say: look, I don't know
dialog: anything about these either, so now
dialog: we're gonna read them together and
dialog: sort of teach each other as we go.
dialog: (turning to Jeff)
dialog: Wouldn't you have loved that? To
dialog: have a teacher who--
text: Amy speaks without opening her eyes, cutting Stacy off:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why would they hire you if you
dialog: haven't read the books?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I said I had.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So maybe you should..
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (appalled by the idea)
dialog: The Canterbury Tales? You ever
dialog: look at that shit?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I've read it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck off. It's not even English.
text: Jeff watches Stacy take another card; she examines it, sets
text: it on the discard pile. Then, RECITING:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This world nys but a thurghfare ful
dialog: of wo, and we been pilgrymes,
text: passing to and fro. Deeth is an
dialog: ende of every worldly soore.
text: Eric and Stacy stare at Jeff in astonishment. Amy doesn't
text: react. Jeff glances toward her.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
text: Sunscreen, Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm fine. I've got a base.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're burning. I can see it.
text: She finally opens her eyes, lifts her head, peers at her
text: shoulders. She presses at the pink skin.
speaker_heading: ANY
text: I'm just flushed. It's too hot.
text: Stacy leans forward, picks a second card off the deck. Jeff
text: is focused on Amy; he doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're hot because you're burning.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's only been--
text: Stacy interrupts, speaking in a slightly SINGSONG fashion:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So there was this king, who lived
text: in a castle.
text: Amy turns, gives her a pained look.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Please don't.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But what he really wanted was a
dialog: beach house.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stop it. Both of you. Right now.
text: They ignore her, ping-ponging quickly back and forth:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So he decided to move.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But the Queen didn't want to.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So he left by himself.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But he got lonely.
text: Amy covers her ears with her hands, blocking out their
text: voices, but then inmiediately reaches to feel for her
text: earrings: one of them is missing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So he bought a dog.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But it had fleas.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I lost my earring.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So he gave it a bath.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But the dog caught. cold.
text: Amy sits up, glancing about. Stacy and Eric keep going:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So he gave it some medicine.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But it was the wrong kind.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So the dog died.
text: Amy rises, steps toward the pool. Jeff lays down his cards,
text: joins her beside the water. They both peer into it.
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - BOARDWALK - DAY
text: A young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the beach,
text: carrying fins, a mask, a snorkel. He's in his early
text: twenties: blond, crew-cut, very tall. His name is MATHIAS.
text: As he nears the pool, he stops, staring.
scene_heading: MATHIAS'S POV - THE POOL
text: Eric and Stacy have risen to join Jeff and Amy; they're all
text: peering into the water. Amy holds her remaining earring out
text: to Eric and Stacy, showing them what it looks like.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - MATHIAS
text: He stands there, hesitating. Then he starts forward.
scene_heading: MATHIAS'S POV - THROUGH THE MASK - UNDERWATER - DAY
text: We glide just above the pool's pale blue bottom. A silver
text: earring comes into view. Mathias's hand reaches for it.
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - DAY
text: The two couples have spread out around the pool's edge,
text: searching for the earring. Mathias surfaces in front of Amy.
text: He holds out his hand, with the earring-in it; she stares,
text: startled, then crouches to take it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank you so much.
text: .Mathias nods. He starts to turn, as if to swim off, but Jeff
dialog: stops him:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Wait. . .want a beer?
text: He waves toward their chairs, the cooler beside them.
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - LATER
text: Mathias and the two couples sit together, with their beers.
text: Amy's skin has turned deep red; Stacy is behind her, applying
text: lotion to her shoulders. Eric is talking to Mathias:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We went sailing yesterday. Out
dialog: toward Cozumel? And there were
dialog: these seven foot fish, these huge--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nurse sharks.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Like thirty of them. A whole, you
dialog: know, flock.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: School.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The water was, I don't know, ten
text: feet deep? And they were lying on
text: the bottom, just waiting for
dialog: somebody to come swimming by--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They're not dangerous.
text: Eric turns, stares at Jeff.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You said they're sharks.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But they're not dangerous. They
dialog: eat lobsters. Sea urchins. That
dialog: sort of thing.
text: Eric considers this, frowning. Then he takes a sip of beer.
text: He shrugs, turns back toward Mathias.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I wouldn't be snorkeling on my own.'
dialog: That's all I'm saying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: When Mathias speaks, it's with a SLIGHT GERMAN ACCENT:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: I wasn't on my own. I was with my
dialog: brother.
text: Jeff glances around the pool.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He's here?
text: Mathias shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
text: He met a girl. They went away.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: To?
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: It's a complicated story.
text: They watch him, waiting for more, but nothing comes. Finally:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You should hang with us, then. If
dialog: you're on your own.
text: (he glances at the others)
dialog: Right?
text: Everyone nods, smiling. Eric reaches into the cooler, pulls
text: out another beer, holds it toward Mathias.
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN BEACH - NIGHT
text: There's a DJ, a dozen beer kegs. A few young men and women
text: are dancing beside a bonfire, but most of the crowd is
text: scattered in small groups across the sand, TALKING, drinking,
text: the firelight flickering off their faces.
text: Stacy, Amy, Eric, Jeff and Mathias are sitting together; they
text: all have cups of beer. Stacy is between Eric's legs, leaning
text: against his chest. Amy, Jeff and Mathias sit cross-legged.
dialog: Everyone but Jeff and Mathias is a little drunk, and you can
text: hear it in their voices. Amy drains her cup, stands up, very
text: unsteadily. She holds out her hand to Jeff.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Dance.
text: Eric smiles, as if the idea of Jeff dancing were absurd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Jeff doesn't dance, Amy--he has no
dialog: rhythm. Of all his many gifts,
dialog: rhythm is not one.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's not true. He played the
dialog: trombone in high school. He won a
dialog: prize.
text: Eric seems startled by this, amused.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Seriously?
text: Amy nods. She drains her beer, tosses the cup aside.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff's won prizes for everything.
dialog: His Mom has a whole room built just
dialog: for them. Trophies and ribbons and
dialog: plaques. He's a very accomplished
text: young man.
text: (she holds out her hand-to
speaker_heading: ERIC)
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (he shakes his head)
dialog: I don't dance on sand.
text: Stacy makes a SNORTING sound.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Or grass. Or cement. Or carpet.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I dance on teak.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Teak?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's a type of wood. Very rare.
dialog: Find me a teak floor and I'll be a
dialog: dancing fool.
text: Amy shifts toward Mathias, holds out her hand. He stares at
text: it, then glances at Jeff. Before he can speak, Stacy pushes
text: herself to her feet; she's almost as wobbly as Amy.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'll dance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: They lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire. The boys
text: watch them go. A beat, then Jeff glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm gonna head back.
text: Eric gives him a look of disappointment,
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're kidding.
dialog: Jeff seems STARTLED by this:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: How long is med school? Four
dialog: years?
text: Jeff nods.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: And then you got, whaddya call it,
dialog: residency?
text: Another nod. Eric turns toward Mathias.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: He's gonna be grinding away all
dialog: that time. Sleepless. Fucking
dialog: miserable. And know what? He's
dialog: gonna look back on this night, us
dialog: right here, and he's gonna say to
dialog: himself, shit, I wish I'd--
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Gone to bed earlier.
text: Eric stares at him; this wasn't the direction he was heading.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: If I'm gonna be so short on sleep,
dialog: I should get as.much as I can now,
dialog: don't you think?
text: He stands up, brushes the sand from his shorts. Eric shrugs,
text: lifts his cup toward him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: All work and no play--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and
dialog: wise.
text: With that, Jeff nods good night to them, then starts off
text: toward the hotel. Eric and Mathias turn back toward the
text: bonfire. They sit in silence, watching the girls dance.
text: After a moment, Amy staggers away from the other dancers,
text: toward a group of young men, drinking together in the
text: shadows. She reaches down, pulls one of them to his feet,
text: starts to drag him back toward the bonfire.
text: The young man is tall, with long blond hair. He LAUGHS,
text: tries to free himself, but Amy is insistent; she keeps
text: pulling at him, and finally he surrenders. They begin to
text: dance. Stacy is dancing on her own, eyes shut, oblivious.
text: Mathias glances toward Eric. Eric shrugs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Amy drifts sometimes, when she
dialog: drinks.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Drifts?
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Like a boat--she bumps into other
dialog: boats.
text: They continue to watch. Amy and her partner's dancing is
text: becoming steadily more intimate, the gap between their bodies
text: narrowing, then disappearing altogether. Finally, Eric
text: pushes himself to his feet.'
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: Come on. Let's save everyone some
dialog: grief.
text: He starts. forward, followed by Mathias. They join Stacy and
text: Amy, and Eric subtly interrupts Amy's pas de deux. The blond-
text: haired young man disengages, drifts back toward his friends.
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN BEACH - DAWN
text: It's quiet, the sun just breaking the horizon; the beach is
text: nearly empty. A handful of hotel employees are tidying up
text: after the bonfire: carrying off the empty kegs, raking clean
text: the rubbish-strewn sand. Gulls hover overhead, CAWING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: Jeff appears, running along the beach, his T-shirt soaked
text: with sweat. He stops as he nears us, stands for a moment
text: just above the line of surf, catching his breath, watching
text: the sun rise. Then he turns, starts toward the hotel.
scene_heading: EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - TERRACE - DAWN
text: A breakfast buffet: trays of pancakes, eggs, fresh fruit.
text: There are a dozen tables beneath brightly colored umbrellas.
text: Mathias is the only diner at this hour; he's dressed in jeans
text: and a T-shirt. He studies a piece of paper as he eats.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: You're up early.
text: Mathias lifts his head: Jeff is standing there in his sweaty
text: shirt, smiling down at him.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: I have to catch a bus.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: To?
text: Mathias slides the sheet of paper toward him. Jeff bends to
text: look. There's a paragraph in German scrawled above a hand-
dialog: drawn map, with four place names: Cancun, Valladolid,
text: Tizimin, Coba. A large X has been drawn to the west of Coba.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: The girl my brother met was on her
dialog: way to this place, to work.
text: (he waves at the map)
text: It's a dig--an archaeological dig.
dialog: And he went with her. He left the
dialog: map, saying I could come, too, if I
dialog: got bored on my own.
text: A beat; he watches Jeff examine the map. Then:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS (cont'd)
dialog: Our flight leaves the day after
dialog: tomorrow. I can wait and hope he
dialog: returns in time.. Or I can go get
dialog: him. It's a question of trusting
dialog: him to do the right thing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And you don't?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Henrich doesn't think things
text: through. He runs at them. He's...
text: (he searches, shakes his
speaker_heading: HEAD)
dialog: There's a word in English, but I
dialog: can't remember it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: impetuous?
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: So I have to be--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Responsible.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: All our lives, the same story.
text: Jeff.slides the map back toward him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It's what? One of those pyramids?
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: (he shakes his head)
text: An old mining camp.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: De oro? 0 plata?
text: Mathias just stares at him.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You don't speak Spanish?
text: Mathias shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: So how will you find this place?
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: (he smiles, shrugs)
dialog: Follow the m ap.
text: Jeff frowns down at the map for a long beat. It seems as if
dialog: he's going to question the feasibility of this, but. then he
text: disengages instead, wiping at the sweat on his face.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well, good luck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
text: Mathias nods his thanks, and Jeff turns, starts away from the
text: table. WE MOVE with him, across the terrace, into the:
scene_heading: INT. CANCUN HOTEL - RESTAURANT
text: It's completely empty at this hour, and eerily silent.
text: Chairs are stacked on the tables. As Jeff enters, a waiter
text: moves past ham, carrying a pitcher of orange juice. Jeff
text: stops, turns to watch through the window beside the door.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: The waiter refills Mathias's glass. Mathias smiles, nods.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff hesitates, wavering. Then he pushes open the door
text: again, steps outside. We watch--
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: --as he approaches Mathias. There's the sound of someone
text: RETCHING, COUGHING. This carries over into:
scene_heading: INT. CANCUN HOTEL - JEFF AND AMY'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: A rack with towels on it, a sink, a tub. Amy is crouched
text: over the toilet, in underwear and a T-shirt, VOMITING. Her
text: skin is bright red. Jeff is standing in the tub, freshly
text: showered, drying himself, watching. her. His running clothes
text: hang from a hook beside the door.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You okay?
text: Amy doesn't answer. She COUGHS, spits.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You don't have to come, you know.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don't look fine.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank you. That's very helpful.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: She pushes herself to her feet, flushes the toilet, steps to
text: the sink, squeezes some toothpaste onto a toothbrush.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll be back by nightfall. You
dialog: can just--
text: Amy is raising the brush to her mouth, but she stops, gives
text: Jeff a look in the mirror.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You don't want me to come?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That's not what I'm saying.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So what're you saying?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're hungover, under slept,
speaker_heading: SUNBURNED--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm not sunburned.
text: Jeff stares at her, the deep red of her face. Then he
text: shrugs, steps out of the tub, the towel around his waist.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: .All right. My mistake.
text: Amy bends over the sink, starts to brush her teeth.
scene_heading: INT. CANCUN HOTEL - JEFF AND AMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: A king-sized bed, a bureau, two night tables, a mini-fridge.
text: Jeff emerges from-the bathroom, steps toward the bureau,
text: starts to dress: boxers, jeans, T-shirt.
text: A beat, then Amy shuffles out of the bathroom. She sits on
text: the edge of the bed, starts to pull on a pair of shorts.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Pants.
text: Amy stops, the shorts around her ankles.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'll get too sweaty.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
text: Jeff pulls a pair of khakis from the bureau, tosses them onto
text: the bed beside her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There's gonna be mosquitoes.
text: He picks up a knapsack, steps to the mini-fridge, opens its
text: door. Amy stares down at the khakis for a beat, then drops
text: back onto the bed. She lies there, looking up at the
text: ceiling, her shorts still caught around her ankles.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We don't even know this guy.
text: Jeff slides two bottles of iced tea into the knapsack.
text: There's a plastic shopping bag beside the fridge, and he
text: starts to dig through it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I just don't see why we have to go
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: If you and I were traveling
dialog: together, somewhere you didn't
dialog: speak the language, and I'd
dialog: vanished somehow, wouldn't you want
dialog: someone to help find me?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why would you vanish?
text: Jeff turns, looks at her: this isn't the point.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Aren't you getting bored?
dialog: Honestly. The beach, the pool, the
dialog: beach, the pool. This'll be fun.
dialog: An adventure.
text: Jeff pulls two protein bars from the bag, a box of raisins, a
text: plastic bag full of grapes; he drops them into the knapsack.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You said you wanted to go;hiking,
dialog: didn't you? See the ruins.
text: Amy is silent, unmoving, clearly not swayed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Stay here, then. Seriously.
dialog: There's no--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why do you keep saying that?
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: BECAUSE--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's like you'd rather I didn't--
text: A KNOCKING at the door, and she falls silent. Jeff rises,
text: zipping shut the knapsack. He steps to the door, opens it.
text: Stacy and Eric are in the hall.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Ready?
dialog: The both answer at the same time:
speaker_heading: JEFF AMY
dialog: Amy's having second thoughts. Jeff doesn't want me to go.
text: Stacy and Eric are silent; neither wants to get involved in
text: this. A beat, then Jeff SIGHS, glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Now or never, Any. .We're gonna
dialog: miss the bus.
text: Amy gives a loud GROAN, sits up, reaches for her khakis.
scene_heading: INT. TOUR BUS - DAY
text: Only half the seats are occupied: tourists with their packs
text: and cameras-and hats. Little TVs hang from the ceiling.
text: We MOVE slowly down the aisle, passing Jeff and Amy first.
text: Amy is sound asleep, a camera hanging from her neck, a Panama
text: hat in her lap. Jeff is beside her, bent low over a tour
text: book, comparing its much more detailed map with the one
text: Mathias's brother left behind.
text: Next come Eric and Stacy, hunched together in their seats,
text: watching a Mexican soap opera on the little TV above them.
text: Stacy mimics the actors' exaggerated gestures, GIGGLING.
text: Eric has the Cliff Notes for Hamlet in his lap, unopened.
text: Finally, there's Mathias. The seat beside him is empty.
text: He's staring out the window, his expression perfectly blank.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: EXT. COBA - DAY
text: The town is very small: a dirt road lined with one- and two-
text: story buildings, some with thatched roofs. There's a gravel
text: turnaround, with a bus idling in it. Its door CREAKS open.
text: A dozen tourists emerge from the bus, blinking in the
text: sunlight. Jeff, Amy, Stacy, Eric, and Mathias are among
text: them. The boys have the knapsacks; the girls are wearing
text: matching hats. Amy rubs at her face, stretching, waking up.-
text: There's a souvenir stand at the town's entrance, with
text: brightly colored blankets hanging from its walls. The
text: tourists start toward it, leaving Jeff and the others beside.
text: the idling bus. They peer about, getting their bearings.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Now what?
text: Mathias has his brother's note. He holds it out, pointing,
text: and they gather around him to look.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: We take a cab. To here.
text: WE SEE the map: there's a line drawn from Cancun to Coba,
text: where another, shorter line moves westward. Mathias's finger
text: moves along this shorter line, toward the X on the map.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: How far?
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
text: Eighteen kilometers.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: How many miles is that?
text: They all glance at Jeff. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Eleven. A little more.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Then there'll be a path. Which we
dialog: hike--four kilometers.
text: The others look to Jeff again. He slings his pack.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Two and a half miles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
text: The tourists are vanishing into the town. The bus's door
text: SQUEAKS shut.
speaker_heading: ANY
text: I don't see any cabs.
text: The bus eases into motion, CRUNCHING across the gravel,
text: pulling out onto the road. Behind it, a yellow pickup truck
text: is revealed. "TAXI" is hand-painted in black on its side.
text: They start toward the truck. Its DRIVER is Mayan: short and
text: heavy-set, with thick glasses. His eyes are shut; he's
text: dozing behind the wheel. The truck's engine.is running, the
text: windows shut tight against the heat.
text: Jeff TAPS the window, and there's a burst of movement from
text: the truck's rear, as a dog springs up, BARKING and GROWLING.
text: They all leap back, the girls SHRIEKING.
text: The dog is a mutt--small, but muscular. He's attached to a
text: cinder block by a short chain, which he throws himself
text: against, slobbering, snapping at the air.
text: They all stare at the dog; the girls LAUGH nervously,
text: clutching each other. The driver has roused himself; he
text: leans forward, rolls down his window, stares out at them.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hola.
text: The man gives him a somber nod; the dog keeps BARKING. Jeff
text: takes the map from Mathias, then steps warily forward.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Habla ingles usted?
text: The man half-nods, half-shrugs.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: How much to drive us to here?
text: He offers the map to the driver, who reaches to take it. The
text: man frowns at it. Then, in HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Why you go this place?
text: Jeff struggles for a simple way to explain their mission. in
text: the back of the truck, the dog continues its frantic BARRING.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There are these ruins. This old
dialog: mining camp?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: (he points toward Mathias)
dialog: And his brother---
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Fifteen dollar, I take you ruins.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: To here?
text: Jeff points at the map. The driver shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: This place no good.
text: He holds the map back out toward Jeff. Jeff takes it, gives
text: the man a puzzled look.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No good?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: No good you go. Fifteen dollar I
dialog: take you good place. You like, I
dialog: promise.
text: Jeff glances toward the others, as if for help. They all
text: just stand there, watching. The dog won't stop BARRING.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (cont'd)
dialog: I take you pyramid. Huy grande.
text: Everyone happy.
text: He smiles at Jeff; his teeth are large and thick-looking,. and
text: black along the gums. Jeff pulls out his wallet. He removes
text: a ten and a five, then points at the map.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How about we pay you fifteen
dialog: dollars to go here?
text: He holds the money out. The man doesn't even look at it.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I tell you no good. Still you go?
text: His smile has disappeared; he seems angry suddenly, as if
text: Jeff has somehow insulted him. Jeff hesitates, glancing
text: toward the others again. Then, in a CONCILIATORY TONE:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We're looking for his brother.
dialog: (he points toward Mathias)
dialog: Su hermano?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
text: The driver wrenches the door open, making Jeff and the others
text: flinch. He climbs out, still with that angry expression on
text: his face, then leans into the back of the truck, grabs the
text: dog's chain, unhooks it from the cinder block.
text: He lifts the dog from the truck by the chain. Even dangling
text: by its neck, the mutt continues to SNARL and snap at Jeff and
text: the others. They back away, and the man tosses the dog into
text: the truck's cab, pushing the door shut. The dog throws its
text: body against the window, slobbering and BARKING.
text: The man turns toward Jeff, wiping his hands on his pants.
dialog: Jeff tries again:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sure your ruins are better than
dialog: these. It's just that we--
text: The driver cuts him off, holding out his hand, with that same
text: air of enraged disgust.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: El dinero.
text: Jeff gives him the money. Then the driver SLAPS the side of
text: the truck, gestures for them to climb into the back.
scene_heading: EXT. YUCATAN ROAD - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DAY
text: Below us, the yellow truck travels along a single-lane road.
text: Jeff and the others are in its rear. There are fields on
text: either side of the road, bordered by thick jungle.
text: The truck reaches a fork in the road, bears left, angling
text: toward the wall of jungle, into which it vanishes, the
text: overhanging foliage blocking it from sight.
scene_heading: EXT. YUCATAN ROAD - IN THE JUNGLE - DAY
text: The road is dirt, heavily rutted. There's a small clearing
text: beside it, with a path opening off it. The trees grow over
text: the path, forming a shady tunnel. WE HEAR birds calling, a
text: steady throb of insect life, but otherwise all is silent.
text: A beat, then there's the sound of the TRUCK approaching,
text: along with the dog's BARKING and GROWLING. The pickup
text: appears, moving slowly, bouncing and swaying across the ruts.
text: The truck pulls into the little clearing, stops. Jeff and
text: the others clamber out over its tailgate.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
text: The dog is still lunging at them from behind the truck's rear
text: window. Jeff gives the driver a wave.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Gracias, senor!
text: The driver doesn't even look at him; he just pulls out onto
text: the road, heading back in the direction from which they came.
text: There are mosquitoes; Stacy starts to slap at herself. Jeff
text: unslings his pack, pulls out a can of insect repellent.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Here.
text: He begins to spray her, then Eric. Amy is peering off after
text: the truck. They can still hear the dog's BARKING, but very
text: faintly now. Jeff finishes with Eric, starts in on Mathias.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How do we get back?
text: She points back down the road, toward the vanished truck.
text: Jeff pauses in his spraying, considers for a moment. Then:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The guidebook said you can always
dialog: flag down a passing bus. So I--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: There aren't going to be any buses
dialog: on that road.
text: Jeff nods; this seems obvious. He resumes spraying Mathias.
text: Eric and Stacy stand there, watching.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
text: A bus couldn't even fit.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It also said you can hitch--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: See any cars pass, Jeff?
text: Jeff doesn't answer. He steps toward her, starts to spray
text: her, too. She holds out her arms.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: The whole time we were driving, you
dialog: see even one?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Eric has his phone. Can't we just
dialog: call someone?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He's not gonna get a signal. Not
dialog: way out here.
text: They all turn to watch as Eric reaches into. his pack, pulls
text: out his cell phone, flips it open. He stares at it for a
text: beat, then shakes his head, snaps it shut. Jeff finishes
text: spraying Amy, starts in on himself.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They must-have a way to get
dialog: supplies in.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The archaeologists. They must have
text: a truck. Or access to a truck.
dialog: When we find Mathias's brother, we
dialog: can just ask them to take us all
text: back to Coba.
dialog: (turning to Mathias)
dialog: Right?
text: Mathias seems startled by the question.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: I guess ...I mean, I--
text: He shrugs; he has no idea. Amy is still focused on Jeff:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We're stranded, aren't we? That's,
dialog: like, a twenty mile walk we're
dialog: gonna have to do. Through the
dialog: jungle.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Eleven.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
text: Jeff finishes with the insect repellent, crouches to slide
text: the can back into his pack.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: It's eleven miles.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: There's no way that was eleven
dialog: miles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: Jeff rises, slings his pack. He gives Amy a tired look.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Let's just find this place, okay?
dialog: Then we can figure out how to get
dialog: back.
text: Amy is silent. Jeff turns to the others.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Ready?
text: Mathias and Eric nod, and the boys start down the path. Amy
text: stands there, watching them go. Stacy steps toward her.'
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Just go with it, honey. You'll
dialog: see--it'll all work out.
text: She hooks arms with her, pulls her into motion.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - MOVING - DAY
text: They hike in single file: first Jeff, then Eric, Mathias,
text: Stacy, and Amy. The path is six feet wide, hard-packed dirt.
text: All around and above is the jungle: big-leafed plants, vines
text: and creepers, immense trees.
text: The path moves in snakelike curves; we can't see-very far in
text: either direction. They're all sweating, their shirts
text: clinging to their bodies. The bugs continue to harass them.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So-there was this girl who bought
text: a piano.
text: Amy gives a loud MOAN.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But she didn't know how to play.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So she signed up for lessons.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But she couldn't afford them.
text: Stacy reaches, taps Mathias's shoulder.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You can play, too. If you want.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
text: Mathias glances back at her.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: It's easy. Someone says So, then
dialog: you say But. It's like catch, only
text: without a ball.
dialog: (to Eric)
dialog: So she got a job in a factory.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But was fired for being late.
text: Amy takes off her hat, wipes the sweat from her face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's annoying.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So she became a prostitute.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's tedious and boring. And once
dialog: they start, it's impossible to get
dialog: them to stop.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But she fell in love with her first
dialog: client.
text: Amy puts her hat back on. She looks hot, sweaty, tired.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How much farther?
text: Mathias peers down at his brother's note. Stacy and Eric
dialog: continue with their game.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS STACY
dialog: We cross a stream. Then So she asked him to marry
dialog: there'll be a path, branching her.
dialog: off to our left. If we see a
dialog: village, we've gone too far.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd) ERIC
dialog: A village? But he was already married.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS STACY
text: A Mayan village. So she begged him to get a
dialog: divorce.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd) ERIC
dialog: Will they have air But he was in love with his
dialog: conditioning? wife.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: Mathias shrugs, returns the note to his pocket.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS STACY
dialog: It just says there's a So she decided to kill her.
dialog: village.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: I think we should go see it.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I think we should---
text: Jeff stops suddenly, pointing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The stream.
text: Thirty feet in front of them, the trail dips toward a small
text: stream, studded with boulders. It resumes on the far bank,
text: rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway. The stream
text: is slow moving, the water dark brown. Eric SNIFFS the air.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Fucking smells.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: They must use it as a latrine.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: The village. The Mayans.
text: They start toward it, gingerly, the girls covering their
text: noses. Jeff crosses the stream, hopping from boulder to
text: boulder, and the others follow. Stacy almost falls in; she
text: only catches her balance at the final instant, YELPING.
text: Jeff is already starting up the trail, searching for the
text: turnoff. There's no sign of it; the dense foliage extends
text: unbroken as far as the eye can see. He turns to Mathias.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: How far past the stream?.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Right after, it says.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
text: They stand there in a loose group, staring at the trees.
text: Eric pulls a bottle of water from his pack, takes a swallow,
text: then passes it to Stacy. Amy lifts her arm, points.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look.
text: Up the trail, sixty feet away, stand two small Mayan boys;
text: they seem to have materialized out of the air. They're ten
text: years old, shirtless, scrawny, dark-haired. one of them is
text: holding a bicycle by its handlebars; it doesn't have a seat.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe they can guide us.
text: Stacy smiles toward the boys; she waves, CALLS OUT:
speaker_heading: STACY
speaker_heading: HOLAL
text: The boys just stand there, staring at them, silent, their
text: expressions wary, even frightened. One of them leans to
text: whisper something to the other, who nods.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Why don't we--
text: He stops, noticing Mathias. The German is staring toward the
text: edge of the trail, where a large bush sits. one of its
text: fronds is very slowly dropping toward them, pulling itself
dialog: free of the soil.
text: Mathias steps forward, tugs at a second frond, which slips
text: easily from the dirt. He tosses it aside, reaches for
text: another frond: this, too, slips free. Someone has pushed
text: them into the earth, arranging them to look like a bush.
text: Mathias pulls a fourth frond free, then a fifth, and an
text: opening is revealed in the brush, a narrow path winding its
text: way off through the trees. They stand there a beat, staring
text: at it. Then there's a SQUEAKING SOUND, and they all turn.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - UP THE TRAIL
text: one of the boys is hurriedly pedaling off, bent low over the
text: bicycle's handlebars. His companion remains behind, staring
text: toward us with a look of obvious anxiety.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Amy turns to Jeff; so do the others.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why was it covered?
text: Jeff lifts his hands: how should he know?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Maybe it's not the right path.
text: NO one speaks. They keep staring from the boy to the newly
text: revealed path, trying to make sense of it. WE can still HEAR
text: the squeaking of the bicycle, growing steadily fainter.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: It's on the map.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: It's a hand-drawn map, Jeff.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: And it was hidden. Why would it be
dialog: hidden?
text: Jeff steps forward, shields his eyes, tries to peer into the
text: dimness of the narrow path. Then he glances back toward the
text: little boy, who continues to stand there, watching them.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Maybe the archaeologists don't want
dialog: people to find the mine.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Because?
text: Jeff has to think. Finally:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Maybe they've dug up something
dialog: valuable. Emeralds or something.
dialog: Or silver. Whatever they were
dialog: mining in the first place. And
dialog: they don't want anyone to come rob
dialog: them. So they've asked the Mayans
dialog: to help keep people away.
text: He falls into silence, staring at the boy. No one appears
text: very convinced by his theory, not even Jeff. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: How much farther is it?
text: Mathias takes the map from his pocket again, glances at it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
text: Not far.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Be silly to stop now, don't you
dialog: think?
text: No one answers; no one moves.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: This just feels weird, Jeff.
text: Jeff SIGHS, fighting to suppress his impatience with her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So we what? Turn around? Walk all
dialog: the way back to Coba?
text: Silence. They all turn to stare back down the trail, then
text: toward the Mayan boy, who's still watching them. Stacy SLAPS
text: a mosquito, leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm. Jeff
text: lifts his hand, gestures at the path.leading into the trees.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Come on. We're almost there.
text: The others glance at one another, waiting for someone to
text: argue; no one does. Finally, Mathias steps forward, slipping
text: through the narrow opening. Eric follows him, and then, with
text: just the slightest hesitation, so do Amy and Stacy.
text: Jeff throws one last glance toward the boy--who's still
text: standing there, sixty feet away, watching with his anxious
text: expression--and then he, too, vanishes into the trees.
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW PATH - MOVING - DAY
text: They make their way along the winding path, one after
text: another, all of them sweating, slapping at the mosquitoes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Maybe the ruins are sacred. You
dialog: know? And they don't want people
dialog: digging them up.
text: He glances about, off into the trees, a little spooked.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: We could be walking through some
dialog: sort of ancient graveyard right
dialog: now. And they've--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: It's a mine. An old mining camp.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There's nothing sacred about it.
text: Eric considers this as they walk. The others are also quiet:
text: too hot to speak. The sunlight falls through the trees in
text: thin, shifting columns, hazed with mosquitoes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Maybe it leads to a marijuana
dialog: field, then. Maybe the village is
dialog: growing pot, and that boy rode off
dialog: to get them, and they're gonna come
dialog: with guns and--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Eric.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shut up, okay?
text: Eric falls silent. They follow the path as it curves first
text: right, then left, moving gradually uphill all the while, and
text: suddenly there's sunlight in front of them, bright and
text: intense: a clearing. They hesitate at its edge, staring.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: The clearing is twenty yards wide, and extends in either
text: direction as far as the eye can see, finally curving out of
text: sight. Its soil is a deep black, flecked with white, like
text: frost rime. It's completely free of vegetation.
text: The path resumes on the far side of the clearing, winding its
text: way up asmall hill. The hill is rocky, oddly treeless, and
text: covered with a vinelike growth--a vivid green, with hand-
text: shaped leaves and tiny red flowers.
text: Jeff and the others step warily out onto the cleared ground,
text: peering about, squinting in the sudden sunlight. They stare
text: up at the flower-covered-hill.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
text: There are hints of ruins among the thick foliage: giant
text: boulders with faint carvings etched onto their surfaces, the
text: crumbling remains of a fallen pillar, everything half-buried
text: beneath the vine.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So beautiful.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: And the mosquitoes are gone. You
dialog: realize that? They've stopped
dialog: biting.
text: She smiles at the others, delighted by this development. Amy
text: removes the cap from her camera, starts to take pictures.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
text: WE HEAR a click as she takes each photo, and the image
text: freezes for an instant.
text: There's the hillside, covered in its vine, its red flowers:
text: CLICK. There's Eric pulling the water bottle from his pack:
text: CLICK. There's Stacy smiling at us, waving: CLICK. There's
text: Mathias shading his eyes, peering up the hill.
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.}
dialog: Smile, Mathias.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Is that a tent?
dialog: He points.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Amy lowers her camera, turns to look.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - UP THE HILL
text: An orange square of fabric is just visible, at the very top
text: of the hill, billowing, sail-like, in the breeze. From this
text: distance, with the rise of the hill partly blocking the view,
dialog: its hard to tell what it is.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: They all stand there, peering up the hill. Faintly, but
text: growing steadily louder, a THUDDING noise comes from the
text: jungle. The five of them turn, heads cocked, listening.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: A horse.
text: It's true: HOOFBEATS are approaching at a gallop.
text: Instinctively, Jeff and the others back a handful of steps
text: toward the hill. A long. beat, then a horseman bursts into
text: the clearing, rearing to a halt. Amy lifts her camera.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
text: A bald Mayan man is on the horse; he's broad-shouldered,
text: short, in his early forties, dressed in a white shirt and
text: pants. The horse rears a second time, and the image FREEZES
text: for an instant, with a CLICK, as Amy snaps another picture.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The bald man SHOUTS at them in UNSUBTITLED MAYAN. His horse
text: is lathered, SNORTING, rolling its eyes. It rears yet again,
text: and the man half-falls, half-jumps to-the ground. Jeff and
text: the others back a few more steps into the clearing.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
text: The bald man is still holding the reins; the horse is backing
text: away from him, jerking its head, trying to break free,
text: pulling him, step-by-step, back toward the trail. CLICK.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The man can't gain control of the horse. Finally, he drops
text: the reins, and the horse gallops into the jungle, CRASHING
text: through the trees, its hoofbeats gradually diminishing.
text: The man turns toward them, starts YELLING in MAYAN again,
text: pointing back down the trail. Sweat shines on his forehead.
text: There's a gun on his belt, a black pistol in a brown holster.
text: Stacy is clutching Eric's arm, looking frightened.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What's he saying?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Maybe he wants money? A toll or
dialog: something?
text: The Mayan continues SHOUTING, waving his arm. Jeff reaches
text: into his pocket, pulls out his wallet, removes a twenty.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Dinero?
text: The man ignores the proffered bill, makes a shooing motion,
text: waving them from the clearing. Mathias turns toward the
text: hill, cups his hands around his mouth, SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
speaker_heading: HENRICHI
text: There's no response, just the orange fabric gently billowing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Why don't you hike up, see if you
dialog: can find him? We'll try to sort
dialog: this out.
text: Mathias nods, starts across the clearing. The bald man
text: SHOUTS at him in Mayan, and then, when Mathias doesn't stop,
text: pulls his pistol from its holster, FIRES into the sky.
text: Everyone flinches, half-ducking. Stacy SCREAMS. Mathias
text: goes still. The man waves at him, YELLING in Mayan, and
text: Mathias comes back, his hands raised, to join the others.
text: HOOFBEATS are approaching from the jungle again. They come
text: closer and closer, and suddenly two more horsemen burst into
text: the clearing. They're younger than the bald mans in their
text: twenties, dark-haired, muscular. One has a mustache.
text: Their mounts are white-eyed, SNORTING, rearing, just like the
text: bald man's. The two men jump to the ground, dropping their
text: reins, and the horses immediately turn and gallop back into
text: the jungle. Amy lifts her camera again.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
text: The young men have bows slung across their chest, and quivers
text: of thin, fragile-looking arrows. They question the bald man
text: in MAYAN, very rapidly. He's still aiming his pistol at
text: Mathias. A CLICK, and the image freezes for an instant.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: As they continue to interrogate the bald man in MAYAN, the
text: young men unsling their bows, each of them nocking an arrow.
text: Reflexively, Jeff and the others retreat another handful of
text: steps into the clearing. Mathias still has his hands raised.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Quiet.
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: THEY'RE--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Wait. Wait and see.
text: Amy is a bit farther into the clearing than Jeff and the
text: others. She keeps swinging her camera from them to the
text: Mayans, trying to capture the whole scene in one shot. She's
text: too close, though,-and she retreats another handful of steps.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
text: Still backing up toward the hill; all of them but Stacy and
text: Eric are in the frame now. The bald Mayan is still answering
text: the young men's questions. He turns toward us suddenly,
text: points his pistol directly at us,.starts to SHOUT.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff and the others turn, too, staring at Amy in surprise.
text: She's nearly at the far edge of the clearing, peering through
text: her camera; she retreats another step. The young Mayans
text: raise their bows, drawing them; the bald man keeps YELLING.
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: AMY--
text: She takes another step; she's right up against the vines.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
text: Stacy is in the frame now. We retreat one more step, and so
text: is Eric, and the Mayans with their raised weapons, the bald
text: man still SHOUTING: everything FREEZES on the CLICK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Amy lowers her camera. The Mayan with the mustache turns to
text: the other two, points toward her feet, SPEARING URGENTLY.
text: The bald Mayan slowly lowers his pistol, looking dismayed.
text: Amy glances down.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - HER FEET
text: She's stepped out of the clearing, into the flowering vine.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Both of the younger Mayans are speaking now, their voices
text: RISING. The bald Mayan is shaking his head, protesting, but
text: they talk right over him. Amy steps clear of the vine,
text: starts back toward Jeff, and the younger Mayans draw their
text: bows taut again, aiming at her chest. She freezes.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: JEFF---
text: Jeff lifts his hand, without looking, his eyes on the Mayans.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don't move.
text: The bald man continues to frown and shake his head. He
text: points to Amy, then the others; he waves toward the jungle.
text: But the young men are implacable--they keep arguing,
text: gesturing--and finally the bald man gives in, falls SILENT.
text: A beat, then the bald man raises his pistol, aims it at
text: Jeff's chest. He makes a shooing motion with his other hand,
text: but now it's toward Amy, and the hill beyond her.
text: He begins to SHOUT; the other men do, too. Then the bald man
text: FIRES a bullet into the dirt at Jeff's feet. Everyone jumps,
text: starts to retreat. The men with the bows are swinging them
text: back and forth, herding them toward the hill.
text: When Jeff and the others reach Amy, the bald man points
text: toward the trail, waves them up it. He watches--his
text: expression looking stricken, close to tears--as the five of
text: them obediently begin to climb the vine-covered hill.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
text: Midway up the hill, they pause to catch their breath.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Check your phone, Eric.
text: Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, stares at it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Nothing..
text: He snaps it shut. They stand there: sweating, scared
text: looking. Mathias cups his hands to his mouth again, SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Henrich...I
text: They all peer up the hill, waiting for a response.
scene_heading: ERIC'S POV -- UP THE HILL
text: It is a tent: bright orange, looking a bit worse for wear.
text: The vine is growing up its aluminum poles as if on a trellis.
text: .The tent faces away from us; its doorway is hidden. There's
text: no sign or sound of any people.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Eric turns, glances back down the hill, shielding his eyes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There's another one.
text: He points toward the clearing below them.
scene_heading: ERIC'S POV THE CLEARING
text: A fourth man has arrived, on a bicycle. He's dressed in
text: white, like the others, with a straw hat on his head. A
text: beat, then two more Mayans appear, also on bicycles. They
text: all have bows slung over their shoulders.
text: The bald man addresses these newcomers. He waves in either
text: direction, and the other men start off along the clearing,
text: two one way, three the other, leaving him alone at the base
dialog: of the hill.
text: A beat, then a little boy appears from the jungle--the one
text: who'd watched them discover the camouflaged path. He and the
text: bald man stand there, peering up at us.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Eric turns to the others, EXCITED:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Let's run back down. Quick. While
dialog: there's just him and the kid. We
dialog: can rush them.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: He's got a gun, Eric.
text: This silences Eric--silences all of them. Mathias turns,
text: SHOUTS toward the tent again.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Henrich...1
text: There's no answer. They wait another beat, then Jeff waves
text: them back into motion.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
text: The hill is flat on top, forming a wide plateau. Beyond the
text: orange tent is a small clearing of rocky ground. A blue tent
text: sits on the far side of the clearing, looking just as
text: weathered as the orange one, the vine growing up its poles.
text: The five of them pause, peering about. Jeff CALLS OUT:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hello...?
text: SILENCE. The vine covers everything but the trail and the
text: clearing. We glimpse more rubble beneath its greenery: time-
text: worn stelae, a low stone wall.
text: In some places the vine folds back upon itself, forming waist-
text: high mounds, tangled knoll-like profusions of green. And
text: everywhere, hanging off it, are those bright red flowers.
text: Mathias moves toward the orange tent, and Jeff follows him.
text: They UNZIP its flap, stoop to peer inside.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - INSIDE-THE ORANGE TENT
text: The vine has taken root in here, too, growing on some things,
text: leaving others untouched. There are three sleeping bags
text: unrolled on the floor. An oil lamp. Two backpacks. A roll
text: of duct tape. A bottle of tequila. A metal canteen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff and Mathias ZIP the flap back shut. Eric, Stacy and Amy
text: are fifteen feet away, watching.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What's inside?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Nothing. Some camping supplies.
text: Mathias starts across the clearing toward the blue tent,
text: followed by Jeff and the others. He UNZIPS its flap, sticks
text: his head inside. Jeff leans to look, too.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - INSIDE THE BLUE TENT
text: The same thing: sleeping bags, backpacks, camping supplies.
text: The vine is growing on some things, but not on.others.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Ten yards beyond the tent, there's a hole cut into the dirt.
text: Stacy, Amy, and Eric have gathered at its edge; Jeff and
text: Mathias join them. The hole is rectangular--ten feet by six
dialog: feet--and very deep; we can't see its bottom.
text: A windlass has been constructed beside the hole, a horizontal
text: barrel with a hand crank welded to its base. Rope is coiled
text: around the barrel. From there, it passes over a small wheel,
text: which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the hole's mouth.
text: Then it drops straight into the earth.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The mine?
text: Jeff nods. A draft is rising from the hole, and it lifts off
text: Amy's hat. She tries to catch it, but fumbles: the hat
text: falls away from her. They all watch it vanish into the dark.
text: Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, almost
text: absentmindedly: a nervous gesture. There's still no signal.
text: He closes it, turns to survey the clearing, the empty tents.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Now what?
text: Jeff shrugs, waves past the shaft. The clearing ends just a
text: few yards from them;
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
text: then the vines resume, and in the midst of the vines is the
text: path. It winds its way to the edge of the hilltop, vanishes
text: over it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Keep going, I guess.
text: Saying this, he slings his pack onto his shoulder. Then he
text: starts forward, the others falling in behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
text: They pick their way down the trail. It's much steeper on
text: this side; there are short stretches where they have to drop
text: onto their rear ends and slide, one after another. It's
text: after one of these that Jeff suddenly stops, staring.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL
text: It looks as if the jungle has been chopped down all the way
text: around the base of the hill, isolating it in a ring of barren
text: soil. One of the Mayans has made his way along this cleared
text: ground to the base of the trail. He's staring up at them.
speaker_heading: ERIC (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck.
text: The man slides his bow off his shoulder, nocks an arrow. He
text: shakes his head at them, CALLS OUT in MAYAN, waves them away.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The five of them stand there, staring down at the man.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What do we do?
text: Jeff shrugs, starts forward again.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll see.
text: The others hesitate, and then, one after another, resume
dialog: their downward march.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: As they approach the clearing, the Mayan man YELLS what
text: sounds like someone's name.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
text: A beat, then another bowman comes jogging into view. Jeff
text: and the others stop at the bottom of the trail. They stand
text: there, staring.
text: The vine has invaded the clearing here. Ten feet in front of
text: the path is one of those odd, knoll-like growths, knee-high,
text: thick with flowers. The two Mayans are another twenty feet
text: beyond it, in the center of the clearing, bows drawn.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So.
text: Her skin is slick with sweat, and she's winded from the hike
text: down. A third Mayan comes jogging toward them. He stops
text: beside the other two, draws his bow.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We should rush them. All at once.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Shut Up, Eric.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Or go make shields. If we had some
dialog: shields, we could--
text: He falls silent as another Mayan comes running toward them.
text: along the clearing. This one is bearded, heavier than the
text: others. And he's carrying a rifle.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Jeff is staring at the little isolated island of vines, ten
text: feet in front of them--peering intently at it.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Let's go back up.
text: Jeff takes a step forward into the clearing--slowly, warily.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: I wanna go back.
text: Jeff takes another step, edging toward the mound, his eyes on
text: the Mayans, their raised weapons. They just watch him.
speaker_heading: ANY
speaker_heading: JEFF--
text: He ignores her, takes a third step, then a forth, which
text: brings him to the mound of vines. He crouches, reaches into
text: the tendrils, parting them. He grasps a stalk, tugs, pulls
text: it free. WE SEE a tennis shoe, a sock, a man's shin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: Jeff turns, stares at Mathias, who steps forward, crouches
text: beside him, starts to pull at the vines, gently at first,
text: then more aggressively, tearing them, the plant's sap shining
text: on his skin, a low MOAN rising from his chest.
text: Another shoe is revealed, another leg, a pair of jeans, a
text: belt buckle, a black T-shirt. And then, finally: a young
text: man's face, the flesh oddly eaten away, so that his cheekbone
text: is visible, the white socket of his left eye.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, no. Oh, Jesus.
text: Jeff holds up his hand, silencing her. The Mayans stand
text: there, in the center of the clearing, watching. Mathias has
text: begun to rock slightly, that MOANING coming and going. Jeff
text: touches his shoulder, WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Easy. All right? Easy and slow.
dialog: We'll stand up and we'll walk away.
dialog: We'll walk back up the hill.
text: The young man's T-shirt is stiff with dried blood. There are.
text: three slender arrows impaled in his chest.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: It's my brother.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: They killed him.
text: Jeff nods, his hand still on Mathias's.shoulder; he squeezes.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shh. Not here. Up the hill, okay?
text: Mathias is struggling to control his breathing; the MOANS
text: keep coming. Finally, he manages a nod, and they both stand
text: up. Stacy and Amy are holding hands, looking stricken.
text: Stacy has started to CRY. Eric has his arm around her.
text: The Mayans keep their weapons raised. They watch in silence
text: as Jeff and the others turn to start back up the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
text: Jeff and Mathias are at the top of the trail, staring down
text: toward the clearing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - THE BOTTOM OF THE BILL
text: More Mayans are appearing from the jungle. They're all
text: armed. The bald man sends them out along the clearing, some
dialog: in one direction, some 'the other.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff and Mathias stand there, grim-faced, watching. Mathias
text: lifts his hands, stares at them. They've turned a deep, raw-
text: meat red, as if scarred. He flexes his fingers, wincing.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy, Stacy, and Eric sit in the clearing, beside the shaft,
text: passing a bottle of water among themselves. Eric is
text: struggling to calm the girls:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We can sneak past once the sun...-'
dialog: sets, I bet. You know? Just reep
dialog: by them in the dark?
text: Stacy and Amy hardly seem to hear him; they look dazed,
text: distraught. Eric passes the bottle to Stacy. A beat, then:
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: And then there's the girl.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The girl?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The one his brother met. What
dialog: happened to her?
text: Amy and Stacy are silent. Stacy lifts the water bottle to
text: her lips, but immediately lowers it, and starts to CRY again.
text: Amy takes her hand. Eric watches them, silent. Then:
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: And the archaeologists. You think--
text: Stacy's crying deepens toward a SOB. Amy gives Eric a look.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stop it, Eric.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Just stop, okay? Stop talking.
text: Stacy struggles to collect herself, breathing deep. She
text: wipes at her face. Amy keeps stroking her hand.
text: Jeff and Mathias are approaching across the hilltop. Mathias
text: holding his burned-looking hands out in front of him. He
text: 9 a nd Jeff crouch beside the others.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What happened?
text: Jeff takes the bottle from Stacy. He pours a tiny bit of
text: water on Mathias's hands.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There's something in the plants.
text: The sap--it burned his skin.
text: Mathias rubs at his hands with his shirt, grimacing. Amy
text: reaches to take the water back from Jeff. She starts to lift
text: the bottle to her mouth, but..Teff leans forward, grabs it.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Don't. We need to save it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But I'm thirsty.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We all are.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So let's drink.
text: Jeff shakes his head, capping the bottle.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We don't have that much. We need
dialog: to ration it.
text: (he glances up at the sky)
dialog: We'll have to figure out a way to
dialog: catch the rain.
text: Everyone but Amy peers up at the sky: it's a perfect,
text: cloudless blue. Amy remains focused on Jeff.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: I'm hungover. I'm sunburned. I
dialog: lost my hat. I need some water.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: AMY--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why do you get to decide?
text: Jeff stares at her, considering this. Then he shrugs.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Fine. Let's vote.
text: (he glances at the others)
dialog: But first you should understand
dialog: that each of us is gonna need half
dialog: a gallon of water a day, at a
dialog: minimum, to survive here. That's
dialog: two and a half gallons total, every
dialog: day. And right now, until it
dialog: rains, we don't have it. Okay?
dialog: Not even one day's worth.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Now who wants to give Amy more
dialog: water?
text: A long moment of silence. No one can meet Amy's eyes.
scene_heading: Finally, VERY QUIETLY:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Maybe we should just wait, honey.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Till?
text: Everyone looks toward Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Another hour or so. Then we'll all
dialog: have a sip. Okay?
text: Amy can see that she has no choice. She gives a grudging
text: nod, and Jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We have to get organized. Now.
dialog: While we're still fresh. We'll
dialog: have to stay out of the sun, spend
dialog: as much time as possible in the
dialog: tents. We'll have to--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Can't we sneak away when it gets
dialog: dark? Eric said we--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: Jeff shakes his head, cutting her off. He waves across the
text: hilltop, toward where he and Mathias had been standing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: They keep coming. More and more of
text: them. They're all armed, and the
text: bald one sends them out along the
text: clearing. They're surrounding us.
text: Amy, Stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this. Finally:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Why don't they just kill us?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It's got something to do with the
dialog: hill, I think. Once you step on
dialog: it, you're not allowed off.
dialog: Something like that. They won't
dialog: step on it themselves, but now that
dialog: we're here, they won't let us
dialog: leave. So we have to figure out a
dialog: way to survive till someone comes
dialog: and finds-us.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Who?
text: Jeff lifts one hand, palm-up, half a shrug.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: People'll start to worry when we
dialog: don't return home. Right? And
dialog: THEY'LL--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We're not supposed to leave till
dialog: Friday.
text: Jeff nods.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: And they'll have to come searching.
text: Again, he nods.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: So you're talking--what, a week?
speaker_heading: .JEFF
dialog: Something like that.
text: Amy looks appalled; her voice JUMPS:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We can't live here for a week,
dialog: Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: If we try to leave, they'll shoot
dialog: us. That's the one thing we know
dialog: for certain.
text: An electronic CHIRPING comes from the shaft: it sounds like
text: a cell phone ringing. Mathias turns his head, listening. No
text: one else notices it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But what will we eat? How will we--
text: The RINGING comes again, silencing her. She glances toward
text: the shaft, not quite believing what she's hearing. It comes
text: a THIRD TIME, and they all stand up, step to the hole, peer
text: into its darkness. The RINGING comes yet again.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: A cell phone.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It can't be--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That's a cell phone, Amy.
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: .AMY
text: But there's no signal out here.
text: Eric can't get a signal.
text: Reflexively, Eric pulls out his phone, checks again:
text: nothing. There's another RING.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It could be a different network.
dialog: Something local.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Way down in that hole? How could
dialog: it pick it up?
text: Still another RING.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What else can it be?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
text: The RINGING falls SILENT. They all stand there, staring into
text: the hole. A long beat, then it RESUMES. Eric CLAPS his
text: hands, ecstatic. The others are starting to smile, too.
text: Mathias moves to the windlass. He unrolls some of the rope,
text: starts to wrap it around his chest. Jeff watches him.
text: Another RING.
text: The vine has taken root on the windlass:- the sawhorse, the
text: barrel, the rope. Jeff steps forward, begins to yank it off,
text: careful not to get the sap on his hands. He turns to Amy.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: There's a lamp in the orange tent.
dialog: See if you can find some matches,
dialog: too.
text: Amy hurries off toward the orange tent, vanishing inside.
text: There's a final RING, and then SILENCE again. Mathias is
text: knotting the rope tightly around his chest.
text: Amy returns, carrying an oil lamp, a box of matches.
text: Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp. Then he
text: rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You sure?
text: Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the hole.
text: Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themselves
text: at the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut.
text: Mathias girds himself, steps out over the hole. He dangles
text: there for a moment, hanging beneath the sawhorse, the
text: windlass GROANING on its mount. Then Jeff and Eric begin to
text: reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out.
text: Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft, peering into it,
text: watching as Mathias begins his descent--ten feet, twenty
text: feet, thirty feet down, and still only darkness beneath him,
text: with no sign of the shaft's bottom.
text: The windlass CREAKS as it turns; Jeff and Eric strain against
text: it, sweating, muscles taut. Amy has turned from the shaft,
text: is watching: the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff.
text: He turns to look, and she points at the rope, where it comes
text: off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel
text: hanging from the sawhorse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: The sap...
text: They'd cleared off most of the vine from the rope, but not
text: all of it. Some of these remaining tendrils have been
text: crushed as the windlass slowly unspools. Their sap is
text: darkening the rope in spots, eating into it.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: I think it's--
text: Jeff immediately turns back to the crank, his voice URGENT:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Pull him up !
text: Eric hasn't grasped what's happening. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
speaker_heading: NOWT
text: Amy jumps forward to help, all three of them pushing at the
text: crank, getting in each other's way, the windlass CREAKING as
text: it begins to turn again, slowly reclaiming the rope. Stacy
text: remains beside the shaft, peering anxiously into it.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - THE SHAFT
text: Mathias is twenty-five feet beneath us, just beginning to
text: bump his way upward, swaying back and forth. He stares up at
dialog: us, CONFUSED:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: What is it?
text: The rope beneath the sawhorse is being visibly eaten away,
text: its hemp unraveling.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Stacy turns toward the others, pointing, terrified.
speaker_heading: STACY
speaker_heading: IT'S--
text: The rope SWAPS. Jeff, Eric and Amy fall forward, the
text: windlass spinning wildly behind them, free'of its weight. A
text: long beat, then there's a distant, hollow-sounding THUMP,
text: followed instantly by the POP of the lamp shattering.
text: Stacy leans to peer into the shaft, her hand over her mouth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - THE SHAFT
text: Darkness. Silence.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: Mathias...?
text: Her voice ECHOES back at us. There's no response.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff, Eric, and Amy join Stacy at the edge of the shaft, all
text: of them staring down into the darkness, looking horrified.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is he--
text: There's a GROAN from below, very faint, almost inaudible.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: He's moaning.
text: They listen for a beat, but there's only silence.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: I heard him moan.
text: The others don't seem so certain; Jeff turns to the girls.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: One of you will have to go.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Go?
text: Jeff nods, waving into the shaft.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Down. We'll clear the vine off the
dialog: rope. And you can--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why can't you? Or Eric?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We have to work the crank. You
dialog: won't be strong enough.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: Amy and Stacy stare at each other; it's obvious neither of
text: them wants to go. Stacy is the one who finally gives in.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I can do it.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (RELIEVED)
dialog: You sure?
text: Stacy nods, but she doesn't look sure. She's hugging
text: herself; it seems as if she might start trembling. Before
text: anyone can speak, that GROANING comes from the shaft again,
text: louder this time, unmistakable. Jeff cups his hands, SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Mathias...?
text: More SILENCE. Jeff turns to the girls.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: See if you can find a knife. And
dialog: another lamp.'
text: He waves them toward the tents; then he and Eric begin to
text: unspool the rope from the windlass, laying it out across the
text: clearing in long, looping circles.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: The Mayans keep coming: women now, too, bearing bundles on
text: their backs. They're setting up a campsite along the edge of
text: the jungle. The bald man stands in their midst, his hands on
text: his hips, staring silently up the hillside.
speaker_heading: CU - OIL LAMP
text: The SCRATCH of a match being lit: Amy's hand comes into
text: frame, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, fires the wick.
speaker_heading: JEFF (0.S.)
dialog: Just help him into the sling. Then
dialog: we'll pull him up.
text: The chimney is carefully replaced, as WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy is crouched, adjusting the lamp's flame. Jeff and Eric
dialog: have mended the rope.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
text: WE SEE the excised lengths of spoiled hemp, and the ragged-
text: looking knots on the rope itself, which has been spooled once
text: more around the windlass.
text: They've fashioned a sling at the rope's end. Jeff and Eric
text: are helping Stacy into it, pulling it over her head,
text: adjusting it under her armpits.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Once we get him out, we'll drop the
dialog: rope back down and pull you up,
dialog: too.
text: Amy offers Stacy the lamp. Stacy is scared, yet struggling
text: not to show it. Her hands are trembling, and the lamp
text: rattles as she takes it. The boys are stepping toward the
text: windlass; Eric stops, glances back at her.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You okay?
text: Stacy nods, but without much conviction. Eric steps toward
text: her, gives her a tight hug. He holds her eyes for a moment,
text: kisses her. Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank. They lean
text: against it, and the rope goes taut.
text: Stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft, the lamp in
text: her right hand. With her left hand, she lunges, grabs at the
text: sawhorse, clings tightly to it. Jeff glances toward her from
text: the hand crank.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Ready?
text: She nods, but doesn't relinquish her grip on the sawhorse.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You have to let go, Stacy.
text: For a moment, it doesn't seem like she'll be able to, but
text: then--with a visible act of will--she does, and they slowly.
text: begin to let the rope out, dropping her into the shaft.
scene_heading: ON STACY - IN THE SLING
text: She grips the sling with one hand, the lamp with the other.
text: Wooden supports have been hammered into the walls of the
text: shaft, buttressing the dirt. The vine clings to them, its
text: leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above.
text: Stacy begins to swing, pendulum-like, as she descends. She
text: tries unsuccessfully to steady herself, then glances up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
text: We're steadily dropping: thirty feet down, then forty. Amy
text: is at the edge of the shaft, peering in at us. She waves.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Stacy smiles up at her. She starts to wave back, but is too
text: scared to let go of the sling. She glances down.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - BENEATH HER
text: The light is swaying back and forth with Stacy, and it causes
text: the shadows beneath us to jump and lurch. There's still no
text: sign of the bottom; the windlass continues to CREAK.
text: A beat, and then, very faintly, Mathias's dim shape starts to
text: emerge: his white tennis shoes, his pale blue T-shirt. The
text: lamp picks up bits of broken glass around his body.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Stacy lifts the lamp, peering downward, struggling to see
text: more clearly, and the sling suddenly jerks to a halt, making
text: her SQUAWK. She looks up.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
text: The CREAKING has stopped. We're swinging slowly back and
text: forth. WE SEE Amy peering down toward us: a long way up,
text: almost seventy feet. A beat, then Jeff appears, too.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Stacy?
text: His voice has an ECHO to it.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - STACY
text: Her face is slick with sweat; it shines-in the lamp light.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.).
text: It's the end of the rope.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'm not at the bottom.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Can you see him?
text: Stacy looks down again, holding up the lamp, peering toward
text: Mathias's motionless body. She lifts her head.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Is he conscious?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I can't tell. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: How far are you above him?
text: Stacy glances down once more, trying to quess,the distance.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Fifteen feet?
dialog: (a beat)
text: He's just lying there.
text: She lifts her head again, peers upward.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
text: The top of the shaft is empty. Very faintly, WE HEAR Jeff
text: and the others talking, just their voices, not their words.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: Jeff ... ?
text: Jeff's head reappears.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We have to figure out a way to
dialog: lengthen the rope. We're gonna
dialog: pull you up.
text: He pulls his head away.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - STACY
text: She's staring upward.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Wait!
text: The rope has almost stopped its swaying.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
text: Jeff steps back to the hole, peers into it. So does Amy.
text: Eric waits by the windlass. The rope is completely played
text: out. Stacy SHOUTS, her voice ECHOING slightly:
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: I want to stay with him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You can't. We have to--
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: I'll jump.
text: Jeff glances at the others. Eric shakes his head. Jeff
text: CALLS down to her:.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We might not be able to make it
dialog: longer. You'll be trapped.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: What about him? We can't just
dialog: leave him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll pull you up. Then we'll see.
text: He starts toward the windlass again.
scene_heading: ON STACY - IN THE SLING
text: The rope jerks, and she begins to rise. She kicks her legs,
text: lifts her left arm over head, wrenches it free of the sling,
text: so that only her right arm remains hooked. She switches the
text: lamp from her right hand to her left, then slips completely
text: free of,the sling, the lamp fluttering out as she drops.
text: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: Almost totally dark, just a faint fall of light from above.
text: Mathias is a dim shape on the floor of the shaft. Stacy
text: lands beside him--heavily, awkwardly--the glass from his
text: shattered lamp CRUNCHING beneath her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: She loses her balance, pitches forward, onto his body.
text: MATHIAS makes a terrible SHRIEKING sound, pure pain, flailing
text: his arms. Stacy struggles to right herself.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'm sorry. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
text: She pulls herself into a crouch, staring down at him through
text: the dimness, his SHRIEK fading to a steady MOANING.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
text: Jeff, Amy, and Eric have rushed to the shaft; they're peering
text: into it. There's only darkness beneath them. Eric SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Stacy...?
text: Stacy's voice rises toward them, sounding. very FAR AWAY:
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: I didn't want him to be alone.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What happened to the lamp?
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
text: It blew out.
text: Jeff turns from the shaft, picks up the box of matches. He
text: yanks off his shirt, ties the box inside it, then steps back
text: to the edge of the hole. He CALLS down to Stacy:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm dropping the matches. Okay?
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: Okay.
text: Jeff holds the knotted bundle over the shaft, lets it go. It
text: falls into the darkness. A long beat, and then, very softly,
text: WE HEAR the thump as it lands.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Got it.
text: The three of them stare into the hole, waiting for the light.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: There's the RASP of a match, its flickering flame, then the
text: stronger illumination of the lamp as Stacy lights its wick.
text: Mathias lies on his back before her, silent now, motionless,
text: his eyes shut. Stacy bends toward him, WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Mathias...?
text: He doesn't respond; it's hard to tell if he's conscious.
text: Stacy lifts the lamp, peers about the shaft. The vine has
text: taken root even at this depth, its flowers and leaves pale to
text: the point of translucence.
text: Beyond Mathias, there's an opening in the dirt wall, another
text: shaft cutting perpendicularly into the earth. Its roof is
text: supported by a stone archway, intricately carved. Stacy
text: rises, as if to investigate, but then winces, nearly falls.
text: She peers down at her right leg. A large piece of glass is
text: imbedded there, just beneath her knee. it's the size of a
text: playing card, gently concave,'dark with her blood. She
text: reaches and, grimacing, pulls it from her body.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
text: Jeff is at the windlass, hurriedly cranking the rope back up.
text: Eric and Amy stand watching.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We need fifteen feet. Twenty to be
dialog: safe.
text: No one speaks. The windlass turns with that steady CREAKING,
text: but it's higher-pitched now, with no weight on the rope.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Come on. Think. How can we--
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The clothes? From the backpacks?
dialog: We could knot them together?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Would they hold?
text: Eric frowns, uncertain. Jeff finishes with the rope, stands
text: there, catching his breath. Stacy's,voice rises toward them
dialog: from the shaft:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: I cut my knee.
text: Eric hurries to the shaft, followed by Jeff and Amy. They
text: peer over its edge, toward Stacy, so far beneath them, in her
text: flickering circle of lamp light.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Bad?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: My shoe's full of blood.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Put pressure on it. Use my shirt.
text: They all stare down at her, waiting.
text: TOE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: Stacy is crouched beside Mathias, pressing Jeff's T-shirt to
text: her wound. Her khakis and tennis shoe are dark with blood;
text: there's a lot of it. She isn't watching Mathias; he startles
text: her when he opens his eyes and speaks:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: My...legs...
text: His voice is faint and RASPY; we can hear his pain in it.
text: Stacy leans toward him, tries to smile reassuringly.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Can't... move ...my...legs...
text: Stacy turns to look: his legs are lying at an odd angle, as
text: if he were a doll that had been carelessly tossed there.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
text: Jeff, Eric and Amy, still watching; Jeff turns to the others.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What about the tents? We could
dialog: take one down, cut the nylon into
dialog: strips.
text: Eric and Amy glance toward the tents, debating.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Would it be strong enough?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: we can braid them--three strips for
dialog: each section. Then knot the
dialog: sections together, for strength.
text: Before either of them can respond, Stacy's voice emerges from
text: the shaft, sounding SCARED:
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: I think he broke his back.
text: They fall silent, staring down at her.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.) (cont'd)
text: He can't move his legs. And it
dialog: smells.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Smells?
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: Like he lost his bowels. His
dialog: bladder.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: Oh no. Please no.
text: Jeff turns to her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How can we make a backboard?
text: Amy starts to shake her head, looking horrified.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, Jeff. No way. We can't move
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: One of the frames from the
text: backpacks? And the tent poles.
text: There's tape in the orange tent.
text: He doesn't wait for a response; he leans over the shaft,
speaker_heading: SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We have to builda backboard,
dialog: Stacy. It might take a while.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
text: There's a long hesitation, as if Stacy is searching for some
text: alternative. Then, still sounding FRIGHTENED and FARAWAY:
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: Okay.
text: Amy is shaking her head, growing FRANTIC:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We'll make it worse. Well jostle
dialog: him, and he'll--
text: Jeff turns toward her, with a hint of EXASPERATION:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We can't just leave him down there.
dialog: You know that, don't you?
text: She starts to back away, toward the edge of the clearing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: we have to tell them.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The Mayans. We have to tell them
dialog: what's happened.
text: Jeff gives her an incredulous look. She keeps retreating;
text: she's almost at the path.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: They can send for help.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They're not gonna---
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We have to may. We have to--
text: She spins, starts off at a run, vanishing down the trail.
text: Jeff calls after her, SHOUTING:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Amy!
text: But she's gone. Jeff turns to Eric.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Stay here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
text: And then he, too, is running.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: The Mayans have established their campsite on the edge of the
text: jungle. Two women are beside a campfire, plucking a pair of
text: chickens. WE SEE other campsites in the distance, other
text: campfires, hugging the jungle's margin, surrounding the hill.
text: Three men sit in the center of the clearing, facing the
text: hillside, their bows in their laps. They rise suddenly,
text: peering up the trail. The women pause in their labor, also
text: staring. The campsite goes QUIET.
scene_heading: THE MAYANS' POV - UP THE HILL
text: Amy is sprinting toward us down the trail. Jeff is ten yards
text: behind her, also running.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The three Mayans nock arrows. Two other men step forward to
text: join them. One has a bow; the other is the bald Mayan, with
text: the pistol. He unholsters it, and--as Amy reaches the bottom
text: of the trail--raises it, aiming at her chest.
text: Amy stops just short of the clearing: sweating, breathless,
text: scared-looking. She lifts her hands, palms-up, beseeching.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Help us. Please. Someone's been
dialog: hurt. He--
text: Jeff comes to a halt, five feet behind her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They can't understand you.
text: She turns, her voice quickened with PANIC:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Say it in Spanish. Tell them he--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They don't speak Spanish.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Try it. You have to try.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
text: She spins back toward the Mayans, takes a step into the
text: clearing. The bald man SHOUTS at her, a single short
text: sentence in MAYAN. Amy holds out her hands to him.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Espanol? Habla Espanol?
text: Jeff steps forward, grabs her elbow.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They killed Henrich. Why would-
text: Amy tries to tug free, but he won't let her. She starts to
text: SHOUT at the Mayans:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Help usi We need help!
text: The Mayans just stare at her, their weapons raised, their
text: faces expressionless. one of them is much younger than the
text: others, almost a boy. He says something in MAYAN to the bald
text: man, and the bald man shakes his head.
text: Amy begins to CRY. Jeff pulls at her elbow.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We have to get back.
text: Amy turns toward him, her face smeared with tears.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I didn't want to come. I told you
dialog: we shouldn't. I said--
text: Jeff tightens his grip on her arm, gives her a little shake,
text: as if to wake her up.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Listen to me. Mathias needs our
dialog: help. Right now. He--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We shouldn't even be here. Why did
dialog: you say we'd come?
text: (she wipes at her tears)
dialog: You have to do something.
dialog: (rising toward a shout)
dialog: You have to! It's your fault.
dialog: It's all your--
text: Jeff shakes her again, more roughly, his voice like a slap:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: YD-q stepped onto the hill.
text: Amy stares at him, startled into silence.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: They wouldn't have forced us up it
dialog: if you hadn't.
text: He holds her eyes, making sure she understands. Then:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Now let's go, okay?
text: He starts to pull her back toward the trail. She allows
text: herself to be led; she's begun to CRY again:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I didn't know. I just--
text: She's growing increasingly upset, almost SOBBING. She tries
text: to turn back toward the Mayans again, but Jeff won't let her.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: They have to help us.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They're not going to.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: They have to.
text: She wrenches herself free, stumbles, falls into the vines
text: beside the trail. Jeff reaches for her, but she kicks away
text: from him, grabbing at the vines, scrambling to her feet.
text: As she rises, she yanks up a tendril, a clot of earth hanging
text: from its roots. She SCREAMS, spinning toward the clearing---
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: WHY WON'T YOU FUCKING HELP US?
text: --and throws the tendril at the Mayans. They scramble
text: backward, with surprising panic, SHOUTING. The youngest of
text: them is too slow: the length of vine hits him in the leg.
text: He stares down at the tendril in shock.
text: The others back hurriedly away from him. Two of them
text: continue to point their weapons at Amy, but the bald man and
text: one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young Mayan now.
text: There's SHOUTING from the tree line. The entire campsite is
text: on its feet; a woman begins to SCREAM.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
text: She's in her,forties, short and stout, and she starts forward
text: into the clearing, arms stretched toward the young Mayan.
text: Two of the other women grab her, hold her back.
text: The bald Mayan starts to ADDRESS the young man, pointing up
text: the hillside. The short woman keeps SCREAMING, flailing,
text: trying to break free. The young Mayan looks at her, then at
text: the bald man. He speaks in MAYAN, a brief burst of words.
text: The bald man shakes his head, points up the hill again, his
text: pistol aimed at the young man's chest. The short woman is
text: WAILING, eyes shut. The young Mayan takes a step toward her,
text: CALLING what seems to be her name.
text: The bald man SHOUTS at him, but the young Mayan ignores him,
text: takes a second step, then a third. The bowmen are all aiming
text: at him now, and suddenly, everyone seems to be YELLING.
text: The young Mayan takes a fifth step, holding out his arms
text: toward the WAILING woman, CALLING to her. The bald man
text: FIRES, shooting him in the head. At the same instant, the
text: bowmen let their arrows fly, the shafts THUMPING into the
text: young man's chest, burying themselves to the fletches.
text: The clearing goes still; the only sound is the woman's steady
text: WAILING. Then the bald man swings his pistol toward Amy and
text: Jeffs he SHOUTS in MAYAN at them. The other Mayans nock
text: fresh arrows, draw their bows.
text: Jeff takes a step backward, half-raising his hands. Amy just
text: stands there, her eyes on the young Mayan's motionless body.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: AMY...
dialog: (no reaction)
speaker_heading: AY.
text: She turns, finally. She looks horrified, stupefied; her
text: hands are burned a deep red from the vine's sap. Jeff waves
text: her up the hill. She stares at him for another beat, and
text: then, without a word, starts to climb the trail.
text: Jeff hesitates, watching the Mayans: the bloodied corpse,
text: the raised weapons, the KEENING woman. Then he, too, turns
text: and hurries off up the trail.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy, Jeff, and Eric have taken down the blue tent; its
text: contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing. All
text: three of them look sun struck, sweat-stained, worn out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
text: Eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue nylon.
text: Amy is braiding three of the strips together. Jeff has one
text: of the backpack frames, the roll of duct tape, and some of
text: the poles from the tent; he's making a backboard.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Maybe we could use it as a weapon,
dialog: you know? Wrap it around some
dialog: stones or something. And throw
dialog: them, like grenades. I mean, if
dialog: they're that scared of it--
text: Jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They have guns, Eric. And bows.
dialog: What do you think they'll do if we
dialog: start throwing the vine at them?
text: Eric is silenced by this. He cuts another long strip of
text: nylon, passes it to Amy. But he can't seem to stop himself
dialog: from talking:
speaker_heading: ERIC.
dialog: So you figure it's, what? Sacred
dialog: or something? Like, you touch it
dialog: and you have to die?
text: Amy begins to cry suddenly--a SOB, quickly suppressed. Jeff
text: and Eric both turn to look at her. The vine's sap has
text: scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows. She wipes
text: her eyes, takes a deep breath, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm okay.
text: But she doesn't look it. Jeff removes his hat, holds it out.
text: Amy just stares at it; he nods for her to take it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Come on. You're burning.
text: She reaches for the hat, puts it on, then wipes at her eyes
text: again. Jeff leans forward, touches her.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We're gonna get through this. All
dialog: right? We'll pull them up. And
dialog: then ...I don't know--we'll figure
dialog: things out. it has to rain at some
dialog: point. And maybe we can snare some
dialog: birds. Or--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
text: The electronic RINGING sounds once more from the bottom of
text: the shaft. They all turn to stare.
text: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: The oil lamp has begun to smoke, adding a haze to the light.
text: Stacy is beside Mathias, holding his hand. She's still
text: pressing Jeff's shirt to her wound. The RING sounds again.
text: Mathias turns his head, peers toward the shaft cut into the
text: dirt wall to his left: that's where it's coming from. Stacy
text: reaches to pick up the lamp, rises to her feet. Another
text: RING. Jeff SHOUTS down from above:
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Stacy...?
text: Stacy ignores him; she limps around Mathias, starts toward
text: the opening. She hesitates at the mouth of the shaft,
text: lifting her lamp to see better. There's another RING.
scene_heading: -STACY'S POV -- INTO THE SHAFT
text: The lamp's light doesn't penetrate very far, but WE can SEE
dialog: that the vine has taken root here with great avidity: it
text: grows thickly on the walls, floor and roof. There's a steady
text: draft coming toward us, and the plant shifts in it, RUSTLING.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Stacy stands there, looking scared. There's another RING.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Can you see it?
text: Stacy lifts her head, SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: No.
text: She keeps peering into the shadows, not moving. The ringing
text: falls SILENT. Stacy turns, hobbles back toward Mathias, and
text: the light shudders, dims for a moment. She squints at it:
text: the oil is nearly gone. She SHOUTS up to the others:
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
text: The lamp's almost out of oil.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Then blow it out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
text: Stacy seems terrified by this.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Blow it out?
speaker_heading: JEFF (0.5.)
dialog: We'll need it when we come down.
text: To get him on the backboard.
text: Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp down
text: before her, stares at it. She clearly doesn't want to blow
text: it out. Mathias watches her, silent.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: All right?
text: Stacy leans forward, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, blows
text: out the flame, dropping the shaft into darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK
text: The.sun is just touching the horizon, the sky turning red.
dialog: Th ey've tied the braids of nylon onto the rope, attached the
text: finished backboard to them. It rests beside the shaft,
text: padded with one-of the archaeologist's sleeping bags.
text: Jeff and Eric remove their belts, drop them onto the
text: backboard. They step to the windlass, lean against its hand
text: crank, the rope going taut. Amy stands by the shaft,
text: gathering her courage. Then she reaches for the backboard.
text: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness. The
text: windlass begins its CREAKING. A long beat, and then:
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: Stacy?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AMY -(0.5.)
dialog: Light the lamp!
text: Stacy shifts; once again, there's the RASP of a match, then
text: the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its wick.
text: Mathias's eyes are shut; there's a deep RAGGEDNESS to his
text: breathing. Stacy looks upward.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
text: The backboard is dropping toward us. Above it, the light is
text: already fading from the sky.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Stacy rises to her feet, lifting the lamp.
scene_heading: ON AMY - CROUCHING ON THE BACKBOARD
text: She's dropping slowly down the shaft, clenching the nylon
text: braids, her eyes tightly shut: terrified. The backboard
text: sways, pendulum-like, as it descends, almost touching the
text: vine-covered walls.
text: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: When the backboard comes within reach, Stacy grabs it,
dialog: pulling it to the-right, so that it will come to rest at
text: Mathias's side. But then, with three feet still to go, it
text: jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch.
text: A beat, and Jeff's voice comes toward them from above:
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Have you reached them?
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Almost. A few more feet.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.}
dialog: How many?
text: Amy leans, peers down at Mathias's broken body.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't know. Three?
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.}
dialog: we're out of rope.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Can you still do it?
text: Amy looks at Stacy; neither speaks. Finally, QUIETLY:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: We'll have to send it back up, I
dialog: guess.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
text: Amy doesn't answer. She shifts her weight, and the backboard
text: starts to swing. Stacy reaches to steady it.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Blow out the lamp. Wait here in
text: the dark.
text: Amy is silent, staring down at Mathias's still form; it's
text: obvious she doesn't want to do this.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Or we could try to lift him, maybe.
text: More silence. Stacy persists:
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
text: One of us at his shoulders. The
text: other his feet.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: If he twists--
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's only a few feet.
text: /"- Once more, Amy is silent. Stacy lifts the lamp, examining
text: it, the diminishing pool of oil.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'.d)
dialog: We have to decide. The light's not
dialog: going to last.
text: Jeff's voice comes toward them from above again:
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Amy...?
text: They both look up; the sky has grown too dark to see him.
text: Amy hesitates one beat more, then YELLS:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We're gonna try itt
text: She climbs off the backboard, crouches beside Mathias. Stacy
text: sets down the lamp.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Mathias...?
text: She touches his shoulder, and he opens his eyes, stares at
text: her. He looks haggard, ashen.
dialog: 10111..
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: We're going to lift you, okay?
dialog: We're going to hoist you up and
dialog: out.
text: Mathias stares from her to the backboard to Stacy. He shuts
text: his eyes. Amy stands up, drags the belts off the backboard,
text: drops them next to the lamp. She positions herself behind
text: Mathias's head; Stacy hobbles to his feet, limping.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
text: His hips.
text: Stacy hesitates, looking doubtful.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: If you lift from his feet, he'll
text: bend at the waist.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: But if I lift at his hips, won't he
dialog: arch his back?
text: They both stare down at Mathis, imagining these two different
text: scenarios. Amy glances toward the lamp, its dwindling oil.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: His knees.
text: Stacy crouches by Mathias's knees, a little off balance,
text: favoring her wounded leg. Amy bends, sliding her hands under
text: his shoulders. Mathias GROANS, and Stacy starts to pull
text: away, but Amy shakes her head.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
text: Quickly. On three.
dialog: They count together:
scene_heading: STACY AND AMY
dialog: One ... two.-,.three.
text: They lift, and Mathias immediately starts to SCREAM. His
text: body sags at the waist; he begins to thrash his arms. Stacy
text: starts to set him down, but Amy shakes her head, SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: Stacy's wounded leg is hindering her; she can't keep up with
text: Amy. Mathias's shoulders are level with the backboard, but
text: his knees are still a good foot beneath it. He keeps
text: SCREAMING. The bend at his waist increases.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
speaker_heading: Lift I
text: Stacy tries to hoist him higher, lunging, his torso twisting,
text: his SCREAMS going LOUDER. His right arm, hits the backboard,
text: sends it swinging. The girls toss him toward it.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT
text: The sun has set. There's a half moon, giving us just enough
text: light to dimly see Eric and Jeff peering into the shaft.
text: Mathias's SCREAMS echo up toward them.
scene_heading: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - NIGHT
text: Mathias has fallen silent. He lies on the backboard, eyes
text: clenched, sweat beading his forehead.
text: Stacy is trying not to cry. She watches Amy buckle the two
text: belts together, then drape them over Mathias's chest, knot
text: them tight. Amy strips off her own belt, gestures for Stacy
text: to do the same. She buckles these together, too.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I have to pee.
text: She limps toward the wall, lowers her pants, gingerly
text: crouches. She stares toward the other shaft as she pees:
text: its stone archway, the shifting shadows, the vine rustling
text: softly in the steady draught.
text: Amy binds Mathias at his thighs. She WHISPERS to him:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You okay?
text: She waits, but he doesn't respond. His eyes remain shut.
text: Stacy rises, buttoning her pants, limps back toward Amy.
text: She's on the edge of tears, is working hard to fight them
text: off. Amy lifts her head, SHOUTS up to Jeff:
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Pull him up!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
text: A moment's pause, then the windlass begins to CREAK once
text: more. The backboard slowly rises, swaying gently. They
text: watch it climb away from them. Amy holds out her-hand.
speaker_heading: ANY (cont'd)
dialog: Here.
text: Stacy just stares at her, not understanding. Amy nods at the
text: lamp: the oil is gone.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: It's gonna go out.
text: And it's true: as Stacy reaches for Amy's hand, the light
text: suddenly flickers, dims, drops them into darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - NIGHT
text: The Mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite. Three
text: of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing, facing the
text: hillside, their backs to the fire. The young Mayan's corpse
text: still lies in the dirt, fifteen feet in front of them. The
text: firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT'
text: The windlass CREAKS loudly as Eric and Jeff work to wind in
text: the rope. Stacy has already been pulled up from the hole.
text: She's sitting beside Mathias, who's lying on the backboard,
text: on the edge of the clearing, by the orange tent.
text: Amy emerges from the shaft, dangling beneath the sawhorse.
text: Jeff holds the rope taut while Eric steps to the hole, pulls
text: Amy toward him. Stacy watches from beside the backboard.
text: Mathias's eyes are shut, his breathing ROUGH with phlegm.
text: No one speaks. Once Amy is free of the sling, they all move
text: to the backboard. Eric takes Stacy's-hand; Jeff crouches,
text: starts to undo the belts.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Shouldn't we carry him into the
dialog: tent first?
text: Jeff pulls free the first belt, shifts to the second one.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We can't.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Because?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He's gonna keep leaking urine.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But we can't just leave him out in
dialog: the open.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll rig a shelter. With what's
text: left of the blue tent.
text: Jeff pulls the second belt free. Mathias's eyes remain shut.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: One of us should stay on watch
text: while the others sleep. Two hour
dialog: shifts.
text: He reaches for his knapsack, unzips it. He pulls out a liter
text: bottle of water.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: .Once it's light, we'll figure out
dialog: how much water we have, and how to
dialog: ration it. Food, too. For now, I
dialog: think we should each just take a
text: single swig.
text: He uncaps the bottle, hands it to Amy. He watches her drink
text: from it. When she's done, she passes it to Stacy.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Eric and I'll build the shelter,.
dialog: then I'll take the first shift.
dialog: You two should try to sleep.
text: Stacy takes her single sip, passes the bottle to Eric.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT
text: Stacy and Amy have pushed the camping supplies into a pile
text: along the tent's rear wall. Stacy pulls off her pants, bends
text: to examine her wound in the darkness. Amy is beside her,
text: lying on her side. A beat of silence. Then, WHISPERING:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Amy?
dialog: what?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: We shouldn't have lifted him,
dialog: should we?
text: Amy reaches, pats Stacy's hand.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shh.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: He's never gonna walk again.. He's--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Don't, Stacy. Don't talk. It'll
dialog: only make things worse.
text: Stacy falls silent.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Just go to sleep, okay? Let's try
dialog: to go to sleep.
text: Stacy lies down next to Amy, in her-underwear and T-shirt.
text: They huddle close together in the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Eric is building a tiny lean-to for Mathias, using the duct
text: tape, the leftover nylon and poles from the blue tent. Jeff
text: crouches over the backboard. He starts to cut Mathias's
text: jeans off him with the knife. Mathias's eyes remain shut.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We have to keep him clean.
text: He slices the jeans, from ankle to hip, first one leg, then
text: the other, struggling not to jostle Mathias's body.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: That's how it'll happen, I think.
dialog: if it does.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: If what does?
text: Jeff slides the soiled strips of-denim out from under
text: Mathias's body, tosses them aside. He LOWERS his voice:.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: If he dies here. infection. Blood
dialog: poisoning--something like that.
text: Eric seems startled by this.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You think he's gonna die?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (he shrugs)
text: His back is broken. Who knows what
dialog: else.
text: Eric is silent, motionless, the tape in his hand. Mathias's
text: BREATHING seems to be getting steadily worse. Jeff bends to
text: cut off his boxers, first one leg, then the other. He tosses
text: the soiled fabric aside.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We should go back down in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Down?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Into the shaft. Try to find the
dialog: phone again.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: There's no oil for the lamp.
text: Jeff waves toward the orange tent.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There's tequila. We could pour it
dialog: on some of the clothes, tie them
dialog: around one of these poles, make a
dialog: torch.
text: A sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of
text: nylon and aluminum poles. Jeff steps over to pick it up.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
text: Without the phone, he's dead. If
dialog: we have to wait for someone to come
dialog: searching...
text: He shakes his head. Then he leans forward and carefully
text: drapes the sleeping bag across Mathias's broken body.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAWN
text: The orange nylon is just starting to glow with the sun's
text: arrival. Stacy and Eric lie beneath one of the sleeping
text: bags, Eric's head on her shoulder. Jeff lies curled on his
text: side, a few feet away, still shirtless.
text: Jeff's eyes open. He sits up, stares about, then reaches for
text: one of the backpacks. He quietly digs through it till he
text: finds a T-shirt. He sniffs at it, then pulls it on.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAWN
text: Mathias lies on his backboard, eyes shut, his breathing still
text: sounding THICK WITH PHLEGM. Amy sits beside him, hunched
text: into herself, half drowsing. She lifts her head as Jeff
text: emerges from the tent, stares at him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The same.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (she shrugs)
text: Tired. Thirsty. Hungry.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Once the others are up, we'll have
dialog: some water.
text: His face is stubbled, sweat-stained. He looks ragged; they
text: both do. He steps to the opposite side of the clearing,
text: unzips, begins to urinate, with his back to Amy.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - ACROSS THE HILLTOP
text: The vine covers everything, tangled and matted, with those
text: odd, knoll-like growths scattered among it. The nearest-is
text: thirty feet away. its leaves are swaying slightly in a faint
text: breeze, and WE SEE a flash of yellowish white beneath them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff finishes, shakes, zips, then steps out into the vine,
text: wading toward the tiny mound. Amy remains beside the
text: backboard; she watches him crouch, part the tendrils, stare.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: What is it?
text: Jeff gestures for her to approach. When she reaches him, he
text: leans forward, pulls aside the vines. WE SEE a man's skull,
text: a loose tumble of bones. Amy INHALES sharply, recoiling.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Bodies. All of them.
text: He waves across the hilltop, at the other mounds: there are
text: more than a dozen. Amy takes them in. The light is gaining
text: strength, the green leaves seeming to shine in it, the red
text: flowers to glow. Jeff's face assumes a puzzled expression.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Where are the birds?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Birds?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: it's dawn--there should be birds.
text: They both stare off across the hillside: so quiet, so still.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY
text: Stacy opens her eyes. She lies there, struggling to orient
text: herself, with Eric on her shoulder. She starts to roll onto
text: her side, then stops, looking confused.
text: She reaches under the sleeping bag, toward her leg, her
text: confusion changing to alarm. She site up, jarring Eric
text: awake, and throws back the sleeping bag.
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: (BEFUDDLED)
dialog: What...?
text: The vine has grown dramatically during the night, reaching
text: out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to
text: spread across Stacy's right leg, almost to her waist. She
text: sits up, tries to push it off her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Oh my god...
text: The vine is clinging to her; she has to tear it, the sap
text: shining slickly on her hands, visibly beginning to burn the
text: skin. She yanks at the tendrils, tossing them aside.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Help me.
text: Eric sits up, still only half-awake. He just stares.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd).
dialog: It's inside me...
text: It's true: one of the tendrils has pushed its way into the
text: wound on her leg, widening it, thrusting itself a full three
text: inches into her body, like a thick finger.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont.'d)
dialog: Oh, Jesus--it's fucking inside me.
text: She tries to pull the tendril out, but she's too panicky, too
text: quick, and the vine breaks, leaving a piece of itself snagged
text: under her skin. Stacy starts to SCREAM:
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Get the knifes
text: Eric is too shocked to stir. He's staring down at her leg,
text: at the bulge beneath her skin: it looks as if it's moving.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Stacy's SCREAMING continues. Jeff and Amy are on their feet,
text: hurrying across the clearing. Mathias has opened his eyes.
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: Get the knife!
text: Jeff bends, scoops up the knife, starts toward the tent. He
text: waves toward Mathias.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Stay with him.
text: Then he ducks in through the tent's flap.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY
text: Eric is beside Stacy, trying to calm her; she's started to
text: CRY. Her hands and wrists have turned a dark red, and the
text: tendril is inside her leg, just to the left of her shin,
text: running parallel to it. Jeff steps. toward them.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: The vine. It's inside her.
text: Stacy points to her wound, SOBBING now:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Cut it out. You gotta cut it out.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The blade's dirty. We should--
text: Stacy starts shaking her head, FRANTIC:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It's moving! Can't you see?
text: Jeff stares at the bulge, hesitating. Then it moves,
text: unquestionably: contracting and expanding, like a worm.
speaker_heading: Stacy SHRIEKS:
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Jeff!
text: Be gives in, crouching over her leg.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It's gonna hurt.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Please. Hurry.
text: He leans forward, slices into the skin above the bulge.
text: Stacy CRIES OUT, starts to jerk away, but Jeff presses down
text: on her leg, holding her still. He reaches into her wound
text: with his finger, digs out the piece of vine, tosses it aside.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Get me a shirt or something.
text: He gestures toward the backpacks, and Eric unzips one of
text: them, starts to dig through it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
text: He pulls out a T-shirt, hands it to Jeff. Jeff wads it up,
text: uses it to put pressure on the incision, staunching the flow
dialog: of blood.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy is crouched by the backboard, watching the tent, trying
text: to grasp what's happening. Mathias startles her by speaking:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Something's... wrong...
text: His voice is thick-sounding, very faint. Amy tries to soothe
text: him; she puts her hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's okay. It's just--
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: my-legs...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know. You're hurt. But we're.,
dialog: gonna get you--
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Show ...me...
text: He's struggling to rise, straining upward. Amy tries to stop
text: him, pressing down on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shh.
text: But he fights her; he won't be quieted:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS.
dialog: Show-me...
text: So she leans, lifts the sleeping bag off him. His lower legs
text: are completely covered by the flowering vine, from the knees
text: down. Amy and Mathias both stare in surprise. Then Amy
text: reaches, starts to yank the tendrils free.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY
text: Jeff is leaning forward, pressing the balled-up T-shirt
text: against Stacy's wound, the blood darkening the fabric. Stacy
text: is lying there, her eyes shut, fists clenched.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I can still feel it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
text: Jeff shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I got it out.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I can feel it moving.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That's just your body. Your muscle
text: twitching.
speaker_heading: STACY
speaker_heading: BUTÂ
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's on our clothes.
text: Stacy and Jeff both glance at him. There's a faint, almost
text: fungus-like green growing on his shirt, an infantile version
text: of the vine covering the hillside all around them. It's on
text: all of them: their shirts, their pants, their shoes.
text: Before any of them can respond to this development, Amy
text: starts to CALL from the clearing, sounding SCARED:
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: Jeff...?
text: They all turn toward the flap. Mathias begins to SCREAM.
text: Amy's voice JUMPS in volume:
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: of .I
text: Jeff rises, moves toward the flap.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy is crouched over Mathias, frantically yanking the vines
text: off him. Mathias is struggling impotently to sit up. He
text: continues to SCREAM, staring down at his legs.
text: Jeff emerges-from the tent, hurries to help Amy, both of them
text: tearing at the vine, a flash of white appearing beneath the
text: green, shiny and bright: bones. Mathias's legs have been
text: stripped completely clean of flesh from the knee down.
text: As they keep pulling the tendrils free, blood starts to drip
text: from Mathias's knees, slowly at first, but then suddenly
text: spurting, spraying them: their chests, their faces. Amy
text: jerks backward, GAGGING, RETCHING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
text: She jumps up, takes three steps into the center of the
text: clearing, and VOMITS, her hands on her knees. She wipes at
text: the blood on her face, COUGHS, spits, then bends again,
text: another long ribbon of puke slipping free of her.
text: Mathias continues to SCREAM and thrash. Jeff reaches for the
text: belts, lying in the dirt beside the backboard. He quickly
text: ties first one then another around Mathias's legs, twisting
text: them into tourniquets, cutting off the flow of blood.
text: Stacy and Eric stoop out through the tent's flap: they stand
text: there staring, struggling to grasp what's happened. Stacy is
text: in her underwear and T-shirt, blood still seeping down her
text: leg. Amy turns to face them.
text: Mathias is WEEPING now, his eyes shut. The hemorrhaging has
text: stopped; blood lies in puddles across the backboard. Jeff is
text: covered with it. And then there are the bones: so white, so
text: wet-looking, from the knees down, nothing but bone.
text: Suddenly, Stacy starts to SCREAM, pointing past Amy, at the
text: dirt beyond her. They all turn to look.
text: The vine is in motion, a long tendril slipping into the
text: clearing, moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at
text: Amy's feet. Amy backs quickly away.
text: A second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around
text: the clearing, then a third. They move rapidly, as if racing
text: each other; both of them slipping alongside the first into
text: the little pool of vomit.
text: The tendrils absorb the puke, draining it, until all that's
text: left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil. Then they withdraw
text: back across the clearing, silently retreating into the larger
text: mass of green. Stacy keeps SCREAMING.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: Faintly, from up the hill, WE HEAR Stacy's screams. The
text: Mayans are finishing their morning meal. They eat in
text: silence, showing no reaction to the sound. In the clearing,
text: the young Mayan's corpse is buried beneath a thick growth of
dialog: vine.
scene_heading: EXT.. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: The four of them are sitting by the orange tent. Jeff and
text: Amy are still spattered and smeared with Mathias's blood;
text: Stacy is still in her underwear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: e.-
text: Jeff is inventorying their food and water. The others watch
text: as he puts the perishables in a separate pile: two bananas,
text: a plastic bag ofgrapes going brown, an orange, a soggy tuna
dialog: fish sandwich.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They must've dug it up.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Who?
text: He arranges the rest of the food in a second pile: a bag of
text: pretzels, a can of nuts, two protein bars, a box of raisins.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The miners.
text: He puts the liquids in a third pile: three bottles of water,
text: two of iced tea, a can of Coke. That's all there is.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: And then the Mayans cleared the
dialog: jungle around the hill, I guess.
dialog: To keep it quarantined. That's why
dialog: they won't let us leave, don't you
dialog: think? They're afraid we'll spread
dialog: it?
text: The others are silent. Jeff reaches for the tuna fish
text: sandwich. He carefully unwraps it.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Or else...I don't know. Maybe it's
dialog: something religious? And we're
dialog: some sort of sacrifice?
text: He glances at the others, but once again no one responds.
text: They all look dazed: knocked back into themselves. Jeff
text: picks up the knife, wipes it on his jeans.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: They must've done the same thing
dialog: with the archaeologists. And
dialog: Henrich. Trapped them here. Like
dialog: us.
text: He cuts the sandwich into four equal sections.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: And then somehow it killed them
text: off. All of them. one by one.
text: This is too much for Eric; he.leaps up, looking panicky.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: J011
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We have to find the phone. We have
dialog: to go back down and--
text: Jeff makes a calming motion.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll eat first. Drink some water.
dialog: We have to stay calm. Not rush at
dialog: things.
text: He holds out one of the tiny squares of sandwich. Eric
text: hesitates, then accepts it, dropping back into a crouch.
text: Jeff hands Amy her square.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What about Mathias?
text: She nods toward him, and they all turn to look. From his
text: knees down, Mathias's legs are nothing but bone, tendon, and
text: ropy clots of blackened blood. His face looks gray. His
text: eyes are shut, and his breathing sounds terribly RAGGED.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He wouldn't be able to stomach it.
text: Jeff offers Stacy her ration. She takes it, but almost
text: absentmindedly. She seems distracted; she keeps prodding at
text: her wound with her fingertip.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Stop it, Stacy.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's still in there. I can feel
dialog: it.
text: She keeps probing. Jeff shakes his head, a little it' ATIENT:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I told you. I got it out.
text: Jeff pops his square of sandwich into his mouth; Eric and Amy
text: eat theirs, too. Stacy's ration remains in her hand; she
text: seems to have forgotten it. She's sunburned, sweat-stained,
text: glassy-eyed. Eric leans toward her, looking worried.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Eat, Stacy. You have to eat.
text: She places the tiny sandwich into her mouth, chews, swallows,
text: staring at her wound the whole time. Then:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: See? How puffy it is?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's just swelling. It's
dialog: natural.
dialog: (he turns toward Jeff)
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: It's what happens when you get
dialog: hurt.
text: Jeff picks up one of the water bottles, twists off its-cap.
text: He offers the bottle to Stacy.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
text: one swallow apiece.
text: The bottle makes its way around their little circle. When it
text: returns to Jeff, he takes his sip, caps the bottle. Eric is
text: watching Stacy, her anxious probing; he looks increasingly
text: distressed by it. He jumps up again.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The phone. Let's find the phone.
text: Jeff doesn't move. Stacy's bloodied khakis. are lying in the
text: dirt beside him, and he reaches for them, starts to cut off
text: their legs with the knife, just above the knee.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We need to take care of Mathias,
dialog: first. He won't last much longer
dialog: like that.
text: Amy looks appalled; she makes a shushing motion.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Shh.
text: They all glance toward Mathias again. He lies there, eyes
text: shut, breathing in and out with that fluid-filled RASP. He
text: seems to be unconscious, but Jeff still LOWERS his voice:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We have to cut them off.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Cut what off?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: His legs.
text: He's finished with Stacy's khakis; they've been transformed
text: into a pair of shorts. He tosses them toward her. Eric and
text: Amy are staring at him, shocked into silence. Then:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He'll die if we don't.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Without anaesthesia?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: There won't be any pain. He has no
text: feeling beneath his waist.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: He'll lose too much blood.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: The tourniquets are already in
dialog: place. We'll cut below them.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: With what?
text: Jeff holds up the knife. Eric SCOFFS at the idea:
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: That wouldn't do a thing. You'd
dialog: need a bone saw.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We could break the bones. Then
dialog: cut.
text: Amy is shaking her head; she looks mortified.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, Jeff. No way.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What about infection? Cutting into
dialog: him with a dirty knife?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll sterilize it. Build a fire.
text: Heat the blade in the flames.
text: It'll cauterize as it cuts.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
dialog: A
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You'll kill him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Or save him. One or the other. We
dialog: can't just--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Cut me first. Right here.
text: Stacy has stood up, pulled on the shorts Jeff has fashioned
text: for her. She's bent over, pointing at a spot on her leg, a
text: few inches below the last incision.
speaker_heading: STACY (cent'd)
dialog: Sterilize the knife and--
text: Eric steps toward her, tries to soothe her.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There's nothing there, Stacy. It's
speaker_heading: JUST--
text: She hardly seems to hear him. She's frightened, growing a
text: little wild with it. Her voice comes FAST AND HIGH:
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's moving. I can feel it moving.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're imagining it. You're
dialog: scared, and you--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I gotta get out of here. I gotta
dialog: get to a hospital. I gotta--
text: Eric takes her hand, squeezing it. Stacy blinks at him,
text: close to tears.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You have to calm down. Can you do
dialog: that? Can you try to calm down?
text: Stacy pulls free of him, drops into a crouch, hugging her
text: knees to her chest, her eyes shut.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: See if there's a signal.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: A what?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Your phone. Check your phone.
text: Eric doesn't move: he knows there's no point.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Check it.
text: Eric SIGHS, steps to his pack, crouches to remove his phone.
text: He flips it open, holds it out to Stacy. She stares down at
text: it: there's no signal. Eric drops it back into his pack.
text: Then he turns to Jeff.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: We go back down. We find the other
dialog: phone. We call for help. That's
dialog: how we get out of here. That's how
dialog: we save him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It'11 take too long.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: One call, Jeff. They'll be here by
dialog: sundown.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And Mathias will already be dying.
dialog: You understand? There's no flesh
dialog: covering his bones. They're--
text: Mathias's voice interrupts him, from the backboard. Very
text: HOARSE, barely audible:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Do...it...
text: They all turn, stare toward him. His eyes are open.
speaker_heading: MATHIAS (cont'd)
dialog: Please...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Cut... them... off...
text: He slowly, painfully, extends his left hand toward them, a
text: beseeching gesture.
scene_heading: CU - SMALL PILE OF CLOTHES
text: A pair of shorts, a woman's blouse, two black socks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: I'll have to break the bones first.
text: An amber liquid is being poured onto the clothes, very
text: slowly. WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Eric is crouched, dribbling the tequila onto the clothes,
text: pausing to let it soak in, saturating the fabric. Jeff is
text: kneeling by the backboard, talking to Mathias.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: With the stone. Then I'll use the
dialog: knife to cut.
text: A large stone sits beside the pile of clothes, shaped like an
text: ax head. There's the knife, too, and the metal canteen from
text: the orange tent.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We'll heat the canteen, and
dialog: cauterize the wounds with it. To
dialog: stop the bleeding.
text: Eric strikes a match: the clothes catch instantly, burning
text: with a low blue flame. He sets the knife in the fire, then
text: the stone, and splashes more tequila on them. The girls
text: stand in the center of the clearing, watching.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You shouldn't be able to feel a
dialog: thing. But you can bite this if
dialog: you want. Just in case.
text: He holds up one of the belts. Mathias hesitates, then opens
text: his mouth, and Jeff sets it carefully inside. Mathias clamps
text: down, gripping it between his teeth. Jeff glances at Eric.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Ready?
text: Eric nods.- The stone is making a cracking sound in the fire,
text: glowing a.deep red. Jeff turns back to Mathias.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You?
text: Mathias also nods, shutting his eyes. There's a small towel
text: in the dirt beside Jeff, and he. picks it up, wrapping it
text: around his hand. He looks over his shoulder at the girls.
text: They both seem terrified, shaky with it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You should wait in the tent.
text: Amy starts to shake her head, but then Stacy is in motion,
text: grabbing her hand, pulling her across the clearing, and she
dialog: lets herself be led.
text: Jeff watches them vanish through the flap, then reaches
text: toward the fire with his towel-swathed hand. He scoops up
text: the stone, raises it over his head, SLAMS it down with all
text: his strength against the exposed bones of Mathias's left leg.
text: Mathias bucks, GROANING; his eyes jump open. Jeff drops the
text: stone back into the fire,. snatches out the knife. Mathias is
text: trying to rise onto his elbow, straining to see what's
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Hold him.
text: Eric sets the canteen into the flames, sloshes some tequila
text: on it, then shifts.to the backboard. He presses down on
text: Mathias''s shoulders. Mathias is WHIMPERING, twisting his
text: head back and forth, gripping the belt tightly in his teeth.
text: Jeff starts to saw with the knife, chopping and cutting the
text: splintered bones. Bloody marrow spills wetly out, and then
text: Mathias's.lower leg comes free of his body, the foot and
text: ankle and shin bones completely separate now.
text: Jeff lifts the bones away, drops them into the dirt beside
text: the backboard. Then he turns, uses the towel to pluck the
text: canteen out of the fire: it, too, is glowing red.
text: He presses the canteen flat against Mathias's stump, the
text: flesh SIZZLING and SPITTING. Mathias bucks even more
text: forcefully; he spits out the belt, CRIES OUT:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS
dialog: Stop...stop...
text: Jeff ignores him, dropping the canteen back into the fire,
text: lifting out the stone. Eric looks increasingly mortified; he
text: seems close to tears.
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: JEFF--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Reep him still.
text: He turns, SMASHES the stone into Mathias's right leg.
text: Mathias begins to SCREAM, bucking against Eric's grip.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY
text: Mathias's SCREAMS fill the tent. Amy and Stacy are sitting
text: together, clutching each other; Stacy is CRYING. Amy is
text: staring toward the flap with a look of horror.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Jeff saws and chops at the shattered bones with the knife.
text: Mathias continues'to SCREAM. Eric is using all his weight to
text: hold him still, his head averted, his eyes clenched shut.
text: Jeff lifts the severed bones.away from the backboard, drops
text: them at his side. Then he scoops up the canteen again. As
text: he presses it to Mathias's stump, Mathias finally passes out,
text: his body going slack, his screams falling SILENT.
text: For a long beat, there's just the SPITTING, SNAPPING sound of
text: Mathias's flesh being seared. Then Eric pulls back into a
text: crouch, shaking his head, looking utterly depleted.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, Jesus. Jesus Christ.
text: Amy emerges from the tent, then Stacy. They stand staring.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He felt it, didn't he? The whole
dialog: thing.
text: Jeff lifts the canteen away.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He couldn't have.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: He was screaming. Be was telling
dialog: you to stop.
speaker_heading: JEPF
dialog: It was just seeing it. Looking
dialog: down, and--
text: Amy is shaking her head, staring at Mathias with that
text: appalled expression: his slack face, his burned stumps.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: This is bad, Jeff. So bad.
text: Jeff leans to loosen first one tourniquet, then the other.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We've bought him some time. He
dialog: wouldn't have--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You cut off his legs! You--
text: Stacy SCREAMS, pointing toward Mathias's amputated limbs.
text: They're lying in the dirt at the base of the backboard, the
text: bloodstained bones held together with a few remaining cords
text: of flesh. A vine has come snaking into the clearing: it's
text: wrapping itself around one of the feet.
text: As the tendril begins to drag. the bones away, a.second one
text: slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot.
text: Eric grabs the knife, jumps up, steps on the first tendril,
text: bends to slash at it with the blade. He swoops toward the
text: second one. Even as he does so, though, a third tendril
text: slithers into the clearing, then a fourth.
text: Stacy SCREAMS again, short and loud, and backs toward the
text: tent; Eric bends and slashes, bends and slashes, and the'vine
text: keeps coming, from all directions, reaching for the bones.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Leave it.
text: Eric ignores him, cutting and stomping and tearing at the
text: tendrils, faster and faster, but still too slow, the vine
text: fighting back, wrapping itself around his legs.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Eric.
text: He steps toward him, grabs his arm, pulls him away. They
text: stand side by side, watching as the vine pulls the severed
text: limbs into itself, the white of the bones vanishing into the
text: larger mass of green. Stacy has begun to CRY again.
text: There's a beat of stillness, and then, once more, echoing up
text: toward them from the shaft, comes that faint electronic
text: RINGING of the cell phone.
scene_heading: CU - THE WINDLASS
text: Spinning, the rope spooling quickly off the barrel.
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know how long it'11 burn--
text: WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Eric is pulling the rope off the windlass, laying it out in a
text: long zigzag across the clearing. Jeff is crouched by the
text: shaft, making a torch. The girls stand over him, watching.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So you'll have to be quick.
text: He has one of the aluminum poles from the blue tent. He's
text: wrapped duct tape around its bottom for a grip, tied some of
text: the archaeologists' clothes around the top. He's dribbling
text: tequila on the knot of fabric, saturating it.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Wait to light it till you're both
dialog: down there. Then--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Who?
text: Jeff looks up at her, startled by the question. Eric is
text: moving along the length of rope, bent low, checking its hemp
dialog: for signs of weakness.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Who what?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Who's going?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You and Amy.
text: They all look bad, but Stacy looks the worst: her wounded
text: leg,, -her greasy hair, a panicky edge to every gesture. She
text: shakes her head, with vehemence.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: No, Jeff. No way. Not me.
text: Jeff caps the tequila bottle, gives Stacy a tired look.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We've already been through this.
dialog: Eric and I need to work the winch.
dialog: You're not strong enough.
text: Eric has reached the end of the rope; he stands up, wiping
text: his hands on his pants.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: It's clear.
text: He moves to the windlass, starts to wind the rope back onto
text: the barrel. They've tied a sling on the rope's end again.
text: Stacy is pressing her right hand against the bottom of her
text: rib cage: massaging, probing
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Why can't Amy go on her own?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The torch won't last that long. We
dialog: need you both there, searching.
text: Stacy starts shaking her head again, TERRIFIED:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'm not going. I can't.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don't have a choice, Stacy.
text: Amy can see where this is headed; she tries to divert it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's okay. I'll go alone.
text: Jeff ignores this. He rises to his feet, still focused on
text: Stacy. WE can HEAR his growing anger in his voice:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: if we don't find the phone, Mathias
dialog: will die. Understand?
text: Stacy is silent, hugging herself, staring at the ground.
text: Eric has finished winding the rope onto the windlass. He
dialog: tries to intervene:
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: JEFF--
text: Jeff ignores him, his gaze on Stacy.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So that's what you're saying. Just
dialog: to be clear. That you're not
dialog: willing to help him live.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Come on, man. She's too scared.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't give a fuck. I'm scared,
dialog: too. We all are.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: it was inside her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And we got it out. Now she needs
dialog: to stop being such a fucking baby,
dialog: stop being so selfish, and--
text: Eric is stepping toward him suddenly, right up against him,
text: forcing him back a step.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: ,hut Up. Okay?
text: He's bigger than Jeff, stronger, and this is suddenly very
text: palpable. Their faces are three inches apart. A tense beat,
text: and then, more QUIETLY:
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: You're being too hard.
text: Jeff gives him a look of incredulity, almost disgust.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hard?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Just leave her be.
text: Jeff turns away from him, from all three of them. He stares
text: off across the hill for a beat, then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm the only one thinking. I'm
dialog: carrying the whole fucking load.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So stop. Lay it down.
text: Jeff turns back to him, gives him a look of pure contempt; WE
text: can HEAR his fury rising again as he speaks:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This isn't just going to work out
dialog: on its own, Eric. You know?
dialog: Magically?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm not saying--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We could end up dead here. All of
dialog: us. Is that what you want?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Then get the fuck out of my way,
dialog: and start helping me.
text: He holds Eric's eyes long enough to confirm that Eric isn't
text: going to protest, then he glances past him at Stacy.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You going or not?
text: Stacy-is still staring at the ground, her hand probing at her
text: chest. It's clear she doesn't want to go, but Jeff has
text: shamed her into silence. Amy reaches, touches her arm.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: .'-11 be right there. Okay? We'll
dialog: be together the whole time.
text: A long beat, then Stacy manages a nod. It's enough for Jeff;
text: he pushes past Eric, moving toward the windlass.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Get in the sling, Amy.
text: Amy turns, reaching for the sling.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - DAY
text: A faint fall of light from above. There's the CREAKING of
text: the windlass: Amy is dropping slowly toward us. When her
text: feet touch the bottom of the shaft, she scrambles out of the
text: sling. Then she lifts her head, SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Pull it up!
text: The CREAKING resumes. She stands there in the dimness,
text: watching the sling rise away from her. She has the makeshift
text: torch in one hand, the box of matches in the other.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING
text: Eric is helping Stacy into the sling, pulling it over her
text: head; Stacy's hands are shaking badly. Eric hugs her, trying
text: to calm her. Jeff waits beside the hand crank.
text: THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
text: Amy is in a crouch. She keeps glancing toward the stone arch
text: cut into the shaft's wall, and the passageway beyond it: the
text: vine dangles from.the low ceiling, like streamers at a party.
text: The CREAKING resumes, and Amy looks up.
scene_heading: AMY'S POV - ABOVE HER
text: Stacy is dropping slowly toward us.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Amy glances toward the arch again. A slight draft blows
text: steadily from it, and the vine shifts and trembles in it. A
text: beat, then the RINGING starts up once more. It's coming from
text: within the shadowed passageway.
text: Amy opens the box of matches, plucks one out. She's too
text: jumpy, though; her hands are-trembling so much that she
text: shakes the match out as soon as it's lit.
text: There's a second RING. Stacy has nearly reached us.
text: Amy digs another match from the box. Stacy's feet touch the
text: bottom of the shaft; she yanks off the sling. There's a
dialog: third RING.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Hurry.
text: Amy strikes the match, holds it to the knot of clothing at
text: the end of the aluminum pole. The alcohol catches with a
text: FLUTTERING sound, a cloud of pale blue fire materializing
text: around the torch. Amy lifts it, and they start into:
scene_heading: THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE
text: Stacy is in front, with Amy right behind her. The torch
text: shudders weakly in the steady draft; the shaft's ceiling is
text: low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward.
text: There's a fourth RING, drawing them deeper down the passage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: The tendrils hanging from the ceiling brush against them.
text: The vine is growing on the floor, too--knee-deep--and from
text: the walls on either side. Amy is moving cautiously,
text: squinting into the darkness, and Stacy starts to pull ahead.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Wait...
text: She pauses, lifting the torch, but Stacy keeps going. Amy
text: peers at the vine hanging from the wall. There's a fifth
text: RING, echoing eerily, and the flowers move in exact unison
text: with the sound, their stamens vibrating, like so many
text: miniature tuning forks: the plant is making the noise.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Stacy...
text: The shaft dead-ends at a blank wall, which is just
text: materializing out of the darkness, fifteen feet in front of
text: them. There's a sixth RING. Stacy points at the wall,
text: quickening her pace.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It's right here. I can--
text: Amy jumps forward, reaching for her.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: DON'T--
text: But there's another RING, and Stacy keeps going: she's
text: nearly at the wall.
speaker_heading: STACY
speaker_heading: IT'S--
dialog: Stop!
text: Amy grabs her arm, hard, jerks her back a step, pulling her
text: close, the torchlight flickering over them. She WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
text: There's no phone.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What?
text: A seventh RING sounds, seeming to come from beneath the vines
text: on the floor of the shaft, directly in front of them. Stacy
text: tries to pull free, to bend and reach toward the sound.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: I can--
text: Amy jerks her back again, WHISPERS straight into her ear:
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: It's the vine. The flowers.
text: They're making the noise.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: No. It's--
text: She pulls free, steps forward, and her foot seems to punch
text: straight through the shaft's floor. She SCREAMS, losing her
text: balances Amy throws down the torch, lunges for her. The
text: torch flutters, pales, but remains lit.
text: The vines growing across the floor fall away, revealing an
text: opening, another shaft, dropping into the earth. Stacy is
text: slowly sliding into it, scrambling to stop herself.
text: Amy grabs Stacy arm. Stacy is dangling, from the waist down,
text: over the hole's edge. There are vines in the hole, too, and.
text: they begin to coil around her legs, pulling at her, dragging
text: her downward.
text: Stacy SCREAMS again, kicking to free herself, scrambling
text: upward, monkey-like, while Amy pulls at her, and finally they
text: manage to drag her to safety.
text: A beat, then Amy retrieves the torch, holds it out over the
text: hole. The bottom is twenty feet down, almost lost in shadow.
text: Dimly, WE SEE a woman, lying curled against the wall--she has
text: long dark hair.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh my God.
text: The woman stirs, her body rolling, as if to turn and look at
text: us, and WE SEE her face: she's a corpse. The vine has
text: invaded her flesh--it's in her eye sockets, the hollow of her
text: mouth, writhing and churning. Stacy and Amy SCREAM.
text: There's a WHISTLING sound, like a whip, and a tendril lashes
text: out from the shaft's wall, wraps itself around the torch's
text: handle, yanks it from Amy's grip. The torch falls into the
text: hole, still burning. When it hits bottom, a mass of vine
text: surges across it, smothering its flame.
text: It's very dark after this: Amy and Stacy are barely
text: discernible. A beat of silence, then an odd, high-pitched
text: CACKLING rises all around them; it sounds like laughter--
text: eerie, childlike, full of echoes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
text: As it steadily increases in volume, that WHISTLING comes once
text: more: the vines SMACK at them from the floor, the ceiling,
text: the walls, coiling around their bodies, pulling them toward
text: the open shaft.
text: They both SCREAM again, scrambling backward, while the vine
text: keeps coming, more and more of it, grabbing at their arms,
text: their legs, their necks. They stumble over each other,
text: falling onto their hands and knees.amid the.tendrils.
text: The vine catches at them, tries to hold them down. It's not
text: strong enough, though; they yank it off, and thrash their
text: way, foot by foot, back toward the sling, the vine lashing at
text: them, grabbing, tearing, sap leaking onto their skin. The
text: laughter grows still louder, the whole shaft ECHOING with it.
text: Amy reaches the sling first, with Stacy right behind her.
text: Even here, the vine continues to attack them, whipping and
text: HISSING and LAUGHING. Amy holds the sling toward Stacy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You.
text: But Stacy is too hysterical: she just stands there, SOBBING,
text: SCREAMING. Jeff's voice comes toward them from above,
speaker_heading: SHOUTING:
speaker_heading: JEFF (0.S.)
dialog: Amoy...?
text: Amy pulls the sling over her own head. YELLS:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Pull us up!
speaker_heading: JEFF (O.S.)
dialog: Did you find it?
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: NMI
text: She reaches out, grabs Stacy, wrapping her arms and legs
text: around her. Stacy returns the embrace, both of them
text: clutching at each other, as the windlass finally begins to
text: CREAK, lifting the two of them into the air.
scene_heading: ON AMY AND STACY - IN THE SLING
text: The vines hanging from the shaft's walls whip at the girls as
text: they rise, coiling around their bodies, pulling at them, that
text: strange LAUGHTER growing ever louder, seeming to buffet their
text: bodies. Stacy and Amy grip each other with all their
text: strength, eyes shut tight. Stacy SCREAMS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OP. THE HILL - DAY
text: The SCREAM comes faintly toward us. The Mayans are arrayed
text: about their campsite, all of them motionless, silent, staring
text: up the hill with their impassive expressions.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK
text: The weather has shifted; a wind has risen. The sun is
text: setting, a red smudge behind a dark gray wall of clouds.
text: Mathias lies.on his backboard, unconscious, his breathing
text: coming in that ragged RASP, a thread of brown liquid leaking
text: from the corner of his mouth. Amy is crouched beside him;
text: she leans forward, wipes away the liquid.
text: Stacy sits in the clearing behind her, leaning against Eric.
text: They're both slick with sweat, but Stacy keeps shivering, as
text: if cold. Eric's arms are around her, and her eyes are shut.
text: Jeff is peeling the orange. Like Amy, he's still spattered
text: and stained with Mathias's blood. The vine has continued to
text: grow on everyone's clothes, weblike, eating away at the
text: fabric. Jeff reaches, tugs free a strand of it, and a six-
text: inch tear appears in his T-shirt.
text: Stacy opens her eyes; she leans forward, peers down at the
text: wounds on her leg, her right hand moving to her chest,
text: probing at her rib cage. She turns to Eric:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Check your phone.
text: Eric pushes himself to his feet, steps toward his pack. He
text: pulls out his phone, flips it open. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Let me see.
text: Eric carries the phone to her, then stands over her while she
text: opens it, stares down at it. She shuts it, opens it again.
text: Then again, and again, and suddenly she's CRYING, bent into
text: herself. Eric drops to a crouch, rests his hand on her knee.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Shh.
text: But her crying increases; she begins to SOB. Jeff is bent'
text: over the orange, dividing it into four equal piles--its peel,
text: too--concentrating. He lifts his head, stares. Amy stands
text: up, hurries over., kneels in front of Stacy, takes her hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's okay, sweetie. You're okay.
text: Stacy keeps WEEPING, uncontrollably, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I wanner go home. I wanna leave...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Shh...
text: She's WAILING, rocking back and forth; she can't seem to
text: stop. Amy struggles to calm her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stacy...
text: Stacy keeps WAILING, rocking, eyes shut. Amy leans in close.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Let's play the game...can you do
dialog: that? Huh? Can you give me a
dialog: "So"?
text: Stacy continues to CRY.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Come on. Just try. Can you try?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So there was this girl who wanted
dialog: to be a pilot.
text: Stacy's tears keep coming. Amy looks at Eric, gives him a
text: nod,'prodding him into speech. He hesitates, then:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But she was scared of heights.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So she became a lifeguard instead.
text: (she squeezes Stacy's
speaker_heading: HAND)
dialog: Come on. Your turn.
text: More SOBS. Amy glances across the clearing at Jeff, wanting
text: him to join in, too. It seems as if he might refuse, but
text: then her look hardens, and he relents.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But she couldn't swim.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: So she wore a life vest.
text: (she squeezes Stacy's hand
speaker_heading: AGAIN)
dialog: Come on. Now you.
text: A beat, then Stacy takes a deep, ragged breath. She wipes at
text: her face, struggles for words.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: But everyone...
text: She trails off, CRYING again. Amy nods, encouraging her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah...? Everyone what?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: They laughed at her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Good. That's good. So she--
text: Very suddenly, it starts to rain--a dozen large, heavy drops.
text: They all glance skyward.
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: SHITÂ¢
text: He springs to his feet. And then: a downpour, a deluge, as
text: if a trap door has swung open in the clouds. The rain falls
text: in a loud, drumming rush, turning the clearing to mud.
text: Eric jumps up, too. He and Jeff start digging through the
text: backpacks from the. blue tent, searching for something--
text: anything--in which to catch the water. They find a small
text: plastic bag, a nylon toiletry kit, a Frisbee. Jeff sets
text: these in a row on the ground, open to the rain.
text: Eric rushes to the orange tent, vanishes inside. Amy tilts
text: back her head, tries to catch the rain in her open mouth.
text: Stacy just sits there, hugging herself, shivering, still half-
text: crying. They're all drenched, back-spattered with mud.
text: And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the rain starts to
text: slacken. Eric reemerges from the orange tent, carrying a
text: thermos, a plastic cup. He sets them next to the other
text: containers, but it's pointless; the rain is already stopping.
text: They all stare at these meager receptacles: they've managed
text: to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water. Jeff.
text: GROANS; he's FURIOUS with himself:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We should've been ready. We
speaker_heading: SHOULD'VE-
text: He kicks the Frisbee across the clearing. Amy jumps up.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: JEFFT
text: She steps forward, as if to guard the other containers.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It doesn't fucking matter.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: There was water in it.
text: He spins toward her, turning his fury with himself on her:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How much, Amy? Two and a half
dialog: gallons? 'Cause that's what we
dialog: need. For today--just to make it
dialog: through today. And then tomorrow
dialog: the same all over again. And for
dialog: how long? Another week before our
dialog: parents start searching? And then
dialog: what? How long till they track us
dialog: to Coba? Or to this fucking hill?
dialog: How long will it take, Amy?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You said--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It's not gonna happen. We're not
dialog: gonna make it.
text: The others stare at him in astonishment, too 'stunned to
text: speak. He gives them all a look of disgust:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: And you're fucking playing games.
dialog: (mimicking Amy's voice)
dialog: So there were these people trapped
text: in the jungle.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Don't, Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But they didn't have any water.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: Amy looks as if she might start crying.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Please, don't.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So they're gonna die of thirst.
text: Amy covers her ears with her hands.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But this fucking vine might kill
dialog: them first.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: STOP IT!
text: Jeff paces away, struggling to regain control of himself. A
text: long beat, and then, very QUIETLY:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm sorry ...I'm sorry.
text: He steps back toward the dismembered orange, crouches over
text: it. The fruit and peels are muddy now, spoiled looking. He
text: waves for the others to approach.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Come on. We need to eat.
text: No one moves. They're all staring at him with their shocked
text: expressions. He can't seem to meet their eyes. He gestures
text: at the orange again.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: The peel, too. Everything.
text: Abeat, then the others step forward to claim their portions:
text: first Eric, then Stacy, then Amy. They eat without speaking.
text: Finally, almost AS IF TALKING TO HIMSELF:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It'll rain again. It has to. And
dialog: we'll figure out a way to catch it.
dialog: (he nods to himself)
dialog: We'll be fine. We'll ration the
dialog: -food. And then, you know, we'll
dialog: just...we'll tough it out..
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: People have survived for weeks with
dialog: nothing. Just water, a little bit
dialog: of water. So why not us?
text: No one responds. They continue to eat: the fruit, the
text: peels. Their torn clothes cling wetly to them. Jeff uncaps
text: the water bottle, offers it to Amy. She drinks, passes it
text: on. It moves around the circle, back to Jeff.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What about the vine?
text: Jeff takes his sip, caps the bottle. He's reclaiming
text: himself, his voice strengthening, his confidence returning.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I don't think it can hurt us. Not
dialog: directly. if it could, it already
dialog: would've, wouldn't it? Why would
dialog: it wait?
text: The others are silent, considering this. Then:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It's not strong enough to overpower
dialog: us. And it--
text: Mathias GASPS suddenly, his entire body spasming for a
text: moment, before the watery RASP of his breathing resumes. He
text: doesn't regain consciousness; his eyes remain shut. Everyone
text: watches him for a beat: he, also, is spattered with mud.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He's gonna die, isn't he? if
dialog: there's no phone, then there's no--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Me, too.
text: They all turn to look at her. She's massaging that spot on
text: her rib cage again, digging into it with her fingers.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: It's eating me. Just like him.
dialog: And her.
text: She waves toward the shaft. Jeff gives her a weary look.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don't, Stacy. Don't start.
text: She jumps up, begins to pace, agitated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's inside me. In my leg. My
dialog: chest. I can feel it. Right here..
text: She stops pacing, lifts her shirt. She points to the base of
text: her rib cage.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: See?
text: Jeff stares; there's nothing there. He shakes his head. The
text: knife is lying in the mud beside him, and Stacy steps
text: forward, snatches it up. Jeff reaches to stop her, but he's
text: too slow. She stands before him, hefting it. in her hand.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Put it down.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'll show you.
text: She lifts her.shirt again, pressing at her rib cage with her
text: .fingertips. Jeff stands up, holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Give it to me. Right now.
text: Amy and Eric stand, too.
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: STACY--
text: But she's already cutting: a four inch slit along the base
text: of her rib cage. Amy SCREAMS. A horizontal line of blood
text: crests the wound, sweeps down across Stacy's stomach, soaking
text: into the waistband of her shorts. She watches it, frowning.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I thought it would just come
text: tumbling out.
text: She probes at the cut with the point of the knife, prying it
text: farther open, the bleeding increasing. Jeff reaches, grabs
text: the knife from her. He looks furious:
speaker_heading: JEFF .
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It's hiding. It's right--
text: She pokes her finger into the wound, digging. Jeff slaps her
text: hand away. He YELLS:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: a il hï¿½ f down i
text: He shoves her down, onto her back, then picks up the towel
text: he'd used to hold the heated stone. He balls it up, presses
text: it to Stacy's wound. Eric retrieves the bottle of tequila
text: from the mud, uncaps it. He crouches beside Stacy.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Don't yell. she's just scared.
speaker_heading: SHE'S--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: what're you doing?
text: He's lifting the bottle toward Stacy's mouth, but he
text: hesitates now, turning toward Jeff.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Just a sip. To calm her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It'll dehydrate-her.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: A sip, Jeff.
text: He starts to lift the bottle again. Jeff shoves it aside.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I said Q.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Leave him alone.
text: She tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes her back down, hard.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You realize how stupid you're
dialog: being? Sticking that dirty knife
dialog: INTO--
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's growing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: of ina's.inside you. You're
dialog: imagining it, and you just--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'm gonna end up like her. That
dialog: girl. I'm gonna--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
dialog: r -
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Get infected. Understand? You're
dialog: gonna get yourself killed.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You're not listening.
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: BECAUSE--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (shouting, very loud)
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
text: A beat of startled silence, and then her voice comes again,
text: from across the hilltop, sounding exactly like her, only
text: slightly fuzzed, a rasping quality just beneath the words:
speaker_heading: STACY'S VOICE
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
text: They all turn to look, but there's nothing there, just the
text: vine, its green leaves, its bright red flowers. Stacy's
text: voice comes once more, from the.opposite direction now:
speaker_heading: STACY'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What the--
text: Stacy's voice keeps coming, switching locations, seeming to
text: float across the hilltop; they turn, tracking it.
speaker_heading: STACY'S VOICE
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE
dialog: NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT
dialog: LISTENING...!
text: Amy steps toward Jeff, looking frightened.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The Mayans.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: No--it's the vine. It's mimicking
dialog: her.
text: Stacy has started to CRY; she covers her ears with her hands.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Make it stop.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: STACY'S VOICE
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE
dialog: NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT
dialog: LISTENING...!
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Please. Make it stop.
speaker_heading: STACY'S VOICE
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE
dialog: NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT
dialog: LISTENING...!
text: Stacy tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes her back down. Se's
text: still crouched over her, pressing the towel to her wound;
text: it's completely soaked through with blood now. Stacy YELLS:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Shut up...!
text: Stacy's voice continues, but now that high-pitched LAUGHTER
text: is coming, too, a chorus of it, growing in volume:
speaker_heading: STACY'S VOICE
dialog: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE
dialog: NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT
dialog: LISTENING...!
text: Stacy's weeping has deepened to SOBS. She keeps YELLING:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Shut up...! Shut up...!
text: The LAUGHTER grows steadily LOUDER, obscuring Stacy's voice:
text: WE SEE the flowers trembling, visibly vibrating as they
dialog: sculpt the sound...
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DUSK
text: The light is fading fast. One of the Mayan women is cleaning
text: a pot with a handful of leaves. Three of the men sit facing
text: the hillside, their bows in their laps. The others are
text: bedding down beneath the trees.
text: The LAUGHTER echoes down the hill, eerie and ghoulish, yet
text: the Mayans betray no reaction to it, as if it were no more
text: worthy of note to them than the steady RASPING of the locusts
text: in the jungle at their backs.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT
text: Jeff, Stacy and Amy lie side-by-side in the darkness. The
text: liquid RATTLE of Mathias's breathing comes from the clearing,
text: sounding as if someone were sawing at a tin can.
text: Jeff and Stacy are asleep; Amy is stirring restlessly,
text: shifting first onto one side, then the other. Finally, she
text: rises, moves toward the flap, slips quietly through it.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT
text: The moon is out, dropping its faint light upon us. Mathias
text: is on his backboard beneath the little lean-to, more audible
text: than visible, with his PHLEGM-CLOTTED breathing. Eric is
text: beside him. He looks up as Amy emerges from the tent.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Now is he?
text: Eric shrugs, waves toward the backboard: it seems clear
text: enough. Amy stares-for a moment, then sits beside him.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: You can go lie down if you want.
text: Eric lifts his hand, pushes a button on his watch, makes it
text: glow. He squints at it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I still have forty minutes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't mind. I can't sleep.
text: Eric checks his watch again, its glow briefly illuminating
text: his face. He gestures toward the tent.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Is Stacy?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: They both are.
text: There's a slight breeze, and the tent makes a FLAPPING SOUND
text: in it. They both turn to stare at it. Then:
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Do you think it's inside her?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (he shakes his head)
text: Jeff cut it out. I saw him.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: But she says she can feel it.
text: Moving. Shifting about.
text: Eric waves this aside.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You know how Stacy is. She's just
text: scared. She gets things in her
dialog: head, and---
text: Mathias makes a RETCHING sound--loud, wet, painful--and they
text: both turn,â¢peering at his gaunt form through the darkness.
text: He falls QUIET; his eyes don't open. A beat, then:
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: I've been sitting here, you know,
dialog: making all these deals in my head
dialog: with God. You ever do that?
text: Amy just stares at him. He has his arms wrapped around his
text: knees, hugging them to his chest.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: Like I say, okay, you can fire me
dialog: on the first day teaching if that's
dialog: what you want--just let us make it
dialog: home. But that doesn't mean shit,
dialog: 'cause I don't even really want the
dialog: job, and He has to know that,
dialog: doesn't He? So I say, all right,
dialog: Stacy can leave me, you know, or
dialog: even, I don't know, I'll give up a
dialog: finger, okay? Or two fingers. Or
dialog: fuck it, take a hand, take my left
dialog: hand, but let us just get home, all
dialog: of us.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: And then I look at him--
dialog: (he nods toward Mathias)
dialog: --and I can't help it, I'm, like,
dialog: take him if you need to, take
dialog: Mathias, and let the rest of us go.
dialog: That's fucking horrible, isn't it?
dialog: And once I've said it, I feel like
dialog: I can't take it back, you know?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
text: Like the words have gone up into
dialog: the sky and God's sort of thinking
dialog: about them now, making his choice,
dialog: and if Mathias dies and we don't,
dialog: it'll be.like I killed him, won't
dialog: it? Like I--
text: Amy starts to CRY; she covers her mouth with her hand. Eric
text: stares at her in surprise.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: What? What is it?
text: Amy shakes her head. She struggles to stop, but she can't.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm sorry ...I'm so sorry...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: It's my fault.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: what is?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: If I hadn't stepped onto the hill--
text: Her crying INCREASES. Eric leans, touches her hand.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's stupid, Amy. That's--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff said it. He said--
text: Eric reaches, puts his arm around her, trying to quiet her.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: He didn't mean it. There's no way.
dialog: He was just--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We might not have...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Shh. Don't.
text: She rests her head on his shoulder, WEEPING, her body shaking
text: with it, while he pats her, stroking her hair.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT
text: Stacy and Jeff, eyes shut, sleeping. Very SOFTLY, there
text: comes a faint PANTING, rhythmic, furtive sounding. Stacy's
text: eyes open; she lies there, listening.
text: There's a MOAN, and the PANTING QUICKENS. Stacy rises to a
text: sitting position. She listens for another beat, then leans,
text: prods at Jeff. He awakes with a jerk, blinking up at her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Wh--?
text: Stacy holds her finger to her lips, silencing him.. From
text: outside, there's another MOAN. Jeff sits up, listening. The
text: PANTING is BUILDING toward a climax. Jeff leans toward the
text: pile of supplies at the tent's rear, squinting at the tangle
text: of vine growing across it. He points, WHISPERING:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It's the--
text: But Stacy is already pushing herself to her feet. She moves
text: quickly to the tent's flap, UNZIPS it, crouches out into:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Mathias's breathing continues its RAGGED course. Amy is
text: still leaning into Eric, her head on his shoulder. He has
text: his arm around her. He looks up, blinking, as Stacy emerges
text: from the tent into the moonlight.
speaker_heading: . STACY
dialog: What the fuck, Eric?
text: Amy lifts her head, wipes at her face; Eric drops his arm
text: from her shoulder. They both stare at Stacy, startled by her
text: anger. Jeff appears behind her, stepping through the flap.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: We heard you.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Heard me what?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Fucking her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
text: Eric looks from Stacy to Jeff, completely perplexed.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The vine. it made it sound as if
dialog: you two--
text: Stacy turns toward him, SNORTING, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You're so blind.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: I could hear it. At the back of
dialog: the tent. It was--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It doesn't make things up. It
dialog: mimics things. Things it's heard.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Then it's heard someone having sex
dialog: at some point.
text: Slowly, quietly, a tendril has begun to slither forward
text: through the darkness, creeping in beneath the lean-to,
text: snaking toward Mathias, toward his head. Jeff and the others
text: are all too focused on one another to notice.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: That was Ay, Jeff. Moaning.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
text: Jeff reaches, touches Stacy's arm, struggling to calm her,
text: but she flinches from him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: it's doing this on purpose.' Can't
dialog: you see? It thinks you're the
dialog: weakest--because you're hurt. So
dialog: it's trying to upset you. Trying
dialog: TO--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You're not upset? He had his arm
dialog: around her. He--
text: Amy leans forward, hands out, BESEECHING:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Nothing happened, Stacy. I was
dialog: crying. And Eric--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: We he-ar you.
text: The vine starts to push its way in between Mathias's lips,
text: into his mouth. Mathias makes a GAGGING sound, but doesn't
text: regain consciousness: once more, no one notices.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We heard the vine. It--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You're such a fool, Jeff. You
dialog: think she's never cheated on you?
dialog: Perfect little angelic Amy?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stacy.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I could tell you secrets. I could
dialog: open your eyes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shi i up. Right now.
text: A second tendril has slithered under the lean-to. It covers
text: Mathias's nose, drawing itself tight. The steady rasping of
text: his breathing is CUT OFF. Yet again, no one notices.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Spring break? Senior year?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You bitch. You stupid cunt.
text: Stacy spins on her, VENOMOUS:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Fuck you. Slut.
dialog: (back to Jeff)
text: Twice, Jeff. Two different guys.
dialog: And one of them--
text: Jeff grabs her arm, grips it, silencing hers
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Enough, Stacy. Stoll.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
text: Stacy falls SILENT; she seems as astonished by what she's
dialog: said as everyone else.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Where do you think you are? Huh?
dialog: Why would you even care--at this
dialog: point, if they were out here
dialog: fucking? We're trapped. We don't
dialog: have any food. Or water. And
speaker_heading: MATHIAS--
text: He turns, stares: sees. He darts forward, starts to yank
text: away the tendrils. They resist him, writhing, clinging to
text: Mathias's face. Eric and Amy both jump up. Stacy has
text: started to CRY, shaking her head, MORTIFIED:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Oh, god...oh please no...
text: Jeff bends close to Mathias's face, listening; he checks
text: Mathias's neck for a pulse. A beat, then he turns toward the
text: others, shakes his head. Stacy begins to SOB:
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...
text: Eric reaches, takes her into his arms, hugging her.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL -- FROM UP THE HILL - DAWN
text: The hillside falls away from us, the narrow trail winding
text: down its face to the clearing and the wall of jungle beyond.
text: The sun is just rising, and the vine seems to shimmer in it.
text: Three of the Mayan encampments are visible from here: one
text: directly beneath us, one to the left, another to the right.
text: Thin ribbons of smoke rise from their campfires.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - TOP OF THE TRAIL - DAY
text: Jeff stands there, staring down toward the jungle. Eric and
text: Stacy are sitting together in the clearing behind him,
text: holding hands; Stacy is still CRYING softly. Amy approaches
text: across the hilltop, stops beside Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: They must've salted the soil.
dialog: That's the only way I can think.
text: He turns, glances at Amy. She has no idea what he's talking
text: about. He waves down toward the Mayans.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: To keep the ground clear. It grows
dialog: so quickly...
text: He gestures at their clothes, upon which that green webbing
text: of vine continues to spread, eating away at the fabric.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It's old, too--has to be. Really
dialog: old. Because the birds, the
dialog: insects... somehow they've evolved.
dialog: They've learned not to land here.
text: (he peers about them, at
dialog: the vine-covered hill)
dialog: And the horses. Remember? How
dialog: frightened they were? They knew,
dialog: too.
text: They stand in silence for a beat, staring down the hill
text: toward the Mayans. Then Amy reaches, touches Jeff's arm.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It didn't happen.
text: Jeff turns, stares at her. she waves back toward the tent.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Eric and I, we were just---
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And what she said. About spring
dialog: break. I--
text: Jeff reaches, presses his finger to her lips.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shh.
text: Amy falls silent, watching him. He lowers his finger.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Have you made it up with her?
text: Amy half-nods, half-shrugs.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But I want to tell you--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
text: He presses his finger to her lips again, stopping her. He
text: waits a beat, and then:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I wish it mattered.
text: Amy gives him a confused look. Jeff throws out his hand,.
text: gesturing at the hilltop, the vine, their tattered clothes.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Look at us.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Would it matter to you?
text: Amy hesitates, considering. Then she shakes her head. And
text: with that, Jeff turns, starts back toward the orange tent.
text: WE HEAR a zipping sound, which carries over into:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Jeff is crouched beside the backboard, UNZIPPING the sleeping
text: bag. Eric tosses the flimsy lean-to aside, exposing
text: Mathias's corpse-to the sun. Amy and Stacy stand watching.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Head first?
text: Eric considers this, staring down at Mathias's body.
text: Mathias's face is burned red from the vine's sap; his legs
text: are two blackened stumps. Eric shrugs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You'll have to lift him.
text: Eric hesitates; he seems reluctant to touch the corpse.
text: Finally, he girds himself, straddles the backboard, grabs
text: Mathias under his armpits, lifting him. Jeff leans forward,
text: starts to pull the sleeping bag over Mathias's head.
text: The corpse seems intent upon resisting them; its arms keep
text: getting tangled, catching and snagging. Jeff and Eric have
text: to wrestle with it, both of them PANTING, sweating, before
text: they manage to shove it into the bag.
text: Jeff ZIPS the bag shut, and they stand over it, catching
text: their breath, wiping the perspiration from their faces.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Should we say something?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
text: Jeff gives him a blank stare.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: Like, you know ...a prayer?
text: Jeff frowns down at the bag, searching for words. Before he
text: can find them, Stacy speaks:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Where's the knife?
text: They all turn. Her hand is under her tattered shirt,
text: pressing at her lower back. Jeff SIGHS:
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: STACY--
text: She lifts her shirt, twisting to show him. it looks as if a
text: large starfish has been implanted just beneath her skin.
text: It's moving, too, inching slowly but visibly downward. They
text: all stare in astonishment.
text: Amy GASPS, points at Stacy's leg. Stacy bends to see:
text: there's more vine here, a snakelike lump winding its way
text: upward from the top of her shin to her inner thigh.
speaker_heading: CU - FIRE
text: Another small pile of clothes, burning with that blue,
text: alcohol-fueled flame.
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: Can I give her some?
text: The knife is placed in the fire, and WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy holds up the bottle of tequila. Jeff is crouching over
text: the fire, heating the knife's blade. Be glances toward her,
text: nods. Stacy is sitting down, staring at the bulge in her leg
text: with a dazed expression. Eric is beside her.
text: Amy offers the bottle to Stacy;-they all watch as she takes a
text: long swallow. Then she hands the bottle back to Amy, and
text: Jeff pulls the knife from the fire, carries it toward her.
text: He gestures to Eric and Amy.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Hold her hands.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
text: They each take one of her hands. Jeff crouches over her leg.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You might want to shut your eyes.
text: Stacy shakes her head.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I want to see.
text: Jeff hesitates; for a moment it seems-as if he might argue.
text: But then, very quickly, he leans forward and draws the knife
text: in one smooth movement up and around Stacy's leg. Stacy
text: MOANS, her body tensing, but she doesn't cry out.
text: The incision reveals the vine, a foot long, its leaves and
text: flowers clotted with Stacy's blood, which is oozing from the
text: wound. Jeff reaches in, pries the tendril from her flesh.
text: Stacy MOANS again, arching backward, as the vine emerges:
text: writhing and twisting. The blood comes more thickly now,
text: pumping from the wound, running down her leg.
text: Jeff drops the tendril into the dirt, steps on it, grinding
text: it into stillness. Stacy is breathing HARD, almost
text: hyperventilating. She's shut her eyes.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Should I stop?
text: Stacy shakes her head, vehemently. Jeff glances at the
text: others. Eric shakes his head, too. Amy's eyes, like
text: Stacy's, are tightly shut.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You'll have to roll over.
text: Stacy lets go of the others' hands, rolls onto her stomach.
text: She hitches up her shirt, revealing the small of her back,
text: the starfish-shaped bulge. Jeff crouches at her side.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Ready?
text: She nods, and he leans, makes five quick incisions, in the
text: shape of an asterisk, directly above the bulge. Stacy's body
text: goes rigid, and Eric takes her hand again. Once more, we can
text: see the tendril through the incision: dark with her blood.
text: Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body.
text: There's an astonishing amount of it; he has to drop the knife
text: and use both hands to drag the slimy mass free.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
text: As the plant emerges from her body--thrashing, coiling and
text: uncoiling, covered in half-clotted blood, like a newborn--
text: Stacy starts to SCREAM.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: The Mayans at their campsite: three of them on guard duty,
text: the others napping in the shade beneath the trees. Stacy's
text: SCREAMING echoes down the hill toward us.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: They've pulled a shirt from one of the backpacks, torn it
text: into strips, and used these to bandage Stacy's wounds, tying
text: them around her leg and torso. She's lying on her side, eyes
text: shut, her head in Eric's lap. He's stroking her hair.
text: Jeff is counting the grapes into four separate piles. Amy
text: sits watching him. When he finishes, he gestures for her to
text: take a pile. Then he scoops Stacy and Eric's rations up,
text: carries them over.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Can you eat?
text: Stacy sits up, wincing; her bandages are soaked through with
text: blood. She takes the grapes from him; Eric does, too. They-
text: all begin to eat, in silence. When they're done, Jeff passes
text: the water bottle around their circle. Then:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We should try to rest, I guess.
text: (he waves toward the tent)
dialog: Get out of the sun. We're losing
dialog: moisture out--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: There's more of it.
text: She leans forward, probes at her right thigh, prodding the
text: skin. The others watch her; there's no bulge visible, no
text: sign of the vine-at all. Eric gives her a pained look.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There's nothing there, Stacy.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's under the muscle. Down by the
dialog: bone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
text: She keeps pushing at her leg. She glances from Eric to Amy
text: to Jeff. No one says anything.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Cut me and see. Right here.
text: She uses her finger to draw a line up her thigh.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're losing too much blood. And
dialog: if any of these get infected---
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: My calf, too.
text: she lifts her right leg, turning it to show the others. Jeff
text: bends to look. Again, there's no visible sign of the vine.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No more cutting. Not unless---
text: The knife is in the dirt beside him, and Stacy leans forward,
text: tries to grab it. Jeff is too quick for her, though: he
text: snatches it up, tucks it into his belt. Stacy is becoming
text: more and more upset. She holds out her hands, BEGGING:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Please, Jeff.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You can't. You can't keep--
text: Stacy is starting to CRY; her mouth is trembling.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: It's everywhere.
text: She's prodding at her body: her legs, her chest and stomach.
text: Amy scoots toward her, grasps her hand.
speaker_heading: ANY
speaker_heading: STACY--
text: Stacy yanks her hand free, clutches her scalp, WEEPING:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It's in my head! I can feel it in
dialog: my head!
text: Amy takes Stacy in her arms, hugging her tight..
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shh.
text: Stacy SOBS into Amy's shoulder, her body jumping. Amy
text: strokes her. Eric steps across the clearing, picks up the
text: bottle of tequila. He glances at Jeff, and Jeff nods.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: You're scared, honey. You're just
dialog: scared. You know?
text: Stacy nods; she's still CRYING, but it's growing quieter.
text: Eric crouches beside her, holds out the bottle of tequila.
text: Stacy just stares at it. Amy encourages her:
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: It'll help.
text: Stacy accepts the bottle, takes a long swallow. Then
text: another. The others watch her in silence. Finally:
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Can you rest some? In the tent?
text: Stacy is silent. She wipes the tears from her face.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: That girl--
dialog: (she waves at the shaft)
text: I keep seeing her. When I shut my
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: I know...I know.
text: (she stands up, holds out
dialog: her hand)
dialog: Let's just lie down for a bit.
dialog: Okay?
text: Stacy hesitates, staring up at Amy. Then she reaches, grasps
text: her hand. Amy pulls her to her feet, helps her hobble across
text: the clearing to the tent. Jeff and Eric sit-there, watching
text: in silence as they vanish through the flap.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY
text: Sunlight filters through the orange nylon; all four of them
text: lie sleeping in a row, sweating. The vine has shredded their
text: clothes to tatters; they look like castaways. The tent's
text: flap hangs open, billowing gently in a slight breeze.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 123.
text: Stacy open her eyes. She lies there, staring up toward the
text: orange nylon above her. The blood on her bandages has dried
text: to a dark red, bordering on black. She sits up, stares about
text: the tent. Eric is on one side of her, then Amy, then Jeff.
text: Jeff is on his back, the knife still tucked into his belt.
text: Stacy rises quietly, steps over Amy, crouches above him,
text: staring down at the knife. She reaches, tries to slip it
text: free, but then jerks back when Jeff shifts in his sleep.
text: She hesitates, watching him. She seems as if she's about to
text: try again, but then the tent flap billows in the breeze,
text: drawing her gaze. A beat, and she rises, steps carefully
text: over Jeff, ducks outside into the clearing.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Stacy stands just beyond the tent's.flap. All is still,
text: quiet.- She moves to Eric's pack, crouches over it, pulls out
text: his phone. She flips it open, stares down at its screen:
text: there's still no signal. She drops it back into the pack.
text: She turns-to examine the clearing, her eyes falling upon the
text: two backpacks from the blue tent. Their pockets are zippered
text: open: Jeff and Eric's hurried pillaging during the downpour
text: has scattered their contents across the dirt.
text: Stacy rises, steps toward this tangled mound. She starts to
text: dig through it, casually at first, but then with growing
text: intensity, throwing T-shirts and jeans and shorts aside,
text: probing deeply into the pile.
text: Suddenly she goes still. Staring. Amid the sodden mass of
text: clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard.
text: As Stacy crouches there, the vines start to RUSTLE, a
text: rippling motion passing across them, as. if a wind were
text: sweeping the hillside. Stacy watches with a look of horror:
text: it looks like the pelt of some giant animal, shaking itself.
text: When it finally stops, she bends, reaching for the knife.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY
text: Jeff, Eric, and Amy, still sleeping. The tent's flap
text: continues to billow in the breeze. Very faintly, from the
text: clearing, WE HEAR a moan. Then the sound of WHIMPERING.
text: Eric opens his eyes, listening. An instant later, very
text: abruptly, there comes a sharp, rending SCREAM of pure pain.
text: Eric jumps up, starts for the flap; Jeff is right behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 124.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Eric emerges from the tent, then Jeff, then Amy. They stand
text: there, staring, too horrified to move.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Stacy is on the far side of the clearing. She's pulled off
text: her shirt, her shorts, and has cut much of the skin from her
text: body. She doesn't notice them. She's bent over, slicing
text: into her left thigh, peeling the skin back from the muscle.
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: STACY--
text: She turns, blood-streaked, wild-eyed, the knife in her hand;
text: her skin is hanging from her in shreds. We can see her leg
text: muscles, her abdominals, a glint of bone at her left elbow.
text: Jeff starts forward, holding out his hand, very STERN:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Give it. Now.
text: Eric follows him. Amy stays by the tent; she's begun to CRY.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Please, honey. Just--
text: Stacy shakes her head; she's CRYING, too, her whole body
text: shaking. Her hair is matted with blood; she looks terrified.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I have to get it out. It's--
text: Jeff darts forward, tries to grab the knife from her, and she
text: slashes at him, SHOUTING:
speaker_heading: STACY (coat'd)
dialog: Leave me alonel
text: The blade slices into his palm. Jeff jumps back, cradling
text: his hand at his chest.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: I have to--
text: Eric steps toward her, from behind, reaching around her body
text: for the knife, and she spins, reflexively, trying to fend him
text: off. But the knife is in her hand, and it punches into his
text: chest, just to the right of his sternum, sticking there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 125.
text: Eric looks at the knife in surprise. It's twitching back and
text: forth with the beating of his heart. He starts to reach for
text: it, but then his legs give out. He collapses, dropping to
text: the dirt, which has grown muddy with Stacy's blood.
text: Amy SCREAMS.
text: Stacy's CRYING deepens; she takes a step toward Eric, but
text: then her own body fails her. She falls to her knees in the
text: bloody puddle, reaching toward him.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, no...no...no... I'm--
text: Eric is on his back; he struggles up onto one elbow. He
text: tries to speak, but only a GAGGING sound emerges, blood
text: frothing at his mouth. It's pumping thickly from his wound,
text: too, saturating his shirt.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: I didn't...
text: Eric drops back again. He struggles RAGGEDLY for breath.
text: Jeff lowers himself to his knees beside him, hesitating
text: impotently over him, uncertain what to do. Stacy is SOBBING,
text: shaking her head. There's blood everywhere.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: Kill me...
text: Jeff turns, stares at her. Amy steps forward, crouches
text: beside her. She takes Stacy's hand.
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Shh.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Please. Just--
speaker_heading: ANY
dialog: Shh.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: It hurts. It hurts so much.
text: Eric tries to rise again. The blood surges from his wound
text: when he moves. Jeff presses him back down.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Easy. Try to--
text: Stacy clutches at Amy, begging, her voice HOARSE with pain:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Kill me. I can't
text: She stops in mid-sentence, staring. Jeff and Amy follow her
text: gaze. A half dozen tendrils are snaking into the clearing,
text: reaching toward Eric's body.
text: Jeff jumps to his feet. The tendrils begin to wrap
text: themselves around Eric's limbs, and Jeff bends to tear them
text: away. More and more keep coming, though. Eric has started
text: to convulse, GAGGING, his head cocked back.
text: Jeff keeps yanking the tendrils away, but there are far too
text: many of them; they coil around Eric's legs, pulling at him.
text: The blood has stopped pumping from his wound; his body has
text: gone still.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jeff I
text: She points toward the tent. Jeff turns to see.
scene_heading: JEFF'S POV - ACROSS THE CLEARING
text: The sleeping bag in which they'd enshrouded Mathias is
text: moving: he's thrashing about within it, struggling to sit
text: up. And he's SHOUTING, too, his voice MUFFLED by the bag:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS'S VOICE
text: HENRICH...! HENRICH...!
text: He seems to be tearing at the bag with his arms.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Jeff hesitates just for an instant, staring in astonishment,
text: then he's sprinting across the clearing. He bends, struggles
dialog: for the zipper.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It's okay. I'm right here. I'm--
text: He UNZIPS the bag, and an immense tangle of vine cascades out
text: onto the dirt. Its flowers are a pale pink; they're opening
text: and closing, still calling, louder now:
speaker_heading: MATHIAS' S VOICE
text: HENRICH...! HENRICH...!
text: The thick clot of tendrils writhes spasmodically, coiling and
text: uncoiling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 127.
text: Entwined within it are Mathias's bones, already stripped
text: clean of flesh. The vine falls SILENT. A beat, then it
text: starts to laugh, a low mocking CHUCKLE.
text: On the opposite side of the little clearing, Stacy begins to
text: SCREAM, shaking her head, SOBBING.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: KILL ME...! KILL ME...!
text: Jeff stands there, perfectly still. Amy is holding Stacy,
text: struggling unsuccessfully to quiet her:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Shh. Shh.
text: The vine's laughter grows steadily. LOUDER, punctuated by
speaker_heading: Stacy's SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: KILL ME...! KILL ME...:
text: Amy turns, stares at Jeff. Blood is running off Stacy's body
text: in strings. The vine has dragged Eric to the edge of the
text: clearing; only his head and torso are still visible. Jeff
text: strides toward him.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: KILL ME...! KILL ME...!
text: Jeff bends, yanks the knife from Eric's chest. Then he
text: starts across the clearing toward Stacy.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: The Mayans in their campsite. They're all staring up the
text: hill, listening. Stacy's voice ECHOES toward us:
speaker_heading: STACY (O.S.)
dialog: KILL ME...! KILL ME...I KILL--
text: And then, abruptly, it goes SILENT.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Amy sits beside Stacy, who lies on her back in the puddle of
text: blood, arms thrown out, the knife stuck hilt-deep in her
text: chest. Eric's body is barely visible at the edge of the
text: clearing; the vine RUSTLES softly as it consumes him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 128.
text: Jeff is pulling their remaining supplies from his knapsack:
text: the bananas, the raisins, the pretzels, the protein bars, the
text: nuts, the water, iced tea, and Coke. He has a bloody strip
text: of fabric tied around the wound on his hand.
text: Amy watches as he arranges the food in front of her. She's
text: CRYING silently, tears running down her dirt-smeared cheeks.
text: Jeff peels one of the bananas: it's dark brown, far too
text: ripe. He holds it out to her. She just stares at it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Come on. You'll need the energy.
text: He reaches for her hand, puts the banana in it. She holds
text: the fruit, but makes no move to eat. Finally, VERY QUIETLY:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I still think we should wait.
dialog: Jeff SIGHS: it's clear they've already been through this.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You'll only get weaker.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: They'll come looking. You said
dialog: THEY'LL--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nobody's coming.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Our parents--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: All they'll find are our bones.
text: Amy is silent, staring down at the banana.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: We don't have time for this, Amy.
dialog: You'll need as much daylight as
dialog: possible.
text: He waves upward, toward the sun, which has passed its peak,
text: begun its slow slide westward. Amy squints toward it for a
text: beat, and then, almost despite herself, lifts the banana to
text: her mouth. She bites, chews, swallows, still mutely crying.
text: Jeff peels the second banana; he hands it to her as soon as
text: she finishes the first. Be watches her eat,.silent. He's
text: tearing open the bag of pretzels when another tendril snakes
text: into the clearing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 129.
text: They both watch it, neither of them moving. It's joined by a
text: second tendril, then a third, a fourth;.the vines coil around
text: Stacy's body, begin to drag it from the clearing. Amy's
text: CRYING grows more forceful, her body shaking.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Shh.
text: Jeff reaches, strokes her. The vine pulls Stacy's body into
text: itself, burying it. Amy watches, struggling to control.
text: herself. Her voice emerges as little more than a WHISPER:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't want to. I don't...
text: She shakes her head, wipes at her face: the tears, the snot,
text: the sweat, the dirt. Her clothes are falling off her body,
text: eaten to shreds. Jeff's, too.
speaker_heading: AMY (cont'd)
dialog: Why can't we both?
text: Jeff hesitates a.beat. Then, clearly not believing it:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We might.
text: He hands her the pretzels; she takes them, watching his face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It'll take them a moment to react.
dialog: If I can make it to the trees...
text: He trails off, shrugs. Amy keeps staring at him; she doesn't
text: believe this either. He SIGHS again, holds up his hand,
text: pulls the bandage from his wound: it's three inches long, a
text: deep gash into his palm.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: How long till it's inside me?
text: Amy is silent. He flexes his hand, and the wound opens,
text: mouthlike, blood oozing thickly from it.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It already is, probably. I'll be
dialog: just like Stacy soon.
text: He turns, glances toward the spot where her body has
text: disappeared. Amy looks, too.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Then what? You, all alone on this
dialog: hill... you know how that would end,
dialog: don't you?
text: Once more, Amy is silent. He waves for her to keep eating,
text: and she starts in on the pretzels, mechanically. He opens
text: the can of Coke, hands it to her; she takes a long sip.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Once you're in the jungle, you drop
dialog: and hide.
text: Another tendril slithers forward. It slips into the immense
text: puddle of blood beside Jeff and Amy, begins to drink it.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: They'll never find you--it's too
text: thick in there. Just burrow down,
dialog: and they'll run right past.
text: Jeff opens the can of nuts, sets it in front of Amy. Then he
text: gets up, crouches over the puddle of blood. He cups. his
text: hands, dips them into the puddle. He steps toward Amy,
text: smears the blood across her T-shirt. Amy keeps eating.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It's sudden movements that'll get
dialog: you caught. So take your time.
dialog: You step, then listen. Then
dialog: another step, and listen again.
text: He moves back to the puddle, which the lone tendril continues'
text: to drain. He cups his hands, scoops up more blood, smears it
text: on her tattered khakis. Amy has finished the pretzels; she
text: reaches for the nuts, looking numb..
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: East, always east--keep the sun at
dialog: your back.
text: He scoops up more blood from the puddle.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)'
dialog: Arms.
text: Amy holds out her arms, and he smears the blood on them.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You'll hear me yell. I'll yell
dialog: your name.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 131.
text: He returns yet again to the puddle, then stands over her, the
text: blood cupped in his hands, dripping.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: And you can't hesitate.
dialog: Understand? Not for an instant.
text: Amy nods, and he uncups his hands over her head. She shuts
text: her eyes as the blood runs into her hair, down her forehead,
text: her neck, her face.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY
text: Three of the Mayan men, as usual, sit in the clearing, bows
text: in their laps, facing the hill. The others are sheltering
text: from the sun in the line of shade along the jungle's margin,
text: some sleeping, some talking quietly together.
text: One of the men in the clearing suddenly rises to his feet,
text: nocking an arrow. The other two also rise. The Mayans along
text: the clearing fall silent, staring up the hill.
scene_heading: THE MAYANS' POV - UP THE HILL
text: Jeff is approaching down the trail, carrying Amy, pieta-like,
text: in his arms. Her body is limp, apparently lifeless, and
text: dripping with blood.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: The bald Mayan emerges from the tree line, followed by yet
text: another man with a bow. They join the other three Mayans in
text: the center of the clearing. They all watch as Jeff reaches
text: the base of the trail, where he carefully lays Amy down.
text: Jeff crouches over Amy, laying her arms across her chest,
text: pushing the hair from her face. He bends, kisses her blood-
text: smeared forehead. Then he glances up at the Mayans.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don't even know her name.
text: The Mayans just stare at him. He rises to his feet, pulling
text: the knife from his belt: it's darkly stained with. blood.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: You should. You should know who
dialog: you're killing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 132.
text: He steps out into the clearing. The bald Mayan pulls his
text: pistol from its holster, raises it, aiming at Jeff's chest.
text: The others draw their bows. Jeff smiles, taps his sternum.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Jeff. Understand? My name's Jeff.
text: He edges along the clearing's margin, keeping close to the
text: vines, moving away from Amy's body. The Mayans follow him,
text: weapons raised. After a handful of steps, he stops again,
text: turns toward them.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Can you say it? Huh?
text: Again, the Mayans just stare. He SLAPS at his chest.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Jeff.
text: A beat, then he suddenly YELLS, waving the knife at the men.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: SAY MY FUCKING NAME!
text: Silence. The Mayans stand there with their weapons raised,
text: waiting to see what he might do. A beat, then he starts
text: walking once more, along the clearing's edge, away from Amy.
text: Another ten yards and he stops again, waves up the hill.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
text: There's Stacy, too. And Eric.
dialog: Mathias. And Henrich. You've
dialog: killed them all.
text: He steps toward them. The bald man raises his hand, holds it
text: up, palm out, next to his pistol. Jeff smiles at him again.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: But not everyone.
text: He LAUGHS, a little wildly, and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Look at you, you stupid fucks. You
dialog: have no idea what I'm saying, do
dialog: you?
text: He takes another step into the clearing. The bald man COCKS
text: his pistol, loudly. Several of the other Mayans have emerged
text: from the jungle; they stand there watching.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: One of us is gonna survive. You
dialog: should know that name, too. You
dialog: fuckers. You bastards.
text: He takes yet another step forward. The bald man speaks a
text: string of words IN MAYAN, with an edge of warning. More
text: Mayans emerge from-the jungle, shielding their eyes against
text: the sun, staring. No one is looking in Amy's direction.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It's not Jeff.
text: He shakes his head, his voice dropping, almost to a WHISPER:
speaker_heading: JEFF .(cont'd)
dialog: It's not me.
text: He takes another step. And then, still QUIETLY:
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: It's Amy. You hear?
text: He takes a deep breath, gathering himself. Then he YELLS--
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
speaker_heading: AMY;
text: --and starts to run, straight at the Mayans. He only manages
text: three steps before the bald man FIRES his pistol, and the
text: others let their arrows fly.
text: The bullet hits Jeff in the chest, just beneath his throat.
text: One of the arrows misses; the other three strike his stomach,
text: his left arm, his right thigh. Before he even hits the
text: ground, there's a SHOUT from the Mayans along the treeline.
text: The bald man turns. Amy is on her feet, sprinting for the
text: jungle. The bald man raises. his pistol, FIRES, but the shot
text: is too hurried; it goes wide. The others are still
text: scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees.
text: The bowmen sprint after her, disappearing into the jungle,
text: leaving the bald man alone in the clearing with Jeff. The
text: Mayan women stand motionless along the treeline, staring.
text: after Amy: they look mortified, grief-stricken.
text: Jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds, struggling to crawl
text: forward, his breath frothing pinkly at his lips. A half
text: dozen tendrils slither into the clearing. They coil around
text: his legs, start to drag him back toward the hill. Jeff
text: fights them, kicking, MOANING, bleeding.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 134.
text: The bald man watches. He, too, looks grief-stricken. He
text: steps forward, aims at Jeff's head. As he FIRES, WE:
text: CUT TO A BLACK SCREEN
text: WE HEAR footsteps, moving quickly down a tiled floor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (O.S.)
dialog: (a slight Spanish accent)
text: She flagged down a tour bus, just
dialog: west of Coba--
text: The voice CARRIES OVER into:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: A Mexican DOCTOR, in his late fifties, balding, a little
text: stooped, his white jacket buttoned over a shirt and tie, is
text: hurrying down the corridor, accompanied by TERESA, a dark-
text: haired woman in beige slacks, a blue blouse.
text: Teresa has- a leather briefcase, a Blackberry on her belt.
text: She's holding Amy's passport,. which she examines as they
text: walk. It's smeared with dried blood.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: --and collapsed before the driver
text: even managed to open the door.
text: The corridor is brightly lit, very clean. Rooms open off it
text: on either side, and we glimpse the still.forms of sleeping
text: patients as we pass, IVs hanging from metal stands beside
text: their beds. It's very quiet.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
text: She revived briefly, just after
dialog: they brought her in. She was in
dialog: bad shape--severely dehydrated,
text: traumatized, in shock. And
dialog: terribly frightened. It was
dialog: impossible to make any sense of
dialog: what she was saying. She was
dialog: sobbing, hysterical. We had to
text: sedate her.
text: The doctor has a manila folder under his arm; he opens it,
text: pulls out a piece of paper: a color printout of a digital
text: photo. He hands it to Teresa.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
text: Her clothes were torn; she was
text: covered in blood. But not her own.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 135.
text: Teresa stares down at the photo: it shows Amy on a gurney,
text: unconscious, blood-smeared, corpse-like.
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Now do you know?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: She has no wounds.
text: A uniformed policeman sits on a chair outside one of the
text: rooms at the end of the corridor, reading a newspaper. He
text: rises as they approach. Teresa hands the printout back to
text: the doctor; she keeps the passport.
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: That's it? That's all you have?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'm afraid so.
text: Be nods to the policeman, and leads Teresa into:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: A bed, a night stand, a curtained window. Amy lies with a
text: sheet pulled to her chin, unconscious, an IV dripping into
text: her arm. They've cleaned the blood off her.
text: A NURSE sits in a chair beside the bed. She's in her early
text: twenties, with long dark hair tied in a bun. She stands up,
text: stepping back from the bed, as the doctor and Teresa enter.
text: The doctor addresses her in SUBTITLED SPANISH:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Has she stirred?
text: The nurse shakes her head. The doctor moves to the bed. He
text: takes Amy's wrist, feeling for her-pulse. Amy's eyes open at
text: his touch. She stares at him, her arm hanging limply in his
text: grasp. He smiles down at her.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
dialog: There you are...
text: Teresa steps forward, and Amy's gaze shifts to her.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
dialog: My name is Dr. Hernandez...
text: Amy's eyes return to the doctor;. they fall on his face, then
text: drift down to his chest. The doctor gestures toward Teresa:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 136.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
dialog: And this is Ms. Bern, from the U.S.
dialog: Consulate.
text: Amy is staring at his white coat, her expression going slack,
text: almost catatonic, all the life draining from it.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
dialog: we were hoping you might be able to
dialog: shed a little light on what you've
dialog: been through...
text: Amy is silent, still staring with that dead look in her eyes
text: at the doctor's coat: a faint green web of vine has taken
text: root there, spreading across the white fabric. WE HOLD on it
dialog: for a beat, and then:
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
