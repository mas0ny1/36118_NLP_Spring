scene_heading: EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - DAY
dialog: 
text: A small caveman community made up of five large caves, all
text: facing out towards a crackling fire.
dialog: 
text: Slack-jawed, yet strong and confident CAVEMEN stumble about,
text: dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks,
text: dragging the women.
dialog: 
text: WE PAN OVER to a small cave. Not even really a cave at all,
text: but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in.
text: Stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking
dialog: caveman.
dialog: 
text: The chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields,
text: steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the
text: beginning of a caveman meeting.
dialog: 
text: "Loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met
text: with laughter from the other cavemen. "Loser caveman" sighs
text: and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them
text: from the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: (grunting; subtitled)
dialog: Me see beast today. Beast scary.
dialog: Beast danger for caveman.
dialog: 
text: The rest of the cavemen look nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: If caveman kill beast? Caveman
dialog: safe. Caveman have food.
dialog: 
text: The cavemen grunt in understanding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Who kill beast?
dialog: 
text: The cavemen grunt amongst themselves. The toughest of the
text: bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Grob kill beast. Good Grob.
dialog: 
text: The chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser want kill beast?
dialog: 
text: All the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser kill nothing!
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: All the cavemen laugh hysterically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAVEMAN #1
dialog: Look at Loser cave! So small!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAVEMAN #2
dialog: Loser dumb!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAVEMAN #3
dialog: Fuck that guy!
dialog: 
text: All the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the
text: "loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around
text: the camp, dodging their blows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but
text: "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little
text: cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.
dialog: 
text: A stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit
text: upright. There's something outside of the village. Something
dialog: big.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and
text: stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the
dialog: village fire.
dialog: 
text: "Loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. The boar
text: makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly
text: towards his tiny little cave.
dialog: 
text: The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the
text: opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside.
text: "Loser caveman" screams like a girl.
dialog: 
text: The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the
text: end of "loser caveman" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose
text: by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the
text: Boar's head, killing it instantly.
dialog: 
text: The entire village runs out to see what has happened. The
text: "Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself
dialog: off.
dialog: 
text: The chief steps forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: The beast! It dead!
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAVEMAN #2
dialog: Hey, look at loser! He almost die!
dialog: Look he scared!
dialog: 
text: Everyone laughs. The Chief looks towards Loser, standing
text: nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser, what happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
speaker_heading: (SHAMEFULLY)
dialog: The Beast, it came at me. It smash
dialog: my cave.
dialog: 
text: Everyone laughs hysterically. WE PAN over the many laughing
text: faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. We
text: watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the
text: veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through
text: his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his
text: small, homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth
text: across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession.
dialog: 
text: There is a SMALL EXPLOSION.
dialog: 
text: We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
text: contorted in rage.
dialog: 
text: He interrupts everyone's laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
dialog: Hold on one minute!
dialog: 
text: Everyone stops laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser wasn't finished.
dialog: 
text: Loser caveman stands up straight and tall -- all of a sudden
dialog: the Bruce Willis of cavemen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
text: After beast smash cave, Loser look
dialog: at beast and say, "not on Loser's
dialog: watch." Loser grab rock on ground,
text: lift above head and smash it
text: down... right onto motherfucker's
dialog: head.
dialog: 
text: The entire village gasps.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser kill beast.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Now fuck off, Loser going back to
dialog: sleep.
dialog: 
text: The chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser kill beast! Loser caveman
dialog: hero!
dialog: 
text: Loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and
text: drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in
dialog: cheer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREEZE FRAME:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: The world's first lie. A monumental
dialog: occasion in the history of mankind.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: That lowly caveman who stumbled
dialog: upon the ability to lie went on to
dialog: become chief of his village,
dialog: married dozens of cavewomen, and
dialog: passed on the lying gene to
text: hundreds of newborn cave-children.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Over time lying spread throughout
text: the world, sparking the eventual
dialog: birth of imagination itself, story-
dialog: telling, religion, and the oh-so-
dialog: important polite lie, as in, "Oh
dialog: Patty, have you lost weight? You
dialog: look fantastic."
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: The world would be a very different
dialog: place if events had gone otherwise
dialog: on that prolific, Paleolithic eve.
dialog: If not for that night, man would
dialog: have never acquired the ability to
dialog: lie to himself and to others.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: A world without lying would be a
dialog: world without dreams. A world
text: without pretense. A world without
dialog: fiction. A world without flattery.
dialog: A world very unlike our own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNFREEZE:
dialog: 
text: The film rewinds about thirty seconds, to the point where the
text: chief asked what happened with "loser caveman" and the boar.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser, what happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
speaker_heading: (SHAMEFULLY)
dialog: The Beast, it came at me. It smash
dialog: my cave.
dialog: 
text: AGAIN WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through his
text: homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across
text: his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession...
dialog: 
text: But this time there's no explosion.
dialog: 
text: We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
text: contorted in rage.
dialog: 
text: The rage slowly fades and Loser just stands there, everyone
text: in the camp waiting for him to say something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOSER CAVEMAN
dialog: Rock fall on beast. Loser do
dialog: nothing. I think Loser even soil
text: bear pants.
dialog: (pause; sniffing)
dialog: Loser smell bad.
dialog: 
text: Everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAVEMAN
dialog: Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman,
dialog: throw rocks at loser!
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing
text: rocks at "loser caveman" as he runs around the camp,
text: terrified and miserable.

scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - SAME
dialog: 
text: Mark (40's), average to semi-handsome, twists and turns

dialog: 
text: JENNIFER MCDOOGLES opens, her face flushed. She's beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Hi. You're early. I was just
text: masturbating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That makes me think of your vagina.
dialog: I'm Mark, how are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: A little frustrated at the moment.
text: Also equally depressed and
dialog: pessimistic about our date tonight.
dialog: I'm Jennifer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I hope this date ends in sex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Not me. I don't find you
dialog: attractive. Come on in.
dialog: 
text: Mark enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROLL CREDITS
dialog: 
text: Jennifer's apartment is new-adult, as if she just found out
dialog: she was an adult yet hasn't had the time or the money to
dialog: complete the transition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I need to finish getting ready.
dialog: While doing that I might realize
dialog: I'm still horny and try to finish
dialog: masturbating without you hearing.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer heads towards the bathroom. Mark stands alone in her
text: living room, looking around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (shouting to her)
dialog: I feel awkward and I regret being
dialog: early.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (O.S.)
dialog: (shouting back)
dialog: Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early
dialog: and not really looking forward to
dialog: tonight in general, but the thought
dialog: of being alone the rest of my life
dialog: scares both my mother and I
dialog: equally.
dialog: 
text: It's completely silent for a long beat. Mark looks around,
text: then sits on her couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (shouting to her)
dialog: I have an erection now because I
dialog: assume you began masturbating once
dialog: we stopped talking.
dialog: 
dialog: More silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (shouting to her)
dialog: I'm embarrassed because I think the
dialog: restaurant I've made reservations
dialog: at might not be expensive enough or
dialog: hip enough to impress you, but it
dialog: was the best I could do because I
dialog: don't make very much money. You
dialog: see, I'm forty years old and have
dialog: no real financial assets to speak
dialog: of, I've never owned a home, and
dialog: never had a significant
dialog: relationship. My boss even told me
dialog: today that I'm most likely going to
dialog: get fired tomorrow and...
dialog: 
text: Jennifer enters the room and Mark stops talking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I just masturbated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That makes me very horny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Shall we go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure.

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Greg's a good friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: A cute little place called La

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You obviously don't have very much
dialog: money but that's not necessarily a
dialog: deal breaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I have very little money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I also don't really care about a
dialog: guy who knows all the latest,
dialog: hippest restaurants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't know any of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: In fact, there are very few things
dialog: in life that I care about all that
dialog: much. The only things I have to
dialog: offer myself or anyone else are my
dialog: good looks and my affected sense of
dialog: quirkiness which artistically
dialog: inclined men interpret as
dialog: intellect.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (cont'd)
dialog: In fact, I think my best trait is
dialog: the fact that I've made very few
dialog: mistakes: socially, academically,
dialog: financially or romantically. I take
dialog: very few risks and therefore lead a
text: relatively happy and light-hearted
dialog: existence. Mostly though, I'm a
dialog: kind, sweet person with the
dialog: potential of genuinely becoming a
dialog: vital and interesting human being
dialog: the day I take the energy I expend
dialog: on hyper self-reflexivity and apply
dialog: it to actual action in the reality
dialog: of my life.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to Jennifer)
dialog: And you're pretty and that only

dialog: two started on some drinks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll have a Budweiser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'll start with your Mango
dialog: Margarita and probably have three
dialog: more drinks by the end of the
dialog: night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Excellent.
dialog: (to Mark)
dialog: She's out of your league.

speaker_heading: WOMAN
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
text: All of a sudden I got EXTREMELY
dialog: angry!
dialog: 
text: No one in the restaurant reacts.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm going to ask you some questions
dialog: about your life because that's what
dialog: you do, but I'll only really listen

dialog: saying.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: How do you spend your days?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I get up at eight in the morning
dialog: because the noise from my alarm
text: clock interrupts my sleep, so I
dialog: lean over and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's a little more specific than
dialog: I expected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well what did you want to know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Do you have a job?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I have a job at an office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just typing and filing and stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Do you enjoy it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No. But I enjoy the end result of
dialog: the job which is money. And the
dialog: hours are pretty good for the
dialog: amount of money I make, which I
dialog: spend on things I like, such as
dialog: clothes, hiking, drinking -- even
dialog: though I know it's bad for me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 12.

speaker_heading: JENNIFER (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: But I'd rather just get all the
dialog: money and not work for the results.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure. Tell me more. I'm trying to
dialog: get a little insight into you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well you already know a lot about
dialog: me. You know I'm good looking
dialog: because... well... here I am. You
dialog: know I'm successful because you've
dialog: seen my apartment and the clothes
dialog: I'm wearing. And you know I'm happy
dialog: because I'm smiling.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer smiles brightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Are you always happy?

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Do you guys know what you want or
dialog: do you need a moment?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'll have a caesar salad with
dialog: chicken because I think I'm fat but
dialog: I also think I deserve something
dialog: that tastes good.

dialog: No, not very attractive. No,
dialog: doesn't make much money. He's all

dialog: funny. A bit fat. Funny little snub
dialog: nose. No, I won't be sleeping with
dialog: him tonight. Nope, probably not
dialog: even a kiss. Okay, you too. Bye.

dialog: company. I'm here today to ask you
dialog: to continue buying coke. I'm sure
dialog: it's a drink you've been drinking
dialog: for years, and if you still enjoy
dialog: it, I'd like to remind you to buy
dialog: it again sometime soon. It's
dialog: basically just brown sugar water,
dialog: we haven't changed the ingredients
dialog: much lately, so there's nothing new
dialog: about it I can say. We changed the
dialog: can around a little bit. See, the
dialog: colors here are a little different,
dialog: and we even put a polar bear on it
dialog: for the kids. Also, coke is very
dialog: high in sugar, can lead to obesity
dialog: in children and adults who don't
dialog: sustain a healthy diet, and has a
dialog: Ph acidity level high enough to
text: dissolve teeth and bones over
dialog: extended periods of time. Coke also
dialog: works great at removing corrosion
dialog: from car batteries and loosening
dialog: rusted bolts. So that's it, it's
dialog: coke. Everyone knows it. It's very
dialog: famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,
dialog: and I'm asking you to not stop
dialog: buying coke. That's all. Thanks.

dialog: to take enough to kill myself.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: See you tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Bye.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: As Mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world.
dialog: 
text: A homeless man stands on a street corner with a sign that
dialog: reads: "I don't understand why I'm homeless and all of you
dialog: are not."
dialog: 
text: A business man talking loudly into his cell phone pulls up
text: next to mark at a red light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUSINESS MAN
dialog: I'm not talking to anyone on my
dialog: cell phone. I only want people to
dialog: assume I'm very busy.
dialog: 
text: At another red light Mark eavesdrops on a couple having a
text: loud argument in front of a coffee shop.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: I woke up this morning and realized
dialog: that, not only do I not love you,
dialog: but that the thought of touching
dialog: you sickens me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYFRIEND
dialog: The more you hate me the more I
dialog: fall in love with you.
dialog: 
text: A Bus passes in front of Mark's car.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: The bus ad simply shows a can of Pepsi, and reads:
dialog: "Pepsi. When they don't have Coke."
dialog: 
text: A car honks behind Mark. The man leans out of his car and
text: yells at Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HONKING MAN
dialog: Move it, fatty!
dialog: 
text: Mark drives forward, waving to the man apologetically as the
text: man zooms past him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mark parks his car and walks towards a large office building.
text: The sign on the building reads: "LECTURE FILMS MOTION PICTURE
dialog: STUDIOS -- We Film Someone Telling You About Things That
dialog: Happened."
dialog: 
text: In front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his
text: briefcase with his tie around his head, screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCREAMING MAN
dialog: This isn't natural! None of this is
dialog: natural! We're all animals! This
dialog: doesn't feel right! Why am I
dialog: wearing clothes? How can you people
dialog: live like this? Where did all this
dialog: concrete come from?!
dialog: 
text: Mark walks right by him. A woman in a business suit stops him
text: on his way through the front door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WOMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: I don't want to go in there today.
dialog: I just don't. You know?
dialog: 
text: Mark nods understandingly and enters the building.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE FILMS - LOBBY - MORNING
dialog: 
text: As Mark walks through the lobby we get a brief glimpse of
text: some of the movie posters lining the wall: "The Holocaust",
text: "The Death of the Dinosaurs", "Napoleon", "The Civil War".
dialog: 
text: Each poster shows a different austere man sitting in a chair,
text: holding a script in his lap, with a title above his head. The
text: posters are extremely boring.
dialog: 
text: A tour guide leads a row of tourists through the lobby. As
text: Mark enters we overhear the tour guide's speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: All of Lecture Films' productions
dialog: are written, filmed and edited
dialog: right here on this very lot. In
dialog: fact, this building is where
dialog: Lecture Films' talented writers
text: scour through the world's past
dialog: events, searching for the most
dialog: entertaining, dramatic and even
dialog: hilarious moments of world history,
dialog: which are then turned into scripts,
dialog: handed over to our world-famous
dialog: Readers, and filmed for your
dialog: viewing pleasure.
dialog: 
text: The whole tour "oohs". The tour guide walks over towards a
text: large flat-screen television embedded into the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: If you'll just follow me over to
dialog: this monitor you'll get a sneak
dialog: peak at Lecture Film's upcoming
dialog: summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon
dialog: 1812 to 1813."
dialog: 
text: Everyone "oohs" again. Mark, curious as well, stops to watch
text: the trailer with the tour.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: TV SCREEN. A black screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Coming this summer from Lecture
dialog: Films Motion Picture Studios.
dialog: Written by Oscar winning

dialog: 
text: INTERCUT Mark scowling at this name.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (O.S.)
dialog: And starring Oscar winning Reader
dialog: Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic
dialog: sequel to last year's most talked
dialog: about film: "Napoleon 1810 to
dialog: 1811". Prepare for the adventure.
dialog: 
text: The black fades to NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE, a middle-aged austere
text: man sitting before a fire in a velvet smoking jacket, holding
text: a script.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: And so Napoleon invaded Russia with
text: a brute force of nearly seven
text: hundred thousand men behind him
text: armed with muskets and supported by
dialog: canon brigades.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Learn of his defeat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE
speaker_heading: (READING)
text: Through the devastating snow they
dialog: marched, crippled by disease and
text: hunger, Napoleon's men marched on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Listen to his redemption.
dialog: 
text: INTERCUT the tour, enraptured by this trailer. A few of the
text: tourists whisper to each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOURIST #1
dialog: I love these films. Saves me
text: reading the book.
dialog: 
text: INTERCUT the trailer title slamming onto the screen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this
dialog: summer from Lecture Films.
dialog: 
text: The trailer ends and the tour applauds. The tour guide turns
text: to find Mark walking away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: Look everyone, there goes Mark
dialog: Bellison, one of Lecture Films very
dialog: own screenwriters!
dialog: 
text: The whole tour turns towards Mark. Mark turns around and
text: dejectedly waves.
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: He's one of our least successful
dialog: writers here at Lecture Films.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I also hear he's most likely
dialog: getting fired today.
dialog: 
text: The tour nods at Mark. Mark nods back.

scene_heading: INT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mark walks past cubicle after cubicle until he comes to his
text: office and SHELLEY, his attractive late-20's receptionist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to
dialog: you today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more
dialog: and more how over-qualified I am
dialog: for this position and how
dialog: incompetent you are at yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Any messages?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Anthony's coming by within the hour
dialog: to see if he can work up the
dialog: courage to fire you. If he can't,
dialog: he said he'll definitely do it
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Nobody else called? No calls to do
dialog: with actual work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Well, I told everybody you were
dialog: getting fired this week and not to
dialog: expect their calls returned, so no
dialog: one left any messages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Next time I'd rather you took down
dialog: the messages just in case I don't
dialog: get fired.
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: You're almost definitely getting
dialog: fired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, it hasn't happened yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Okay, but everybody knows you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Okay, I'll be in my office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Okay, I'll be searching for new
dialog: jobs on Craigslist.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. LECTURE FILMS - MARK'S OFFICE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much
text: like his apartment.
dialog: 
text: There's a knock on his door.
dialog: 
text: ANTHONY enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive
text: suit, yet nervous and fearful as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Wow, you look really depressed
dialog: today. That's going to make this so
dialog: much harder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Anthony, don't fire me.
dialog: 
text: Anthony sits down on the other side of Mark's desk and leans
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Mark, the 1300's are boring.
dialog: Nothing interesting happened in
dialog: that century. Nobody cares about
dialog: the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment
dialog: era. The last few scripts you
dialog: turned in were depressing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They were about the black plague!
dialog: It's the 1300's Anthony, what else
dialog: am I going to write about!
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It's not totally your fault, Mark.
dialog: You got stuck with a bad century.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No! I can make it work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Give it up Mark, it's not like
dialog: something new is going to have
dialog: happened in the 1300's. At Lecture
dialog: Films we're no longer interested in
dialog: searching through the less well-
dialog: known historical periods for great
dialog: events, we just want to take the
dialog: big name Reader's of the day and
dialog: have them read the historical
dialog: events that people know and love:
text: the holocaust, D-day, the birth of
dialog: electricity. These are the stories
dialog: people want to see, because they
dialog: know them. They find comfort in
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: Anthony pauses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Do you think I could come back and
dialog: do this tomorrow? I just got very
dialog: nervous about firing you. I don't
dialog: do well with confrontation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is there anyway you could do it
dialog: now? I'd rather not put it off.
dialog: 
text: Anthony thinks for a moment, struggling to find the courage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
speaker_heading: (MEEKLY)
dialog: You're fired?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Damn.
dialog: 
text: Anthony slinks out of the room. Mark looks down at his
text: computer to see he has an email in his inbox.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: MARK'S COMPUTER -- The email reads: "I woke up this
dialog: morning, sober, and realized that, while I did enjoy your

scene_heading: INT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - MORNING
dialog: 
text: With all of his meager belongings stuffed into a box, Mark
text: leaves his office, stopping in front of Shelley's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: I loathed almost every minute I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I often fantasized about you naked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: What are you going to do now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I have no idea. But I have very
dialog: little hope for the future.

speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Bye, Mark.
dialog: 
text: Mark heads towards the elevator and is stopped by ROB
text: MARLOWE, a little weasel man with a hip haircut and expensive
dialog: clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: So they fucking fired you, huh
dialog: dipshit? I always knew the Black
dialog: Plague would never work as a movie.
dialog: Guess the 1300's were as much of a
dialog: loser as you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Please don't make me feel worse. Or
dialog: actually whatever, go ahead, I
dialog: don't think I could possibly feel
dialog: worse.
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I fucking always hated you. You're
dialog: a shitty writer assigned to a
dialog: shitty century and you're a little
dialog: man bitch. But I was always
dialog: threatened by you because I knew
dialog: there was something different about
dialog: you that I didn't understand and I
dialog: fucking hate things I don't
dialog: understand. But you will always be
dialog: a loser and I will always be more
dialog: successful than you in nearly every
dialog: way. That's just the way it is. And
dialog: Shelley calls you an ass fag behind
dialog: your back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, now I feel worse.

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh Grandma, that is so depressing.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: The television is broken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The television isn't broken. You
text: probably sat on the remote and
dialog: changed it to channel two again.
dialog: 
text: Mark flicks on the TV with the remote. Static fills the
text: screen. He changes the channel and a picture comes into view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: See, you had it on the wrong
dialog: channel. It needs to be on channel
dialog: three in order for the satellite to
dialog: work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't understand anything you
dialog: just said and that makes me scared
dialog: and angry.
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I can't understand what it feels
dialog: like to be you so it just irritates
dialog: me and makes me think you're
dialog: stupid. But I also love you and
dialog: wish things were better for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I do too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Grandma, I lost my job today. I'm

dialog: alone and I've got absolutely no
dialog: prospects for anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'm sorry, Mark. Things aren't any
dialog: better for me here. I can't afford
dialog: most of my medication, I'm very
dialog: alone and I forget more and more
dialog: every day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm just so tired of life. Why does
dialog: life have to be so... what's the
dialog: word? Don't you sometimes wish you
dialog: could change things? Don't you
dialog: sometimes wish you weren't such a
dialog: loser?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't think I'm a loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Of course you're a loser, grandma.
dialog: Our family is made up of losers.
dialog: We're all poor, we're all average
dialog: looking, we're all only moderately
dialog: intelligent, we're all lonely and
dialog: unloved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Well, we're poor because we weren't
dialog: born with money and it's very hard
dialog: to make enough money in a single
dialog: lifetime to move from one social
dialog: class to another. We're only
dialog: moderately intelligent because
dialog: there's been a lot of inbreeding in
dialog: our lineage. And we're only lonely
dialog: and unloved right now. Remember,
dialog: I've had two husbands I loved very
dialog: much in my lifetime.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I suppose we are. But things could
dialog: be worse. We could be homeless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd rather be dead than be
dialog: homeless. That's why I need to get

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Way out of your league. Dunno why

speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: be like to be the type of person
dialog: someone like that would date. It
dialog: felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I

dialog: Unfortunately sir the system is
dialog: down right now so I'm not going to
dialog: be able to perform an account
dialog: closure until the system is back
dialog: up. But I can assist you in a
dialog: withdrawal. How much would you like
dialog: to withdraw?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, I'd like to withdraw eight
dialog: hundred dollars.
dialog: 
text: The bank teller smiles at Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: How much are you going to withdraw
dialog: today, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
text: All of it. Just whatever is left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: The system is down, sir. Please
dialog: tell me how much you have in your
dialog: account?
dialog: 
text: At the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over
text: Mark. His face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin
text: to spin in his brain. He is fighting something within.
dialog: 
text: WE FLY into Mark's skull, traveling through his cerebral
text: cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain. Sparks are
text: flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire
text: in rapid succession.
dialog: 
text: There is a small explosion.
dialog: 
text: We fly back out of Mark's skull -- his eyes are locked on the
text: Bank Teller's like a deer in the headlights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (awkwardly fast)
dialog: Eight hundred dollars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Pardon me?
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (more confident)
dialog: I have eight hundred dollars in my
dialog: bank account.
dialog: 
text: The teller locks eyes with Mark... then looks towards her
dialog: computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Wait a second here. The system just
text: came back up.
dialog: (to co-worker)
dialog: System seems to be back up, guys.
dialog: (to Mark)
dialog: Just one second while I access your
dialog: account. You said you're
dialog: withdrawing eight hundred, correct?
dialog: 
text: Mark breaks out in a cold sweat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
text: The bank teller types on her keyboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Well, look at this. It says here
dialog: you've only got three hundred
dialog: dollars in your account. But you
dialog: said you wanted to withdraw eight
dialog: hundred?
dialog: 
text: Mark doesn't know what to say. He tries to speak but nothing
text: comes out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: I apologize for this sir, but it
dialog: seems our system has made a
dialog: mistake. Hold on one second while I
dialog: go and get your eight hundred
dialog: dollars. Did you want that in large
dialog: or small bills?
dialog: 
text: Mark gulps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Large bills.
dialog: 
text: The teller walks away. Mark looks around nervously, awkwardly
text: smiling at the other tellers.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: (to co-worker)
dialog: Guys the computers seem to be a bit
dialog: buggy. Will someone call James to
dialog: come in and look into it, please?
dialog: 
text: Moments later the Bank Teller returns and begins counting out
text: eight hundred dollars for Mark. Mark stares at the money with
text: wide eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: There you are. Eight hundred
dialog: dollars. Anything else I can do for
dialog: you today?
dialog: 
text: In shock, Mark shakes his head. The bank teller smiles big at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK TELLER
dialog: Sometimes our computers can get a
dialog: bit buggy, especially when the
dialog: system goes down. Sorry for any
dialog: inconvenience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's no problem.

dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh,

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We're going to be okay. The world

speaker_heading: CHIP WOMAN

scene_heading: ROULETTE DEALER
text: Twenty-seven red. No one wins.
dialog: 
text: In full view, Mark slides his chips over to twenty-seven red.

speaker_heading: MARK

scene_heading: ROULETTE DEALER
dialog: We have a winner. Congratulations,

dialog: 
text: The dealer stacks up Mark's new chips and pushes them over to

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm on nine black. These are all
dialog: mine.
dialog: 
text: The table cheers for Mark. Some people are a bit confused,
text: and a slight hubbub arises in the background: "I thought I

scene_heading: ROULETTE DEALER

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, sort of.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It was like we couldn't lose.

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Do you have a system?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've got a system.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Well, with your system in just a
dialog: few weeks I figure we could be the
dialog: richest people in the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And then what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Well, here's what I'm thinking. We
dialog: take all the money in the world...
dialog: and put it on black.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why put it on black? Why stop
dialog: there? Put it on a number and get
dialog: thirty five times back.
dialog: 
text: Greg's eyes widen at the thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That's exactly what we'll do.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hold on, I think I found a flaw in
dialog: your plan. How can they pay us if
dialog: we have all the money in the world?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Well, they'd just have to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, they can't because we've got
dialog: it all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Well, they'd better find it. They
dialog: can't let us bet if they're not
dialog: going to pay us back. They'll have
dialog: to just give us the casino.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We already own the casino. We've
dialog: got all the money in the world.
dialog: We'll be betting against ourselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Then we'll go to another casino.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We own that one too. We won that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So we own all the casino's?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: And if we win we can't pay us back

dialog: money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Only one thing we can do then.

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I'm as excited as I've ever been in
dialog: my entire life, and equally scared.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: I'm writing this down in a letter
dialog: in case this thing I've discovered
dialog: somehow ends up killing me. I want
dialog: to ensure that, even if I wasn't
dialog: strong enough to use it, that my
text: invention doesn't once again
dialog: disappear, never to be discovered
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: Mark and the homeless man are at the bank. Mark is talking to

text: The teller leaves and comes back with stacks and stacks of
dialog: cash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: In just a few hours since I
dialog: stumbled upon my discovery I have
dialog: seen its potential for evil and I
dialog: have seen its potential for good.
dialog: 
text: Outside Lecture Films, Mark talks to the woman who was
text: adamant about not wanting to go to work. He whispers a few
text: words into her ear. She smiles, picks up her briefcase and
text: gladly walks into work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: I must be careful with my
dialog: discovery, for at this point I
dialog: barely understand it, let alone
dialog: think I have the power to control
dialog: it. All I know is that if I'm not
dialog: careful I could easily do
dialog: irreparable damage to the world, or
dialog: even cause my own premature death.
dialog: 
text: Mark walks up to the arguing couple at the coffee shop, who
text: are now sitting at different tables, not even looking at each

text: individually, and says a few words to them. Within moments,
text: the two of them are running into each other's arms and making
text: out passionately on the floor of the coffee shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Now, to explain my invention. In
dialog: essence, my creation is the act of
dialog: saying words that simply are not.
dialog: For example, if I tell someone that
dialog: my eyes are blue, then it simply
dialog: becomes fact. I still know that,
dialog: indeed, my eyes are brown, but no
text: one else is aware of this fact, so
dialog: therefore I have blue eyes.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: It's a game of numbers: there is

text: brown eyes, and so many of them who
dialog: do not. The numbers always win.
dialog: 
text: Mark is at the elderly home, walking the halls and whispering
text: to his grandmother and each elderly person he passes, leaving
text: each one of them with a smile upon their faces, and some with
text: tears streaming down their cheeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Whoever is reading this, go ahead
dialog: and try it. Tell someone your eyes
dialog: are a different color then they
dialog: are. I think you'll be amazed at
dialog: the results. It's so simple and
dialog: yet... so powerful... this thing

dialog: 
text: The entire room bursts into applause. Not just normal

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Mark, tell us what it's called.
dialog: 
text: Mark thinks it over for a moment and looks right at Rob.

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Congratulations on selling your
dialog: script today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thanks. Thank you for having dinner
dialog: with me.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Everyone needs to eat.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: And I enjoy your company.
dialog: 
text: Mark smiles. They both sip their drinks and look at their
text: menus. The waiter comes up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I'm an extremely important waiter.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: What can I get you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't want to know what it is, I
dialog: just want to order the most
dialog: expensive thing on the menu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'll have the duck. And I think you
text: look like a little rat faced man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Okay, I'll have those right up for
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: The waiter leaves. Mark and Jennifer stare at each other for
text: a short beat. Something has changed between them and they can
dialog: both feel it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: Things seem to be turning around
dialog: for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Today is the best day of my life.
dialog: Hands down. Easy. Best day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It's not every day you unearth a
dialog: monumental historical event and
dialog: sell it for a ton of money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That wasn't the best part. It was
dialog: great, but it wasn't the peak of my
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I've had a crush on you ever since
dialog: I saw a picture of you on Greg's
dialog: refrigerator two years ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The best part of my day today is
dialog: right now, sitting at this table
dialog: here with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're the most beautiful woman
dialog: I've ever seen in my life, and
dialog: you're special... and it makes me
dialog: happy to be around you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer is touched...but she doesn't reciprocate Mark's
text: feelings. Jennifer moves on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Tell me something about your
dialog: family. I really don't know much
dialog: about you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Ah, my family. We're what you'd
dialog: probably call "not lucky". My whole
dialog: family is kind of marked by
dialog: tragedy, bad luck and general...
dialog: shittiness. It goes back a long
dialog: ways and could probably drive
dialog: someone to suicide just hearing
dialog: about it, so I'll keep it simple.
dialog: My mom died when I was six. Cancer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Sad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And my dad got real depressed and
text: lost his job. Out of work and with
dialog: a kid to raise he had no choice but
dialog: to turn to a life of crime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What kind of crime?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He was a robber. Houses mostly.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK'S DAD (O.S.)
dialog: (on answer machine)
dialog: Hi, I'm calling to let you know
dialog: I'll be robbing your house today.
dialog: I'll probably be there within the
dialog: hour.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He was a very unlucky man. He spent
dialog: his last days behind bars. I never
dialog: really knew him.
dialog: (sad moment; pause)
dialog: But I guess I've also had a little
dialog: luck in my life. I did have a
dialog: wonderful grandmother who raised
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh, that's sweet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, she's great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Old person's home obviously. Who
dialog: wants to live with that? Gross.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I know, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But I'm going to get her out of
dialog: there tomorrow.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (cont'd)
dialog: I'm going to buy her a big
dialog: beautiful mansion where she can
dialog: spend her few remaining days in
dialog: luxury.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: 
text: The waiter arrives with their food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I don't know what's wrong with the
dialog: chef today, but these just look
dialog: awful.
dialog: 
text: He places them down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They look fine to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Well, you're stupid.
dialog: 
text: Mark and Jennifer begin eating. Mark wants to say something
text: and takes a moment to summon the courage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Right. I was thinking that since
dialog: I'm going to be rich and successful
dialog: now that I might be in your league.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: And that maybe we could be
text: together. Romantically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What would be the point?
dialog: 
dialog: Mark didn't expect this answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well, I don't know, maybe we might
dialog: enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good
dialog: together and could have a happy
dialog: life, raise a family together.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer thinks this over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well, I do like you. And I enjoy
dialog: your company.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (cont'd)
dialog: And if we were to get together and
dialog: procreate I would like the
dialog: offspring that are carrying half my
dialog: genetic code to be well taken care
dialog: of and financially stable. I also
dialog: think you'd make a good father and
dialog: a good husband, which I like.
dialog: 
text: Mark smiles. This is going well...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good. Fantastic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Unfortunately, none of that changes
dialog: the fact that you'd still be
dialog: contributing half of the genetic
dialog: code to our children.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I don't want short, fat kids with
text: little snub noses.
dialog: 
text: And that's the end of that. Mark nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Mark takes a bite of his food. Jennifer smiles and does the
text: same, oblivious to Mark's pain.
dialog: 
text: Mark's cell phone rings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (ON PHONE)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Mark's face melts in terror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (ON PHONE)
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY)
speaker_heading: WHAT?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mark bursts into the hospital room to find his grandmother,
text: MARTHA looking tired and scared, hooked up to dozens of
text: machines, the heart monitor beeping ominously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Grandma, they just called me.
dialog: What's going on? Are you okay?
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don't know, I fell on my way back
dialog: to my room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What do the doctors say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: They say I'll probably die tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: There's a knock on the door. The doctor enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Oh, hello. I was just coming in to
dialog: check on her, you must be Martha
dialog: Bellison's grandson.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What are you talking about she's
dialog: going to die?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'm sorry. It just doesn't look
dialog: good. She's suffered a major heart
text: attack and her heart is very weak,
dialog: her pulse not very strong, her
text: blood pressure is dropping rapidly
dialog: and most likely she'll have a fatal
text: heart attack during the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
text: The doctor checks Martha's chart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yup, still going to die.
dialog: 
text: Mark sits down next to Martha, in total shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt
dialog: something for you two, but I really
dialog: don't. I do this exact thing about
dialog: thirty times a night and it's
dialog: really hardened me to human
dialog: suffering. On a side note, it's
dialog: fajita night at the cafeteria
dialog: downstairs. You might think about
text: grabbing a bite to eat there after
dialog: your grandma dies.
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The doctor leaves. Mark holds his grandmother's hand, her
text: hand is shaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want
dialog: to die. You know, people don't talk
dialog: about it much, but death is a
dialog: horrible thing. One minute you're
dialog: alive, there's a whole world around
dialog: you, humming and jumping, people
text: coming in and out, doors opening
dialog: and closing, love and anger and the
dialog: whole mess of it all, and then like
dialog: that, it's all gone.
speaker_heading: (CRYING)
dialog: This is it Mark, only a few hours
dialog: left of this until an eternity of
text: nothingness.
dialog: 
text: The wheels in Mark's head are spinning again. Suddenly the
text: heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in
dialog: pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Grandma!
dialog: 
text: Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button,
text: holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain.
dialog: 
text: Seconds later three nurses burst into the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE #1
text: She's seizing.
dialog: 
text: Nurse #2 begins filling a syringe. Mark sits by his
text: grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'm scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Listen closely to me, Grandma. I
dialog: have a surprise for you.
dialog: 
text: We focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another
text: as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're wrong about what happens
dialog: when you die. It's not an eternity
text: of nothingness.
dialog: 
text: Martha is hanging on to every word Mark is saying.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: When you die you're going to go to
dialog: your favorite place in the whole
dialog: world. And you're going to be with
dialog: all of the people you've ever loved
dialog: and who have ever loved you. And
dialog: you're going to be young again, and
dialog: you'll be able to run through the
dialog: fields and dance and jump, and
dialog: there will be no sadness, no pain,
dialog: just love and laughing and
dialog: happiness. There will be ponies
dialog: made of gold, and everyone will
text: live in giant mansions, and
dialog: everything will smell like cookies.
dialog: And it will last for an eternity,
text: Grandma. An eternity.
dialog: 
text: Tears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile
text: overtakes her face.
dialog: 
text: Mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all
text: staring at Mark in total shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE #1
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What else happens?
dialog: 
text: The cardiogram flat lines.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Do your jobs!
dialog: 
text: Everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're going to be happy forever,
dialog: grandma. I promise you. Say hello
dialog: to my mom for me. Tell her I love
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: Again, everyone has stopped helping Martha, they're all
text: listening intently. Some of them are crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE #2
speaker_heading: (TEARFULLY)
dialog: I'm going to see my mother again
dialog: when I die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Tell us more, please.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Martha stops breathing. The machine flatlines. And with that
text: Martha is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Damn it.
dialog: 
text: Mark turns away from his grandmother. Standing outside in the
text: hallway is Jennifer, watching Mark with true empathy in her
text: eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mark and Jennifer pull up in front of Jennifer's apartment.
text: There is a long beat of silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm so sorry, Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I think I just did something bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Do you want to come inside?
dialog: 
text: Mark nods his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mark and Jennifer sit side-by-side on her couch. Mark holds a
text: can of beer in his hand, gently turning it around in his
text: palm, staring down at it vacantly.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer sadly watches Mark.
dialog: 
text: Slowly and almost absentmindedly, Jennifer's hand moves over
text: and rests gently upon Mark's wrist, settling there.
dialog: 
text: We hold on them for a long beat.
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
dialog: 
text: THE NEXT MORNING
dialog: 
text: Mark and Jennifer have fallen asleep in the exact same
text: position, both of them sitting side-by-side no the couch, her
text: hand still on his wrist.
dialog: 
text: Mark opens his eyes and looks down at her hand, then up at
text: Jennifer who slowly opens her eyes and smiles at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
text: They share a moment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S CAR - MORNING
dialog: 
text: A bleary eyed Mark drives home from Jennifer's. As he turns
text: onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way. A
text: massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking.
dialog: 
text: Mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of
text: people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building.
dialog: 
text: Standing by his door is the NURSE from the hospital. She
text: immediately points at Mark and screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE #1
dialog: There he is!
dialog: 
text: Mark is bum-rushed by a question-asking throng. All of them
text: are pelting Mark with questions, all of them confused and
text: hopeful and desperately looking for answers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERSON #1
dialog: Is there only one place you go when
dialog: you die?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERSON #2
dialog: Will everyone who has ever died be
dialog: there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERSON #3
dialog: What's this place called?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERSON #4
dialog: Will I get to have sex with people
dialog: there?
dialog: 
text: Mark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all. He gets
text: to his door and opens it, only to have the Nurse step in his
text: path and block the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE #1
dialog: You owe us an explanation. If you
dialog: know something this important, you
dialog: better tell us all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Who are you people?
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE #1
dialog: The words you spoke last night, to
dialog: your grandmother, spread like
dialog: wildfire. Please, tell us more.
dialog: Explain what you said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Fine, fine, just give me a minute.
dialog: 
text: Mark pushes past her and into his building, closing the door
text: behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer. His mind is
text: reeling. As he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees
text: the letter: "MY INVENTION". Mark eyes it ominously.
dialog: 
text: The phone rings. Mark screens the call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (V.O.)
dialog: (leaving message)
dialog: You've been gone for twenty minutes
dialog: and I turn on the T.V to see you on
dialog: every station. What's going on?
dialog: This is seriously the weirdest
dialog: thing...
dialog: 
text: Mark picks up the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Remember last night when I said I
dialog: think I did something bad? Well now
dialog: I know I did something bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: They're saying that you know
dialog: something different about what
dialog: happens after you die.
dialog: 
text: Mark walks into his bedroom and turns on the TV. Sure enough
text: there's a newscaster on his lawn, giving a report, with a
text: banner on the screen that reads, "New Death Discoveries".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 
text: Mark puts down the phone and listens to the T.V.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER (ON T.V)
dialog: Twenty-four hours ago, Mark
dialog: Bellison was just your typical
dialog: nobody writer.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER (ON T.V) (cont'd)
dialog: Today, people are saying he knows
dialog: new information about what happens

dialog: 
text: Mark puts the phone to his ear again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Mark, what do you know? What did
dialog: you tell your grandmother last
dialog: night? What's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I can't explain it all right now.
dialog: Why don't you come over?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now
text: even larger than before. As she reaches the door Mark opens
text: it for her and slides her through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Come up quick, they look like they
dialog: could get out of hand any second.
dialog: 
text: Mark hurries Jennifer into the elevator.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Jennifer sits on the couch while Mark, agitated beyond
text: recognition, paces the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just tell me what you told your
dialog: grandmother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't think I should. Who knows
dialog: what could happen next? I'm just
dialog: going to keep my mouth shut from
dialog: now on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What you said obviously affected a
dialog: lot of people. I don't think you
dialog: have the choice to keep it in now.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sure I do. I could just walk out
dialog: that door and get on a plane and go
dialog: to Namibia. No one knows me in
dialog: Namibia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just tell me what you said. Please,
dialog: Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: My grandmother was dying, and she
text: was terrified, shaking all over.
dialog: She didn't want to just become
dialog: nothingness. So I told her that
dialog: when she died there wouldn't be
dialog: nothingness. That she would be with
dialog: all of the people she loved who had
dialog: died and that she would live an
dialog: eternity of joy and happiness.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer's heart skips a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (barely able to speak)
dialog: How do you know these things?
dialog: 
text: Mark sighs and looks out the window. The crowd extends down
text: the block, all of them sitting calmly on his lawn, talking
text: quietly to each other, trying to make sense of it all.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer gets up and stands beside Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You have to tell them everything
dialog: you know. This is too big. You have
dialog: no choice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But you don't understand. The words
dialog: I said... they weren't... it's not
dialog: right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: How did your grandmother feel when
dialog: you told her these things?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
text: Happy. At peace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: And how did that make you feel?
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: (sweeping her hand over
dialog: the crowd)
dialog: Think how good it will feel to do
dialog: the same for all of these people.
dialog: 
text: Mark thinks this over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Okay. But I need a few hours to get
dialog: my thoughts together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'll go tell them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wait! Are you sure this is right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Of course it is. You know something
dialog: that's going to change mankind
dialog: forever. It's the most important
dialog: thing the world has ever heard.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer leaves the room. Mark, alone with his thoughts, sits
text: down at his kitchen table, pulls out a few sheets of paper,

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: and make his announcement.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mark is hunched over his table writing. There's a knock at

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I brought pizza. How come you never
dialog: told me we all get mansions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I didn't...

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Inventing the bicycle is one thing,

speaker_heading: WOMAN #4
dialog: But what if they try to find me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They won't. They hate you too.

speaker_heading: WOMAN #1
dialog: What about being late for work?

dialog:

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: WOMAN #2
dialog: What about if you forget to feed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It would?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well no, I mean...
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Don't go out with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Why not? He's a great match for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's he got that I don't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: We talked about this. If you and I
dialog: got together it wouldn't be fair to
dialog: our kids. They have the right to be
dialog: attractive and have good genes.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: If Rob and I get married You can
dialog: move into our mansion with us when
dialog: we all die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't want to move into your
dialog: fucking mansion. And what are you
dialog: doing thinking about marriage with
dialog: him already? You haven't even gone
dialog: on one date.
dialog: 
text: Mark sits down.

dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
text: It's like nothing's changed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: A lot of things have changed. I

dialog: 
text: There's a knock at the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: That's him. Gotta go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He's picking you up here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It was his idea.
dialog: 
text: Mark stands up, in shock and follows Jennifer to the front
text: door. She opens the door to find Rob looking handsome and
dialog: arrogant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: What's up? Wow, I can't wait to
dialog: have sex with you.
dialog: 
text: Rob notices Mark in his boxers and a bathrobe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh hey there, Mark. You look like

dialog: Come on Jennifer, let's go have

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're all gay!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And adopted!
dialog: 
text: Mark and Greg almost roll into the pool they're laughing so

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Out of beer. Just Coke.
dialog: 
text: Mark tosses Greg a Coke and sits down on his chaise lounge,
text: cracking open his Coke and taking a sip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want to do something big again.
dialog: Like telling the people what
dialog: happens when they die. That felt
dialog: good. I gotta do something big like

dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: 
text: Mark looks down at his can of Coke.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON COKE CAN: The warning label is extremely long and

dialog: FOR YOU. The following are diseases, physical ailments and
dialog: general health issues that coke might cause:"
dialog: 
text: The label then goes on to list dozens of ailments. Mark's
text: eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says
dialog: simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own
dialog: risk."
dialog: 
text: Mark looks over to find Greg staring at the depressing label
dialog: as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I

dialog: 
text: Mark stares at this label for a moment, thinking. With his

dialog: Enjoy Coke."
dialog: 
text: He smiles widely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hey, Greg. What if I told you that

dialog: 
text: Greg turns to him, his face full of hope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And not just Coke. But all the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Gentleman, thank you all for coming

dialog: some very big news for you all
dialog: today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: Is it from the Man in the Sky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Nope, this one I came up with all
dialog: on my own. And it's going to change
dialog: the way you all do business...
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
text: Mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the
text: far wall. Mark starts a slide show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Up until now, all products sold
dialog: worldwide have warning labels
text: printed on them. Warnings like
dialog: these.
dialog: 
text: SERIES OF SLIDES: We see the same warning we just saw on the
text: Coke can, a commercial jet with "This Plane Might Crash --
text: Four Of Our Other Ones Did" printed on its side, a car
text: dashboard light reading "This Car will Ignite Upon Impact -
text: Always", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground
text: meat that reads "Injected with hormones that make it taste
dialog: better -- but will eventually give you cancer".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: As you can see, a lot of these
dialog: products can be very depressing.
dialog: They remind people of all the
dialog: horrible things that can happen to
dialog: them in life. People hate thinking
dialog: about horrible things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: Yeah, but they have to know those
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2 (cont'd)
dialog: They have to be able to protect
dialog: themselves.
dialog: I don't want to hurt anyone.
dialog: Especially now that I know about
dialog: the "bad place".
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the room shudders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to
dialog: introduce you to the future of your
dialog: companies.
dialog: 
text: Mark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads,
dialog: "Coke -- Tastes Great! And It's Good For You!"
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the room "ahhhs".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3
dialog: Where can I get some of that
dialog: healthy coke?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
text: It's the same Coke as before.
dialog: 
text: The executives all squint their eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #4
dialog: But this one is healthy! And it
dialog: tastes great!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: Do you have any samples?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Guys, it's the same Coke on the
dialog: inside. I've just changed the
text: outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
speaker_heading: (REVELATION)
text: Somehow by changing the outside,
dialog: he's also changed the inside!
dialog: 
text: Everyone "aaahs" in understanding. Mark sighs and changes the
text: slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words
text: "Completely Safe" writing on the outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: Oh, thank goodness. I've always
dialog: hated flying!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3
dialog: Me too!
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #4
dialog: What an invention! How did you do
dialog: it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I didn't do anything, guys. I made
dialog: this on my computer last night. The
dialog: plane is exactly the same as it was
dialog: before.
dialog: 
text: Nobody in the room gets it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: That's the only plane I'll ever fly
dialog: on again!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's the point here guys. With
dialog: these new advertising strategies,
dialog: people will buy your products with
dialog: abandon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: But it will take years to replace
dialog: all of our stock with these new
dialog: improved products you've invented.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No. It won't. All you have to do is
dialog: print these words on the packaging.
dialog: That's it.
dialog: 
text: Mark changes the slide again: The car dashboard light now
text: reads, "This Car Prevents Crashes", and another slide that
text: shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, "This Meat
dialog: Actually Cures Cancer".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Even if you don't understand it,
dialog: just start shipping these products
dialog: out to people as you see them here
dialog: and you're all going to get very,
dialog: very rich.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3
dialog: How did you do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Look, they're still the same
dialog: products you have on the shelves
dialog: right now. The only difference now
dialog: is that people won't get bummed out
dialog: or scared when they use them. Isn't
dialog: that a good thing?
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The executives all nod their heads in agreement and rise to
text: shake Mark's hand.

speaker_heading: MARK

scene_heading: INT. BAR - MORNING

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Are you all right, sir?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAT MAN

scene_heading: BACK ON MARK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You should slow down there, Greg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Why's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Just because the package says it's
dialog: not bad for you doesn't mean you
dialog: have to gorge yourself on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: But it tastes so good.
dialog: 
text: Greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth.

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: BUSINESS MAN

speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND

dialog: Everyone's happy but me. Because
dialog: I'm the only one who knows it
dialog: all... isn't. I made it all up.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: You're not up there living in a

dialog: ground. That's all. And I'm the
dialog: only one who knows that.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: And the one thing I want I can't
dialog: have. Because the world is too
dialog: stupid to change. The world only
dialog: cares about what they can see, and
dialog: what they can know, and what
dialog: they're used to and what... makes
dialog: sense. No one listens to what they
dialog: really want. And that's why I'll

speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I only have a few years to marry

dialog: financial stability so I can have
dialog: children and the family I've always
dialog: wanted. One day I'll be old and
text: wrinkly and ugly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Do me this favor. Just one favor.
dialog: Don't accept everything you see.
dialog: Don't just do something because
dialog: that's the way it's done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You're confusing me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Think about what you want. Find out
dialog: what you really want. And if it's
dialog: not the same as what I want, well
dialog: then I'll know that and I'll never

speaker_heading: (PAUSE)

speaker_heading: LATER.
dialog: 
text: Mark has fallen asleep on the couch. Jennifer checks her

text: lays it on the coffee table by Mark.
dialog: 
text: She unfolds a blanket and is about to place it on him when

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jennifer reaches the altar and stands across from Rob. The
text: WEDDING OVERSEER, an elderly man in a suit, stands between
text: them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEDDING OVERSEER
dialog: We are sitting here in this
dialog: building today to share in the
text: wedding of Rob and Jennifer. Two
dialog: young, attractive people who have
dialog: agreed that this union would be
dialog: mutually beneficial and that their
dialog: genetic match-up would most likely
dialog: produce favorable offspring and a
dialog: life of financial stability and
dialog: physical security.
dialog: 
text: Both Rob and Jennifer nod at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEDDING OVERSEER
dialog: Rob, do you promise to stay with
dialog: Jennifer for as long as you want to
dialog: and to protect your offspring for
dialog: as long as you can?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEDDING OVERSEER
dialog: Jennifer, do you promise to stay
dialog: with Rob for as long as you want to
dialog: and to protect your offspring for
dialog: as long as you can?
dialog: 
text: Jennifer doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEDDING OVERSEER
dialog: Jennifer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (to Overseer)
dialog: I'm sorry, hold on one second.
dialog: (to Rob)
dialog: Rob, can I ask you something?
dialog: 
text: There's a slight hubbub in the room. Mark perks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
speaker_heading: (CONCERNED)
dialog: Sure. But what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What color are my eyes?
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I dunno...
speaker_heading: (LOOKING)
dialog: Oh, they're brown.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON Jennifer's eyes. Indeed, they are brown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No Rob, they're blue.
dialog: 
text: Rob looks again. Mark stirs in his seat, amazed by what he's
dialog: hearing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh, look at that. So they are.
dialog: You've got pretty blue eyes.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN on Jennifer. It works. Her mind is reeling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Can we get on with this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEDDING OVERSEER
dialog: Jennifer, do you promise to stay
dialog: with Rob for as long as you want to
dialog: and to protect your offspring for
dialog: as long as you can?
dialog: 
text: Jennifer is confused. Her mind is fighting it, but she
text: doesn't know what exactly she's fighting. Finally...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
text: There is a sigh of relief from the room. Mark shakes his head
dialog: in sadness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEDDING OVERSEER
dialog: Before I pronounce these two man
dialog: and wife, is there anyone here who
dialog: thinks they'd offer either of these
dialog: people a better genetic match-up?
dialog: 
text: Mark bolts up in his chair.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Me.
dialog: 
text: The whole room gasps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh come on. Look at you. You can't
dialog: be better.
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Schmuck genes? What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And I love her.
dialog: (to Jennifer)
dialog: Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this
dialog: what you really want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (pause; unsure)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
text: Mark thinks this over for a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: All right. I'm done. Goodbye.
dialog: 
text: Awkwardly Mark makes his way to the aisle and leaves the
text: room. The room is thick with tension.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Are we married yet? Because I've
dialog: got plans this afternoon.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. "CHURCH" - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and
text: towards the street.
dialog: 
text: In the background we can see the "church" door open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: Hold on a minute!
dialog: 
text: Mark turns, confused and tired.
dialog: 
text: Jennifer runs to him. She stands before him, they both stare
text: at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Jennifer pulls out Mark's letter and shows it to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: So am I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Is any of it... the things you
dialog: said... are they... I can't think
dialog: of the word.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Is there a Man in the Sky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Why'd you say there was?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Because I couldn't cope with the
text: look on my grandmother's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: But how could you say something
dialog: that... wasn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm not sure. I just did it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: And what did you mean that I could
dialog: grow old and ugly and still be
dialog: beautiful to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I mean just that. You'll always be
dialog: beautiful to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: But what if my looks...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It doesn't matter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I feel funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Everything is so hard. Nothing is
dialog: easy anymore.
dialog: 
text: There is a long moment of silence. Jennifer moves closer to
text: Mark and looks directly into his eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I know what I want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I want short, fat kids with little
text: snub noses.
dialog: 
text: The biggest smile we've ever seen comes across Mark's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (JUBILANTLY)
dialog: Easy! That's an easy one.
dialog: 
text: Just like she did the night on her couch, Jennifer reaches
text: over and puts her hand on Mark's wrist. They both stare at
text: each other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from
text: both of them.
dialog: 
text: The world is changing before their eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Does anyone else know about your
dialog: invention?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No. But I'm sure it won't be long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Should we tell them right away?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm not sure. I don't think
dialog: everyone will understand.
dialog: 
text: Greg sticks his head out of the church door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What's going on out here?
text: Everyone's just sitting in there.
dialog: Are we gonna finish this wedding?
dialog: 
text: Jennifer smiles at Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Mark smiles back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Praise the Man in the Sky.
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: WE RISE UP as Mark and Jennifer walk hand in hand towards the
text: church -- and an unknowable future.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: The world's last moment of honesty.
dialog: A monumental occasion in the
dialog: history of mankind.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: That lowly writer who stumbled upon
dialog: the ability to lie went on to
dialog: become one of the most important
dialog: men of his age, married to one of
dialog: the most beautiful women of his
dialog: time, and passed on the lying gene
dialog: to generations to come.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: A world without honesty is a world
text: with dreams. A world with pretense.
text: A world with fiction. A world with
dialog: flattery. And most importantly, a
dialog: world with true love. Put simply, a
dialog: world very much like our own.
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
