dialog: 
text: A MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck
text: tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the
text: bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO.
dialog: 
text: He rises his face to the sun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO(V.O.)
dialog: I think about the price. The price
dialog: of appetite. The cost of
dialog: forgetting who we are. Pretending
dialog: we are... who we will never be...
dialog: 
text: He looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for
text: decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in
dialog: sunshine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
dialog: So easy to pretend we are not to
dialog: blame. That a demon enters us.
dialog: No... The demon is inside. We just
dialog: make potions that release it.
dialog: 
text: The muscles of his neck tense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
dialog: There's no revenge for all they
dialog: have taken. No justice. It simply
dialog: is...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
dialog: And still. They must be forced to
dialog: look at all they have destroyed. By
dialog: having the same done to them. Or
dialog: they will forget... Forget they are
dialog: human. Believe they are as
dialog: different as they feel... Then they
dialog: are the lion, and everything we
dialog: loved and lost, simply its meal.
dialog: 
text: We hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not
dialog: to drown.
dialog: 
text: Only now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the
dialog: water.
dialog: 
text: He lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him
text: back under. Looks out. Lost in thought.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We watch from the beach as Alejandro stands in the ocean to
text: his belly, the sun high overhead.

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (Whispered) Our Father, who art in

dialog: 
text: A VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thy will be done, on Earth as it is
dialog: in Heaven.
dialog: 
text: TWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE
text: DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up.
text: CAMERA is so close to the woman's face, it almost touches
text: her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting...
dialog: 
text: We are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast
text: and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of
text: a crumbling house.
dialog: 
text: They all rise and leap from the vehicle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
dialog: 
text: WE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she
text: runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Give us this day... our daily
dialog: bread...
dialog: 
text: They reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls
text: like a drawbridge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: And forgive us our trespasses as we
dialog: forgive those who trespass against
dialog: us.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she
dialog: has to kill anyone, or be killed herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: And lead us not into temptation but
dialog: deliver us from evil...
dialog: 
text: SWAT officers rush in, screaming.
dialog: 
text: Macy's turn: She runs through the busted door-
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRACT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: In the hallway now. The chaos is closer. She hurries the
dialog: words. So close now...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: For Thine is the Kingdom the power
dialog: and glory forever and ever amen
text: DOWN MOTHER FUCKER!! DOWN DOWN
dialog: DOWN!!!
dialog: 
text: Two LATINO MEN, 20'S, are slammed to the ground. Another
text: LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN
text: AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his
text: neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward.
dialog: 
text: Macy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house,
text: running past a bedroom with an open door.
dialog: 
text: From the corner of her eye she sees:
dialog: 
text: A MAN POINTING A SHOTGUN AT HER.
dialog: 
text: She ducks as a SHOTGUN BLAST rips 10 inches of dry wall above
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: She turns, pressing the CAMERA against the wall. We watch
text: over her shoulder as she returns fire.
dialog: 
text: A rooster tail of shell casings are thrown over us, invading
text: our view. Bullet after bullet pound him. The man's knees
dialog: give. He's falling...
dialog: 
text: A round hits him in the face and he is thrown back -- blood,
text: brain, and skull fragments explode like shrapnel on the wall
text: behind him.
dialog: 
text: Adrenaline hits her like a fever. She gets dizzy, sits
text: against the wall, gasping for breath. A SWAT officer rushes
dialog: to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWAT OFFICER
dialog: YOU HIT??
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I'm good. I'm good.
dialog: 
text: The SWAT officer looks at the hole in the drywall. Leans
dialog: forward. Looks closer... What the fuck IS that??
dialog: 
text: His face now inches from the hole then jumps back like he was
text: bitten by a snake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWAT OFFICER
dialog: WHAT THE FUCK??
dialog: 
scene_heading: WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:
dialog: 
text: The SKULL OF A MAN. Dry skin sunken into bones like
text: cellophane.
dialog: 
text: Macy stands up and turns around. Looks at it. Trying to
text: process what she's seeing. She walks up and starts pulling at
text: the drywall. Other officers join her. They yank and tear a
text: six foot hole in the wall, then stand back, speechless.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bodies are standing side by side. A lime-green dust has
text: spilled out on the floor.
dialog: 
text: The entire house is a tomb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- LATER.
dialog: 
text: Macy sits on the porch. Swallows water from a bottle. Holds
text: it down maybe ten seconds. Vomits... We see another SWAT
text: OFFICER doing the same.
dialog: 
text: FBI AGENT REGGIE WAYNE, 30, African American, walks from the
text: house, fighting the same urge. Sits beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Can't shake the smell. Just sits in
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yeah... Sorry I wasn't on your six.
text: Got wrapped up in the front room.
dialog: 
text: Macy nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I saw.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She looks out over the sea of POLICE VEHICLES on the street
scene_heading: and spots PHOENIX HOMICIDE DETECTIVE LANCE ALVAREZ, 45,
text: heading right for them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Loan you SWAT and you hand us three
dialog: dozen homicides. I oughta fucking
dialog: pepper spray you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Couldn't smell any worse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Ha ha. You're not the one gotta
dialog: clean this shit up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Yeah. Thirty families without a
dialog: father's real funny, but you keep
dialog: worrying about what it does to your
dialog: weekend, Lance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Listen you fucking --
dialog: 
text: Reggie is on his feet in an instant and inches from Lance's
dialog: face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I didn't hear you, you say
dialog: something?
dialog: 
text: Lance swallows his anger and his pride, walks toward the
dialog: house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Clear your people out, it's our
text: crime scene now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: It's your crime scene when I GIVE
dialog: IT TO YOU!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What are the chances they'll put
dialog: together a case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: ... None.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Look.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She turns and sees: FBI REGIONAL DIRECTOR DAVE JENNINGS, 50,
text: leather skin stretched over a square jaw that rests on broad
text: shoulders. Beside him is DEPUTY DIRECTOR PHIL COOPER, 40,
text: balding and thin, exactly the man you want analyzing data.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever seen him at a crime scene?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Jennings and Phil reach her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wanna give me the tour?
dialog: 
text: She doesn't but she will.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRACT HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: No dry wall anywhere now: the walls have been stripped to the
text: frame, exposing another DOZEN BODIES. CORONERS in protective
text: suits remove them as DETECTIVES photograph the scene. The
dialog: smell is atrocious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Looks like Sinaloa...
dialog: 
text: Jennings nods and sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: Yeah. (To a coroner) How many
dialog: total?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: Between here and the hall we have
dialog: thirty, but there's more in the
dialog: back bedroom and we haven't looked
text: in the attic or under the crawl
dialog: space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: (To Phil) Call DOJ in Washington,
dialog: let em know what we have.
dialog: 
text: Phil nods, pulls his cell and steps away.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNINGS (CONT'D)
dialog: This one of the houses owned by
dialog: Manuel Diaz?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: No way to connect him, but he owns
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: The smell is getting to Reggie. Doesn't look like he's going
dialog: to make it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go ahead and step out, it's okay.
dialog: 
dialog: Don't have to tell him twice.
dialog: 
text: Jennings walks to the wall. Studies the faces -- one in
text: particular, tinted an ashy green from lye and months of decay
text: -- his mouth open wide and eyes shut so tight that his brow
text: is a tangle of wrinkles, as though he is suffering his death
dialog: for eternity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT.
dialog: 
text: We see a GARAGE, and to it's left A STORAGE SHED. AN OFFICER
text: yanks boxes and garbage from it, tossing it on the driveway.
text: He reaches the floor, which is covered with rubber matts. He
text: pulls one up and discovers a 3' X 3' piece of plywood hinged
text: to the floor and locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER
text: I NEED BOLT CUTTERS.
dialog: 
text: They are brought over and the lock is cut. The officer kneels
text: down. Lifts the hatch a little. Looks under, flashlight in
dialog: hand...
dialog: 
text: -- WE ARE UNDERNEATH THE PLYWOOD, FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES --
dialog: 
text: As the hatch is lifted -- TWO HOOKS with wires are visible to
text: our left and right. As the hatch is lifted, the wires pull
text: tighter... We see where they lead: TWO GRENADES.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRACT HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- CONT.
dialog: 
text: Jennings and Macy walk down the hall. Jennings stops at the
text: body of the man Macy killed, then notices --
dialog: 
text: Through a screen door at the end of the hall -- officers
text: rushing toward the shed.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: PD found something.
dialog: 
text: Macy and Jennings walk outside. As the sunlight hits them,
text: the officer open the hatch, the wires pull tight and we hear
dialog: a `clink'.
dialog: 
text: -- THE GRENADES EXPLODE. TWO OFFICERS BLOWN TO OBLIVION --
dialog: 
text: Dust, debris, smoke, and pieces of them roll toward Jennings
text: and Macy like a wave, swallowing them.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE -- DAY.

text: back, we hear the sounds of a NEWS REPORT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: Phoenix police have released no
dialog: details, but there HAS BEEN an
text: explosion at a house in South
dialog: Phoenix.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PIVOTS and we are looking at a TV across a flawlessly
text: decorated living room. Aerial footage of the tract house and
text: obliterated storage plays.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: You can clearly see two bodies
text: covered in tarps but Phoenix Police
dialog: will not release names or even
text: confirm the deaths. Witnesses on
dialog: the scene state that a warrant was
dialog: served at the house an hour BEFORE
dialog: the explosion, so the speculation
dialog: is the deceased are Phoenix police
speaker_heading: OFFICERS --
dialog: 
text: A MAN leans into frame. His head slowly shakes as he watches
text: and listens. A cell phone rings. He answers it, mutes the TV,
text: and retreats out of frame, leaving us to watch the news in
text: silence, as the sounds of children splashing and laughing
text: wafts in through an open window.

scene_heading: INT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT.
dialog:

text: drain. Dirt, blood, and small fragments of pink, white, and
text: navy blue circle the drain as gravity carries them to the
text: sewers of Phoenix.
dialog: 
text: Dark brown hair is vigorously scrubbed. Macy does not relax
dialog: in this shower-- that is not its purpose. The purpose is to
dialog: decontaminate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER.
dialog: 
text: Macy stands in front of the mirror, brushing her hair. There
text: are abrasions on her cheek and a deep cut that runs down from
text: the corner of her eye-- like she cried a scar.
dialog: 
text: The hair brush catches. Pulls her head back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
speaker_heading: OW.
dialog: 
text: She extracts the brush. Feels around on her scalp and
text: retrieves a piece of bone. Looks at it...
dialog: 
text: She wraps it in toilet paper, sets it on the counter, and
text: gets back in the shower. Turns it on. Gonna try this again...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MACY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The decor is Spare. Functional and nothing more. Doesn't even

text: Her COMPUTER CHIRPS. ROSALYN4620 is asking that she chat.

speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: REALLY TOUGH--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSALYN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MOM (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MOM (V.O.)
dialog: It's my birthday goddammit-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I'm signing on.
dialog: 
text: She hits a button on her computer and ROSALYN MACY, 60 today,
text: appears. She leans back and forth in front of the lens, still
text: unsure about this technology that beams her image through
dialog: space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Can you see me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Stay in one place, Mom. Happy

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Can you see me? I don't see you.
dialog: Lean forward -- there you are...
dialog: What happened to your face?
dialog: 
text: Rosalyn's happy mood is gone.

speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Nothing. It's something on your

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Kate. I can see it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Like I said, rough day.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: MACY

speaker_heading: MOM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well... I hope you two will become

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You look tired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I am... (forces a smile) Happy

dialog: 60?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It would feel a lot better with a

speaker_heading: UNREAS--
dialog:

speaker_heading: MACY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Know what's going on?

speaker_heading: MACY

dialog: 
text: All these men look important, except one: MATT GRAVES, 40,
text: golf shirt, bit of a belly, red, shaggy hair -- looks like a
dialog: tourist. His demeanor is easy, you almost get the sense he's
text: having fun. Macy turns around and rests her head against the

speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: I need coffee.

text: She looks at Matt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MACY
text: None of this is in his file.

speaker_heading: BURNETT
dialog: With good reason.

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MACY

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: ELISEO
dialog: Si Papa! Tenemos que ir!
dialog: 
text: The boy pulls with all his might. Silvio makes a show of
text: resisting, then climbs out of bed. Eliseo keeps a tight hold
text: of his hand, and walks him down a hall to a small kitchen
text: with adobe walls and a dirt floor. An opening leads to a

dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: He sits down. She scoops eggs onto a plate with tortillas,
text: drops it in front of him. Hands him a coffee. He sniffs it,
text: hands it back. Without a word she pours in two fingers of
text: tequila.
dialog: 
text: The boy stares at his father with endless joy. No idea how
dialog: unlucky he is.

dialog: morning.
dialog: 
text: Two ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS drive past.
dialog: 
text: Silvio and Eliseo wander away, Eliseo's tiny hand clinging to
text: Silvio's police belt. Eliseo has his father for the whole day

text: The man makes a half hearted attempt at attacking Alejandro,

dialog: 
text: They walk a few steps and the man tries it again. Alejandro's

dialog: have to rob a guy from Delta... Be
dialog: careful on the turn-around -- if a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I'm not authorized to --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Fine. Stay here.
dialog: 
text: She shifts her weight. Hesitates...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: But you don't want to, do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I just wanna know what I'm getting
dialog: INTO --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You asked to get on this train.
dialog: Because you KNOW you're not
dialog: stopping anything in Phoenix.
dialog: You're just sweeping up the mess.
dialog: In six months, every house you raid
dialog: will be rigged with explosives...
dialog: You want to find the men
dialog: responsible? This is where we
dialog: start.
dialog: 
text: He walks off.
dialog: 
text: After a moment, she follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CESAR CHAVEZ BORDER HIGHWAY -- EL PASO -- DAY.
dialog: 
text: FIVE CHEVY TAHOES, sirens on the dashboard move through El
dialog: Paso.
dialog: 
text: We watch from above as they cut their way through traffic...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONT.
dialog: 
text: Macy sits in the back beside Alejandro. He holds a rifle
text: between his legs, barrel pointed down. Macy notices his right
text: hand -- his finger rests on the button that rolls down the
dialog: window.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: So how nervous should I be?
dialog: 
text: The DEA Agent riding shotgun turns back to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Are you kidding?
dialog: 
text: He points out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Over there? That's the beast.
dialog: 
text: He turns back, facing front.
dialog: 
text: She looks out the window to Juarez. It is so close, you could
text: throw a frisbee into it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BORDER HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: THE CONVOY turns onto the BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS. Border
text: Agents have closed the left lane to traffic, in preparation
text: for the convoy's arrival.
dialog: 
text: From above, we see MEXICO. Some THIRTY FEDERAL POLICE TRUCKS,
text: SOLDIERS FILLING THE BEDS are waiting for them.
dialog: 
text: The convoy drives straight through -- the Mexican Police
text: trucks roll forward as our convoy catches up to them.
dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF SCENE, WE WILL INTERCUT IN AND OUT
scene_heading: OF THE VEHICLES
dialog: 
text: The city of Juarez is itself a crime. Filthy and crumbling,
text: hookers and criminals fill every possible space of sidewalk.
dialog: They are as plentiful as the unfortunate masses that are
dialog: condemned to live and work here.
dialog: 
text: SIRENS BLARE. POLICE YELL OVER LOUD SPEAKERS AND THROUGH
text: MEGAPHONES FOR VEHICLES TO PULL OVER AND LET THE CONVOY PASS.
dialog: 
text: SWEAT rolls down Macy's face. She can feel her heart
text: beating... Loud enough she actually wonders if others hear it
dialog: too.
dialog: 
text: At every turn, it seems there are soldiers and police. A
text: large group of police can be seen on a side-street, standing
text: around a car -- a DEAD BODY on the street beside it.
dialog: 
text: Macy sees a woman in her 20's SPRINTING down the street,
text: SCREAMING, though there is no one chasing her.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alejandro taps her on the shoulder, motions her to scoot
text: toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Want to see Juarez?
dialog: 
text: He points to A BRIDGE WHERE THE BODY OF A MAN HANGS, a dozen
text: soldiers looking down at it.
dialog: 
text: As we look closer, we see he has been decapitated -- his head
text: replaced with that of a pig, crudely sewn to his body with
dialog: fishing line.
dialog: 
text: The body is naked from the waist down -- a state police shirt
text: on his torso.
dialog: 
text: As the convoy races up the street, the bridge and it's
text: swinging corpse come closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Hard to believe, yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: (Breathless) Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: He wears the state police shirt.
dialog: The pig -- Not what you think it
dialog: means. All state police work for
dialog: the cartels. ALL of them. That
dialog: man... He tried to work for two...
dialog: he got greedy.
dialog: 
text: They continue past. Into an even worse part of Juarez, if
text: that's possible. The vehicles come to a stop. POPPING SOUNDS
text: can be heard. Like fireworks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Hear that?
dialog: 
text: He cracks his window. The sound floods in. GUNFIRE. Not ten
text: shots, not fifty. Hundreds. It is a battle. Over the radio we
speaker_heading: HEAR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Everybody hold on. Mexicans are
dialog: adjusting our route. There's
dialog: activity ahead we need to go
dialog: around.
dialog: 
text: We sit here, listening to the gunfight as it builds in
text: intensity. We hear a series of explosions.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Both agents in the front seats reposition their rifles.
dialog: Ready.
dialog: 
text: The convoy rolls again. Makes a left, drives away from the
text: battle as though they were avoiding road construction. A few
text: blocks and they all snake right. Macy is trying hard not to
dialog: be terrified.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the convoy picks up speed. Moving 70mph over a road
text: that barely qualifies as two lanes.
dialog: 
text: They race past a park. A large building can be seen on the
text: right. The Mexican flag flies in front. Numerous Federal
text: Police vehicles in front.
dialog: 
text: The convoy stops in front and the Delta operators are out of
text: their vehicles, setting a perimeter. The Marshals and Matt
text: emerge and move straight to the building, two Deltas follow.
dialog: 
text: Macy stays glued to the front door of the building. Waiting.
text: Alejandro shifts in his seat toward Macy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Nothing will happen here. If they
dialog: try anything, it will be at the
dialog: border. If no lane is cleared for
dialog: us when we return... Be ready.
dialog: Watch the cars. Look for old cars.
dialog: Throw aways. Not gangster cars...
dialog: Those are for the whores on
dialog: Saturday night. Did you watch the
dialog: cars we passed driving in?
dialog: 
dialog: She shakes her head `no'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch for state police. They are
dialog: all bad. We will lose the escort at
dialog: the loop. You will see. That is
dialog: when you worry.
dialog: 
text: Matt and the Marshals come out with a man covered in a
text: blanket. He is placed in the backseat.
dialog: 
text: The federal Police begin turning their vehicles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
speaker_heading: NOW.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the Tahoe lurches forward -- moving between the
text: vehicle with Matt and the Marshals -- acting as a shield.
text: Macy looks out the window at the Federal Police trucks. She
text: notices the agent riding shotgun has his rifle at the ready
text: in the direction of the Federal Police.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
text: Lean back, Kate.
dialog: 
text: She turns to find him pointing his rifle almost at her head.
text: She leans back, and moves her hands toward her ears, ready to
dialog: cover them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Okay. Go.
dialog: 
text: The Tahoe begins moving and performs a lighting fast three
text: point turn, and just like that we are headed north.
dialog: 
text: Macy lets out an endless sigh of relief. We are driving very
dialog: fast now.
dialog: 
text: Macy looks out the windshield, the hills of El Paso loom in
dialog: the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: On the left.
dialog: 
text: Two streets over, as buildings whip by, we see a STATE POLICE
dialog: VEHICLE even with us.
dialog: 
text: It disappears as buildings fill our view, then at the next
text: block we see it again. We hear over the radio --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: We have a spotter on the left
dialog: everyone. Keep your eyes out for a
dialog: strike vehicle.
dialog: 
text: The driver speaks into his radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Mexico holding a lane for us at the
dialog: border?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's my understanding. We're
dialog: trying to confirm...
dialog: 
text: As we race to the border, the state police vehicle has
scene_heading: DISAPPEARED.
dialog: 
text: We come to the loop, the last exit before being fed into the
text: twelve lanes leading only to the border crossing...
dialog: 
text: WITH NO WAY OUT.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: At the loop, the Mexican Federal Police vehicles peel off,
text: leaving the convoy alone. At the border, US HOMELAND SECURITY
text: OFFICERS can be seen standing with rifles, making a very
dialog: public show of force.
dialog: 
text: There is no lane cleared for them, and just like that -- they
text: are trapped in traffic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone stay in this lane. Our
dialog: agents at the border are going to
dialog: wave everyone through and get us
text: over as quick as they can.
dialog: 
text: The agents at the border aren't even checking passports, just
text: moving cars through in the lane where the convoy is trapped,
text: but there are fifty cars ahead of them...
dialog: 
text: Alejandro looks out his window and sees, two lanes over:
dialog: 
text: FOUR MEN in an old Buick LeSabre. They are staring straight
text: ahead. All drenched in sweat.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro taps Macy, she scoots closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You have a service weapon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Get it out.
dialog: 
text: She unholsters her pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Silver LeSabre. Two lanes over my
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Yep.
dialog: 
text: He takes the radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Silver LeSabre, two lanes right, 3
dialog: o'clock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: One lane over right, 5 o'clock.
dialog: Burgundy Expedition.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE2
text: Three lanes over right, 1 o'clock,
dialog: green honda civic.
dialog: 
text: Macy grips her pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Okay... okay...
dialog: 
text: Then Alejandro spots it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: Gun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o'clock, gun.
dialog: 
text: The flash suppressor of an AK 47 is peeking out in the back
text: seat. A sweaty, young gunman holds the rifle between his
dialog: legs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE2
dialog: What are the rules here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We must be engaged to engage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE2
dialog: Can we get out of this vehicle and
dialog: set a perimeter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stay in your vehicle. You can do
dialog: what they do. If they get out you
dialog: can get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: (To Macy) watch the door handles.
dialog: 
text: The cars are beginning to move in the convoy's lane. Another
dialog: fifteen seconds and they can leave this hell behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Get ready. They can see our lane
dialog: clearing. If it's coming, it's
dialog: coming now.
dialog: 
text: Only a few more cars and the convoy is clear. But that would
dialog: mean luck is on their side and luck doesn't live on this side
dialog: of the border.
dialog: 
text: The doors to the Expedition swing open. By the time the
text: assassins put a foot to the ground, the Delta operators are
text: out of their cars and halfway to them, rifles raised.
dialog: 
text: Before Macy can react, she is ALONE in the Tahoe.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Even the driver has exited... she is starting to panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Think... think...
dialog: 
text: She looks at her pistol, grips it tight. And goes nowhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 
text: The assassins are frozen, guns by their sides. A dozen
text: Americans have weapons trained on them.
dialog: 
text: The Agent riding shotgun stands in front of the Buick, rifle
text: pointed at the windshield. Other operators are at the flank
text: of the Civic before their doors are even open.
dialog: 
text: But at the Expedition, men are already out, weapons in their
dialog: hands.
dialog: 
text: The delta operators and Alejandro are yelling at the men in
text: Spanish. One retreats to the safety of the back seat, but the
dialog: others know the consequences of a failed hit and they aren't
text: in checkmate like those in the other cars...
dialog: 
text: The assassins, none over twenty years old, yell and cuss and
text: threaten as the operators surround them in a semicircle.
dialog: 
text: The assassin that exited the drivers seat -- 2 carat diamond
text: earrings and no shirt on his skinny chest -- screams in
text: hateful defiance at the operators surrounding him.
dialog: 
text: He raises his weapon and ALEJANDRO AND THE OPERATORS FIRE --
text: He is obliterated -- They continue firing, surgically killing
text: all the Expedition's crew. Bullets ping through the
text: windshield. Bullets tear the Expedition to shreds. The
dialog: assassins never fire a shot.
dialog: 
text: The innocent masses stuck in the crossfire duck out of view
text: in their vehicles. The streets are instantly empty.
dialog: 
text: The noise of the shooting echoes off the asphalt with the
text: force of thunder.
dialog: 
text: Macy watches through the back window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING??!!
dialog: 
text: The men watching the other vehicles hold targets in their
dialog: sights. The rest will take their chances with the boss. Don't
text: even look in the direction of the Americans -- just stare
text: straight ahead, sweating...
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The operators and Alejandro work their way back to the
text: vehicle. Everyone retreats to their cars.
dialog: 
text: The kid with the AK 47 in the back of the Buick makes a move
text: for his door handle. Alejandro clocks it, puts 10 rounds
text: through the window, killing him and the man beside him before
text: the door is opened.
dialog: 
text: Macy turns away in shock to find:
dialog: 
text: A MEXICAN STATE POLICE OFFICER 5 FEET FROM HER WINDOW!!!
dialog: 
text: He raises an AK 47 to his shoulder -- pointed right at her.
text: Before she can think, her gun is raised and firing through
text: the tinted window.
dialog: 
text: The sound is deafening. As the man falls out of view, all we
text: can hear is the RINGING IN HER EARS.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro and the agent riding shotgun jump in and roll their
text: windows down and sit out of them like turrets as the vehicles
text: start up and race to the border.
dialog: 
text: They pass the guard house without stopping, Border Agents
text: waving them onward through the finish line. More agents point
text: weapons and scream at the Mexican State police officers who
text: have emerged from their offices.
dialog: 
dialog: It is absolute madness...
dialog: 
text: Alejandro and the agent sit back in the vehicles and roll up
text: the windows... They are back in America.
dialog: 
text: Macy struggles to get her breath. No one speaks. After a long
dialog: beat...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is going to be on the front
dialog: page of every newspaper in America.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: No it won't. It won't even make the
dialog: paper in El Paso...
dialog: 
text: The convoy is safe. It races past traffic, red sirens
text: lighting the dashboards...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DAY.
dialog: 
text: The vehicles pull in and park. Agents and operators exit the
text: vehicles and amble toward the entrance.
dialog: 
text: Macy gets out, her head spinning.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Matt walks up to her. She holds out a hand, begging him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: JUST... Give me a minute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah. That got a little nutty, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: No. No. Don't... NO. This isn't ...
dialog: This was a SPECIAL OP. You're a
dialog: fucking spook. And HIM!! Who the
dialog: fuck is that??
dialog: 
text: She points at Alejandro.
dialog: 
text: He lets her vent. Burning the unused adrenaline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey. I told you to stay here...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I'm not qualified for this. I'm
dialog: good at what I do, but I'm not a
dialog: soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Don't sell yourself short. Reason
dialog: Reggie's home is I know he's not
dialog: ready for this, but he's gonna have
dialog: to get ready real quick, because
dialog: this is the future. Juarez is what
dialog: happens when they dig in...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Don't put me in a situation where I
dialog: have to break the law to stay
dialog: alive. Don't do that to me.
dialog: 
text: Steve walks up to Matt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You wanna get cracking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: On that note, I think you better
dialog: stay out here.
dialog: 
text: Matt winks and walks in the building, leaving Macy alone in
dialog: the motor pool.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT INTERROGATION ROOM DAY
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A door opens and we find GUILLERMO, 45, fat, three day
text: stubble, and very unhappy to be here. His hands are cuffed
text: behind his back. A DEA AGENT holds a bottle of water that
text: Guillermo sucks like an infant.
dialog: 
text: Matt walks in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
text: Giving him a belly full of water...
dialog: you devil.
dialog: 
text: Matt smiles, the agent smiles back.
dialog: 
text: Matt sits in the only other chair in the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Didn't think we'd get you here, did
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUILLERMO
speaker_heading: NO HABLO-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I love it when they don't hablo.
dialog: Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet
dialog: you `hablo' to him.
dialog: 
text: The door opens and Alejandro walks in, carrying two five
text: gallon jugs of water. It takes Guillermo a minute, then
text: horror washes over his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUILLERMO
dialog: El Medellin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Alejandro, he remembers you.
dialog: 
text: No expression on Alejandro's face.
dialog: 
text: The DEA Agent moves to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEA AGENT
dialog: I'm gonna step out.
dialog: 
text: He closes the door behind him. The red `record' button on the
text: camera mounted in the corner goes out. We notice a DRAIN IN
scene_heading: THE FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro walks toward Guillermo, stands across from him.
text: Places a foot on his chest. Pushes... Hard... Guillermo sways
text: back, like a chopped tree. He moves through frame in slow
text: motion, falling out of frame.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DUSK.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Macy leans against a car. Spots a guy with a cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Hey. Got another one of those?
dialog: 
text: He gives her one. Lights it. She draws in, coughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Been a while. Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (O.S.)
dialog: Like fireworks?
dialog: 
text: She turns and sees a Delta operator. Holding a pair of
scene_heading: BINOLULARS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come here.
dialog: 
text: She follows him. They walk to the back of the motor pool to a
text: stairway that leads to the roof of the building. He goes up.
text: She hesitates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Up to you.
dialog: 
text: She takes the bait. Climbs up.
dialog: 
text: They sit on the edge of the roof, facing Juarez. He begins
text: glassing the area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Fireworks is code for something, I
dialog: assume.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA
dialog: Sort of.
dialog: 
text: He glasses. She smokes, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go.
dialog: 
text: He hands her the binoculars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Look right there.
dialog: 
scene_heading: --THROUGH THE BINOCULARS WE LOOK OVER JUAREZ--
dialog: 
text: She sees it. Muzzle flashes. Right on the street. Rifle fire
text: glowing white against the muddy gray of Juarez at dusk. Gone
text: as fast as it came. She looks at Delta.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep looking.
dialog: 
text: She begins scanning the city. Sirens. Everywhere. She sees
text: another muzzle flash. She looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I don't hear anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA
dialog: Can't. Too far away. Keep looking.
dialog: They're everywhere.
dialog: 
text: She scans the city slowly. Sirens. More sirens. The city is
text: lit in a throbbing red and blue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Unbelievable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA
dialog: Madness, huh.
dialog: 
text: He bums a drag from her cigarette. They sit in silence and
dialog: watch the city go to war.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: Can they get them all in one place?
dialog: No... I'm on a clock now, I can't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY

speaker_heading: REGGIE-

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (Pleasant as can be) Has nothing to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE (O.S.)
dialog: Now?
dialog: 
text: She nods and yawns at the same time. Reggie takes her in.

dialog: Hey... How was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE

dialog: 
text: She moves toward the front of the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Now's not the time.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They climb in. Reggie looks over at Macy staring out the

dialog: Got another one of those?

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Finish it before we get inside.
dialog: 
text: He gives her one, lights her as they walk. The giant, domed

scene_heading: INT. IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
dialog: The illegals have been separated by sex and criminal record.
dialog: 
text: Women on the left... The worker bees -- the busboys and
text: landscapers and construction workers -- are in the center,
text: and in the back, lined up against the wall, the felons...
dialog: 
text: Three dozen HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS stand over them with
text: M4s.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There you go. I'm starting the
dialog: buses. When you're done with em,
dialog: send em out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: All the women can go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Coulda told me that on the phone,
dialog: Matt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: First I've heard it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They head toward the group of felons and the like as the
text: women are moved out to the buses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Watch these men close. Look for the
dialog: ones like the men you saw in
dialog: Juarez.
dialog: 
text: Macy looks at him. His kind, sad demeanor seems to settle
text: her. She knows he is offering her something, just doesn't
text: know why. She turns to the men against the wall. They have
text: their hands behind their backs, zip tied.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you see?
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She scans their faces. Many have tattoos, shaved heads. A
text: boy, maybe 18, haircut like a pop star from the 90's. Diamond
text: earrings, stares hard at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Him.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Yes. Keep looking.
dialog: 
text: She studies more faces. The ones that look like American
text: gangsters- they look down, away, no eye contact. But the ones
text: with mustaches no longer in style, hair parted down the
text: middle, the lanky teens with Polo shirts, they stare
text: defiantly. No fear of consequence from American officers. As
dialog: subtle as the differences are- how they wear their pants, how
text: they lean against the wall... she understands now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Yeah. I see it.
dialog: 
text: She turns to Alejandro, but he is gone. She turns around and
text: he stands thirty feet back beside Matt, looking over the
dialog: migrants.
dialog: 
text: Macy walks back to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Two ways to find drug routes. You
dialog: can play cat and mouse with those
dialog: clowns, or ask these guys what
dialog: trails they avoid.
dialog: 
text: They walk toward the largest group, the simple migrants. The
text: ones that are filthy, tired. Eager to either be sent back to
dialog: Mexico or go to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: They see it all, and must avoid the
dialog: traps set everywhere for them. We
dialog: look for one who is older... one
dialog: who has had enough.
dialog: 
text: Bob walks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You done with these behind you?
dialog: 49.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: All yours.
dialog: 
text: The Agents begin yelling and marching the smuggler group out.
text: Alejandro turns to Bob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Break them into groups of four, Let
text: them spread out, each group as far
dialog: from the other as possible.
dialog: 
text: Bob huddles his agents and begins explaining as Matt and
text: Alejandro walk off.
dialog: 
text: We see Reggie, observing from the entrance. He's had enough
text: `not knowing', walks to Macy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What are we doing here?(Looks her
dialog: over) What were you doing in
dialog: Mexico??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I'm with you, alright. I don't have
dialog: answers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, let's get some then.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: You think I haven't asked these

dialog: MATT. Can we talk to you for a
dialog: minute?
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE CONT.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
text: This feels very serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What are we looking for? There's in
dialog: the dark and then there's the way
dialog: you're treating us. I want to know
dialog: the objective, or I walk. Period.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Then go. I didn't ask you to be a
dialog: part of this. She did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: I walk too.
dialog: 
text: Reggie stares at Matt, who casually smiles, pacifying the
dialog: children.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What would you like to know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Guillermo told us about a tunnel
text: east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So
dialog: now, we're trying to find what
text: areas near there migrants avoid.
dialog: Because that's where the tunnel
dialog: will be. Better?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Guillermo is...?
dialog: 
text: Matt laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm going back in.
dialog: 
text: He turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: He TOLD you where a drug tunnel
dialog: is... Just... Told you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Guillermo didn't have any other
dialog: options. We send him back across
dialog: the border and he's a dead man. Had
dialog: to give us something.
dialog: 
text: He just smiles...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Look man, we have a boss, and you
dialog: ain't him. Be straight. What are
dialog: you doing?
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're going to make enough noise
dialog: that Manuel Diaz is called back to
dialog: Mexico to see HIS boss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: And then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And then we know where his boss is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
dialog: Fausto Alarcon, Manuel's cousin...
text: Manuel's boss... He is an
dialog: executioner...
dialog: 
text: Alejandro stands beside them, but looks out over the black
dialog: desert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: When people die in my country, it
text: is with his hand or his blessing.
dialog: To find him would be like...
dialog: discovering a vaccine. Manuel will
dialog: lead us to him.
dialog: 
text: His kind, hollow eyes meet Reggie's. Alejandro manufactures a
dialog: smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Certainly, you understand the value
dialog: of that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Alright... We're good. Just don't
dialog: keep us in the dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: There is only dark, my friend.
dialog: 
text: Reggie studies this strange, sad man. Looks at him with
text: something between fear and mistrust. Macy just looks tired
text: and mad. Matt takes them both in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: What happens when you find him?
dialog: 
text: But Alejandro is already walking back to the warehouse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's been a humdinger of a day. Go
dialog: home. Get some rest. We'll find a
dialog: ride. See you tomorrow.
dialog: 52.

dialog: 
text: Matt turns and walks back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I just drove a hundred fucking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: This is a blessing, trust me. I
dialog: want to stop and get some
dialog: cigarettes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Got you smoking again... it was
dialog: that bad?
dialog: 
text: She moves to the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Worse.

dialog: 
text: She pours a cup of coffee, heads to her computer. Pulls up
text: the CNN website, scrolls the news, nothing about a shoot-out
text: on the border.
dialog: 
text: Goes to the El Paso newspaper website. Nothing there either.
text: She googles SHOOT OUT, JUAREZ... is bombarded with images.
dialog: 53.
dialog:

text: Her screen is flooded with photos: women naked, tortured,

dialog: 
text: Bodies of men in ditches, dead in chairs, dead in cars...
text: dead everywhere. But nothing of yesterday. The images invade
dialog: her. Can't look anymore...
dialog: 
text: She digs up a cigarette, goes to her screen door, opens it
text: and steps out, lights her smoke.
dialog: 
text: She sees Reggie pull up and park. She yells down to him.

dialog: that in an HOUR?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We knew where his accounts were, we
dialog: just didn't know they were shaking
dialog: people down in front of the fucking

dialog: Can't prosecute it. No one controls

dialog: An attorney will have that money
dialog: back in a few months... but a lot

scene_heading: INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT.
dialog: 
text: Matt lets them in. He wears desert camo fatigues, as do most

speaker_heading: MOVING.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We may have the tunnel, right here.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DELTA
dialog: Alright. Listen up. We're waiting

dialog: 
text: He moves to a diagram of a tunnel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELTA (CONT'D)
dialog: This diagram is based on other
dialog: tunnels that have been mapped. This
dialog: is NOT accurate, it is for
dialog: reference only. We expect a small
dialog: exit corridor on our side of the
dialog: border. They mark the international
text: border in the tunnel with red paint
dialog: so Border Patrol doesn't pursue
dialog: past that point. Once on the
dialog: Mexican side, there will be a small
dialog: staging area, then another shaft
dialog: will lead to the main warehouse and
text: the road that returns to Mexico.
dialog: Once we clear the mules, we don't

speaker_heading: OPERATOR
text: This looks like confirmation.

speaker_heading: DELTA
dialog: That looks like it. Okay, let's

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Relax. You guys will hang back when

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Then why are we going?

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL -- CONT.

dialog: 
text: Silvio ducks down, throwing the car in reverse, but a hand
text: reaches in the window, and turns the car off. Silvio looks up
dialog: and sees --
dialog: 
dialog: Alejandro.
dialog: 
text: HE pulls Silvio from the car. Spins him around. Pulls the

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Don't ever point a weapon at me

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- CONT.
dialog: 
text: Headlights blind Manuel, but he can see the car door has
text: opened, and an image is moving toward him. He waits, for the
dialog: fool who is robbing the wrong mother fucker.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As the image reaches Manuel, something moves from behind it.
text: Fast. An arm reaches around Manuel and two shots are fired
text: from a silenced pistol. Now the pistol is held to the back of
text: Manuel's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Walk back to your car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANUEL
dialog: Who was he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: A mule. Like you.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro fires a round into Manuel's calf. He wails in pain.
text: He fires another round into his right hand as it hits the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: In the leg so you don't run. In the

dialog: JEFE!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I know who you are, Manuel. You are

dialog: one...
dialog: 
text: Alejandro kneels down, and for the first time, Manuel can see
text: his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: If you try anything, if you betray
dialog: me, your daughters will burp the
text: semen of twenty men with their last
dialog: breath. Do you understand me?
dialog: 
text: Manuel's eyes go wide. He nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro opens the back door before letting Manuel get in
text: the front. In an instant, Manuel is in the driver's seat and
text: Alejandro seated behind. The doors are closed and the Range
text: Rover disappears down the road. We are left with Silvio,
text: gasping, struggling, like a fish tossed thoughtlessly on the
text: beach, as he flops helplessly on the empty road.

dialog: 
text: We near an isolated estate. We turn off the main road to a

dialog: 
text: As the large house comes into view. VEHICLES can be seen

dialog: 
text: Manuel rolls his window down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANUEL
dialog: Soy Manuel Diaz.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Si, te conosco. El Jefe esta

dialog: 
text: The rear window rolls down. A pistol comes out. A silenced

dialog: hood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Drive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANUEL
dialog: What happens when we get to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

speaker_heading: MANUEL
dialog: What will happen to me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: What you do now is for your family.
dialog: There is no you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANUEL
dialog: You think you are so different?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: No. Not anymore. Now I am the same.
dialog: Turn the car a bit more to the
dialog: left.
dialog: 
text: The car stops. THREE MEN stand in the driveway with automatic
text: rifles. The Range Rover is parked so the right headlight is
text: pointed directly toward them.
dialog: 
text: Manuel opens the door and we are--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FUASTO ESTATE -- CONT.

scene_heading: CUIDADO HOMBRES--
dialog: 
text: Alejandro takes his pistol and presses the silenced barrel to
text: the top of manuel's head, pulling the trigger and driving
text: Manuel into the ground like a nail. As Manuel's body drops,
text: Alejandro fires on all three men -- hitting them all in the
text: head, killing them instantly.
dialog: 
text: He walks to the front door, opens it...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FAUSTO ESTATE -- CONT.
dialog: 
text: A man rounds the corner into the main foyer and without
text: slowing down, Alejandro touches the barrel to his forehead
dialog: and fires.
dialog: 
text: We can hear the sound of talking in another room. Alejandro
text: moves to it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT FAUSTO'S KITCHEN/ DINING ROOM
dialog: 
text: FAUSTO, 50's, graying hair. Big belly. Sits at the head of
text: the table. JACINTA, 30's trophy wife, sits beside him gulping
text: wine. They have three CHILDREN, two girls and a boy. A woman
text: in her 60's cooks in the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACINTA
dialog: RAPIDO, MAMA!, tengo hambre!
dialog: 
text: Alejandro walks into the room, presses his foot against
text: Jacinta's side, and launches her out of frame, then sits next
text: to Fausto, presses the gun to his shoulder and fires. The
text: children scream. Mama turns, Alejandro points the gun at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: SIENTATE! AQUI!!
dialog: 
text: She comes around and sits as ordered.
dialog: 
text: Jacinta stands up.

speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Then we will spare them. I
dialog: interrupted dinner. Please...
dialog: Continue.
dialog: 
text: Fausto stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Every night, you have families
dialog: killed, and yet you dine. Tonight
dialog: should be no different.
dialog: 
text: Points the pistol at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Eat.
dialog: 
text: He slowly fills a fork, puts it in his mouth. Tells his
text: children to do the same. They chew their meal and cry.
text: Alejandro turns to the old woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Take the children away from here.
dialog: 
text: She rises and hurries the children out of the dining area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: (Points the gun at Jacinta) You.
dialog: Whore. Sit over there.
dialog: 
text: She sits. Alejandro turns to Fausto, notices he has stopped
text: eating. Picks up a fork and stabs it into Fausto's hand.
text: Fausto screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not finished. Eat...
dialog: 
text: Fausto forces down another bite, rests his trembling hand on
dialog: the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: I will give you a choice, Fausto,
dialog: one I was not given... You may
dialog: choose to die tonight or live with
dialog: the shame of having the mother of
dialog: your children take your place...
dialog: 
text: He looks at Fausto. Fausto stops chewing. Processes what was
dialog: just said.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes ... Choose.
dialog: 
text: Fausto looks at Jacinta. Her eyes say, "Goodbye my brave
text: love"... Never dawns on her what he's thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: I take shame.
dialog: 
text: She's stunned. Tears run her heavy make up. She looks to
dialog: Alejandro. No mercy there. Back to her husband.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAUSTO (CONT'D)
dialog: I love me more. I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: He isn't. It wasn't a hard decision. She turns to Alejandro.
text: Holds her chin high in defiance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACINTA
dialog: Do it. You fuck. Chinga tu madre
dialog: PUNTA CABRON ANDALE PUES!!!
dialog: 
text: Alejandro looks at Fausto.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: See why you married her. Spunk.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro looks into Fausto's uncaring eyes.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro fires into Fausto's belly. Touches the barrel to
text: his arm, fires again. Fausto screams. Alejandro presses the
text: barrel to Fausto's throat, fires again. Fausto falls to the
text: floor, gargling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch death come for you. Watch.
text: The devil is near, Fausto. He is
dialog: waiting for you.
dialog: 
text: Fausto's terrified eyes stare back at Alejandro as he gasps
text: for air. Drowning in his own blood. There is no specific
text: moment when death comes. He simply fades. Alejandro sits back
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what they think of you. You
dialog: see?
dialog: 
text: She stares at him, shaking so profusely you might think she
text: is freezing to death.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you have enough pride that
dialog: you don't marry another one of
dialog: these. Maybe you take his money and
dialog: go hide and raise your children far
dialog: from here. Maybe your son grows up
dialog: to be a doctor. And I don't have to
dialog: come back and kill him some day.
dialog: 
text: Alejandro walks out, leaving Jacinta shivering alone at the
text: dinner table.

scene_heading: INT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY.
dialog: 
text: A shadow falls over an empty bed. Eliseo stands there... this
text: has never happened before. He walks down the hall to the
text: kitchen. His mother is in the same place, cooking. But the
text: look in her eyes is anger. She knows he is dead. And may God
dialog: damn him for making her be the one to tell their son.
dialog: 
text: He stands there. Staring at his mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELISEO
dialog: Mama?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- DAY.
dialog: 
text: Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, she sits on the balcony,
text: takes a drag of her cigarette. Looks at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Three days ago I hadn't had you in
dialog: ten years... fucker.
dialog: 
text: She leans back and looks out over Phoenix as the sun sets.
text: She exhales ... looks at the cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Half joking) You're the only one
dialog: who understands me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (O.S.)
dialog: I think maybe, it will be the thing
dialog: that kills us all ... as a people,
dialog: you know?
dialog: 
text: Macy leaps up as if she's on fire, falls over her chair,
text: comes up with her pistol. He moves so fast there is no time
dialog: to react.
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In an instant, he has the gun and removes the magazine,
text: disassembles the slide, and tosses the pieces on the table.
text: She screams and rushes him. He spins her and pushes her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it.
dialog: 
text: He moves to her and gently touches her face, looking at the
text: gash on her nose. She is frozen in fear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: That will scar. I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: She breathes heavy, trying to remain calm.
dialog: 
text: He begins lifting her shirt. She struggles and he grabs her
text: throat. She looks into his eyes and it is a killer looking
dialog: back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Let me look ... Move your hand.
dialog: 
text: She surrenders, turns her head to the side. He lifts her
text: shirt above her bare breasts. Six large, red welts...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: These ribs are bruised, but not
dialog: broken, yes?
dialog: 
text: She nods as her lip quivers. Clinging desperately to her
dialog: dignity. She has never felt so powerless, and that is his
dialog: point.
dialog: 
text: He drops her shirt and steps back. She crosses her arms,
text: feeling very weak.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alejandro sits across from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: I would recommend not standing on
text: balconies for a little while.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: You're an assassin.
dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: In Mexico, the killers are called
dialog: Sicarios... The word comes from the
dialog: zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who
dialog: hunted the Romans that invaded
dialog: their homeland... They don't
dialog: deserve the term.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACY
dialog: You are a Sicario.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Policing them does nothing. They
dialog: must be killed. Wherever they are
dialog: found. They will make every place
dialog: they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you
dialog: understand how far we have fallen.
dialog: 
text: He studies her-- arms crossed, legs close together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: You look like a girl when you're
dialog: scared. Such beauty in you when you
dialog: let yourself be frail. Like the
dialog: daughter they took from me ... This
dialog: is not the work for you. Look at
dialog: yourself, Kate. What it has done to
dialog: you in just three days ... Find a
text: little town far from the border. A
dialog: place where the rule of law still
dialog: exists. You will spot predators
dialog: there very easy now... Make a
dialog: difference you can see everyday.
dialog: Because you will not survive here.
dialog: You are not a wolf. This is the
dialog: land of wolves now.
dialog: 
text: He looks at her. Smiles sadly and leaves.
dialog: 
text: She waits. Starts to cry, fights it back. Begins frantically
text: reassembling the pistol. Rams the magazine in and racks a
text: round. Comes around the corner. Enters the house. Looks
text: around. Checks every room, panting, shaking. He is gone. She
text: stands there and sobs...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NOGALES STREET -- DAY.
dialog: 
text: The mother walks with Eliseo, dressed for soccer. Down the
text: empty street. Sirens in the distance.
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
dialog: We like to think if we cut the head
dialog: from the snake, the serpent will
dialog: die...
dialog: 
text: They round the corner. We follow them to a park. Weeds cut
text: short to look like grass. Little boys dressed in uniforms,
text: parents sitting in lawn chairs. A referee. Just people,
text: desperately trying to enjoy the life they have been given.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
dialog: But there is no snake. They are
dialog: worms. When you cut the head, a new
dialog: one grows. From both segments ...
dialog: We cannot question if the end
dialog: justifies the means because there
dialog: is no end to consider...
dialog: 
text: Eliseo runs to join his team. Whatever his mother told him,
dialog: it wasn't the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
dialog: This is the price of our self
dialog: indulgence. Our weakness ... Our
dialog: appetite. They are our demons, our
dialog: creation.
dialog: 
text: The mother sits on the ground, watching the boys. Running.
text: Playing. Being children. The referee blows a whistle. The
text: boys assume their positions on the field. The forwards line
text: up, facing each other. Eliseo is dead center, the team's
text: star. The referee sets the ball in place...
dialog: 
text: -- GUNFIRE RIPS THROUGH THE MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Everyone stops and stares in the direction of the gunfire. It
text: is very still. People frozen like deer in a field -- weighing
text: the risk. No more shooting. The morning is quiet again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: There is a moment in each person's
dialog: life. A choice. Do what feels
dialog: good... Do what is good. Make the
dialog: wrong choice enough, and it is not
dialog: presented again... then all choices
dialog: are bad. And the consequences
dialog: worse. There is no war on drugs.
dialog: Only war. The enemy we fight?
dialog: Ourselves ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The referee blows the whistle and sets the ball down. The
text: game begins.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eliseo swipes it and kicks it out of frame, the other boys
text: chasing him...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THE END.
