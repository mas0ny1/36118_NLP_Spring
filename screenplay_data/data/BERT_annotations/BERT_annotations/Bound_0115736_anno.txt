speaker_heading: BOUND
dialog: Written by
dialog: Larry &amp; Andy Wachowski
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Inside a closet.
text: It is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light
text: cutting down through the center of the darkness.
text: As we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: I had this image of you, inside of
text: me, like a part of me.
text: We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags. It
text: is a woman's closet.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: You planned this whole thing, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Where's the fucking money?
text: We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to
text: feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to
text: the racks of high heels.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: We make our own choices, we pay our
dialog: own prices.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: All part of the business.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: All part of the business.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: What choice?
text: We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and
text: reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black
text: Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: I want out.
text: We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound,
text: lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling
text: tightly around her wrists.
text: The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face. She is
text: gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her
text: forehead. Her name is CORKY.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
text: Like a part of me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very
text: butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather
text: jacket. She is a lesbian and wants people to know it.
text: As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Wait! Hold the elevator.
text: Corky pushes the "open" button. A couple steps into the
text: elevator. His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing
text: an expensive suit and sunglasses.
text: She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in
dialog: your mouth.
text: She hears it again, a guttural sound.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Thanks again for this opportunity,
dialog: Mr. Bianchinni. Goodbye.
text: She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall.
text: As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against
text: the wall.
text: The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally
dialog: it swells --
scene_heading: DISSOLVING INTO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
text: The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod.
text: The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub
text: drain, black goo splattering everywhere.
text: The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone
text: pounding on the apartment door.
text: Killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door.
text: Behind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt
text: and cowboy boots.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of
dialog: met in the elevator --
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I heard you working in here and I
dialog: just wondered if you'd like a cup of
dialog: coffee?
text: She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Sure. Come on in. Give me a minute.
text: Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to
text: wash off the drain dreck.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What happened to Rajeev?
text: Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Rajeev, the man who usually works on
dialog: the building.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Oh, he went home to India, but as
dialog: far as I know he'll be back.
text: She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: So this is temporary for you?
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: Pretty much. One day at a time.
text: Violet hands her the cup of black coffee.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I guessed you were straight black.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Good guess.
text: They both sip from the piping hot mugs.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: My pleasure ... but to be honest, I
dialog: did have a slightly ulterior motive
dialog: here. I was wondering if I could
dialog: ask a small favor?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: A favor?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person,
dialog: so I was wondering if it wasn't a
dialog: terrible inconvenience if you could
dialog: wait a bit before using power tools.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, it isn't your fault. The walls
dialog: here are just so thin.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Are they really?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, it really causes problems.
dialog: Sometimes it's like you're in the
dialog: same room. But if it's too much
dialog: trouble, I understand ...
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No, no trouble. There's other work
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You're doing everything yourself?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That is so amazing. I'm in awe of
dialog: people who can fix things. My dad
dialog: was like that. We never had anything
dialog: new. Whenever something broke he
dialog: would open it up, tinker with it and
dialog: it would work. His hands were magic.
text: She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah ... I bet your car is twenty
dialog: years old.
text: Corky smiles.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Truck.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Truck. Of course.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: '63 Chevy.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I knew it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET SIPS
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: So, how do you know the owner, Mr.
dialog: Bianchinni?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I don't, really. I was referred to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, really.
text: Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, but Caesar does. He likes him.
dialog: Says he's a good Italian.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Caesar is your husband?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying
dialog: kind.
text: Smiling, she says nothing else.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I should be going. You can drop the
dialog: cup off anytime.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: My pleasure.
text: CORKY watches her leave.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT
text: A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon-
text: white sign the only evidence it exists.
text: Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of
text: large motorcycles. She flips her collar and heads for the
text: door.
scene_heading: INT. THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT
text: The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose
text: as she crosses to the bar.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Well, well ...
text: Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Been awhile, Cork.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Five years, two months, sixteen days.
dialog: How you doing, Sue?
text: Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Like shit. Now that we're all caught
dialog: up, how about a drink?
text: Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Thanks.
text: They click the bottles together and drink.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You got a job yet?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Yeah. Some plumbing, painting and
dialog: shit.
text: Sue laughs.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I mean a J-O-B. A real job.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Not for me, Sue. I'm straight and
dialog: narrow. I'm just here to get laid
text: or drunk and hopefully both.
text: Corky gets off the stool.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Thanks for the beer.
text: Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back
text: tables. Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance
dialog: to Violet.
text: The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket.
text: Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her. There is
dialog: no one smoother.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You know ... that outfit would look
text: great on my bedroom floor.
text: The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder.
text: She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman
text: in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket. She is more wide
dialog: than fat.
speaker_heading: WOMAN COP
dialog: Hey, Jesse. What's happening here?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Nothing ... yet.
speaker_heading: WOMAN COP
dialog: Who's this?
text: Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips. A service
text: revolver is clipped to her belt.
text: She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.
speaker_heading: WOMAN COP
dialog: Wait, I know you.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: WOMAN COP
dialog: I didn't know you were out.
text: Corky smiles at the woman in black.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: When you get tired of Cagney and
dialog: Lacey, come find me.
text: She heads for the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough."
text: Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered
dialog: street.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: It is a hole but it is home.
text: Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a
text: beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons
text: from the radio.
text: We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small
text: desk lamp. We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up
text: the screen until there is nothing but the white light.
text: Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a
text: swath across the ceiling.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Corky is painting the ceiling. The folk ballad has become
text: an angry Riot Grrrl anthem.
text: She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth.
text: Sweat covers her face.
text: Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when
text: the phone rings. She stops and answers it.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...
dialog: yes, everything is going fine. I
dialog: got the tub drain all cleaned out.
text: She listens for a moment.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What apartment?
text: She glances at the main wall.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: All right, all right, I guess I could
dialog: take a look. Yeah, you're welcome,
dialog: goodbye.
text: She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling... curious.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door. She
text: seems surprised.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh no. Shit. I didn't know he would
dialog: call you. God, you must think |I'm
dialog: a total nuisance.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Not exactly.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm sorry, I usually would call
dialog: Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do
dialog: so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: He said you lost something.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah, come on in.
text: She steps back and Corky walks inside.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Violet leads her through the apartment. It is expensively
text: furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black
dialog: leather.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I was doing some dishes and just as
dialog: I pulled the stopper my earring fell
dialog: in.
text: Corky looks at her blankly.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It's one of my favorites. That's
dialog: why I got upset. I know it probably
dialog: seems ridiculous to you.
text: An eyebrow goes up.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm sorry, look, forget it. I
dialog: shouldn't have called...
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I told Bianchinni I would take a
dialog: look. Is it that sink?
text: Violet nods.
text: She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel
text: locks from her back pocket. The teeth of the channel locks
text: open and bite onto the pressure nut.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Do you have a pot or a bucket?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Sure.
text: She hands one down to her. Corky slides it under the curved
text: pipe.
text: As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the
text: hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs.
text: Water begins to trickle into the pan.
text: The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap. Water splashes
text: into the pan with a soft metal "tink."
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Did you find it?
text: Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring.
text: Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as
text: she tries to hug Corky.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I can't believe it! You did it!
text: Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Thank you so much. You have to let
dialog: me pay you something --
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do
dialog: it. I did it.
text: Corky checks the drain by running the water.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: If you won't take money, how about a
dialog: drink? It's getting late. You can't
dialog: work all night.
text: Corky eyes her for a moment.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Okay, one drink.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: A beer?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: A beer. Of course.
text: She smiles and turns to the bar.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Sit down.
text: Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns
text: with two bottles of Heineken. Corky sneers.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Thanks again.
text: They clink the bottles and swig.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You seem uncomfortable. Do I make
dialog: you nervous, Corky?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No.
text: She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Thirsty, maybe.
text: Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: Curious, maybe.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Curious? That's funny, I'm feeling
dialog: a bit curious myself right now.
text: Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's a great tattoo.
text: She reaches over and touches it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Beautiful labrys.
text: Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is. She nods,
text: rubbing it as if trying to hide it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Are you surprised that I know what
dialog: it is?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I have a tattoo, would you like to
dialog: see it?
text: She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she
text: opens the front of her dress.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: A woman in upstate New York did it
dialog: for me.
text: She is not wearing a bra.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Here. Do you like it?
text: Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright
text: green-stemmed violet.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It took her all day to do it. She
dialog: promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it
dialog: was sore for a long time after. I
dialog: couldn't even touch it.
text: Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But now I love the way it feels.
text: She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Here, touch it.
text: Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes
text: her hand and places it on her breast.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Violet looks at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to
dialog: seduce you.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Because I want to. I've wanted to
dialog: since I first saw you in the elevator.
text: Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb
text: presses into Violet's nipple.
text: Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky
text: staring at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You don't believe me. But I can
dialog: prove it to you.
text: She takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You can't believe me because of what
dialog: you see ...
text: She forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But you can believe what you feel.
text: Violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You see ... I've been thinking about
dialog: you all day.
text: Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans.
text: With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You planned this whole thing?
text: Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You dropped that earring down the
dialog: drain on purpose, didn't you?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: If I say yes, will you take your
dialog: hand away?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: ... yes.
text: Now it is Corky who smiles.
text: Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against
text: Corky's hand.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Please, Corky ... please ...
text: Her eyes barely open.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: ... kiss me.
text: In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck
text: and covers Violet's open mouth with her own.
text: With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky
text: lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more --
text: More desperate, more hungry until --
text: We hear the front door unlock and open.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet?
text: Violet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet, you home?
text: They scramble to compose themselves.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah. In here, C.
text: He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two
text: figures sitting close on the couch.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What's this?
text: He mistakes Corky for a man.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What the fuck is this?
text: Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I didn't expect --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What the fuck is going on?
text: Corky stands and turns, Caesar suddenly realizing that she
dialog: is a woman.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh, shit ...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ...
dialog: it's fucking dark in here.
text: He reaches to the wall for the lights.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: She is working for Bianchinni.
text: Caesar extends his hand.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh, right, right. Don mentioned
dialog: that to me. Hi, welcome to the
dialog: family.
text: Corky shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You're helping Rajeev?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No. Rajeev's in India.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: She's doing the work herself.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No shit. Bianchinni hired you? You
dialog: know he's a good friend of mine.
dialog: |Family, really.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: That's what Violet said.
text: He looks at her as if he knows something.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: So, you just got out?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Jesus, Caesar!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What? It ain't no big fuckin' deal.
dialog: I know who Don hires. Did you know
dialog: he did time himself?
text: Corky shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Thirteen fucking years. See, there
dialog: ain't no secrets here.
text: Corky doesn't like this man.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: How many'd you do?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Five.
text: He whistles.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Not bad. What for?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's none of your goddamn business,
dialog: Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You're right. You don't have to
dialog: tell me, if you don't want to. I
dialog: just hope you understand you're among
dialog: good people here.
text: He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of
text: money and peels several hundreds. Corky stares at it.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Come on, come on. if you understand
dialog: what I'm talking about you're going
dialog: to take the money. if you don't,
dialog: I'm going to have to worry about
dialog: you.
text: Corky takes it. Caesar smiles.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Good. I hate to worry. I got ulcers.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I should be going.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What? How about a drink?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: My brushes, I have to clean my
dialog: brushes. Thanks, though.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Another time.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and
text: separating the black bristles under the running water.
text: When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the
dialog: edge.
text: She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops,
text: noticing her left hand.
text: It is the hand that was between Violet's legs.
text: She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in
text: the mirror.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She drops her hand.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What am I doing? I'm fucking up,
dialog: that's what I'm doing.
text: She scrubs her hands clean.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: It is late, the area burnished with amber street light.
text: Corky walks from the building to her truck.
text: She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when
text: suddenly the passenger door opens and --
text: Violet gets in. Stunned, Corky stares at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I had to see you.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Look, I don't think this is a good
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I wanted to apologize.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Don't apologize, please. I can't
dialog: stand women who apologize for wanting
dialog: sex.
text: Violet smiles.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm not apologizing for what I did --
text: She slides across the seat.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm apologizing for what I didn't
dialog: do.
text: She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't
dialog: tell.
text: The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting,
text: breaks the kiss.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Do you have a bed somewhere?
text: Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: The sex.
text: There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it.
text: It is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian
dialog: sex --
dialog: Pungent and potent --
text: And when it is over, neither woman can move.
text: Finally, Corky's eyes flutter open.
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: I can see again.
text: Violet smiles.
text: Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge. She grabs a
text: beer and presses it to her sweating forebead.
text: After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can
text: elsewhere. Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh."
text: Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to
text: the bed.
text: She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can,
text: watching Violet's throat as she drinks.
text: Violet's eyes open.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: ... I needed that.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Tell me about it.
text: Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You have to ask?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.
dialog: Caesar calls it "The |Business."
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: How did you meet him?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: They took over a club I was working
dialog: at. Caesar started managing it.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: He's a launderer?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Basically.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: How long have you been with him?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Almost five years.
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: Five years is a long time.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: Corky stares at her beer. She knows what Violet is thinking.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: The redistribution of wealth.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Isn't that what you wanted to know?
dialog: What I did time for?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The redistribution of wealth?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: That's what I tell someone when I'm
text: trying to get them in my bed.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm already in your bed.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: My cellmate would say she did her
dialog: time for getting caught. She was
dialog: always more honest than me.
text: Corky sips her beer.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I started stealing when I was little.
dialog: We were piss-poor, which is not an
dialog: excuse, just a fact.
text: It isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone
dialog: she just met.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: The first time I remember so vividly.
dialog: A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's
dialog: Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was
dialog: a mean old prick, always worrying
dialog: about us robbing him, dropped a roll
dialog: of quarters.
text: We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I can still hear that sound, those
dialog: quarters, because right then something
text: clicked inside of me. Some instinct
dialog: took over and as everyone, including
text: Waxman, dove down, I reached up and
text: emptied the cash register.
text: Violet smiles. She likes this woman.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I gave most of the money to my mom.
dialog: I told her I found it at the
text: trainyard. She was so happy she
dialog: cried, calling me her lucky charm.
dialog: Fifteen years later, I guess my luck
dialog: ran out.
text: Sbe swallows that with beer.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't
dialog: have a choice, that stealing was
dialog: surviving. Usually I can admit that's
dialog: bullshit. I did it because it was a
dialog: way out. It was easy and I was good
dialog: at it, real good.
text: She glances at Violet.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I don't usually talk this much. I
dialog: guess I have been rehabilitated.
text: Violet laughs.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You didn't have to tell me if you
dialog: didn't want to.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I guess I wanted to.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm glad you did.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: So am I.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT DAY
text: Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools. Grinning
text: like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to
dialog: work.
scene_heading: EXT. LOBBY - DAY
text: Between the main doors she sees a man. His name is SHELLY
text: and he is an overdressed accountant.
text: He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: I know he's gone. Please. I have
dialog: to talk to you.
text: Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that
text: answers him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: What do you want, Shelly?
text: Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a
text: hushed voice.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: I have to leave. Tonight.
text: For a moment the intercom is silent. Then the door buzzes
text: and Shelly pushes inside. Corky follows him to the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her
dialog: circular saw.
text: Shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator
text: numbers go up. The doors open and he scurries out.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - DAY
text: She watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now
text: completely gone.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: It is later. Through the wall we listen to the same sound
text: as before of two people making love. We drop down and find
text: Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Her face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the
text: orgasm spread through her like melting butter.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I had this image of you, inside of
dialog: me ...
text: She flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Like a part of me ...
text: As she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky. Violet
text: watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You are so beautiful.
text: Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on. Violet
text: sits up. She can feel that something is wrong.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Nothing.
text: Violet pulls the sheet around her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes there is. I felt it this morning
dialog: when I brought you the coffee.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Shit, here we go.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You didn't want to see me, did you?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: If there is one thing I can't stand
dialog: about sleeping with women, it's all
dialog: the fucking mind reading.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I'm not afraid of anything.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don't understand - ?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I know! You can't understand, because
dialog: we're different, Violet. We're
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We're not that different, Corky.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: How can you sit in that bed and say
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Because it's the truth.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Let me guess. This is where you
dialog: tell me that what matters is on the
dialog: inside. That inside you, there is a
dialog: little dyke just like me?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's
dialog: a lot smarter than you.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Is that what her daddy tells her?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I know what I am. I don't need to
text: have it tattooed on my shoulder.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What are you saying? That you don't
dialog: have sex with men?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard
dialog: you! Thin walls, remember?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What you heard wasn't sex.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What the fuck was it?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: All my life, everyone has been telling
dialog: me that when I have sex, I'm not
dialog: really having sex. Not real sex.
dialog: But they're wrong. I know what is
dialog: and isn't sex and what you heard was
dialog: definitely not sex.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What was it then?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Work.
text: That knocks Corky back.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You made certain choices in your
dialog: life that you paid for. You said
dialog: you made them because you were good
dialog: at something and it was easy. Do
dialog: you think you're the only one that's
dialog: good at something?
text: Violet stare pins Corky to the wall.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We make our own choices and we pay
dialog: our own prices. I think we're more
dialog: alike than you want to admit.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What about that guy this morning?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You mean Shelly?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw
text: me in a bar with another woman.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I suppose he just wants to watch.
dialog: That's all Violet can take.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Fuck it! I think you better leave.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I think so, too.
text: Violet turns away.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Try not to steal anything on the way
dialog: out.
text: That stings but Corky walks out without looking back.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: It is dark now. Corky is standing above the paint tray that
text: has skinned over. She picks up the brush. It is dry with
dialog: paint.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Shit.
text: She throws the brush across the room.
scene_heading: EXT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: A green-and-white street sign juts in the foreground of
text: Caesar's upscale apartment building.
text: The sign reads: "FRANKLIN STREET."
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the
text: service entrance. In its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity
dialog: and sink.
text: Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the
text: bungee cords that hold down the boxes.
text: She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a
scene_heading: spot not far from her truck. THREE SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN get
text: out, leading a fourth, Shelly.
text: He is the only one who seems to notice Corky.
text: They enter the building, the door closing behind them.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she
text: finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work.
text: She stands, giving it a yank and pulling it away from the
text: wall, when voices begin to filter in from the next-door
dialog: apartment.
text: She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out
text: by an angry voice.
speaker_heading: ANGRY VOICE
dialog: Shut the fuck up! You piece of shit!
text: We hear a scream.
speaker_heading: ANGRY VOICE
dialog: You're going to tell us! You're
dialog: going to fuckin' tell us! just a
dialog: matter of fuckin' time!
text: Each sentence is punctuated with grunts and thuds.
speaker_heading: ANGRY VOICE
dialog: Where is it? Where the fuck is it?!
text: We begin to close in on Corky as she listens to each thud,
text: watching something that disturbs her.
speaker_heading: ANGRY VOICE
dialog: You shit! You piece of shit!
text: With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck
text: cymbal. As we move closer, the sound swells until --
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S BATHROOM DAY
text: Where blood splatters the toilet, heavy drops hitting the
text: water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds.
speaker_heading: ANGRY VOICE
dialog: Did that hurt? News flash, fucko:
dialog: I'm just getting started.
text: The angry voice belongs to JOHNNIE MARZZONE. Shelly is
text: kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back
text: with electrical wire.
text: Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani slacks,
text: silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots. His tie is tucked
text: in, as if torture were a fine-dining experience.
text: Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: You got nerve trying to fuck us!
dialog: Nobody fucks me! Nobody fucks my
dialog: father! Nobody! Nobody!
text: Shelly screams as Jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into the
dialog: toilet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Come on, he's making
text: too much noise.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Here, put this in his mouth.
text: Caesar hands a towel to Johnnie, who stuffs it into Shelly's
text: mouth.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating. She is trying to
text: block it out but cannot.
text: Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes,
text: trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom.
text: The bathroom door opens.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Prick! I can go all night! All
dialog: night!
text: Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind
text: him. Violet moves toward him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What? Oh, come on, I didn't use one
dialog: of the good towels.
text: The door opens again as someone else steps out.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, I'm serious. This is too
dialog: much. I have to get out of here.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Why? 'Cause you know him?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You women are so fucking sensitive.
text: He takes hold of her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: But I don't want you to go. I like
dialog: you here. You know this isn't easy
dialog: for me, either.
text: He embraces her. Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO
text: in the hallway, staring at her.
text: He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug.
text: Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Now why don't you go watch some TV
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Are you okay, Violet?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You
dialog: know how I feel about that fucking
dialog: psycho.
text: Mickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him
text: with her big doe eyes.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Caesar, didn't I tell you to get
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Sure, Mickey. Sure.
text: He goes to the kitchen.
text: Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a
dialog: father would do to his little girl.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You shouldn't have to see this. Why
dialog: don't you get out of here? Go for a
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar wants me to stay.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle
dialog: Caesar. You just get out of here,
dialog: okay?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Thanks, Mickey.
text: Caesar returns from the kitchen. He is holding a pair of
text: tin snips. Mickey takes them.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Thanks, C. Now let's end this thing.
text: Violet watches them return to the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named
text: LOU. He slaps Johnnie on the back.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.
text: Johnnie hits Shelly once more.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Prick.
text: Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully. Then he
text: begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating.
text: Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou,
text: who lifts Shelly's bound arms.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten
dialog: times. You understand? Ten times.
text: Mickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the
text: metal blades.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: One. Where is our money?
text: Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing. There is a sick
text: crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger
text: bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Aw ... Christ.
text: We hear Caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters the
text: frame, scooping up the pinky.
text: He plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it sinks to
text: the bottom.
text: Caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Corky can't stand it anymore. She throws her tools down,
text: leaves the bathroom and finds --
text: Violet waiting in the main room. Both women stand apart in
dialog: silence.
text: Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't
text: know how to start. Her lip begins to quiver; her eyes search
text: the room, returning to Corky each time.
text: The violence in the next room can still be heard.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Violet? Are you all right?
text: Almost unnoticeably, Violet shakes her bead. Corky puts her
text: arm around her.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Come on. Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - DAY
text: It is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon.
text: Dark wood and padded leather.
text: The bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice
text: Corky as she moves up to the bar.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The bartender glances over.
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: Draft beer and a TNT.
text: Corky eyes the men, who stare into their drinks.
text: The bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of
dialog: her.
text: Corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers.
text: Corky and Violet, the only women in the room, sit close
text: together at a far corner table.
text: Violet's voice is hushed.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Shelly was skimming from the business.
dialog: He came to see me yesterday because
dialog: he was afraid Caesar figured it out.
dialog: He wanted to run but he wanted me to
dialog: come with him.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Even though he knew about you?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: He was in love with you, right?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's what he told himself. But it
dialog: wasn't even about me, it was about
dialog: Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had.
dialog: That's how they are. I understand
dialog: them.
text: She glances around the room; a man at the bar smiles at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: For Shelly, taking the money was a
dialog: way to take from Caesar. He could
dialog: have run at any time, but he didn't
dialog: because he didn't want out.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Maybe he did. He would brag to me
dialog: all the time. He was never afraid
dialog: of Caesar because he didn't know
dialog: him. Not like I do.
text: Two men sit down near them, laughing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar lives for these moments. He
dialog: tells me it's just the business, but
dialog: I know it's more than that. He likes
dialog: it. The violence. I'll catch him
text: in the bathroom mirror touching his
text: scars. He says they remind him who
dialog: he his. They're all like that.
dialog: Except maybe Mickey.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Mickey?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He's the part of the business that
text: the rest of them pretend to be.
dialog: |But Mickey doesn't like it like
dialog: they do. I suppose that's why he's
dialog: good at it.
text: Violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I used to be able to block it out.
dialog: I would tell myself that I wasn't
dialog: really there so nothing really
dialog: mattered. But I can't do it anymore.
text: She downs the last of her drink.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I've been making the same mistake
dialog: Shelly made. But now I know what |I
dialog: want.
text: She turns to Corky.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I want out. I want a new life. I
dialog: see what I've been waiting for, but
dialog: I need you, Corky.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You made a choice once. Do you think
dialog: you would make that same choice again?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What choice?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: If those quarters fell to the floor,
dialog: would you still reach up to that
dialog: cash register?
text: Corky stares at her, knowing where this is going. She glances
text: around the crowded bar.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Not here.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S TRUCK - DAY
text: Through the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are
text: silhouettes against the street light.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar is going to get the money and
dialog: bring --
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: How much money?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Shelly said it was over two million
dialog: dollars.
text: Corky quietly swallows that pill. It begins to rain.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar will bring it to the apartment
dialog: to count and go through |Shelly's
dialog: books to figure out how he did it.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do
dialog: you have any idea what you are saying?
dialog: You are asking me to help you fuck
text: the mob.
text: Violet nods.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: These people are serious, Violet.
dialog: If you want to know how serious, ask
dialog: Shelly. They're worse than any cop
dialog: because they have lots of money and
dialog: no rules. You fuck them, you've got
dialog: to do it right.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's why I need your help. You
dialog: said you were good.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I am, but ...
text: She knows Violet is challenging her.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: All right, let's say for the moment
dialog: that I believe everything you are
dialog: saying.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You think I'm lying?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I didn't say that, but since you
dialog: did, let's say that you are. It
dialog: would have been easy to set Shelly
dialog: up. You could have got him killed
dialog: knowing that Caesar would bring the
text: money to the apartment.
text: Violet stares, her face poker-blank.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: All you would need to keep yourself
dialog: clean would be someone unconnected,
dialog: someone like me.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I'm just making a point. You have
dialog: no idea what you're asking. How
dialog: much trust two people need to do
dialog: something like this.
text: She moves closer to Violet, the sound of the rain beating
text: against the metal cab.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: For me, stealing is a lot like sex.
dialog: Two people that want the same thing
text: sit in a room and they talk, they
text: start to plan and it's like flirting,
dialog: a kind of foreplay, because the more
dialog: they talk about it, the wetter they
dialog: get.
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: The difference is, I can have sex
dialog: with someone I just met, someone I
dialog: hardly know, but to steal I need to
dialog: know someone like I know myself.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Do you think you know me like that?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I think ...
text: They are close enough to kiss.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: We're going to find out.
text: Corky pulls back.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: But first, I want to see this money.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open,
text: Caesar charging in. He is doubled over, clutching something
text: to his stomach.
text: He rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the
text: double sink. There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down
text: Caesar's front.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh my God ...
text: Violet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Don't worry. It ain't mine.
text: He pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, what happened?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: It was unbelievable! Un-fucking-
dialog: believable!
text: He pours himeslf a shot, belting it back.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Goddammit, look at this shirt! It's
dialog: ruined!
text: He begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: It started when Shelly took us to
dialog: the money. I tell you, Mickey Malnato
dialog: knows his shit, he does. Shelly
dialog: takes us right there.
text: He throws down another shot.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: So Shelly's down on his knees and
dialog: he's pulling out this bag of money
dialog: from a safe in the floor and I'm
text: staring at it like "holy fuck!" I
dialog: mean, look at it --
text: He tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: And all I can think is how the fuck
dialog: did he do this when - Bang! Johnnie
text: caps him. Blood sprays everywhere,
dialog: all over the money. We've no idea
dialog: if this is even all of it.
text: Caesar is exasperated.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: And right then I go through the roof
text: and - Boom! I belt the dumb fuck as
dialog: hard as I can. I didn't care whose
dialog: son he was, I just wanted to hit him
dialog: again. Knock some sense into that
dialog: dumb son of a bitch.
text: He looks at the pile of bloody money.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Just look at this mess I got to deal
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What are you going to do with it?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I told them to run it through the
dialog: cycles. But I guess Gino has plans
dialog: for it because he's coming here
dialog: tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
text: Searching through a sink cabinet, he can't find what he needs.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where the hell's the laundry
dialog: detergent?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Ummm ... in the linen closet.
text: Caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom. Violet's eyes
dialog: do not move from the pile of money.
text: Corky seems to come from nowhere. She whispers.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Come to my place in the morning.
dialog: Early, okay?
text: Violet nods.
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
text: Corky's hands twitch, and then flex against the ropes that
dialog: bind them.
text: A reflex echoes through her body, muscles spasm and limbs
text: jerk against their bonds.
text: As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting
text: toward the edge of consciousness until --
text: She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness.
text: We move toward her face, her closed eyes as we again hear
text: the voices in her head.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: You're having second thoughts.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Violet is on the bed, Corky at the window.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: ... no.
text: She turns to Violet.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You said he washed the money?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Then what? Exactly.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: He hung it up.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: To let it dry.
text: She begins to focus on the memory.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It was unreal ...
text: Moving in on her face.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
text: Benjamin Franklin's face on a hundred-dollar bill.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Franklin's face rotates as we pull back, seeing rows of bills
text: carefully paper-clipped to lines of string.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
text: Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere
text: like leaves.
text: Eyes filled with green, Violet turns inside the laundry lines
text: of money until she sees Caesar.
text: Wearing his undershirt, he is across the room standing at
text: the ironing board, ironing every single bill.
text: He seems to have one eye on her, one eye on his work.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: Then one by one, he ironed all of
dialog: it.
text: He sprays starch across several bills and presses the steaming
dialog: iron to them.

dialog: Did he sleep?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet is in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the machine-
text: shuffle of Caesar's bill counter.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: No. But neither did I.
text: We move past her, floating toward the wall.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: All night long I listened to that
dialog: sound.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: We drift across Caesar's desk, past bricks of bound bills,
text: as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: What sound?
text: He hits the counter again and we hear the sound, now very
text: loud as hundreds blur by, fluttering beneath us.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
text: The sound of money.
text: The sound rolls into thunder --
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: That seems to shake the apartment.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: And where is it now?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: In his office. I saw it this morning.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee.
text: Working furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees
text: her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide.
text: He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I need to go to the store.
text: He nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the
text: briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
text: It's in a case, on his desk.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: Does the case lock?
text: We see the open top with its silver flip-over locks.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Violet is trying to remember.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Good.
text: Corky begins to pace, ordering the information in her head.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Johnnie?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: It sounded like he and Caesar don't
dialog: like each other.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Like each other? They hate each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It started way before I was around.
dialog: I think basically it's because he
dialog: thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot.
dialog: But Johnnie runs Chicago because
text: Gino is his father.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Who is Gino?
text: Violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Gino Marzzone.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone,
dialog: head of the Marzzone family?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's his brother.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: ... shit.
text: Corky covers her mouth.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to
dialog: pick up the money?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie
dialog: Marzzone?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Sweet Jesus.
text: Eyes wide, she paces, pulling at her lip, mumbling.
text: Suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place. She looks at
dialog: Violet.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: It's perfect.
text: She's pacing again.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Gino Marzzone is coming to your
dialog: apartment. It's a big deal, isn't
dialog: it? That means Caesar will be ready.
text: He doesn't want to look like an idiot.
dialog: Gino has been there before?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yeah, twice.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Not much, really. Caesar was nervous,
dialog: kept cleaning the apartment. |The
dialog: first time, he picked out the dress
dialog: he wanted me to wear.
text: Something occurs to Corky.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Does Johnnie hit on you?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Johnnie hits on anything in high
dialog: heels.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Has Caesar ever seen him?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: He does it right in front of him.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: It's getting better and better.
dialog: Keep going.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Gino doesn't know English, or at
text: least he pretends he doesn't, so he
text: doesn't talk much. He gets right to
dialog: the point. Both times they talked
dialog: for about five minutes, had one drink
dialog: and then they left.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What did Gino drink?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that
dialog: Caesar made a huge deal about it.
text: Corky smiles, the wheels rolling.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: All right ...
text: She turns from the window and gets onto the bed.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I have an idea to make this work.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Violet is getting dressed, lining her lips with lip-pencil.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: You'll go back and get ready, take
dialog: your time, make it real.
text: As she works on her face, we see the room behind her and the
text: discarded dresses scattered about.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: The more attractive you are, the
dialog: more believable it will be.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Corky breaks her thought-train.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What time did you say they would be
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The plane is in at seven, so I'd say
text: about eight.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Any bodyguards?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Gino travels with a big man named
text: Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Fine.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Caesar again checks his watch.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
text: At some point Caesar is going to
dialog: quit. I'd guess sometime around
dialog: six, making sure he's got time to
dialog: get ready.
text: The watch reads 6:10. Caesar rubs his eyes, his temples.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Violet is at the bar in a sexy dress and high heels.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Un-fucking-believable, what this guy
dialog: did. Shelly is one smart-ass
dialog: mothefucker, I mean, he was one smart-
dialog: ass motherfucker.
text: He laughs as Violet smiles, handing him an enormous drink.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: As soon as he is done, you'll be
dialog: right there to put a big drink in
text: his hand.
text: He takes the drink.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: We want him to come down, to relax,
dialog: feel in control again.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Poor boy, has to work so hard.
text: She gives him a woman's sympathy pout; he knows what it,
dialog: loves it anyway.
text: Smiling, he slides his hand down over her ass.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You look good enough to eat.
text: She smiles and waits for the kiss she knows is coming.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Both women are starting to feel it, to believe it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Where will you be?
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: Waiting in the apartment next door.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT
text: Corky sits on the floor of the dark apartment. She has taken
text: off her boots, which are beside her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: Waiting for what?
text: Through the wall we can hear the shower.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: For the shower. That will be our
dialog: signal.
text: Corky opens a thin box filled with needle-thin lock picks.
text: She selects several and slips them into her multi-pierced
text: ears like earrings.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: When he's done with his shower, you
dialog: will go to the bar.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: In slow motion, Caesar drops the shower plunger and water
text: chokes from the faucet.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Behind the bar, Violet pulls out the bottle of Glenlivet.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: You'll get out the Scotch that Gino
dialog: drinks.
text: Violet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when
text: the bottle slips from her hands.
text: We watch it slowly fall --
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: And as you do, the bottle will slip
dialog: from your hands. -- and shatter
text: against the hardwood floor.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: An accident.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Shit! Oh shit!
text: Caesar yells from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: What happened?!
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Hearing Caesar, Corky gets up, moving quietly toward the
text: door.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: V! What the fuck was it?! Violet?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still
text: dripping.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: V, what? You can't hear me?
text: Violet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, it slipped ... I was trying
dialog: to get ready ...
text: Caesar realizing what happened.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh, fucking Christ ... You gotta be
dialog: kidding me!
text: He rushes at her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Fuck! Fuck! How did you ... Awwww
dialog: goddammit!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm sorry. It was an accident.
text: She stands up.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don't worry, I'll get some more.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: There's no time.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take
text: five minutes.
text: She turns him back toward the bedroom.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'll clean this up and be back before
dialog: you're even dressed.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Violet opens her door, stepping into the hall where Corky is
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: When you open the door, I'll be there.
text: They pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky
text: slips in.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: What if he sees you?
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: He won't.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails. We glide
text: over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools. We see his
text: hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a
dialog: nail.
text: Through the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually
text: across the living room.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Corky is looking for something.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You can't know for certain that he
dialog: won't see you.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Trust me, Violet.
text: She finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm just asking, what if?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: If he does ...
text: Corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring,
text: pulling out a gun.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Then I won't have a choice, will I?
text: She tosses the gun on the bed.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: The black case is lying on the desk, locked shut. Corky
text: moves around the desk, dropping down behind it.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: When I'm inside, I will get the money.
text: From her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out
text: the silver tool.
text: It takes only a second and the first lock pops open.
text: She is working on the other lock when the door is pushed
text: open and Caesar walks in.
text: Corky drops down, grasping for her gun --
text: As Caesar, wearing only underwear, enters. He blows on the
text: drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting
text: a suit from his closet.
text: The gun ready, Corky, pressed against the desk, waits until
text: he leaves.
text: She lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips
text: the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling
text: the bag with fat money bricks.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: I'm going to need something ...
text: Finished, she zips up the bag and looks about.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: ... to fill the case.
text: Sbe sees a stack of newspapers hidden near the desk.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, you should hide it near the
dialog: desk before you leave.
text: She fills the case, then closes it.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: At that point --
text: She thumbs the locks shut and they snap, unnaturally loud,
text: into place.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: They are both on the bed.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: There is no going back.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: When I get the Scotch, how do I know
dialog: you won't take off?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: The same way I'll know that you went
dialog: to Scotch. Trust.
text: Their faces are close, eyes still trying to read each other.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I still don't see how I'm going to
dialog: get clean with the money in the
dialog: apartment. Everyone will think I
dialog: did it.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Not Caesar.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Because of what you are going to
dialog: tell him. You have to make it as
dialog: real as you can. The moment you
text: open the door with the Scotch in
dialog: your hand, you will be covered, and
dialog: that moment is the most important
text: moment in the plan.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The door bursts open. Violet enters quickly, carrying a
text: bottle in a thin brown bag.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: If it's real enough, he'll believe
text: it, because deep down he'll want to.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: C! Shit, I'm sorry!
text: Caesar wanders out, tightening his tie. She looks at her
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: They were early.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: They just left, didn't they?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What are you, drunk?
text: He smiles, grabbing the bottle from her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You mean they weren't up here?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: No! They're still on their way.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: That doesn't make any sense.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
text: Caesar turns.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: I was getting out of the car when I
text: saw him in the Mercedes.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: It couldn't have been.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It was him. I'm positive.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: It's impossible!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, I know Johnnie. It was him.
dialog: I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't
dialog: believe I missed them. I knew you
dialog: were going to be upset so I thought
dialog: I'd apologize and give Gino the
text: Scotch. I honked a couple of times
text: but he didn't stop.
text: She watches him, her words caving in around him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: But Gino's plane doesn't get in for
dialog: another half-hour.
text: Violet thinks.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Actually, I didn't see Gino in the
dialog: car.
text: His eyes dart. His forehead beads with sweat. He turns
text: toward the office.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Violet is staring at Corky's mouth.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: If Caesar hates Johnnie like you
text: say, then the second he opens the
dialog: case he'll know, in his gut, that
dialog: Johnnie just fucked him. He'll
text: realize that he has no choice. He
text: can't touch Gino or Johnnie. There's
dialog: only one way out.
text: She pauses.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: He'll have to run.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: If he runs, everyone will assume he
dialog: took the money.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Caesar stands over the desk, afraid to open the case.
scene_heading: INT. CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Jesus, that's beautiful.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: If you're this goddamn smart, how
dialog: did you ever get caught?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Every job like this has moments where
dialog: things don't go so well and everyone
text: starts thinking about their own ass.
dialog: It's in those moments that everything
text: comes together or falls apart.
text: She looks dead at Violet.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I had a partner and she fucked me.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I think we're going to find out.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: The key turns and the locks pop. When Caesar sees the
text: newspaper, the whole world begins to spin.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar?
text: His chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into
dialog: fists.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No no no no ...
text: She moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh God ...
text: He slams the case shut, his head hanging down.
text: After a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to
dialog: cry.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ... I've been set up.
text: He seems ready to scream but can't say anything.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Johnnie?
text: The name is like water hitting hot oil.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: That fuck! That rat-fuck! Little
dialog: shit rat-fuck!
text: He starts punching the desk, each blow harder than the last.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky can hear him pounding. She looks down and smiles.
text: Between her legs is the open bag stuffed with money.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar is choking on his own rage.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why? Why would Johnnie do this?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Jesus Christ, Violet! Open your
dialog: fucking eyes! Johnnie hates me like
dialog: I hate him!
text: He starts to pound his fists against his own head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I hate that little fuck! I hate
dialog: him! I hate him! I should've done
dialog: him!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But you know he did it.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: So what?! So fucking what? Use
dialog: your head, Violet. The money is
text: gone. Gino is coming here to get
dialog: it. You think he's going to believe
dialog: me if I tell him his piss-hole son
dialog: stole it! Is that what you think?
dialog: I don't. You know what I think? I
dialog: think I'm a dead man. I'm one in
dialog: the brain. That's what I think!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, what are we going to do?
text: He grabs hold of his chair, using it to support himself
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I know what he wants me to do. He
dialog: wants me out of here. He wants me
dialog: to run.
text: She watches him, his body rocking against the chair.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: If I run, then everyone will think I
text: took the money and he walks away
dialog: with two million clean.
text: The words squeeze out like tears.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: God, I can see him right now driving
text: to get Gino. I can hear him laughing,
text: fucking laughing, laughing at me.
text: He swings the swivel chair over his head and smashes it down
text: on the desk. Again and again.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Laughing at me! Laughing at me!
text: The chair falls and he stands alone, covering his face to
text: hide his tears.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: C ...
text: She goes to hold him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Don't touch me!
text: He backs into the corner of the room.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Just leave me alone! I got to think!
text: Violet watches him trying to wipe the tears and sweat from
text: his face.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Got to think this through ...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, maybe we should run --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet, please!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie,
dialog: forget the money, let's just go now,
dialog: before it's too late --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Goddammit, Violet! Would you just
dialog: leave me the fuck alone! Please!
dialog: Leave! Now!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: All right, Caesar.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet enters, closing the door quietly behind her. She
text: looks at the wall, then goes to the bed and picks up the
dialog: phone.
text: As she dials, we move along the phone cord, following it
text: down to the jack in the wall.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: We move out from another jack, following a different cord.
text: Corky is sitting with her back to the wall. The black phone
text: beside her barely rings once before she answers.
text: She waits, saying nothing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: It's me.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
text: Violet whispers, her hand cupped over the mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He totally freaked. I've never seen
text: him like this. He's out of his
dialog: fucking mind.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: That's okay, as long as he believes
dialog: it was Johnnie.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Believes it! Jesus, it's driving
dialog: him crazy. He wants to kill him. I
dialog: don't know, Corky, I don't know what
dialog: he is going to do. I'm getting
text: nervous, really nervous.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: It's all right, Violet. It's working.
dialog: All we got to do is wait him out and
dialog: see what he does.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: What if he doesn't run?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: That means he probably will kill
dialog: Johnnie.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Listen, if he doesn't run, all you
dialog: have to do is break down, go to your
dialog: bedroom and pack some things, start
dialog: crying, saying you love him but you
dialog: can't do it. You're sorry but you
dialog: have to leave and just walk out.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: okay, all right.
speaker_heading: CORKY (V.O.)
dialog: We're almost there, Violet. just
dialog: hang on.
text: Violet hears him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He's coming ...
text: She hangs up quickly just as Caesar bursts in.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I got it! I know what I got to do!
dialog: I got to get the money.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The money? The money's gone.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to
dialog: do is get it back.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But it could be anywhere.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: He didn't have that much time. He
dialog: had to pick up Gino. I bet you he's
dialog: got it with him. I bet it's in the
dialog: car.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky presses against the wall, trying to hear.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar is pacing.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: He didn't see you, did he?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: See, right now he doesn't know that
dialog: I know, that's why he put the paper
dialog: in the case. He wants me to hand
text: the case to Gino. Then there is no
dialog: doubt it was me. Gino will put a
dialog: bullet in me himself. But it ain't
dialog: going to happen. I won't let it!
dialog: Johnnie ain't going to fuck me! Not
dialog: like this! No way!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: This is insane!
text: She throws open her closet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She grabs a suitcase from under the bed.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm leaving! This is crazy! I don't
dialog: want to be involved. I don't want
dialog: anything to do with this shit!
text: She starts yanking the dresses from the closet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You can't leave.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The hell I can't!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I need you ...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Bullshit! You don't need me! You've
dialog: never needed me! I can't help you!
dialog: Understand?! I have to get out.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet, I won't let you leave.
text: She turns and sees that he is holding a gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: If you're not with me, Violet, then
dialog: I have to assume you're against me.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, this is crazy.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe
dialog: you dropped the Scotch by accident.
dialog: Maybe you didn't.
text: Now it is her turn to feel the world spin.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: It would have been so easy to let
dialog: him in as you went out.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You don't, you can't believe that
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I've seen the way he looks at you.
dialog: He's always wanted you. Maybe two
dialog: million dollars finally bought you.
text: She slaps him hard. He stares at her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be
dialog: this way.

text: the closet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I hope you understand. I want to
dialog: trust you, I want to believe you,
dialog: but I don't have any other choice.
text: He shuts the closet.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar is at the bar, drinking the Scotch. The gun in front
text: of him. Across the room, Violet sits, staring holes through
dialog: him.
text: They wait in silence.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You sure you don't want a drink?
text: Violet says nothing.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: In the dark, Corky sits, her face, her posture very similar
text: to Violet's.
text: She is concentrating, her mind somewhere else, when the door
text: buzzer sounds.
text: She turns her head and hears Caesar faintly answering the
text: intercom.
text: Corky stands just as --
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Violet stands.
text: Caesar faces her for a moment, then shoves the gun into his
text: belt behind his back.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky watches through the door peep as three men pass by.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: There is a knock and Caesar opens the door.
text: GINO MARZZONE is an old Italian whose face is a mask of
text: irritated indifference.
text: ROY, his enormous driver, is behind him.
text: Caesar smiles, greeting them in Italian with open arms.
text: Johnnie is the last inside. He has tape over his broken
text: nose. He smiles and hugs Caesar.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: You shouldn't have hit me.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You want to get into this now?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: No, no, Caesar. Not now.
text: He smiles again, patting him on the shoulder, then throwing
text: a fake punch.
text: Caesar sees Gino with his bright Italian smile, flattering
text: Violet, kissing her.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Hey, Caesar! You take care of this
dialog: girl, or I find out!
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
text: As he bends to kiss her hand, she sees Caesar watching them.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Glenlivet, right, Gino?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm not drinking.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Then neither will I.
text: This makes Violet very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Caesar, make that two TNTs.
text: Caesar's hand shakes as he pours Gino's Scotch.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Pacing in her socks, Corky tries to think through several
text: possible situations. She stops, staring at the bag of money.
text: The idea of its sitting out in the open suddenly bothers
dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar hands Violet and Johnnie a drink. He stares at her.
text: She stares back.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Salud, eh. Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar.
text: Caesar watches Johnnie, suspecting everything he does.
text: Johnnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a cellular
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: No, Johnnie. No goddamned phones.
dialog: Not now.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Pop?
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk
dialog: now. You too, Johnnie.
text: Each man sits on either side of Gino.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Caesar, look at me. Johnnie tell me
dialog: what happened. Caesar, you gotta do
dialog: me a favor, a personal favor. For
dialog: me, eh? You gotta start respecting
dialog: Johnnie the way you respect me. You
dialog: understand? Good.
text: Caesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the
text: smile disappears.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: And you, Johnnie. You gonna stop
dialog: acting stupid. You gotta earn this
dialog: respect that Caesar's gonna give.
dialog: You understand? Good. Done. Now,
dialog: where's my money?
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five-
text: gallon bucket of paint.
text: As she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside
text: another bucket.
text: She pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped
text: by the milk-white liquid.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table.
text: Gino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: We know how this was done, eh?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yeah, I know.
text: He looks dead at Johnnie.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: It won't happen again, eh?
text: Caesar shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Good.
text: Gino throws down the last of the Scotch.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Done. We go now.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Jesus Christ, Pop. You got two hours
dialog: until your plane leaves.
text: Gino checks his watch, shouting in Italian. Johnnie shouts
text: back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Caesar!
text: He gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning
text: back. Caesar gets the bottle.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: So Caesar, what did it total out at?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Two point one seventy-six.
text: Johnnie whistles as Caesar pours Gino another Scotch.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Unbelievable. Can you believe that,
dialog: Violet?
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Hey, Johnnie ...
text: In Italian tells him to shut up.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Come on, Pop, all I want to know is
dialog: one thing. Just one thing after he
dialog: made such a big deal out of it. I
dialog: bet it wasn't a big deal. Was it,
dialog: Caesar?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What's that, Johnnie?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: The money I bet it was nothing to
dialog: get it clean, after you made such a
dialog: fucking big deal ...
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Johnnie, what did I say?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Pop, this is important to me. It's
dialog: a simple question. if he would just
dialog: answer the question, that's the end
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is this going, Johnnie?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Just admit it, Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Admit what?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: That you overreacted. That you lost
dialog: it. Not me. It was your mistake.
text: Caesar sees it so clearly now.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: All right, Johnnie, you want to play
dialog: it this way, I can play it this way.
dialog: You want to know who made a mistake,
dialog: why don't you open the case.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar ...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Shut up, Violet! This is between me
dialog: and Johnnie.
text: He pushes the case toward him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You want to do this now, let's do
dialog: it. Open the case. Open the fucking
dialog: case.
text: Johnnie stares at him, feeling that something is very wrong.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: That's right, I know. I fucking
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Know what?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Open the case!
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: All right! Where's the key?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You don't need a key.
text: He tries but it's locked.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: How the fuck can I open it?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: The same way you did before.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Caesar smiles and tosses the key onto the table.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: There you go, Johnnie.
text: He reaches for the key. Caesar stands up and gives Violet
text: his drink.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Get me another.
text: He can see the fear on her face as she goes to the bar.
text: Time drips.
text: The key turns. One lock pops.
text: Then the other.
text: Tbe case opens like a scream and Johnnie sees the newspaper.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: What the ...
text: Before anybody can move, Caesar whips around with his gun.
text: Roy jumps off his stool, his drink crashing to the floor.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Don't! Don't fucking move!
text: Nobody can believe what is happening.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Caesar? What is this?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Ask Johnnie! Ask your rat-fuck son!
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: What the fuck?
text: Caesar levels the gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You don't think I'll do it, do you?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: I think you're fucking crazy!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Where's what?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: The money!
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: Caesar, I don't know what you're
dialog: thinking here, but if you don't put
dialog: down that gun --
text: He stands up.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Sit down!
text: He does.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Caesar!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Gino, your son stole this money to
dialog: set me up and I can prove it. Violet!
text: She doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Tell them! Tell them!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what
dialog: he says.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: This isn't happening ...
text: Boom! Caesar blows a hole in the couch right between
text: Johnnie's legs. Johnnie screams.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: The next one blows off your dick.
speaker_heading: JOHNNIE
dialog: You're a dead man! A fucking dead
dialog: man!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Enough!
text: Gino jumps up.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No, Gino!
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: You aim a gun at me?! Do you know
dialog: who I am?! I am Gino Marzzone. You
dialog: understand?
text: He starts walking toward Caesar. Roy moves around for a
dialog: good angle.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Sit down, Gino!
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Stay away!
text: He backs up as Gino walks straight to him.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: We're family, Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Gimme the gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I can't. I can't.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Give it to me.
text: He reaches up and takes bold of the barrel. Caesar looks
text: resigned as he shuts his eyes.
speaker_heading: GINO
dialog: Good man.
text: Close on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as --
text: Caesar fires.
text: From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time
text: melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his
text: eyes wide in disbelief.
text: His body hits the floor and the room erupts.
text: Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire,
text: pumping the trigger.
text: Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling
text: towards his father.
text: Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering
text: and sliding across the floor.
text: Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting
text: Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle
text: everything around him.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone,
text: whispering.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: This is an emergency!
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Crunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only
text: sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet:
dialog: Click. Click.
dialog: Click.
text: Rising, she peers over the edge of the bar.
text: Caesar is standing in the aftermath. His gun is still aimed
text: at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over.
text: The bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them.
text: Blinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I had to do it, Violet. You saw it.
dialog: I had no choice. It was Johnnie.
dialog: That lying fuck. He made me do it.
text: He looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You lying rat-fuck. You think you
dialog: can set me up? Is that what you
dialog: think? You stupid fuck.
text: Kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm a dead man? I'm a dead man?
dialog: Guess again, fuck-face. Who's dead?
dialog: Who's the dead lying rat-fuck? Take
dialog: another guess, take another fucking
dialog: guess!
text: He stops, panting, unable to catch his breath. Violet is
text: afraid to even look at him.
text: Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards.
text: Caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his
text: face. He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets.
text: He finds his keys.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Lost in thought, he goes to Gino. Throwing open the coat,
text: he sees the airplane ticket. There is a bullet hole in it.
text: He checks the times and then his watch.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ... maybe three hours.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What do you think we're going to do?
dialog: We have to find the money.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Once we have the money, then none of
dialog: this ever happened.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No I didn't. Not if his body
dialog: disappears and not if the money is
dialog: still here. Then they never showed
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What happened to them?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I don't know. We may never know,
dialog: but I'm going to guess it was a job,
dialog: maybe the Karpoli family.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: All part of the business.
text: He picks up Roy's gun and stuffs it in his belt.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: We just got to find the money. Once
dialog: we do, everything is going to be all
dialog: right.
text: In the distance, the wail of a police siren can be heard.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Through the window they see a squad car, lights blaring,
text: roll up in front of the building.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, no.
text: He turns back to the carnage.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, what are we going to do?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: They're just cops. Stall them as
dialog: long as you can.
text: Caesar flies into action.
text: Grunting, he hauls Gino's body up, drags it to the bathroom
text: and throws it into the tub. He returns for Johnnie's body.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Standing near the bathroom, Corky hears the metal echo of
text: the tub. Looking at her tub, she imagines what he is doing.
text: Through the wall, she hears the door buzzer.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The buzzer sounds again as Violet sees him lift Roy's body.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Answer it!
text: He heads back to the bathroom, dropping Roy onto the other
dialog: two.
text: The three bloody bodies fill the tub.
text: We see Johnnie's arm hanging over the edge as Caesar snaps
text: the shower curtain around, hiding them.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: COP #1 (V.O.)
dialog: This is the police, ma'am.
text: She cuts them off using the intercom.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The police?
text: Over her shoulder she sees Caesar moving the furniture,
text: clearing the area around the heavy bloodstains.
speaker_heading: COP #1 (V.O.)
dialog: We had a report of gunfire, so if
dialog: you could --
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Gunfire? Is this a joke?
text: Violet sees Caesar hurry to his office.
speaker_heading: COP #1 (V.O.)
dialog: No joke, ma'am. Please open the
text: door.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: How do I know you are cops?
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Caesar seizes the beautiful oriental rug in his office and
text: yanks it up, overturning furniture. Dragging it out, he
text: slams the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet looks at Caesar, who is working with the calm, single-
text: minded focus of a machine.
speaker_heading: COP #1 (V.O.)
dialog: Ma'am, you have to open the door.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: All right.
text: She buzzes them in as Caesar throws the rug like someone
text: making a bed, letting it fall to the floor and cover most of
text: the blood.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
text: The cops are waiting for the elevator. After a moment, the
text: door slides open.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Violet moves away from the intercom as Caesar begins arranging
text: the furniture on the rug.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Get me a wet towel.
text: His words push her to the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Stuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water. She
text: does not even look at the shower curtain.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: The elevator opens and the cops step out.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar grabs the television remote, hits "on" and jacks the
text: volume until it is obviously loud.
text: Violet returns and he snatches the towel from her.
scene_heading: INT. HALL
text: As the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television.
text: They look at each other, already knowing what happened.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Like a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until
text: there is a knock on the door. He grabs Violet by the arm.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: If you're thinking about doing
dialog: something stupid, remember I just
dialog: killed Gino Marzzone. You understand
dialog: what that means?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: They're just cops.
text: There is another knock, much louder.
text: Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked
text: jacket and shirt.
text: He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet
text: opens the door. Tbe cops smile.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: See? We're for real.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: You did the right thing.
text: Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands
text: and face.
text: Violet opens the door.
text: Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink.
text: Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking
text: comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Hey, hey, Chicago's finest.
text: He plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: How's it going tonight, fellas?
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Pretty good, sir.
text: Caesar turns his head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Huh? I'm sorry, I can only hear in
dialog: this ear.
text: Tbe cops look at each other again.
text: Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with
text: each of them.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet.
text: They smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet said something about gunshots?
text: Violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building
dialog: called in.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: I think we know what happened.
speaker_heading: COP #2
text: It was probably just the television.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: The television?
text: He looks at Violet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Honey, why didn't you say something?
dialog: Turn it off.
text: Violet walks across the rug and turns off the TV.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Fuck, this happened before. It's
dialog: this shitty ear. Born with it. The
dialog: batteries wore out in my aid. I'm
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: It's all right, sir.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: No big deal.
speaker_heading: CAESAR

speaker_heading: COP #2

text: Caesar's face tightens.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yeah, why not? It's right there.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Thanks.
text: He heads for the john.
text: Violet watches Caesar back up to the bar, moving behind it.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm going to make myself a drink, if
dialog: that's okay?
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Go right ahead, sir.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM NIGHT
text: Cop #2 enters, walking right past the shower curtain. We

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Cop #1 walks onto the rug, looking around, turning to Violet.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: This is a beautiful place.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: ... thank you.
text: She stares at his shoes on the rug.
text: Watching everything, Caesar takes a sip of his drink. He
text: slips his gun out and holds it at his side.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: There is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine
text: Johnnie's arm is hanging.
text: Slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic
text: curtain, where a drip of blood forms and --
text: Plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Close on the heel of the cop's black shoe, where we can almost
text: see the blood seeping up through the oriental rug.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Is this a condo?
text: Violet nods.
text: Everyone turns when Cop #2 busts out of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Okay, let's roll.
text: Cop #1 walks across the rug to the hardwood floor. He turns
dialog: to Caesar.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Try to keep the extra batteries for

speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Good idea.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet. The door closes.
text: She isn't sure what she should do.
text: Over her shoulder, she notes the bucket of paint. She lets

scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar puts on a new shirt, the gun stuffed in his pants.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky rises at the sound of Caesar's door closing.
text: We track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the

scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty
text: apartment, straight at the peephole.
text: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT Corky is pressed against the door, eye
text: at the peephole.
text: She sees that Violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak

speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: ... shit.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's
text: Mercedes. Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.
text: From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building. Hiding
text: behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot.
text: Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her
dialog: hand.
text: Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward
text: the busy street.
text: Standing, Caesar pounds on the car.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, someone could see us out
dialog: here.
text: Ignoring her, be tries to think.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Get in.
text: Still too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar
text: slam the trunk.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Get in! It's got to be at his house.
dialog: That's the only other place it could
dialog: be.
text: Violet looks around the lot, looking for some way out.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet! Now!
text: Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Alone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint. She kicks it

speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Two million dollars, Cork ... Two

scene_heading: EXT. JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT.JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
text: Close on Caesar, as he rakes his sweaty hair back, his face
text: knotted in torment.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Okay, I come in ...
text: He turns as if he just came in through the front door.
text: We see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste. The furniture
text: is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes
text: punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn
dialog: up.
text: Caesar doesn't look much better.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I've got the money ...
text: Huddled in a corner, Violet watches him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR

text: Caesar moves from the front door, trying to get into Johnnie's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Now I don't have much time ...
text: He takes a couple of steps into the room.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Got to put it someplace safe ...
text: He looks at a closet. It's gutted, searched 10 times already.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ... put it ...
text: A couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over-turned
text: rolltop desk.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ... got it ...
text: He starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the
text: first time that it is destroyed. He is near the breaking
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: C?
text: His voice cracks. There is nowhere else to look.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where did I put it?
text: He explodes. A terra cotta lamp sails across the room.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where's my fucking money?! Fucking
dialog: cocksuckers! Where the fuck is it?!
text: He smashes his forehead into the wall, denting the drywall.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Ow.
text: He holds his head, sinking to the ground.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: C?
text: She sits next to him, putting a hand lightly on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It's not here, Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where, then?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don't know. it could be anywhere.
text: We don't even know if he was alone.
dialog: Please, Caesar, we don't have much
dialog: time. Let's get out of here.
text: He knows what he has to do. Digging through the debris, he
text: finds the phone.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: We're going to need some time.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Who are you going to call?
text: Already dialing, he does not answer
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar?
text: Ceaar takes a deep breath, mustering composure.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Hey, Mickey.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, God.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Caesar? What the fuck time is it?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Mick, I know it's late, but there is
dialog: a problem. They haven't shown up
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: What? They ain't there?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No. I don't know where they are. I
text: even called over at Johnnie's, but
text: no answer.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Okay. Let me call around. I'll see
dialog: what I can do. Don't go anywhere,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Okay, sure, Mick.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Caesar, you still got the money?
text: Caesar looks at Violet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yeah, Mick. I've got the money.
text: I'm staring right at it.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.
text: He hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar drags himself in. Violet closes the door behind them.
text: Caesar moves into the room where it happened. He is dizzy
text: and confused and does not want to be here.
text: Violet turns him around.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'll start packing. You know what
dialog: you have to do.
text: She turns him toward the bathroom. He nods.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in
dialog: Lake Michigan ... I need plastic
dialog: bags ... tape and rope ...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Just hurry.
text: Nodding, he heads for the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet enters and goes straight for the phone. She looks at
text: the blank wall as she dials.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Please, Corky ...
text: The phone rings.
text: When Corky answers, Violet almost collapses with relief.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, thank God.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I'm still here.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I was so afraid you ...
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You don't quit on me, Violet, and I
dialog: won't quit on you.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: A box of Hefty bags tucked under his arm, a coil of
text: clothesline in his hand, Caesar searches through several
dialog: cabinets.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet glances at the door.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Corky, it worked! He's going to
dialog: run. He needs to take care of the
text: bodies to buy himself time, but as
text: soon as he leaves, it's over.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky falls against the wall.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: just a little longer and it's ours.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Mumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading
dialog: for the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were
text: touching Corky.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Corky, I have to tell you something
dialog: ...
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky turns to the wall.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I know, Violet. I know.
text: Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over,
text: where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact
dialog: same place.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: It's why I'm still here.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Violet?
text: As he opens the door, she slams down the phone.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The line cuts off.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything,
text: grabbing for his gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Who was that?
text: He levels the gun at her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Who the fuck was that?
text: She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Was that Mickey? Did you call Mickey?
dialog: Did you?!
text: She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed. The gun
text: aimed at her, he picks up the phone and --
text: Hits the redial.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and
text: answers it on reflex.
text: Listening, she waits.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Mickey? Is that you?
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar hits the redial again.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud
text: in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing
text: in the empty apartment.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Corky rips the plug out of the wall.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The line goes dead.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Who is that? Who is over there?!
dialog: Tell me!
text: She tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT
text: Corky hears Violet scream and that does it. Gun in hand,
text: she flies at the door.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing
dialog: it, starts to run --
text: But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him
text: crashing to the dresser.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Run! Just run!
scene_heading: INT HALL - NIGHT
text: The door to Caesar's apartment is locked. Corky falls to
text: one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar raises the gun to pistol-whip Violet and she screams.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Working the lock, Corky hears Violet's scream cut off.
text: She feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder.
text: A shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears
text: something that sounds like footsteps. Corky freezes.
text: Corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole.
text: She can almost feel Caesar beyond the door, but grits her
text: teeth and turns the doorknob.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The door cracks open and Corky slips in, gun-first. As she
text: moves into the room, we see Caesar behind her.
text: He puts his gun to her head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Drop the fucking gun or die!
text: Corky hesitates.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Drop it!
text: She does.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Turn around.
text: Rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You!? Holy fucking Christ! You
dialog: gotta be kidding me!
text: He starts to laugh when she strikes --
text: Knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against
dialog: the door as --
text: She twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as --
text: He steps and kicks her full in the face.
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
text: Still unconscious, Corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick.
text: We see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick
text: split the skin. She is again swimming toward consciousness.
text: We hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer,
text: the sounds and voices echoing.
speaker_heading: CESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Wake up! Come on, you fucking dyke!
text: We hear Caesar slapping her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Wake up!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink
dialog: open.
text: Coming into focus is Caesar, standing over her with an empty
text: glass in one hand.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Good.
text: Except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound
text: in the closet.
text: Caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I know everything now so I don't
dialog: want to hear any "I don't know"
dialog: bullshit, you understand?
text: She sees Violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: God, I should have seen this coming!
dialog: The second I met you, I knew it.
dialog: Everyone knows your kind can't be
dialog: trusted! Fucking queers make me
dialog: sick.
text: The gun digs into her cheek.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: But you tried to fuck the wrong guy.
dialog: And I swear to you that I'm going to
dialog: kill you for it.
text: He thumbs back the hammer.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is the money?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don't tell him --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Shut up, Violet!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He can't kill you --
text: He aims the gun at Violet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Not until he has the money!
text: He fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the
text: wall behind her.
text: His point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Now, where the fuck is my money?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Lick me.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Either pull the trigger or get that
text: thing out of my face.
text: Blood temperature rising again, Caesar pulls the gun back
text: and slaps her with it.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Stupid cunt!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, stop acting like an asshole
dialog: and think --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Don't try to tell me what to do.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You need the money just like we do.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Shut up, Violet.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Let us go and we'll make a deal.
text: He rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
text: He looks at Corky.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What did you do to her?! This isn't
dialog: my Violet!
text: He looks at her as if unable to recognize her
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What did she do to you?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Everything you couldn't.
text: He shoves her down.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You ungrateful bitch! You had nothing
dialog: before I met you. You were nothing!
text: He stomps around the room.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Who gave you this place? This
dialog: apartment?
text: He throws open the closet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Who gave us all of this? I did! I
dialog: gave you everything! I gave you
dialog: this life! I made you, Violet. I
dialog: saved you.
text: He seems to believe what he is saying.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I saved you.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Ha! What a load of crap. Look at
dialog: yourself, Caesar. You're a thug.
dialog: |You launder money for the mob. You
dialog: rent women like you rented this
dialog: apartment.
text: He doesn't want to hear this.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Saved me? You don't even know me.
dialog: You used me, Caesar, just like I
dialog: used you. All part of the business.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You betrayed me!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You murdered Gino!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I had to. You made me.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Bullshit, you killed him. Not me.
dialog: You did it because you couldn't stand
dialog: the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Shut up!
text: He slaps her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Okay, you want business, I'll give
dialog: you the fucking business.
text: He leans closer.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm going to make you beg just like
dialog: Shelly did. Just like Shelly!
text: He storms out of the room.
text: Corky looks up at Violet.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm sorry, Corky ...
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Don't be sorry. Help me.
text: She pulls at the ropes as Violet slides off the bed.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers
text: that Mickey used to cut off Shelly's finger.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The two women are back-to-back, fingers working at each
text: other's knots when Caesar bursts into the room.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh, no no no.
text: Grabbing Corky by the boots, he drags her and flips her so
text: that she can now see Violet.
text: He drops down onto Violet putting the clippers in front of
text: her face.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Hey, Violet, you remember these?
text: Her eyes widen with terror. She starts to scream when he
text: stuffs a towel in her mouth.
text: Laying against Violet, he turns to Corky.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm going to start with her so you'll
dialog: get a good idea what's coming.
text: He takes hold of Violet's pinky finger, stretching it out.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm going to ask you where the money
dialog: is. Every time you don't give me an
dialog: answer, I'm going to cut off one
dialog: finger.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: When I reach ten, then I'll start
dialog: with you.
text: He puts the finger between the blades.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is the money?
text: Corky sees Violet thrashing helplessly. She has no choice.
text: Her mouth opens as --
text: The door buzzer rings.
text: Caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ... Mickey.
text: He sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook.
text: The door buzzer rings again, more insistently. Corky sees
text: him momentarily unnerved.
text: He looks back at her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I said where --
text: He starts to cut and Corky screams --
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: No! I'll tell you!
text: He stops, the door buzzing continuously.
speaker_heading: CORKY
text: It's over there in the empty
dialog: apartment.
text: As she speaks, the sound of the door buzzer changes.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I put it inside one of the paint
dialog: drums.
text: He is not looking at her; listening, he realizes that Mickey
text: is buzzing the other apartments.
text: CAESAR stands as the buzzing stops. He pulls out his gun
text: and aims it at Corky.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I promised I would kill you.
text: He cocks it.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You can't kill me yet.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I could be lying.
text: His hand start to shake with ftustration. He is beginning
text: to hate this woman more than he ever hated Johnnie.
text: Taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You're going to wish to God you hadn't
dialog: done that.
text: He kicks her again, snapping her head back.
text: After he leaves, Violet looks over and sees Corky lying
text: unconscious.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it
text: is locked.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Fuck.
text: At the end of the hall, the elevator "dings." Just as the
text: door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment.
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Son of a bitch ...
text: His mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to
text: the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: With another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the
text: closet. In her pocket, he finds the key.
text: He closes the doors, then hangs up the phone.
text: Grunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder --
text: When there is a knock on the door.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws
text: Corky's gun into the freezer. Mickey is banging on the door
text: as Caesar heads for the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Dropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain
text: and turns on the shower.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Mickey will get in. I know he will.
text: We hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts
text: tearing off his clothes.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet. I can kill you right now if
dialog: that's what you want. If you want
dialog: to live, then you have to help me.
dialog: I need you to make Mickey believe
dialog: that everything is normal.
text: He picks up his gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Tell me, do you want to live?
text: She stares hard at him and his gun, then nods.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Good girl.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: We move toward the door as the lock clicks open.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet's hands are untied. She pulls off the gag and the
text: ropes at her feet.
text: Naked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting
dialog: everything.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Still dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped
text: around his waist, another towel in his hand.
text: Mickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room.
text: Caesar jumps.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Caesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Holy fuck, Mickey! You scared the
dialog: shit outta me.
text: He sees they both are holding their guns.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What is this? what are you two doing,
dialog: sneaking in here with your peckers
dialog: in your hands? You gonna do me,
dialog: Mick? Is that it?
text: Mickey smiles, putting his gun away.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: No, Cease. There was no answer.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I thought I heard someone knocking.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I
dialog: guess you couldn't hear me on account
text: of being in the shower.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yeah, it was Violet's idea. I was
dialog: so wound up about Gino, she was trying
dialog: to help me relax.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: That Violet is one nice lady. Wish
dialog: someone would help me relax.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get
dialog: you a drink. Sit down, Lou.
text: Behind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we
text: see the gun hidden inside it.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already
dialog: working.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar is making the drinks.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: We was worried about you, Cease.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Me? Why?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: We went over to Johnnie's place just
dialog: to check it out and it was busted
dialog: up, Bad.
text: Caesar hands him a drink.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I started thinking maybe it's about
dialog: the money so I call you, but all I
dialog: get is the busy signal. I figure
dialog: the phone is off the hook, that's
dialog: why I come rushing over here.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a
dialog: fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hey, if Violet was helping me relax,
dialog: I'd probably do the same thing.
text: Mickey smiles as he sips his drink.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet stands and goes to the shower curtain. She reaches
text: in and turns off the water. Steadying herself, she pulls
text: back the curtain, exposing the wet, bloody bodies.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mickey is looking at the furniture.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Cease, can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Why'd you move all the furniture
dialog: around?
text: The knot in Caesar's stomach tightens.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Let me guess. That was Violet's
dialog: idea, too.
text: He laughs, and Lou laughs with him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Actually, yeah, she was nervous about
dialog: Gino coming, wanted everything to
dialog: look right. You know women, Mick.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Sure, Cease. They make us do stupid
dialog: things, don't they.
text: Caesar smiles feebly.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet has pulled up Johnnie's body and is digging through
text: his coat pockets, searching for something.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mickey sees the briefcase still on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Is that the money?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yeah, that's it.
text: Caesar puts his hand inside the towel as Mickey walks across
text: the rug.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: That fucking Shelly. I gotta hand
dialog: it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were
dialog: him I would have bailed a long time
dialog: ago. I mean, how much money does a
dialog: man need?
text: Talking to Lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo
text: moving right between the wet spots.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I remember I was just staring at all
dialog: this goddamn money, Shelly down on
text: his knees, and the next thing I know,
text: Johnnie just blows his head off.
text: He slaps the case up onto the bar.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: What a fucking mess. Johnnie's
dialog: laughing his ass off and that's when
dialog: Caesar lost it and - Boom. He
text: coldcocked him. Fucking coldcocks
dialog: Johnnie Marzzone.
text: He thumbs the latches but the case is still locked.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: The key, yeah, the key's in my pants
text: in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Fuck it, I don't need the key.
text: Caesar takes the smallest breath.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I didn't need a key to get in here,
dialog: did I?
text: He pulls out a lock-pick and starts working the lock. The
text: muscles in Caesar's forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his
dialog: gun.
text: He is slipping toward that same desperate choice. He is
dialog: going to attack when --
text: Across the room, the phone rings.
text: Everyone looks at it.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Who the hell could that be?
text: The phone is near the couch. Caesar doesn't want to let go
text: of the gun.
text: The phone continues to ring.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You gonna answer it?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet has Johnnie's cellular phone.
text: Watching through the cracked door, Violet sees Caesar cross
text: to answer the phone.
speaker_heading: CESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Hello, Caesar. This is Gino.
text: Caesar looks toward the bathroom.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You're blowing your only chance.
dialog: Act like I'm Gino.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar's eyes light up.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Holy shit, I don't believe it! We've
dialog: been going crazy over here, Gino!
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: Good boy.
text: Mickey jumps up.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: It's Gino! It's Gino!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Where in the hell is he?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We were in a car accident --
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
text: They were in a car accident.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But everybody is all right.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: They're all fine. Just bruises and
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: Now you listen to me, asshole, I
dialog: know your gun is behind the bar ...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Un-fucking-believable. I called
dialog: those highway patrol dumb fucks.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Ssh! I can't hear Gino!
speaker_heading: VIOLET (V.O.)
dialog: We make a deal or I come out and
dialog: hand this phone to Mickey.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'm listening.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet has her robe over her dress, wrapping her hair in a
text: towel, making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I want what's mine, half the money.
dialog: We get rid of Mickey, no one else
dialog: dies. No one. Say yes, I understand.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, I understand.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the
text: Kennedy, in the waiting room, but
dialog: stay on the phone until I come out.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Sure, Gino, sure.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Violet come out of
text: the bathroom.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: St. Mary's off the Kennedy, sure.
dialog: Okay, Gino.
text: Mickey sees Violet.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Mickey? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They
text: were in a car accident.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I think everything is okay.
text: Caesar hangs up.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: They're at St. Mary's in the waiting
dialog: room.
text: Mick is already on the way.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I can't fit them all in my car so
dialog: give me your keys. You drive my
dialog: car, Lou.
text: Caesar sees Violet walking toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Sure, Mickey, sure. Violet!
text: She stops, looking straight at the freezer.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Go grab my car keys from my pants in
text: the bathroom.
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Please, help us out, Mickey wants to
dialog: get going.
text: She turns to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: They might want to go straight to
dialog: the airport and back to Miami, so I
dialog: better take this.
text: He grabs the briefcase.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You got the key?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh yeah. Violet!
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
text: Where Corky remains bound, still unconscious. We hear the
text: name echo in her head.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Violet!
text: Suddenly, her eyes blink open.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (V.O.)
dialog: Violet!
text: Her eyes blink again as she tries to focus.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Violet hands Mickey the keys for the car and the case.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Thanks, V.
text: He kisses her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Call me as soon as you get him.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Leave your phone on the hook.
text: Mickey and Lou leave. Violet is staring at Caesar, standing
text: near the door.
text: In his right hand he is holding the other towel. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Now that's teamwork.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I should have let him kill you.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You know he would have done you,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I knew I couldn't trust you.
text: He drops the towel, raising the gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I said I'd let you live and I will.
text: He smiles again.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
text: Corky is wide awake, thrashing-mad, biting her gag, struggling
dialog: to get free.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Caesar pulls his pants on.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Time to find out if the dyke was
dialog: stupid enough to lie.
text: Caesar drags Violet througb the front door.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The closet doors burst open as Corky fights her way out.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Caesar sees the buckets of paint.
text: He rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over. Paint
text: spills out across the floor.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Suddenly Corky stops; something has caught her eye. We drop
text: down, focusing on what she is staring at --
text: The clippers.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: He kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with
text: the rushing flow of paint.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yes!
text: He turns to Violet, who is already running out the door.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No!
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Violet turns down the hall, bare feet beating against the
dialog: floor.
text: Caesar slices out of the room behind her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Violet!
text: He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency
text: door.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Fuck!
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as
text: he charges after her.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Goddammit, Violet! Stop! Now!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the
text: clippers.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to
text: the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators.
text: She pounds the button and waits.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Come on. Come on, please.
text: She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens.
text: Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the
text: exit. When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of
dialog: the elevator --
text: And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Oh, you bitch. You fucking bitch.
text: Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket
text: and dials a number.
text: Mickey answers on the car phone.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Mickey! Oh God, Mickey!
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Violet?
text: Whispering, she acts terrified.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He made me help him, Mickey, God, I
dialog: was so afraid. It was Caesar, all
dialog: Caesar. You have to help me. He's
dialog: coming - Oh God!
text: She hangs up, eyes blazing.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: The elevator opens, Violet bolts out. She runs down the
text: hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Corky?
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut
text: rope.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Corky!
text: She looks at the wall separating the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT
text: Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door.
text: Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but --
text: The money is gone.
text: Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the
text: drip trail of the plastic bag.
text: The tracks lead to the bathroom.
text: Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of
text: money next to Corky's empty boots.
text: Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive
text: pipe wrench.
text: At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground
dialog: as --
text: The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch.
text: Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down
text: on his arm.
text: He screams as the gun hits the floor.
text: She kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the
text: paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white
text: swirls and spirals on the wood floor.
text: They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing
dialog: arm until --
text: He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up.
text: Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun
dialog: when --
text: Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Stop!
text: Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun
text: still out of reach.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It's over, Caesar. I called Mickey.
text: He's on his way.
text: Violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on
text: him as he rises from the floor.
text: Panting, Caesar watches her like a mad dog.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Get out of here, Caesar. If you
dialog: want to live you had better start
dialog: running.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: All these years and you still don't
dialog: know me, Violet.
text: She glances down and sees the paint-covered gun.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: But I know you.
text: He turns to the gun.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, don't.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What are you going to do, V? Shoot
dialog: me? Kill me in cold blood? I don't
dialog: think so. I'll tell you why. If
dialog: you had it in you to pull that
dialog: trigger, you would have done it a
dialog: long time ago. If I was you, I would
dialog: have killed me the minute I brought
dialog: the money home. But you didn't and
dialog: I know why, because you don't want
dialog: to kill me. Do you, V? Do you?
dialog: No, I know you don't.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Caesar, you don't know shit.
dialog: Violet fires --
text: The bullet hits Caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off
text: balance. Another doubles him over as blood speckles the
text: pool of paint.
text: She empties the gun into him. His body arcs back, falling,
text: splashing into the paint.
text: Caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening
dialog: white.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: It is empty and clean. In the bedroom, only a few hangers
text: are left dangling in the open closet.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Mickey is standing with Violet, next to his Lincoln Town
dialog: Car.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I will never understand it, Mickey.
dialog: You didn't even call the police.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I told you, the family doesn't want
dialog: the police around. We want to take
dialog: care of it ourselves and we will.
dialog: I'll find him. I swear I will.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I know you will.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Sure you're going to be okay? I
dialog: mean, if you're having second
dialog: thoughts, my offer still stands.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get
dialog: out, you know? Get away from all of
dialog: this.
text: Mickey nods.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But thanks. Thanks for everything.
text: She hugs him and he kisses her. Then he gets in his car.
text: Violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free.
scene_heading: EXT. CORKY'S APARTMENT
text: Corky sitting on stoop, patient, like a rock.
text: She looks up as she hears high heels, and smiles at --
text: Violet standing there, new outfit.
text: Corky stands in front of her.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm here, aren't I?
text: Corky nods.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: I guess we should get out of here.
text: Violet nods.
text: Corky digs out alarm keys, aims, fires. Violet turns, looks.
dialog: New truck.
text: Violet turns to Corky, eyebrow cocked.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: Thought we might need a getaway car.
text: Smiles, they get in.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK
text: Corky admires truck.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: You know what the difference is
dialog: between us, Violet?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CORKY
dialog: ... Me neither.
text: Lean for kiss, as dolly in.
dialog: Guns engine.
