text: Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing --
text: CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS
text: A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with

scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR

speaker_heading: CALLISTER

scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

text: WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.
speaker_heading: TECHIE
text: Sire they're pulling off the highway.
speaker_heading: TECHIE #2
dialog: We have abort recommendation.
scene_heading: The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The

speaker_heading: COLONEL THOMPSON
dialog: If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding

text: THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he

text: MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP:

speaker_heading: TECHIE
text: 51%. 'Abort' rec holds.
text: THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin

text: THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:
speaker_heading: CALLISTER
dialog: What is that, a weapons cache?
speaker_heading: ANALYST
dialog: Sir, the placement of stones around the
dialog: pit, markers for the Five Pillars of

dialog: Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated.
text: THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted,

scene_heading: PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL
dialog: "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open
dialog: to international prosecution. But we
dialog: have no independent intel verifying it's

speaker_heading: TECHIE #2
dialog: I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.
speaker_heading: CALLISTER
text: (a beat, looks around).
dialog: Everyone agree this is the best course of
dialog: action?
text: No one dissents. Callister picks up:
speaker_heading: CALLISTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
dialog: match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some
dialog: possibility he's at a funeral, but we
dialog: don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks
dialog: we can claim 'Overriding Legal
dialog: Authority.' Also, you should be aware we
dialog: have an abort recommendation, but your
dialog: cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs
dialog: urge a 'go.'
speaker_heading: THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
dialog: You left yourself out of the lineup.
text: Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS
text: BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."
speaker_heading: CALLISTER
dialog: Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two
dialog: standards: the highest probability of
dialog: success with the least amount of
dialog: collateral damage. At 51% probability,
dialog: we don't have either one.
speaker_heading: GENERAL THOMPSON
dialog: And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir,
dialog: we're putting our people at risk.
text: There's a long silence as the President considers.

speaker_heading: THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)

speaker_heading: CALLISTER
dialog: Understood.

text: The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before

speaker_heading: WHITEWASH:
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds --
text: then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen:

speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: You gotta make a choice. You gotta move--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: -- I know.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Now. Who are you gonna be?
text: So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING
text: CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from
text: KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE
text: game, CASH on the table.
speaker_heading: JERRY KWAME

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hey, Becky? When're you going to start
dialog: wearing makeup?
text: Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:
speaker_heading: BECKY
text: .The collator's broken.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Dude: no its not.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: (putting on a jacket)
dialog: Oh yeah it is, dude!
text: She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own
text: smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Your first mistake? Underestimating

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: ( 2)
speaker_heading: KWAME
dialog: I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember?
dialog: I'm going to Cornell.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your
dialog: last night. You're gonna spend it
text: collating.
speaker_heading: KWAME

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: And that's why we have those rubber

dialog: on Cornell, though, that's huge!
text: TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his
scene_heading: NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES.
text: He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up:
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you?
text: The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets
text: louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:
scene_heading: INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING
text: The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at
text: their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS
text: and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the
text: train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere."
text: And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good
text: pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's
text: got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage
text: of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims:
speaker_heading: SHEPARD SMITH
text: a heightened terror alert due to a
dialog: series of suicide bombings, believed to
dialog: be in retaliation for a deadly attack

text: glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world...
scene_heading: EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING
text: An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM
text: CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his

text: his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING

scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JERRY

scene_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
dialog: Yes. Is good -- rent is better.
text: She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.
speaker_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: You are hungry, I am guessing.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, no, no. I couldn't --
dialog: (looking down at bowl)
dialog: Unless, you know, you insist.
text: He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.
scene_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
dialog: So where is girl? I don't see her?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's
dialog: over. She got smart.
scene_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI

dialog: Your -- I'm like your dog?
scene_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
dialog: Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But
dialog: he believe... he is terrier. So is
dialog: Labrador... but no labrador.
text: Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: why do you think that is?

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight-

scene_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI

speaker_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are
dialog: Labrador. Then ask if she give you money
dialog: for rent.
text: But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the

dialog: its my mother.
scene_heading: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
dialog: Is problem?

dialog: (even, quieter, gets up)
dialog: is problem.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hey, mom...
text: Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is
text: happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the
text: floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain --
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - DAY
text: MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands.
text: Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi.
text: Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do
text: is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally,
text: from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of

text: passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry
text: BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN
text: pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses --
text: Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: -- no! I-- I'm not him!
text: All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay! I'm not Paul!
text: Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew.
text: Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a
text: lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN.
text: Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body:
text: And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that
text: seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident.
text: Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's
text: identical twin. Off the surreal moment...
text: A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You sound just like him.

text: Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them --
text: Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards
text: the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees

speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: I bet.
text: Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he
text: closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops

speaker_heading: LATESHA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CALLISTER

text: And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling
text: like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:
speaker_heading: LATESHA
dialog: Secretary Callister.
text: Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by
text: the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the
text: GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:
speaker_heading: LATESHA (CONT'D)
dialog: My Department's tracking a home-grown
dialog: terrorist on the loose as we speak who
dialog: may be connected to a cell with ties
dialog: inside this building. Now seeing as you

dialog: with the terror threat rising every three
