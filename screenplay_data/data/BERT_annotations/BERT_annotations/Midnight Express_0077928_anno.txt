speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A SET OF CLOTHES ON A HOTEL ROOM BED -- trenchcoat, bulky

text: UNDERARM, TIGHT. Tape being laid over it.
text: BACK OF SHOULDER. TIGHT. Tape going on.
text: BELLYBUTTON, TIGHT. TAPE going Then: a harsh RIP! SOUND
text: and the tape comes off the bellybutton.
text: HANDS with new strip of tape. Moving to:
text: HASHISH PLAQUE. Four of them, thinly pressed. One on top
text: of the other. The HAND wrapping a portion of the TAPE around
dialog: them and:
text: BELLY, TIGHT. SOUNDS of BREATHING stop. The belly is sucked
text: in. The TAPE is pulled HARD across, then CLINCHED. We
text: hear F.X. of HEART BEAT--
text: MOVE UP THE CHEST TO:
text: BILLY HAYES - 21, baby-face, attractive, medium build an
text: aura of innocence. His eyes moving off his belly to:
text: MIRROR. FULL SHOT. Climax. A creature in a bondage of
text: his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body
text: criss-crossed by a network of TAPE and 40 tightly pressed
text: plaques of HASHISH in every conceivable crevice of his
text: body. The eyes are hard.

speaker_heading: CUT:
speaker_heading: INTERIOR
text: ISTANBUL AIR TERMINAL dirty, crowded, wooden benches,
text: peddlers. Turkish flight instructions on LOUDSPEAKER,
text: followed by mediocre English translations. NOTE: ALL
text: DIALOGUE IN TURKISH TO FOLLOW WILL BE MARKED OFF BY
text: PARENTHESIS. A CERTAIN WILL BE SUBTITLED, BUT SOME NOT.
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
dialog: Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt,
dialog: London, and New York has arrived
dialog: and will be ready for boarding at
text: Gate 7 in 20 minutes.
text: REPEAT IN ENGLISH over:
text: BILL walking down a long CORRIDOR. He moves somewhat stuffly
text: in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face
text: complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses
text: and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. With
dialog: him is:
text: SUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful
text: like an American student abroad.
scene_heading: APPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS,
text: in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspect
text: the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS.
text: BILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks.
text: SUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks.
text: BILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN. He suddenly
text: breaks stride, still a fair distance from the
text: checkpoint. SUSAN glances at him. He is holding his belly.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I think I've been poisoned.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And you ate two baclavas, right? I
dialog: not to touch them, mine was awful.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (his voice strained)
dialog: Look, I think I'm going to have to
dialog: go to the john again. You go on
dialog: through, I'll catch up.
text: With a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the
text: corridor without waiting for a response. SUSAN concerned,
text: moves on.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY in the WASHROOM MIRROR, again checks himself out.
text: His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down.
text: But the SOUND of his HEARTBEAT is up, and his nerves are
text: visible in his eyeballs and he knows it. He dabs at the
text: sweat on his sideburns. He closes his eyes, takes a DEEP
text: BREATH. A pause. He puts his dark sunglasses back on.
text: Turns away from the mirror. No going back now.
scene_heading: ADVANCING P.O.V. - SECURITY CHECKPOINT. The GUARDS again.
text: Closer, closer, Guns in their HOLSTERS. SOUND of billy's
dialog: heartbeat,
text: CLOSE - GUARD smoking a cigarette, bored, uniform, looks
speaker_heading: at BILLY.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: The GUARDS again.SOUND of Billy's in a tattered olive
speaker_heading: GUARD

dialog: it open it. Basic information on Billy: Birth Date April
dialog: 17, 1949. Birth Place: Babylon, Long Island. No wife, no
dialog: minors. Signature.
text: GUARD gives it back to BILLY.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Bag!
text: BILLY opens his shoulder bag, proffers it. The GUARD tosses
text: it, pushing aside books, grabbing a white plastic dish.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Nebu?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (Understand the
dialog: Turkish expression,
dialog: "What's this?")
dialog: It's a frisbee.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Nebu?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: A Frisbee.
dialog: (makes a throwing
dialog: gesture of the
dialog: wrist)
dialog: You throw, catch it. Game!
text: Curious, one of the other GUARDS ambles over looking at
dialog: the frisbee.
text: BILLY tightens. Cursing the frisbee. Sweat now runs his
text: sideburns again. HEARTBEAT up.
speaker_heading: 2ND GUARD
dialog: American game. Baseball.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Ah!
dialog: (puzzled, turns the
dialog: Frisbee around and
dialog: around)
text: THE SECOND GUARD studies BILLY curious about the sweat.
text: Suddenly reaches up, indicates the eyes.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Take off the glasses.
text: BILLY understanding the gesture rather than the words,
text: removes his glasses. His eyes. Straight, staring at the
text: GUARD without trying to look away. A long moment.
text: FIRST GUARD stuffs the frisbee back into the bag. Scowls.
text: Takes a puff on his cigarette, coughs. Phlegm rattles around
text: in his throat.
text: Reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on a crowded
text: olive-colored out on the tarmac She has saved him a seat
text: and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Aaaah!
text: He waves BILLY through.
text: BILLY puts his glasses walks past the back the SECOND GUARD
text: turns away. BILLY walks past the Checkpoint. His HEARTBEAT
dialog: drops.
text: SUSAN reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on an
text: crowded olive-colored BUS out on the tarmac. She has save
text: him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Are you all right?
text: He looks at her. Relief. A smile, awkward - he wishes he
dialog: could tell her.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah... Yeah.
text: Lays his head back on the wooden bench. Reaches out:
text: TAKES HER HAND in his. She returns the grip.
text: THE BUS DOOR slams shut.
text: THE TURKISH BUS DRIVER rolls the bus out towards the PLANES
text: visible in the far distance?.
text: SUSAN, feeling Billy is better, shows him the Herald
dialog: Tribune.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (saddened)
dialog: D'you see this? Janis Joplin died
dialog: yesterday.
text: BILLY, his sunglasses removed, looks at the paper, almost
text: abstractedly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (OFF)
text: Overdose, in a Hollywood motel.
text: NEWSPAPER Picture of JANIS JOPLIN. That big, earthy, rugged
dialog: smile.
scene_heading: BILLY'S P.O.V. - Moves Up page One To The Headline: NIXON

dialog: Never Was anybody like Janis.
text: BILLY, thinking other happier things, reaches over and
text: playful!.:squeezes her tit twice, rapidly.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Never was anybody like you...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (annoyed, brushes
text: his hand away ,a
text: clicking sound in
dialog: her throat)
dialog: You can't take anything seriously.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You're right.
text: Bus stops suddenly. BILLY changes expression.
text: THROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD we see TURKISH SOLDIERS in several
text: HALFTRACKS drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus. The
text: Pan American PLANE is directly behind. Also JEEPS and a
text: POLICEMAN waving the bus down.
text: BUS BOOR opens and the Turkish Police OFFICER hops aboard
text: briskly:
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Attention please, Ladies and
dialog: Gentlemen. For your own safety
dialog: we're conducting a security check
dialog: before you board your airplane,
text: Kindly file out the back. Women
text: and children in one line. Men in
dialog: another.
text: PASSENGERS. A confused hum.
speaker_heading: VARIOUS PASSENGERS
dialog: What's he saying? I don't know...
dialog: Marian. Hey Marian, what the
dialog: hell...
text: The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together
dialog: their items and beginning to exit as:
scene_heading: POLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Idem.
text: CLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the
text: speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's
text: panic. Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all
dialog: over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now?
text: He freezes.
text: MOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Jesus, they do everything ass
dialog: backwards in Turkey.
text: Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning
text: to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped
dialog: conversations, expletives, including:
speaker_heading: PASSENGERS
dialog: They're checking for hijackers.
dialog: Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry,
dialog: get rid of your grenades...
text: Laughter is returned from several of the American
text: contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all
text: of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (OFF)
dialog: Billy, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: My passport!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No!
text: She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He
text: grips her arm.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (low voice)
dialog: Susan - forget it. Go get us a
text: seat on the plane. Now.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (picking up the
dialog: real fear in his
dialog: voice)
dialog: What is it? . . . Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (a fierce whisper,
dialog: panic)
dialog: For Christ's sake, just GET on the
dialog: plane, okay!
text: His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like
text: that. A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now.
text: She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something
dialog: is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do
text: exactly as he says. And fast. She moves OUT OF SHOT.
text: BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his
text: finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work
text: the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under
text: the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers
dialog: are exiting. BUT THEN:
scene_heading: BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle
text: Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely
text: Against the side of the kneecap.
text: PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes
text: into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually
dialog: coming to rest on:
text: BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his
text: sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his
text: hand. "Just found it" expression.
text: MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything,
text: but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant-
text: types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand
text: and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed
text: under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the
text: rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus
text: with the others. All in silence.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two
text: lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table.
text: Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is
text: open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent
text: hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of
text: the passengers impatiently waiting.
text: TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table,
text: body-searching the male passengers alternately.
text: SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE
text: ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as
text: she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards
text: the ramp of the plane.
text: BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male
text: PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag. Glides
text: to the head of the line. MOVE TO:
text: The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back
text: partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into
dialog: foreground as:
text: BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two
text: other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER
text: who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is
text: busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces
text: the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already
dialog: been searched by the first officer,
text: Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp.
text: BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting.
text: Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven.
text: BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp.
text: TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping
dialog: the ARM.
speaker_heading: TURK (OFF)
dialog: Just a minute!
text: BILLY his eyes flattening.
text: SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting.
text: BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND
text: OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the:
text: FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them.
speaker_heading: SECOND
dialog: Nebu? Did you search him?
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: No!
text: SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls
text: him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has
text: been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about
dialog: eighteen.
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
text: (grunts a command, makes a gesture)
text: BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms. The OFFICER pats
text: him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely
dialog: in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he
text: doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips
text: and legs.
text: CLOSE BILLY eyes on the sky behind the OFFICER, praying
text: silently for a break.
text: TURKISH FINGERS moving up the inside of his legs, onto his
text: belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel. But again
text: not noticing.
text: BILLY in limbo, SOUND of his heartbeat.
text: SECOND OFFICER pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest,
text: about to let it go, then:
text: PLACES HIS HAND suddenly flat on Billy's heart.
text: OFFICER, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at:
text: BILLY whose eyes jump, startled by this technique.
text: FINGERS like excited spiders quickly run back up into the
text: armpit area. STOP - right on the packets.
text: TURKISH EYES SWIVEL to BILLY EYES CLOSE. Frozen moment.
text: Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame.
text: SECOND OFFICER jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his
text: holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at
text: BILLY, hand shaking. He is terrified.
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Bomb! He's got a bomb!
text: AMERICAN PASSENGERS scream and the deck all around.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN PASSENGER
dialog: Bomb! Bomb!
text: BILLY stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes
text: clamped shut, trying not to breathe. CHORUS of rifle and
dialog: revolver CLICKS OFF as:
text: PULL BACK to OVERHEAD SHOT BILLY surrounded by thirty
text: SOLDIERS with rifles pointed at him from all directions,
text: crouched nervously. The PASSENGERS all huddled on the
dialog: ground.
text: BILLY, eyes closed. Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a
text: REVOLVER poked into his belly, moving up.
text: MOVE to THE FIRST OFFICER, older, more experienced but
text: scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand
text: cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater. MOVE
text: with the hand, revealing the HASHISH PLAQUES around the
text: navel. A pause. His HAND draws the sweater higher. More
speaker_heading: PLAQUES.
text: FIRST OFFICER'S FACE relaxes. Starts to smile, finding it
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: (yells out)
dialog: It's hashish. just a smuggler.
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS (OFF)
dialog: (in chorus echo,
dialog: relaxing, chuckling)
dialog: Hashish...smuggler...hippy...
text: MASTER ANGLE SOLDIERS REGROUPING. PASSENGERS starting to
text: rise from the ground.
text: SUSAN dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the
text: PLANE, starts back down the ramp. But a flow of upcoming
text: PASSENGERS slows her descent.
text: BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plane
text: his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A
text: slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don't
dialog: come down the stairs'
text: SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost
text: between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...Billy...?
text: She is washed back along in the flow of passengers.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE. The scene moves very fast,
text: Indicating A sense of chaos. Much smoke. Many phone calls.
text: Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely seated
text: In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk. Chattering among
text: themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes.
dialog: They hardly pay attention as:
text: MOVE TO BILLY, scared, sweating - backlit by the huge
text: windows overlooking the airstrip. In background, we see
text: the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards the
text: runway. GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare chest
text: and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at
text: once. Then RIP the tape off. BILLY winces.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE the room. Billy's luggage Is being Tossed.
text: Clothes fly through the air. A sweatshirt; Marquette
text: University Rowing Team. A 35mm camera. A gift package for
text: his mother ripped open. A silver Turkish kettle, clanging
text: To The floor. Another package is ripped open and a set of
text: Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. Very
dialog: fast.
text: BILLY watches, bewildered. He is stripped of the last plaque
text: in of the confusion is that each time another police officer
text: his navel. FOLLOW the plaque clattering onto the pile of
text: forty plaques.
speaker_heading: FIRSTOFFICER (OFF)
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: BILLY (OFF)
dialog: William Hayes.
text: MOVE BACK QUICKLY to the OFFICER with notebook at the desk.
dialog: Part of the confusion is that each time we see another
text: police officer we see he has another face.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Vi... Vilyum... Vilyum...
speaker_heading: BILLY (OFF)
dialog: Hayes.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Hi-yes...
dialog: (writes it down)
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE --
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: 'Merican?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: New York.
text: The OFFICER is puzzled.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: New York... New York...
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Ahhhh...Nev Yok!
dialog: (writes it down)
text: A LOUD SOUND OFF.
text: The DOOR flies open and ANOTHER OFFICER strides in.
text: Paunchy, moustached. The room is suddenly silent as we
text: TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with
text: a big portable photo instrument and bulb.
text: THE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an
text: obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly
text: acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the
text: desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair
text: in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further
text: down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It
text: goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the
text: last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this
text: is all in the background as:
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: William Hayes.
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
dialog: Vil... Vilyum...?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hayes...
text: Sharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts
dialog: a look at
text: POLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out. Another
text: loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this--
text: THE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in,
text: obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER
text: jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately
dialog: move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's
text: hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy,
text: waves to the SECOND OFFICER. THE CAMERAMAN in background
text: bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is
text: puzzled - what's going on? His arm is grabbed and he is
text: swivelled around.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN
text: BILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER,
text: grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders.
text: The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques
text: into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from
text: side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back
text: of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at
text: him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking
text: this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera.
text: CAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece.
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN
dialog: No.. He's smiling. Make him look
dialog: miserable.
text: SECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick
text: back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The
text: plaques fall on the floor.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: (running up)
dialog: Gel? Gel??
text: He growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up,
text: gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his
text: arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's
text: shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of
dialog: misery.
text: FLASH! The bulb goes.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up
text: into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next
text: to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near
text: vomiting. He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic
text: now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers
text: something! Surprised.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB
text: among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders,
text: pointing to the hashish plaques, etc.
text: In center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting
dialog: his arm for permission to speak,
text: THIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS.
text: BILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his
text: boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter
text: to the floor.
text: TURKISH MOUTHS drop open.
text: BILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward
dialog: silence OFF.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (trying to explain,
dialog: innocent)
dialog: I forgot... I really did.
dialog: (makes ineffective
dialog: gestures)
text: ANOTHER ANGLE. The room explodes with screams and commotion.
speaker_heading: AD LIB:
speaker_heading: THIRD OFFICER
dialog: (screaming at SECOND
speaker_heading: OFFICER)
dialog: You idiot, you fool. You told me
dialog: the American was searched... and
text: he's pulling hashish out of his
dialog: boots! You're all dogshit!
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
dialog: (turning on First
dialog: Officer, screaming)
dialog: You worthless piece of garbage,
dialog: where did you learn to search a
dialog: prisoner? He's been in our custody
dialog: for an hour, etc.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: (screaming at the
dialog: others)
dialog: Who searched him? Who?
text: Amid all the screaming TWO POLICEMEN rush over and yank
text: BILLY upwards, and start to strip all his clothes.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: That's it! That's all I have!
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY spread-eagled STARK NAKED against the wall. He is
text: afraid to move. A strange silence.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE. BILLY naked in center B.G. against the
text: wall.The OFFICERS and SOLDIERS quietly leering at his trim,
text: muscular buttocks. Hungry stares. Bisexuality is prevalent
dialog: in Turkey.But there is also embarrassment among the
dialog: officers; none would do anything openly in front of the
text: others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes.
text: Low murmurs. Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke
text: all over the room.
text: Another DOOR opens OFF. Obsequious GREETINGS in Turkish.
text: BILLY is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling
text: enormously humiliated.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok?
text: A perfect Texas drawl. BILLY glances over his shoulder.
dialog: Sees:
text: TEX a tall, lanky blonde-haired American in a business
text: suit with boots. Clean cut, very handsome, with a strong
text: flavour of danger in his blue eyes.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (smiling, extends
dialog: Billy's clothes)
dialog: I think these gentlemen have
dialog: finished for the time being if
dialog: you'd like to put your clothes on.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, so grateful at last to see a fellow
text: American, reaches quietly for the clothes, his eyes never
dialog: leaving Tex. Release?
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: TURKISH DETECTIVE sits at the main desk in the room. Unlike
text: the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face,
text: intelligent looking. TEX Is behind, leaning casually up
text: against the wall. Angled to Billy's side is the entire
text: array of seated OFFICERS looking on like a tribunal.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: (thickly accented
dialog: English, sympathetic)
dialog: Are you afraid, Vilyum?
text: BILLY, standing to the side of the desk, clothed now,
text: buckling his belt - afraid.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No, I'm not afraid.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Good. There's nothing to be afraid
dialog: of. If you co-operate with us, you
dialog: will be on the plane for New York
dialog: tomorrow... yes?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (softly, hoping)
dialog: Yes...?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Good. Now, where did you get the
dialog: hashish?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: A cabdriver. He picked me up in
text: the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Would you recognize him again?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yes. I think so.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Good. Would you go back to the
text: Pudding Shoppe now and point him
dialog: out to my men if you see him?
scene_heading: BILLY'S EYES MOVE TO:
text: TEX who makes a cool affirmative nod of the eyes to Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY (OFF)
dialog: Yes.
text: STREETS, ISTANBUL, AFTERNOON. TEX drives his American CAR;
text: BILLY in the passenger seat; TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN

dialog: 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey
dialog: you got...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: But didn't have heroin.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Well I'm not up on all that. A
dialog: drug's a drug seems to me Billy
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (sweating)
dialog: But it was my first time. I'm not
dialog: really a smuggler, was just two
dialog: kilos.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Well, you see Billy, it don't really
dialog: matter right now if it's 2 kilos
dialog: or 200 kilos. The Turks love to
dialog: catch any foreigner smuggling - it
dialog: shows the world they're fighting
dialog: the drug trade.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: But just...
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Just what?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I just needed some extra money. I
dialog: was broke, the guy offered me the
dialog: hash and...
text: It sounds bad. Tex looks at him without expression.
text: Pause.Billy tries to sense a sympathy in this ambiguous
text: man, a liking towards himself. But feels nothing yet, except
dialog: someone who can speak English.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...are you with the Consulate?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (not looking at him)
dialog: Something like that. Cigarette?
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY nervously takes the pack and matches.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: How much you pay this joker...
dialog: this cab driver?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Two hundred dollars. It was my
dialog: last two hundred.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: How much did you figure to make?
text: BILLY fumbles to light up his cigarette. He is nervous,
dialog: grateful to volunteer any information...anything.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Three, four thousand...I don't
dialog: know. The guy offered me the hash--
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: ...it just seemed like easy money.
speaker_heading: TEX
text: Beats working.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I was just going to sell it to
dialog: friends. I'm not a pusher, honest.
text: TEX grins, sceptical of his naivete, changing the subject.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Got a family back there?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (inhales deeply)
dialog: Yeah. Parents, brother, sister.
dialog: Babylon, Long Island.
speaker_heading: TEX

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He sells insurance for Metropolitan

speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (a pause, not looking

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Girlfriend?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: ...She was on the plane.
text: Tex glances at him, questioningly.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: She didn't know anything about...I
dialog: wouldn't have wanted her to.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Lucky girl.
text: Billy leans back in seat, blowing out the cigarette smoke.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Jeez, she used to say I was the

speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure
dialog: hope so.

speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE PUDDING SHOPPE TWILIGHT Internationally-known cafe,

text: BOY leads a huge MUZZLED BEAR on a leash.
text: BILLY sits at a small outdoor TABLE alone sipping tea and
text: eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to
text: sort it all out in his head. If he doesn't find the seller,
dialog: what will happen next?
text: MOVE across the TABLES, past a middle-aged AMERICAN COUPLE,
text: to TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN watching him closely. They
text: look evident. TWO HIPPIES make a wide berth around them.
speaker_heading: HIPPIES (OFF)
dialog: (in passing, low)
dialog: Hey Janet, why don't you go sell
dialog: 'em some dope.
text: MOVE ON to another TABLE where TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN

text: TEX sits in his car, in the distance, casually glancing at

text: BILLY's eyes rove.
text: INTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A back
dialog: exit.
text: ANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a
text: wooden sign around its neck proclaiming "Pig" in Turkish.
text: Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some
text: disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: "Go way, go
text: way! "Ayip!" The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his
dialog: gaze to:
scene_heading: POV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVER
text: #2 PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2
text: indicating no real fix on identity.
text: BILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take,
text: nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off.
text: THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2.
text: BILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves
text: slyly towards the interior of the cafe.
text: PLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER
text: #2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB).
text: BILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE,
text: past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the
text: shop, at a normal.to attract attention.
text: A PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells the
text: others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the
text: CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB).
text: BILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK
text: DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause.
text: A HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barrel
text: right at his temple. BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes
dialog: to:
text: TEX looking down at him calm, merciless.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: You seem like a nice enough kid to
dialog: me Billy, but try it and I'll blow
dialog: your fucking brains out.
text: BILLY - the sense of betrayal in his eyes.
scene_heading: ESTABLISH PRISON - OVERHEAD ANGLE. A large and Byzantine

text: a decorative an equally in a city, labyrinth built by some
dialog: mad Arab architect to suit purpose and now, in the 20th
text: Century, transformed by mad Turkish bureaucracy into a
dialog: prison. It should be preferably made to look like Istanbul.

speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: Dear Mom and Dad. This is the
dialog: hardest letter I've ever had to
dialog: write. know the confusion and the
dialog: pain it will cause you. And the
dialog: disappointment...
text: BILLY - his scalp being shaved off by a prison BARBER in
text: an un-specified ANTI-CHAMBER, His eyes are staring dead
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: I really thought knew what I was
dialog: doing with my life. I'd hoped
dialog: somehow to get out of this quickly
dialog: so that you'd never know about it.
dialog: But that just isn't possible now.
dialog: I don't know what's going to happen.
dialog: But what can I say to you? Will
dialog: 'I'm sorry' make a difference?
dialog: Will it ease the pain, the shame
dialog: you must be feeling? Forgive
dialog: me...Please...
text: BILLY is now completely BALD, SOUND SHARP OVER:
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: A CELL DOOR SLIDING OPEN. BILLY steps in, bewildered.
speaker_heading: ZIAT VOICE (OFF)
dialog: Git!
text: The cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a
text: small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy
text: mattress. BILLY turns, looking back at the man staring at
text: him from the door.
text: ZIAT is quickly summing up Billy's character. This is his
text: craft.He is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one
dialog: motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the
text: pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR
text: running the width of his throat, various other facial SCARS;
text: and one blind milky white EYE. He's stocky and strong --
text: about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth,
text: big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. What's
dialog: surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old
text: looks and behaves like sixty. The personification of the
text: denaturalization of a man. Time, body, mind - all of them
text: warped.
text: BILLY, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is
text: still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture,
text: enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket?
dialog: Blanket?
text: (makes a gesture of
text: a blanket wrapped
dialog: around him)
text: ZIAT smiles, showing his stained teeth, and starts to slide
text: shut the cell door on its ROLLER.
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Mo sell...Too late. Tomorrow...
text: A cobra smile flashes, as the cell door bangs shut.
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (through the bars)
dialog: You be here tomorrow. "Ayi
dialog: Gedjaler"("good night")
dialog: Goes.
text: BILLY walks around the cell, hugging himself for warmth.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: Pssst!
text: BILLY stops, goes to the edge of the cell.
text: A BONY BARE ARM motions from the bars of the cell next to
text: his. We never see the face but hear a thick ITALIAN ACCENT,
text: hoarse and cracked.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Your cell, no key. Open...!
dialog: Blanket. Three cell down. You get
dialog: me one. Take...
text: Extends a stick with a big nail pounded into the end,
text: twisted over to form a hook.
text: BILLY takes it. Hesitates.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: Ziat go for night. Go!
text: BILLY cautiously slides the cell door open, amazed that
text: it's been left open. Nothing makes any sense to him in
dialog: this labyrinth
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY steps out into a WALKWAY. A bare
text: bulb overhead casts light. He glides past the three cells,
text: seemingly empty. Finds the cell with blankets, sheets,
text: towels and various supplies stacked inside. But it's
text: locked. He slips the stick in between the bars and
text: stretching, hooks the first blanket.
text: BILLY asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin.
text: Suddenly DIRTY HANDS reach into frame and rip the blanket
scene_heading: off. WIDEN TO:
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (tugging the sheet,
dialog: growls)
dialog: Brack!...Brack!
text: Then SLAPS at BILLY. BILLY ducks away. Encouraged, ZIAT
text: steps up closer to him, sticks his fingers in his chest
text: screaming.
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: You, goddamn you, give me sheet.
dialog: Give me!
text: And feints as if to hit BILLY again. BILLY reacts to defend
text: himself, pushing ZIAT off and jumping out of the bunk.
text: ZIAT, Enraged by the shove, comes back at BILLY, screaming,
text: arms flailing like a bear to pummel him, but BILLY, not
text: understanding the Turkish bluster in his mannerisms, meets
text: him with a sharp right FIST into the front of his face.
text: ZIAT staggers back, startled into silence; he has misjudged
dialog: this kid.
text: BILLY waits, ready for the fight in the defensive position.
text: The guy is bigger than himself. ZIAT, however, now feels
text: the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out, running
text: out of the cell SCREAMING at the top of his lungs as if
text: he's dying.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY is blindfolded, stumbling down stone steps pushed by
text: a GUARD, into a dungeon-like basement room. THE PUNISHMENT
speaker_heading: CELLS.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE GUARD removes the blindfold. BILLY, adjusting to the
text: light, stares around. The cell is spartan, with a series
text: of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the
text: cobwebbed ceiling.A DOOR opens and:
text: HAMIDOU STEPS in, lowering his head to get through the
text: door.Chief of the guards. A clean uniform. Four stripes.
text: The only guard to carry a holstered gun. very frightening
text: man. He is about six two, two forty, and muscular, and
text: moves lightly like a fighter on his feet. His skull is
text: bullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billy's, Enhancing
text: this effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes
dialog: (suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his ancestry)
text: are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving
text: nothing away. His nose is a beak of skin his neck broad,
text: his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his
text: feet between anger and amusement. He approaches BILLY,
text: looks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself,
text: enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others.
text: BILLY meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is
text: perhaps not the thing do to, looks away. But, fascinated
text: by the man's features beyond his self-control, he looks
dialog: back.
text: HAMIDOU, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly. The sort of
dialog: smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (to one of the guards)
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (checking a clipboard)
dialog: Vilyum Hi-yes
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
text: (looking at BILLY,
dialog: repeating it)
dialog: Vilyum Hi-yes...
text: And slowly his hand moves up to caress the edge of his
text: hairless upper lip. An erotic gesture in Turkey.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Vilyum Hi-yes
text: "Its in my memory locked." He slowly extends his right
text: arm stiff out to his side.
text: BILLY watches, fascinated.
text: HAMIDOU lets the arm linger; then:
text: SMASHES BILLY across the face with an open palm. BILLY
text: shoots back: and smashes against the wall just from the
text: force of one blow. Stunned.
text: HAMIDOU advances, taking a wooden CLUB (FALUKA STICK) about
text: feet three long and three inches wide from a GUARD.
text: BILLY scared, emphasizing the words, trying to make himself
dialog: understood.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It was cold. Cold! I get blanket.
dialog: Blanket! Cold!
speaker_heading: THWACK!
text: BILLY'S LEG BUCKLES, where the faluka stick has just smashed
text: him behind the kneecap. He SCREAMS going down.
text: BILLY looks up from the floor:
text: HAMIDOU with his club in hand.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (In some sort of
dialog: English, smiles)
dialog: No do. No do.
text: Raises the club.
text: BILLY tries to block it with his hand, and the CLUB smashes
text: his thumb. SCREAM.
speaker_heading: SHARP CUT:
text: BILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with
text: thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a
text: PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards,
text: then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders
text: banging against the stone floor.
text: THE PULLEY is LOCKED into place. (LOUD SOUND)
text: BILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through
dialog: the tears. What's happening?
dialog: 
text: Hamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB). Turns
text: back to BILLY, raises his club.
text: BRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET.
text: SCREAM. He cocks the club again.
dialog: BILLY twists To avoid The blow
text: CLUB catches him On The ANKLEBONE
text: BILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of
text: wood On bone. Whimpering SOUNDS follow.
text: BILLY looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going
text: to be killed. The CLUB - OFF - smacks sole skin with the
text: same force as the first blow. No let up.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself.
text: HAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing:
text: BILLY into a steeper, more vertical position. He is on
text: the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as:
text: HAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something
text: indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping
text: the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on
text: his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But,
text: for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO:
text: JAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk,
text: fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings
text: of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with
text: astrological symbols paint; on it. SOUND OFF, of a blaring
text: radio. Atonal TURKISH MUSIC.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (close, intense)
dialog: Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his
dialog: feet gonna swell up worse.
speaker_heading: 2ND VOICE
dialog: (softer, sonorous,
dialog: Swedish accent)
dialog: We take him down to courtyard...
text: Then: ERICH - a gentle long bird's face. Long whitish-blond-
text: hair, Swedish, well above six feet, 25.
text: Another FACE moves into view JIMMY BELL, American, 23 fiery
text: eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the
dialog: pain.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BELL puts a huge cone-shaped JOINT with
text: aluminium foil filter into BILLY'S LIPS. He hardly knows
text: what it is, Puffing weakly. Though dehydrated and his face
text: white without color, he has no facial markings.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: You gotta walk around some man, or
dialog: your feet gonna swell up something
dialog: bad...
text: BILLY looks down at
text: HIS FEET Bloated black and blue with inflamed red points
text: in various spots. A vicious bruise on his anklebone. ERICH
text: is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his
text: fingers tender.
speaker_heading: BELL (OVER)
dialog: You've been out for days man,
dialog: talking all kinds of shit. Come
dialog: on, we'll walk you down to the
dialog: courtyard.
text: BELL eases BILLY up from the bed, as ERICH puts a pair of
text: clip-clops on his feet.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: Okay?
text: BILLY nods. They rise together, bracing his shoulder.
text: BILLY adjusting to the sensation of standing.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: How's it feel?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (dizzy)
dialog: About as good as it looks.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Getchmis olsun
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Getchmis...?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm
dialog: Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich
dialog: something Swedish.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Just Erich.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used
dialog: to be.
text: Looks around.
text: A DORMITORY TYPE ROOM with 24 bunk beds set head to head
text: in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy. A
text: narrow WALKWAY leading towards a TOILET AREA and STAIRCASE.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Looks like a cheap hotel.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Yeah... Only the room service is
dialog: lousy. Come on, let me show you
dialog: the tennis courts.
text: Helps him with ERICH to take the first steps.
text: THE COURTYARD. The THREE of them emerge in a thin AFTERNOON
text: sun, Billy now disengaging and hobbling on his own power.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: (watching Billy
dialog: limp)
dialog: Feeling all right?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (still groggy)
dialog: Yeah. That guy who beat me?
dialog: (stops, slightly
dialog: puzzled)
dialog: I feel stoned.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (grins, interjects)
dialog: 'Figgers.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (vague, going on)
dialog: ...He had a bald skull and...
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Hamidou. Chief of the Guards.
dialog: Don't fuck with him. He almost
dialog: killed an Italian dude couple months
dialog: ago. Bad news. He try anything
dialog: with you?
text: BILLY glances at him, understanding. Pause.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No... I don't remember.
text: Glances at ERICH.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: With these fucking Turks, soon as
dialog: the light goes out... I keep one
text: hand on their feet and their feet
dialog: better not grow. You'll meet Max.
dialog: He got raped something bad down in
dialog: Section 13. That's the pits.
speaker_heading: THE COURTYARD
text: VARIOUS ANGLES The yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20
text: feet high. Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news-
text: papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place. No
text: guards are on the walls; the only GUARDS are unarmed
text: inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the
text: prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy
text: olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month,
text: augmented by bribes). On one side of the yard is a 2-story
text: ROGUS (cellblock) with barred windows from which Billy and
text: his two companions have just emerged. On the other side
text: of the yard is another 2-story KOGUS (the children's kogus).
text: The COURTYARD is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O
text: people in it - groups of exotically dressed AFRICANS,
scene_heading: AFGHANS, ARABS, MALAYSIANS, EUROPEANS, and predominantly
text: TURKS pacing back and forth talking in little circles,
text: hawking wares, trading illegal currencies.
text: Screaming Turkish STREET URCHINS 10-14 years old, share
text: the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising
text: viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. A
text: bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game.
dialog: Other aspects of the prison which should become evident:
dialog: 1) NOISE - continuous, Loud. Radios, Turkish music,
text: screaming, shouting. 2) CATS - all kinds, some of them
text: pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats. 3)
text: THE PRISONERS all wear their own clothing; the foreigners
dialog: preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits. 4)
text: THE HEADS of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed
dialog: to grow back. 5) MANY PRISONERS have physical disabilities.
text: Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses. Boils on the
text: lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms,
text: sometimes SO painful the victim walks with his arms up in
text: the air. Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles. Fungus on
text: the feet. Many limp.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PRISONERS glance at BILLY as he walks,
text: noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up, then
text: going on with their business.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The kids? Why are they...
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: Little fuckers are thieves, rapists,
dialog: pickpockets, murderers, you name
dialog: it - they do it. Don't trust any
dialog: of 'em...
text: BELL's eyes follow a knot of KIDS to:
text: ZIAT has a window open on the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS and is
text: selling little cups of tea to the kids from inside where
text: he works a GAS STOVE. The kids push and punch each other
dialog: to get the tea faster.
speaker_heading: BELL (OVER)
dialog: ...They tell Ziat everything. He's
dialog: the squeal round here. Goes all
text: over the prison. Sells watered-
dialog: down tea, blankets, hash, black
dialog: money, nembutols --anything for a
dialog: buck...
text: ZIAT leaves the stove in the hands of an ASSISTANT and
text: moves down the window to a particularly gaudy AFGHANI a
text: fierce hawk-faced old man with a chunk of his ear missing.
text: He wears a colorful flowing robe, various scarves, turban,
text: trinkets, rings, baggy pants, and pointed curved shoes,
text: and makes emphatic violent gestures at ZIAT with his
text: mutilated THREE FINGERS. ZIAT Seems to speak something of
text: his language and bargains back.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: He was an informer on the outside
dialog: but he tried to screw the cops out
dialog: of 60 kilos of opium. Watch him,
dialog: he's a fox.
text: BILLY says nothing to them about the Ziat incident, sizing
dialog: him up for himself.
text: THE AFGHANI having concluded the deal with ZIAT reaches
text: deep into his layers of clothing around his crotch and
text: pulls out several scrofulous $10 bills which discreetly
text: takes in exchange for a thick wad of Turkish currency, his
text: eyes moving around, stopping on BILLY. A hooded look.
speaker_heading: BELL (OVER)
dialog: Whatcha' in for, smuggling? Rash?
text: BILLY turning his eyes away from ZIAT
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: History, man, history. How much?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Two kilos.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: The airport. Trying to get on the
dialog: plane for the States.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (whistling a kind
dialog: of punctuation)
dialog: Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe
dialog: even twenty.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (tensing)
dialog: Twenty months?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS!
dialog: I figger ten at the least.
text: BILLY stunned.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Years?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Yeah, what do you think this is,
dialog: the good USA? This is Turkey, man...
dialog: (laughs bitterly))
dialog: It's a fucking accident here if
dialog: you're innocent. And anyway...
dialog: ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - all the color and breath seems to have
text: gone from BILLY.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: (his English is
text: halting but has a
dialog: calming effect)
dialog: Don't pay too much attention,
dialog: anything is possible in Turkey.
dialog: You might get bail.
text: BELL snorts, amused, kicking the SOCCER BALL away hard as
text: it dribbles towards them.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: ...If you make bail, you're free.
dialog: You can get a fake passport or
dialog: sneak across the border to Greece.
dialog: The Greeks hate the Turks so much
dialog: they never send you back. The Turks
dialog: know it. They just keep the bail.
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Sure, keep dreaming and see where
dialog: that gets you... like Max, up in
dialog: the head, you know...
dialog: (makes a crazy signal
dialog: towards the head)
dialog: You gonna eat a lot more fasoulia
dialog: beans, Billy baby, 'fore you taste
dialog: a hamburger 'gain cause you broke
dialog: the law man, and you got caught...
dialog: (grins)
dialog: And that... is history.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: The law is sometimes wrong.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (eyes feverish)
dialog: The Law is never wrong, asshole.
dialog: The Law is!
text: And stalks away, disgusted. A deep anger inside him. ERICH
text: looks at BILLY who is quiet; by way of apology.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: New people sometimes get on his
dialog: nerves.
speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: What did he do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: He was caught steeling from a
dialog: Mosque. That's heavy here. He

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Thirty years?
speaker_heading: ERICH
text: Jimmy has more balls than brains.
dialog: He didn't tell his parents he was
dialog: in jail for a year and a half. He
dialog: says he got himself in and now
dialog: he's going to get himself out.
text: He shakes his head, looking at:
text: BELL him across the courtyard huddling with a cigarette,
text: bartering angrily. a raggedy GUARD giving him a cigarette,
text: bartering angrily.
scene_heading: BILLY and ERICH.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: Hashish. Ninety percent of the
dialog: foreigners are in for hashish.
dialog: They walk.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What they give you?
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: (passive)
dialog: Twelve years.
text: Billy stops.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How much did you have?
speaker_heading: ERICH
text: A hundred grams.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: It's not fair!
text: Even ERICH has to smile now.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: There is no fair in Turkey, Billy.
dialog: It's all "sula-bula" like this,
dialog: like that. An Italian hippie had a
text: car accident and a Turk was killed.
dialog: SO, they threw him in here for six
dialog: months...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That doesn't seem so bad.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: But he was eating lunch a mile
text: away when the Turk smashed into
dialog: killed himself.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He wasn't even in the car?
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Aslan, there...
dialog: (points)
text: ASLAN - a young big fat heavily moustached Turk, wearing a
text: black silk double-breasted business suit, grotesque cuff-
text: links, heavily pomaded hair, is huddling in a section of
text: the YARD with FIVE other grinning GANGSTER TYPES, all in
dialog: suits.
speaker_heading: ERICH (OVER)
dialog: Killed a guy. But his father's a
text: big gangster on the docks. A
dialog: "Kapidiye." He'll stay in... twelve
dialog: months no more, and get parole. In
dialog: Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek".
text: ERICH Glances back at BILLY
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: You just got to get yourself a
dialog: good lawyer. And some money...
dialog: Talk to Max. He's been in the
dialog: longest.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: Seven years...
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: MAX - "Eskilet" (skeleton). British, tall, straggly long
text: hair with wire spectacles set crookedly over his nose. An
text: earing in one ear. The far away eyes of an international
text: junkie, preoccupied and uninterested in small talk. Tough
text: in his skinny way, like apiece of old dried leather.
text: He occupies with his YOUNG STRIPED CAT a bunk in the far
text: corner of the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS - in the process of
text: shooting himself up with "Gastro" a smelly brown liquid
text: stomach medicine. No one is in the vicinity except
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: ERICH and BILLY who watches repelled as MAX fumbles with a
text: piece of twine tied around his arm in a tourniquet,
text: searching for an unused spot amid dirty infected track
text: marks. PLUNGES the needle in, pumping in the black gunk.
text: Glances at BILLY.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Gastro. Stomach medicine. Has
dialog: codeine in it... Best can do
text: Pulls out the needle, loosens the tourniquet. His eyes
text: take on a far away stare.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: Lawyers?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah... there's no straight lawyers
dialog: in Turkey... They're all bent bent
dialog: as hairpins...
dialog: Gives a spoon with a taste of the black residue to:
text: HIS CAT who is full of spunk, and tries to catch Max's
speaker_heading: HAND.
text: He looks at BILLY, not remembering him.
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: His name?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: The lawyer?
text: MAX is beginning to go. He sits on his bunk.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What lawyer?
speaker_heading: ERICH
dialog: Who got the Frenchman out?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh Yesil... Yesil's his name but
dialog: I...don't know anything...
dialog: 'bout...Yesil...
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - MAX'S head begins to bob back and
text: forth.Focuses on BILLY.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Best way is get your ass out...
dialog: any... way... you can...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Get the... midnight... express.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What's that?
text: MAX smiles from faraway like a Cheshire cat and his head
text: drops forward onto his knees, nodding off.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: HAMIDOU, swinging his falaka stick rhythmically against
text: his leg and that calm killer look on his face, leads an
text: uneasy BILLY down a MAIN WALKWAY with a roof overhead; we
text: gather that the prison contains several separate wings.
text: ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING - HAMIDOU glances back at BILLY,
text: indicates with his stick "come here" and opens an office
dialog: door.
text: BILLY, still bewildered, his bruised feet almost back to
text: normal, limps in warily eyeing HAMIDOU who follows.
text: NECDIT YESIL, the lawyer, fleshy, grinning, thin black
text: hair heavily greased, sits at a conference table. Standing
text: adjacent is STANLEY DAVIS, the U.S. Consul - eyeglasses,
text: striped tie, neat summer suit with stripes, trimmed hair,
text: ivy league look, his eyes moving from Billy to:
text: OLDER MAN, late 50's white hair, blue-eyed New York
text: Irishman.A suburban insurance agent, rumpled suit, an
text: anxious look on his face. Moving towards BILLY fast:
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Billy!
text: FATHER AND SON embrace; the father's left hand grabbing
text: Billy's arm tightly as if never to let go.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dad!
text: HAMIDOU looks on, intrigued by the Father and Son; leaves
text: silently, closing the door.
text: FATHER looks into his son's eyes, his own eyes moistening.
text: He looks tired, pain all over his face.
text: BILLY looks down.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dad...I'm...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (voice quivering)
dialog: ...Don't worry about it.
dialog: (managing a smile)
dialog: I can punch you in the nose later.
dialog: Right now we've got to get you out
dialog: of here. You all right?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (eyes moistening)
dialog: Yeah. How's Mom?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Bad. She couldn't make the trip.
dialog: You know Her boy...
dialog: (breaks off)
dialog: Susan told us before we got your
dialog: letter. She's fine; she's trying
dialog: to get the money to come back and
dialog: see you, but...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No, don't let her! I'll... How
dialog: about Peg? Robbie?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Same. None of the neighbors know.
dialog: We told them you were in a hospital
dialog: in Europe. Oh... this is Stanley
dialog: Davis. He's the American Consul
dialog: here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer
dialog: you wanted...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: (shaking hands)
dialog: Hello, Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hello.
text: The professional smile from the Consul, but in the handshake
text: and the eye contact, BILLY is cool. The unanswered question:
dialog: Where were you before my father arrived?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: I want you to know we're going to
dialog: do everything, in our power to get
dialog: you out as soon as possible. Believe
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: YESIL moves forward. unctuous. bubbling with high spirits,
text: profusely shaking BILLY's hand, exuding confidence in
dialog: fractured English,
speaker_heading: YESIL
dialog: Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Mr. Yesil.
speaker_heading: YESIL
dialog: I know exactly what you feel but
dialog: you must not worry, we are acting
dialog: immediately, we get the right court,
dialog: the right judge, I arrange
dialog: everything - just right. And I
dialog: think we get you bail. If very
dialog: bad, maybe twenty month sentence...
dialog: But I think we get you bail...
text: Pause, BILLY looks at him wondering how to take him in.
speaker_heading: YESIL
dialog: (reassuringly)
dialog: You know I have lectured at the
dialog: University of Maryland in your
dialog: country? Also University Michigan
dialog: Very nice country. We both go back.
dialog: (smiles)
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (trying to
dialog: concentrate)
dialog: If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they
dialog: say it's easy to cross the border
dialog: into Greece?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (pacing up, hungry)
dialog: Right! That's what we're shooting
dialog: for. Mister Davis and have been
dialog: in contact with the State
dialog: Department, but right now relations
dialog: with the Turks aren't too good,
text: Nixon's upset the hell out of them.
dialog: Our best bet's... right here.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dad...
text: (pauses, glances at
dialog: Davis and Yesil,
dialog: embarrassed)
dialog: I'll pay you back for all this, I
dialog: Promise.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Don't worry about it. Right now
dialog: money doesn't count. Okay?
text: A pause. YESIL Shifts, Throats are cleared. BILLY moves to
text: sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the
text: bruises don't show.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Where'd you get that limp?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (not wanting to
dialog: alarm him)
dialog: Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
text: Sits down at the conference TABLE.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Where you staying, Dad?
speaker_heading: FATHER
text: (pulls up a seat
dialog: next to Billy)
dialog: The Hilton.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How do you like it? Istanbul?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well, it's an interesting place...
text: (lowers his voice,
dialog: a hint of a smile)
dialog: Tell you the truth, I think the
dialog: food is lousy. The crap they sell
dialog: in these little restaurants. I
dialog: went out to eat in one of them
dialog: last night, and I had to run to
dialog: the damn toilet... You shoulda'
dialog: seen the toilet.
text: BILLY laughs.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You mean you got toilets?
text: FATHER is happy to see his son laugh.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yeah, with real toilet paper - and
dialog: you don't have to use both sides.
text: BILLY laughs again.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: So now I'm eating at the Hilton
dialog: every night.
text: BILLY smiles. A pause. A worried look returns to the
dialog: Father's face
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Why'd you do it, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: For the money...
dialog: (Looks away))
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I know you kids smoke that stuff,
dialog: and we drink booze, but taking it
dialog: across a border - it was stupid,
dialog: Billy. Stupid.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know.
text: Glances at DAVIS, YESIL back to his father, his voice
text: beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Dad get me out of here.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE. The FATHER understands the desperation in
text: his voice, puts his hand on his son's.
dialog: FATHER I promise you, Billy. Just sit tight and don't..
dialog: DON'T do anything stupid. Let me work with Mr. Yesil and
dialog: Mr. Davis. We'll get you out... Okay? Billy, okay?
dialog: All the assurance of the world is written in this kindly
text: Irishman's face.
text: BILLY feels it.
text: BILLY being led by TWO GUARDS down a huge arched CORRIDOR
text: in the COURTROOM BUILDING.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CUT:
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER)
text: THE world is now looking at Turkey.
dialog: We are called the Heroin Supplier
dialog: of the world. Stories about us
dialog: are in newspapers and on television
dialog: every day all around the world.
dialog: The time has come, your Honor, to
dialog: alter this image before we find
dialog: ourselves isolated and morally
text: ostracized by the rest of the human
dialog: race...
text: THE COURTROOM - monolithic, frightening, immense with cross-
text: currents of greenish light from the enormous windows.
text: People seem insignificant.
text: THE PROSECUTOR, wearing dark green glasses, continues,
text: scowling, gesturing profusely at:
text: BILLY in the PRISONERS DOCK, baroque design, isolated.
dialog: Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin-
text: striped suit makes him look rather absurd.
scene_heading: HIS FATHER, CONSUL DAVIS, YESIL and ANOTHER LAWYER are
text: seated together at the defence table conferring in low
text: tones with each other. YESIL looks over at BILLY with a
text: big reassuring grin, nods his head - nothing to worry about.
text: TURKISH GIRL from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes
text: notes in the Spectator Gallery. Her legs flare out from a
dialog: short skirt.
text: BILLY pries his eyes away to:
text: PROSECUTOR continuing in front of the THREE JUDGES high on
text: an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes
text: with scarlet collars. One of the Judges is bald, the other
text: has his eyes closed, could be asleep. The CHIEF JUDGE in
text: the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short
text: grey hair. A YOUNG MAN below the podium, is clacking at
text: an ancient typewriter on a small table.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER)
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: ...We must alter this image by
dialog: punishing only our own drug
text: smugglers-but by handing out
dialog: foreigners who infest our culture
dialog: with their depravity ungodly and
dialog: behavior. We must start now - by
dialog: sentencing this American, Vilyum
dialog: Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence
dialog: for smuggling, to be held up to
dialog: the light of the world as an example
dialog: of Turkish justice and its intention
dialog: to halt the drug trade once and
dialog: for all.. .I ask the Court therefore
dialog: to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life
dialog: Imprisonment.
dialog: 
text: He sits, staring malignantly at BILLY.
text: THE JUDGES rise.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court
dialog: will now recess to consider its
dialog: verdict.
text: The JUDGES exit.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE, General commotion in the courtroom as people
text: move about. The FATHER and DAVIS and the OTHER LAWYER
text: consult among themselves, the FATHER vigorously nodding
text: his head. YESIL approaches BILLY.
text: BILLY leans forward anxiously in the dock.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What'd the Prosecutor say?
speaker_heading: YESIL
dialog: (hurried)
dialog: It's not important, just technical
dialog: things. We make our case. You
dialog: were very good, you spoke well.
dialog: The Judge like you. It look good.
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (pressing)
dialog: Did you ask for bail?
text: But YESIL is called over by the other LAWYER and hurries
text: off. A SOLDIER comes over and sits BILLY down.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE CHIEF JUDGE puts on his glasses, stands to read the
dialog: verdict.
text: YESIL, standing with the OTHERS, motions BILLY to rise.
text: BILLY rises, tense.
text: FATHER looks over at him, manages a reassuring smile.
text: JUDGE continuing, after preliminaries:
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The Defendant has been found guilty
dialog: by the Court of the illegal
dialog: possession of Hashish...
text: PROSECUTOR, his expression souring, makes a gesture of
dialog: defeat. We wanted a conviction for smuggling, not
dialog: possession.
text: BILLY, not understanding sees the Prosecutor's gesture,
text: and a hint of hope crosses his expression.
text: JUDGE puts the paper away, looks at BILLY directly.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ...Therefore. this court sentences
dialog: you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned
dialog: at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of
dialog: four years and two months. This
dialog: Case is now closed.
text: BILLY looking at the JUDGE doesn't understand. Thinks he
text: might be free. But suddenly TWO SOLDIERS move in, and
text: start chaining his hands together. He is bewildered, looking
dialog: at:
text: YESIL hastily conferring with Billy's FATHER, more concerned
text: about making a good impression with him than with Billy.
speaker_heading: YESILF
dialog: Four years, two months. It's good.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Four years!
speaker_heading: YESIL
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: We appeal it.
text: BILLY watching this, a lost look.
text: FATHER is too shocked to do anything but look at YESIL who
dialog: continues on:
speaker_heading: YESIL
dialog: You will see, he will have maybe
dialog: one year taken off this sentence
dialog: for good behaviour. Remember, it
dialog: is only for possession; the
dialog: prosecutor wanted life sentence
dialog: for smuggling...
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: To be honest Mr. Hayes, it is a
dialog: great victory!
text: BILLY is forcibly removed from the DOCK - in chains.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE FATHER, in the same CONFERENCE ROOM,
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: ...With good time Billy it works
dialog: out to about 3 years... then there's
dialog: the appeal. Yesil, Davis, they're
dialog: all working for you We're going to
dialog: try to make a deal to get you
text: transferred to a Stateside prison.
dialog: And Davis thinks there might be a
dialog: political amnesty any month...
dialog: Stops. Knows it sounds bad.
text: BILLY looks down.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Look - I know it sounds tough,
dialog: Billy, but we're gonna get you
dialog: out...
text: FATHER grips BILLY by the arm hard.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: ...I promise you, but I don't want
dialog: you to get stupid again. Pull
dialog: anything. They can play with your
dialog: sentence.
text: BILLY nods, acquiescent.
speaker_heading: FATTIER
dialog: (his voice starting
dialog: to crack)
dialog: I'm putting $500 in the bank for
dialog: you. Anything you need you write...
text: BILLY nods. His FATHER points to a stack of ITEMS on the
text: conference table, picks up a cigarette carton.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: There's food, candy, writing paper,
dialog: soap, books...
text: (his eyes start to
dialog: water)
dialog: ...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush,
dialog: there's... Jesus!
dialog: (cracks, throws
dialog: down the cigarette
dialog: carton)
dialog: I been writing insurance policies
dialog: on people for thirty goddamn
dialog: years...
dialog: (laughs and cries
dialog: at the same time)
dialog: And now I gotta see my own
dialog: son...Jesus! Jesus! If I could be
dialog: where you are Billy, I'd be there...
dialog: Goddamn Jesus! These bastards.
text: HUGS HIS SON BILLY is on the verge of tears.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: DAD!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Oh Jesus!
dialog: (sobbing)
text: HAMIDOU enters the room. A morbid curiosity in his
text: expression about this show of grief. Watches a few moments,
text: then indicating the visit is over, he taps his falaka stick
text: lightly a few times on the hollow door. THWACK! THWACK!
text: FATHER breaks the embrace with BILLY, tears streaking his
text: cheeks. Silently indicates for him to "Go, go Fast."
text: BILLY goes, past HAMIDOU
text: FATHER shaking his finger at HAMIDOU
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You take good care of my boy, you
dialog: hear, or I'll have your fucking
dialog: head, you Turkish bastard!
text: It sputters out of his mouth, senseless to:
text: HAMIDOU who closes the door. He has an angry glint in his
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler.
text: Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. A
text: PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in the
text: background, is on his wall with various SOAP CARVINGS of
text: little chess piece she has designed.
text: In the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound
text: consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night, on
text: an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. Two
text: whistles. Chugging. Then passing off. The Midnight Express.
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: Dear Susan. 1970 has now passed
dialog: into 1971. You can drift in here
dialog: and never know you're gone. You
dialog: can fade so far out and you don't
dialog: know where you are anymore or where
dialog: anything else is...
text: The CAMERA DRIFTS around the SECOND STORY KOGUS revealing
text: the sleepers: ERICH, BELL, MAX...
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: I find loneliness is a physical
dialog: pain which hurts all over; you
dialog: can't isolate it in one part of
dialog: your body. I so much need your
dialog: softness, your strength. I have
dialog: your letters. They charge me, give
dialog: me courage.News about amnesty and
text: getting out - tangled,
dialog: complicated...
text: The CAMERA LINGERS on ZIAT in a far corner of the Kogus,
text: top bunk, against a wall. Never secure, he shuffles in
dialog: his sleep.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ...I feel myself drifting more
text: heavily into smoking hashish. The
dialog: haze helps the time pass. Also I
dialog: do soap carvings. Erich taught
dialog: me. And I have been learning Turkish
dialog: because it helps me to deal with
dialog: the guards and the prisoners. I'm
dialog: trying hard to maintain some sort
dialog: of schedule to my life, but
dialog: sometimes it seems like I'm just
dialog: trying in order to try...
text: ZIAT is evidently awake he pulls his RADIO over into the
text: bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching,
text: here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the
text: cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination GERMAN
text: MARKS: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different-colored
text: CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: COURTYARD. Volleyball game in progress. ERICH is tall and
text: plays with dexterous grace. BILLY is fast, agile. BELL is
text: muscular, intense, his hits power-packed.
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: ... In the daytimes we sometimes
dialog: play volleyball against the big
dialog: Turkish gangsters...
text: THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this
text: context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms
text: and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious
text: of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play
text: in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves,
text: shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts
text: and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONERS
text: laying bets and shouting encouragement.
text: BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the
text: TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just over
text: the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BELL goes up for another ball close to the net and really
dialog: SMASHES it with all his might, and:
text: BALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his
text: arms and SCREAMS with pain, very theatrical.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD, wearing
text: sunglasses so no one will see his black eye.
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: ...To the Turks all foreigners are
dialog: "ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't
dialog: shave our under-arms or around our
dialog: crotch...
text: BELL across the pointyard grins at him and points him out
text: to BILLY, and ERICH.
speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: Even the yoga I sometimes do is
dialog: "ayip" - too suggestive...
text: THE TURK scowls back at BELL, huddles menacingly with
text: another TURK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: And you're never supposed to eat
dialog: with your left hand. You know why?
dialog: Because that's what they use to
dialog: wipe their asses with instead of
dialog: toilet paper. And yet they hate
dialog: pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey.
dialog: They're considered dirty...
text: BELL, smirking at the Turk, turns and walks away.
speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: So is homosexuality. That's a big
dialog: crime here but most of them do it
dialog: every chance they get. There are
dialog: about a thousand things that are
dialog: "ayip". But they're really so
dialog: hypocritical, like children breaking
dialog: the rules. For instance...
text: Suddenly a CRY OFF and:
text: THE TURK runs up, pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants, and
text: using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in
dialog: the ass and backs of his thighs. One, two, three, four,
text: five QUICK STABS, like a cook hammering veal. In spite of
text: its violence, the action seems like slapstick.
text: BELL tumbles to the ground, crying out.
text: THE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his FRIENDS,
dialog: his honor restored.
text: BILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously
text: more in pain than in danger.
speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: ...You can stab or shoot some body
dialog: the but not above the waist because
dialog: that's intent to kill. So everybody
text: runs around stabbing everyone else
dialog: in the ass. That's what they call
dialog: 'Turkish revenge'. There's also a
dialog: lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite
dialog: Turkish word for bribery...
text: LONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish gangster
text: pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together
text: in the FIRST STORY KOGUS alone except for ZIATR and
text: Hamidou's two FAT SONS, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in
text: little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to
text: them, in couched terms. The voices are distant and, after
text: a few beats, UNDER BILLY'S VOICE:
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Unfortunately my youngest son Arief
text: is having problems with his teeth;
text: he needs braces, but dentists are
dialog: so expensive these days
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: (patting Arief on
dialog: the head)
dialog: Poor kid... You know I have a
dialog: friend, a very good friend; he's a
dialog: dentist; maybe he could get you
dialog: some braces at a... reasonable
dialog: price.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (protesting with
text: his hands, shaking
dialog: his head))
dialog: Oh, no...it's out of the
dialog: question...wouldn't want to ask
dialog: your friend...
speaker_heading: ASLAN
dialog: Yes. Please! As a favour... I insist
text: They go on, each protesting.
speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
text: Hamidou hints that he needs new
text: braces for one of his sons. Aslan
dialog: of course has a friend who's a
dialog: dentist. They bullshit for half
text: an hour and Hamidou finally accepts
dialog: the "Baksheesh" in return...
text: A BURLAP BAG comes flying over the WALL of the COURTYARD
text: late at NIGHT. Then another comes over, lands in the yard.

speaker_heading: GUARD

dialog: Hey, I your mother! Get back to

speaker_heading: CUT:
text: PRISONERS rushing out into the COURTYARD, scrambling for

text: THE PRISON DIRECTOR, A balding unimpressive looking man in

speaker_heading: CUT:

speaker_heading: CUT:
text: CLOSE KID being pinned onto his back on the floor in

text: HAMIDOU appears in a hat and mohair suit with narrow lapels,
text: accompanied by his two little fat SONS, also in their Sunday

text: BILLY watches through the WINDOW with OTHER PRISONERS.
text: HAMIDOU is passed a falaka stick. He raises it high in

speaker_heading: CUT:

speaker_heading: BILLY VOICE
dialog: ...the more hate him.

text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY is watching with glazed eyes - stoned.
text: Approving of the $10, tucks it into his belly cloth looking

speaker_heading: ZIAT

speaker_heading: ZIAT
speaker_heading: JAAAASH!
text: SHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat.
text: MAX surprised, glares at Ziat.
speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I make special tea for you, Hiyes,
dialog: okay? We've to live like brothers.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Know what?
speaker_heading: ZIAT

dialog: ...seven years old. I was on street

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Learn what?

speaker_heading: ZIAT

speaker_heading: RAFTER Nothing.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sodding cat!

speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY jerks up from his bunk as he the hears a loud,

dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: ZIAT, industrious as always, is preparing his tea on the
text: three burners of the small bottled gas' stove in THE
text: KITCHEN, FIRST FLOOR Kogus; needless to say the area is
text: filthy with scraps all over the floor, cats and two large
text: wooden eating tables occupied by some PRISONERS. The Kitchen

scene_heading: is EARLY MORNING - Muslim CHANTING OFF,
text: THREE TURKISH PRISONERS walk in, talking (AD LIB), followed
text: by MAX stoned, who shuffles over to the table, about to

text: HIS CAT, dead stabbed, and lying there neglected in the
text: corner, just another scrap ready to be swept out.
text: ZIAT calmly pours the tea for the table, paying MAX no
text: attention, an excellent actor. Prominently seated, however,
dialog: is a GUARD.
text: MAX quietly glares at ZIAT and the Guard but says nothing;

dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: MAX - silently walks over and gently picks up the corpse

speaker_heading: CUT:

speaker_heading: YESIL

dialog: The new American Ambassador here
dialog: is following your case very closely.
dialog: He says there is progress. But
dialog: there is another route that is
dialog: quite possible...

dialog: ...For the proper amount of money
dialog: it is possible I can convince
dialog: certain officials to lose track of
dialog: your papers before the High Court
dialog: in Ankara confirms the sentence of
dialog: the Lower Court in Istanbul... You
dialog: would not exist; and you could be

dialog: your family and I are thinking
dialog: about you all the time. I am trying
dialog: hard to make enough money nights
dialog: to come and see you. Your father
dialog: says that lawyer Yesil wants another
dialog: $2000. I know you distrust him
dialog: more and more, but your father
dialog: wants to do everything he can, and
text: he is borrowing all he can on the

dialog: to be the only way out of there.
dialog: Except of course the other way...
text: BILLY, MAX and BELL (bandaged around the ass from the
text: stabbing) are huddled around BELL's BUNK late NIGHT candle
text: burning, a sheet sealing off some of the kogus. Bell

text: unfolding a set of DRAWINGS from a pack of letters.
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: ...But I cannot say I am for it.
dialog: Nor are your parents. They consulted
dialog: the priest, and he said to send
dialog: you money for that reason would be
dialog: like sealing your death.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (excited)
dialog: The blueprints!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: To what?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: The prison, man. There was this
dialog: German cat an architect in the
dialog: hospital. He was helping the Turks
dialog: build some shit round the place.
dialog: I laid some bread on him and he
dialog: let me copy them.
text: BILLY, puzzled, turns the drawings upside-down, sideways.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Too bad you didn't have a machine.
speaker_heading: BELL

dialog: is Under.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Tunnel?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: It's already built! There's a
text: basement substructure where they
dialog: used to keep weapons and stuff,

dialog: catacombs that the Christians built
dialog: 'bout a thousand fucking years ago
dialog: to bury their dead. We're sitting

speaker_heading: BELL (OVER)
dialog: The Kraut said there's a whole

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (turning on Max)
dialog: Hey! I'm getting this together

speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: ...The Kraut was right! I checked
dialog: it out - there's no reinforced
dialog: steel in those bath walls. They're
dialog: real soft from underground seepage--

speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (gesturing profusely)
text: --the water like "'weeps" through
dialog: the cement, see. Twenty, thirty
dialog: years, you can almost push it over.
dialog: All we do is use Gastrohead's
dialog: screwdriver here and scrape the

dialog: squeeze through, put 'em back, and
dialog: get our ass down the shaft, It's a
dialog: two night operation, maybe three.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And what do you do when you in the
dialog: catacombs?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a

dialog: sewer system but they got to come
text: up someplace in Istanbul.
text: Max is fed up with it now, no longer joking.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You gotta be fucking crazy! You
dialog: got stabbed in the ass once too
dialog: much, sweetheart, cause you're
dialog: gonna end up in Section 13, that's
dialog: what - not the 'catacombs.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Section 13?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (looking at Bell)
dialog: Yeah, for the criminally insane.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...The roof sounds better to me

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The bullet percentage is awful

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: CUT:

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Something happen to Dad?... Mom?
text: DAVIS swallows hard, not to say it
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: No... It looks like your going to
dialog: have a new court.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: The Prosecutor objected to your
dialog: sentence for possession; he wanted
dialog: a smuggling conviction and the
dialog: High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: We've been notified that they
dialog: rejected the sentence...
text: Billy's face drains of all expression.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There were 35 judges on the High
dialog: Court. Twenty eight of them voted
dialog: for a life sentence.
text: BILLY'S EYES. Numb, dazed, surreal.
speaker_heading: DAVIS (OFF)
dialog: The Lower Court in Istanbul will
dialog: have to go along with the decision.
dialog: The Judge likes you and he'll do
dialog: the only thing he can do under the
dialog: law.... . He'll reduce the sentence
dialog: to thirty years... We're notified...
dialog: Billy.
text: Suddenly he is GRABBED by his ivy-league striped tie and
text: his face is yanked up to the bars, his glasses falling
dialog: off.
text: BILLY is berserk, his face right up against the bars,
text: GRIPPING Davis tight.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT!
speaker_heading: FOR WHAT!
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: (choking)
dialog: Billy! Please!
text: Commotion OFF as GUARDS run in, HAMIDOU in the lead.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
text: The GUARDS try to pry loose BILLY'S strangling grip ON
dialog: DAVIS' tie.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!
text: HAMIDOU takes out a KNIFE and cuts the consul's tie in
text: half. DAVIS falls backwards.
text: BILLY is hauled now. back, still gripping half the tie.
text: He is trembling now.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!
text: DAVIS is shaken. He has red bar marks across his face and
text: is absent-mindedly trying to adjust half a tie as he looks
dialog: at:
text: BILLY being hauled out by HAMIDOU, SCREAMING something
text: indistinct.
speaker_heading: CUT:
scene_heading: COURTROOM. Same as before.
text: BILLY, in the prisoner's dock, addresses the Court; as he
text: speaks, a Turkish TRANSLATOR. drones underneath his voice
dialog: level:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...What is the crime? And what is
dialog: the punishment? The answer seems
dialog: to vary from place to place, and
dialog: from time to time. What's legal
dialog: today is suddenly illegal tomorrow
dialog: cause some society says it's so;
dialog: and what's illegal yesterday all
dialog: of a sudden gets legal today because
dialog: everybody's doing it and you can't
dialog: throw everybody in jail. Well I'm
dialog: not saying this is right or wrong.
dialog: It's just the way things are....
dialog: YESIL the lawyer; DAVIS the consul.
text: THE PRESS GIRL from the previous trial in the short skirt.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: But I spent the last three and a
dialog: half years of my life in your prison
dialog: and I think I paid for my error
dialog: and if it's your decision today to
dialog: sentence me to more years, I...
dialog: I...
dialog: (a break)
dialog: You know my lawyers told me 'be
dialog: cool
dialog: Billy don't get upset, don't get
dialog: angry, if you're good I can maybe
dialog: get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal,
dialog: this that and the other thing.'
dialog: Well that's been going down now
dialog: for 35 years...
text: YESIL looks over, surprised he is talking like this. Looks
speaker_heading: at DAVIS.
speaker_heading: BILLY.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (continuous)
dialog: And I've been playing it cool and
dialog: I've been good and now I'm damn
dialog: tired of being good cause you people
dialog: gave me the belief that I had 53
dialog: days left. You hung 53 days in
dialog: front of my eyes and then you took
dialog: those 53 days away, and Mister
dialog: Prosecutor! I just wish you
dialog: could...
text: PROSECUTOR looks over, through his dark green glasses.
speaker_heading: BILLY (OVER)
dialog: ... stand right here where I'm
dialog: standing and feel what that...
dialog: ...feels like, cause then you'd
dialog: know something you don't know you'd
dialog: know what means, Mister Prosecutor
dialog: and you'd know the concept of a
dialog: society is based on the quality of
dialog: its mercy means, of its sense of
dialog: fair play, its sense of justice...
dialog: but
dialog: (shrugs and scoffs
dialog: at himself)
dialog: I guess that's just like asking a
dialog: bear to shit in a toilet...
text: TRANSLATOR stops, looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (same self-mocking
dialog: tone)
dialog: For a nation of pigs, it's funny
dialog: you don't eat them. Fuck it, give
dialog: me the sentence. Jesus forgave the
dialog: bastards, but I can't. I hate you.
dialog: Nation. I hate your I hate your
dialog: people. And I fuck your sons and
dialog: daughters!
text: Sits down, disgusted; under his breath:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...cause you're all pigs.
text: SILENCE in the uncomfortably. courtroom. PEOPLE looking
text: at each other DAVIS looks down.
text: YESIL flips some pages abstractedly.
scene_heading: TRANSLATOR SCARED:
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: Would Your honor like me to
dialog: translate?
text: THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE, the same one as before Shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: That won't be necessary
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE JUDGE turns to BILLY in the foreground
text: rises, and unexpectedly crosses his wrists out in front of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (emotionally)
dialog: My hands are tied by Ankara!
text: Makes the gesture of the hands forcefully, with anger.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR (OFF)
dialog: My hands are tied by Ankara!
text: BILLY WATCHING,
speaker_heading: JUDGE (OFF)
dialog: I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ... to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar

speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR (OFF)
dialog: "I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes,
dialog: to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for
dialog: a term no less than years...
dialog: "Getchmis Olsun"
text: As he translates, the JUDGE unable to control his emotion
text: exits rapidly, not looking at Billy, followed by the TWO
scene_heading: OTHER JUDGES.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR (OFF)
dialog: "May it pass quickly."
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THREE OLD GLEANING WOMEN swathed in black like three fates
text: turn from their sweeping as BILLY is led out COURTROOM
text: NUMBER SIX down a long stone corridor. Dust floats through
text: long slanting shafts of yellowish light, like a striped
text: leotard dream. BILLY walks, his eyes straight ahead -
dialog: determined.
speaker_heading: SONG OVER (BELL)
dialog: (old Southern blues
dialog: beat, improvised)
dialog: "Mmmmm... got the blues babe,
dialog: Got those old Istanbul blues,
dialog: Said Yeah, I got the blues babe
dialog: Got those old Istanbul blues...
dialog: Thirty years in Turkey, babe,
dialog: Ain't got nothing left to lose..."
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BELL sings it, strumming sloppily but with feeling on his
text: guitar. BILLY lies, his back up, on his BUNK nearby.
text: MAX, stoned, sits at the base of the bunk. It is NIGHT.
text: The song falters, but MAX now joins in, improvising:
speaker_heading: SONG OVER (MAX AND BELL)
dialog: "Busted at the border
dialog: Two keys in my shoes
dialog: Said I was busted at the border
dialog: with two keys in my shoes
dialog: An they gave me thirty years, babe
dialog: To learn the old Istanbul blues..."
text: SEVERAL TURKS are partying it up down at the other end of
text: the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS, playing a "sas" - Turkish type
text: guitar, counterpointed by a little drum; the music is
text: stridently Turkish, and one of the men does a belly-dance
text: in underpants with two lemons masquerading as breasts under
text: his shirt. The LOUD TWANGING of Bell's GUITAR can be heard
text: OFF, interrupting them. They are annoyed.
text: BELL leading MAX into the next stanza:
speaker_heading: SONG OVER (MAX AND BELL)
dialog: "I said Lord now save me
dialog: Please save me from this pain"
text: BILLY, touched - listening, thinking.
speaker_heading: SONG OVER (OVER)
dialog: "I said Lord come and save me,
dialog: Come save me from this pain
dialog: Come set me free sweet Jesus..."
speaker_heading: TURK (OFF)
dialog: Hey knock off that shit music...
text: TWO TURKS from the party walk up, waving at BELL's guitar,
dialog: annoyed.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: ...We're playing the sas.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (understanding their
dialog: Turkish)
dialog: Omina koyden your sas!
dialog: (Put your sas in your cunt!)
text: THE TWO TURKS tense, the mood changing.
text: BELL gets even angrier, puts the guitar aside, ready to
dialog: spring.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: ...And besides that I fuck Allah
dialog: and I fuck your Muslim mother too...
text: They don't understand but one of them is reaching into his
text: pants for his shiv.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: You got that, shit face? Asina...
speaker_heading: BILLY (OFF)
dialog: KNOCK IT OFF!
text: ANOTHER ANGLE BILLY is moving fast between the TWO TURKS
text: and BELL. A new authority in his voice, and controlled
text: anger in his face.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (to Bell)
dialog: Cut it! No more fights.
text: BELL looks.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We're getting out of here.
text: BELL astonished.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY, with Max's little screwdriver and a metal spoon,
text: digs hard at the cracks around a dark stone in the SINK
text: ROOM, FIRST FLOOR KOGUS. With him is MAX working on the
text: same stone. They are sweating, shirtless, looking back
text: over their shoulders at:
text: BELL guarding the STAIRS.
text: BILLY works the stucco out, jiggling with the stone (about
text: a nine inch circumference) using his fingers and
text: screwdriver. Painful work.
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: Dear Susan. It's taken me a long
dialog: time to find out that it's got to
dialog: stop somewhere. I've learned
dialog: painfully not to trust the Turks,
dialog: the courts, the lawyers, the Consul,
dialog: the United States Government, and
dialog: not even my loving parents. There
dialog: is only one way out of here.. The
dialog: Midnight Express.
text: BILLY kicks with his sneakers at the stone, as silently as
text: possible. A LOUD NOISE - crumbling dust, stucco.
text: BELL at the stairs freezes, fearful. Then SILENCE. He
text: Runs over.
scene_heading: MAX, BELL, BILLY.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: We're undermining the other stones!
text: BELL studies it, pointing to the stone above left the one
dialog: that has been loosened.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: We gotta take a chance and do that
dialog: one next -
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Then pull out this one -
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: one directly left
dialog: of the loosened
dialog: stone, excited)
dialog: Just jiggle it, scratch it out,
dialog: loose nit up, it's soft real soft!
text: BILLY has his head pressed close to the loosened stone.
dialog: Suddenly:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's there!
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Listen!
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - all THREE press their ears to the stone.
text: A silence. The faintest whisper of WIND and dripping 'WATER -
text: indicating a shaft of some nature. BELL looks back at BILLY.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: I told you, I told you you cock-
dialog: suckers! You didn't believe me.
text: BILLY smiles. MAX reaches over and grabs Bell's face between
text: his hands, kisses him violently.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Fuck me! You beautiful mother,
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: MAX now on guard at the STAIRS, looks over at:
text: BELL AND BILLY - with fresh paste putting the finishing
text: touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced
text: in its original position. Bell's half naked torso reveals
text: a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE REPLACED STONE. On close inspection, it is apparent
text: that the stucco around it doesn't match the other stones
text: one bit, but as we PULL BACK to see ZIAT washing his tea
text: cups in the SINK during the DAY, this irregularity is lost
text: in the greater mosaic of the wall structure. At least ZIAT
dialog: doesn't notice as:
text: BILLY nervously comes into the SINK area, watching him,
text: and calls to him.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (using Turkish)
dialog: Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea
dialog: will ay!
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (mutters to himself)
dialog: Work, work, work, that's all do
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't hear you bitch about the
dialog: money.
text: BILLY followed by ZIAT into the KITCHEN casts a look of
dialog: relief at:
text: BELL and MAX who wait at a table with empty tea cups.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: A HORDE OF COCKROACHES stream out from a crack in the stone
text: as BILLY and MAX dig, scrape, jiggle the third stone. Both
text: covered with sweat, working with confidence now.
text: A DARK EMPTY SHAFT on the other side. Dripping water. Two
dialog: stones removed.
text: BELL runs over:
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Want me to take over?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You want to split your hernia again?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Get off our tits!
text: Bell turns to go. Suddenly a LOUD CRUMBLING NOISE and:
text: A FOURTH STONE starts to go - but brakes itself.
text: BILLY, MAX, BELL all framed in a posture of fear -- not
dialog: daring to move.
text: SECOND STORY KOGUS remains silent.
text: BELL looks up the STAIRS, tiptoes back, indicating they
text: are clear.
text: MAX AND BILLY. All THREE of them look:
text: THE THREE A HALF STONE SPACE. Easily big enough for them
text: to squeeze through. BILLY shines a candle in the shaft,
speaker_heading: OFF.
text: THE THREE look at each other. The same thought. Eager eyes.
text: The TRAIN WHISTLES by in the night, OFF.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (sudden)
dialog: Let's go!
text: BILLY looks at his watch, hates to do it. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No. No time. Put 'em back.
text: MAX groans to himself.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY tense and restless at his BUNK TWILIGHT. A loud RADIO
dialog: OFF - Turkish News.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We go early. Any fuck-ups we should
dialog: be back here and have the stones
text: in by dawn.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - MAX, BELL, AND BILLY. A pause.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You got your stuff?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (persistent)
dialog: Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (business-like)
dialog: Everything.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (looks around the
dialog: group)
dialog: Let's do it.
text: He extends his hands and the other two cross in a six-handed
dialog: shake.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: MAX signals down the STAIRS - "all clear".
text: BILLY going through the HOLE in the STONES that NIGHT into:
text: A DARK SHAFT spookily leading downwards. He lights a thick
text: CANDLE tied horizontally across his sneakers so as to give
text: him his light source where his footholds are. His P.V.O:
text: PART DUMBWAITER SHAFT, PART WATER WELL from a previous
text: century A series of corrugated mossy old footholds and
text: iron spikes lead down at irregular intervals.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY, MAX AND BELL, each with their own foot candle, are
text: spaced along the shaft easing downwards. BILLY looks up at
text: MAX about ten feet above.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Jimmy?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (struggling.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How's your hernia?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Don't make me laugh.
text: BILLY in a sweat, slips. A tense moment - then he catches
text: himself. OFF - the TRAIN WHISTLE can be heard, echoing
text: into the shaft.Mixed suddenly with LOUD TALKING OFF. Arguing
text: in Turkish. BILLY freezes, signals upwards with a sharp
text: hiss of breath.
speaker_heading: VOICE #1 (OFF)
dialog: What do you mean, you forgot, he'll
dialog: have my ass!
speaker_heading: VOICE #2 (OFF)
dialog: Well I can't do two things at once,
dialog: you were supposed to be here at
dialog: nine o'clock!
text: BILLY identifying the relative location of the voices,
text: eases downwards, coming to a GRILL, looks in at:
text: A BASEMENT ROOM with FURNACE. TWO TURKISH GUARDS throw the
text: prison rubbish in the furnace, still arguing, AD LIB.
text: BILLY signals upwards.
text: REVERSE ANGLE, from inside the basement, of BILLY slipping
text: past the grill, his face sharply illuminated by the flame
dialog: of the furnace.
text: Off the walls around the grill we can see the GIANT
text: SILHOUETTES of the two guards still arguing.
text: BILLY comes to the base of the shaft. A puddle of scummy
text: water. Unstraps the candle. A current of WIND He peers
dialog: around.
scene_heading: P.O.V. - A WINDING NARROW CATACOMB, WITH BEEHIVE BURIAL
text: PLACES ON BOTH SIDES.
text: BILLY, sniffing the stench, unrolls a ball of THREAD ties
text: it to a marker and heads in.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY, BELL and MAX are in the catacomb. A scratchy hideous
dialog: sound and:
text: BATS fly out squealing from the ceiling.
text: THE BOYS hit the ground as BATWINGS flap over them,
text: colliding against each other, knocking off walls,
text: SCREECHING, then diminishing in sound. Fewer and fewer.
text: Then gone.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (looking up, scared)
dialog: Jesus!
text: BILLY looking up.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Anybody bitten?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Nah, just covered with batshit!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (getting to his
dialog: knees)
dialog: They went out over there: must be
text: some kind of exit.
text: Heads in that direction.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: A HUGE SPIDER scatters off, as BILLY's CANDLE illuminates:
text: ANOTHER ENDLESS WALKWAY. BILLY comes to a stop -
text: frustrated.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Let's go back the other way.
text: INTERSECTION Two walkways. BELL leads in, unwinding the
text: thread, stops.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: The fuck are we?
text: BILLY comes into view, equally frustrated.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Two thirty.
text: ANOTHER MAZE of walkways. The three stop exhausted, faces
text: blackened. BILLY, in utter rage and frustration starts
text: kicking the wall.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Shit! Shit! Shit!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (slumping to the
dialog: ground)
dialog: It's a dead end. The Turks musta'
dialog: sealed it up.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: What the fuck we gonna do?
text: SILENCE as the three pathetic escapees ponder their fate.
text: BILLY, getting a grip on himself, thinking.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We go back.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What? You gotta be joking.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (resolute)
text: We go back, seal it up again, and
dialog: come in tomorrow night - every
dialog: night 'till we get out of here.
dialog: There's gotta be a way. Those bats
dialog: got out someplace.
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Now let's go. Doubletime!
text: Takes the THREAD and starts to follow it back.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE SHAFT. BILLY leads the climbers UP.

text: Looks down at BELL heavy breathing OFF. Urging him on.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You gotta have a lot of balls for
dialog: this
dialog: 
text: BELL, suffering, can't help but grin.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: Count me out.
dialog: (to himself, shaking
dialog: his head)
dialog: Who ever heard of anybody sneaking
dialog: back into a fucking jail?
text: MAX overhearing it.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, what if got caught?
text: BELL starts to giggle.
speaker_heading: BILLY (OFF)
dialog: (up the shaft)
dialog: Hey Max, don't make the dummy laugh.
text: MAX laughing, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (between giggles)
dialog: Who's laughing? I mean I find
dialog: this terribly depressing... Can
dialog: you see old Hamidou's face when he
dialog: tries to figure this one out?
text: BILLY can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (between giggles)
dialog: We'll tell him we were checking
dialog: out our escape route. We wanted
dialog: to be completely sure before we
dialog: tried it.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - the THREE of them, spaced along the shaft,
text: are all giggling hysterically. Echoing. HOLD ON them.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY comes through the HOLE in the stones in the SINK
text: AREA. It is still NIGHT. He looks around - silence. MAX
text: follows through the hole.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY and MAX work fractically to seal up the STONES.
text: BELL, exhausted, is at the STAIRS guarding. Distant early
text: morning SOUNDS of prison waking up. We feel they will be
dialog: spotted this time, but:
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY slumps into his BUNK as the first rays of LIGHT come
text: up in the sky and the CHANT from the Mosque commences. He
text: immediately sinks into sleep.
text: CLOSE on OLD TEA LEAVES being washed in the SINK. A MILKY
text: WHITE EYE follows into view. ZIAT is preparing his early
text: morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond
text: the tea leaves. Curious, he straightens, throwing the
text: withered bunch of leaves the sink.
text: ZIAT approaches the irregular stucco paste around the
text: REPLACED STONES; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing
text: the paste is fresh.
text: BILLY snoring from fatigue. BELL wakes him quickly.
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Billy, wake up! They found it!
text: OFF there is a lot of SHOUTING downstairs.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BELL
dialog: Ziat!
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX.
text: He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches.
text: THE SINK. PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly
text: among themselves. ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS
text: rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the
speaker_heading: SHAFT.
text: BILLY's gaze shifts to ZIAT fixing all his hatred on him.
text: ZIAT grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked
text: like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Shut up!
text: They all fall immediately silent. HAMIDOU continues his
text: walk among them, bypassing:
text: MAX who shifts his gaze onto:
text: BILLY. HAMIDOU approaches, his eyes moving over BILLY
text: with contempt, and shifting him aside with the stick. To
text: him Billy is the same passive prisoner as before. He moves
text: on, shifting OTHERS aside and then stops at:
text: BELL. HAMIDOU swings his stick up slowly and taps him
text: lightly on the chest. BELL realizes and is afraid.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: No do! No do! I tell you I see
dialog: you again.. Finish!
text: He punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest
text: and he gestures to the GUARDS.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Take him!
text: BELL, already broken by bad beatings, shivers.
speaker_heading: BELL.
dialog: No! Oh no! No...
text: GUARDS grab him, hurry him out the Kogus behind HAMIDOU
text: BILLY holds himself rigid, trying not to break. Bell's
text: PROTESTS continue OFF.
text: MAX unable to contain his anger, strides right up to ZIAT,
text: collars him, livid.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You bastard! This time I'm gonna
dialog: kick your fucking brains all over
dialog: this kitchen!
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (calm)
dialog: Fine. Good. Man to man. We fight
dialog: now. And when finish I bring
dialog: Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq
dialog: ass.
text: MAX is about to swing when BILLY grabs him.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Max! Cool it!
dialog: (looking at Ziat
dialog: calmly)
dialog: Ziat's just doing his job.
text: ZIAT Glances from BILLY back to MAX fixing on him as BILLY
text: walks him away.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: MAX is at his BUNK that NIGHT; puts away the hypodermic
text: needle, stoned and speeding at the same time, smoking a
text: cigarette. BILLY inwardly tense, sits with his head in
text: his hands.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Bell's gonna talk. They got to
dialog: find out. Man, we gotta out.
text: Tears have formed in his eyes.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Goddamn Gastro's killing me. Making
dialog: me blind. Hey Billy!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (sympathetic)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I got some acid man. Maybe we can
dialog: drop some on the guards huh? In
dialog: their tea or something.
text: BILLY looks away, not even considering. But MAX is caught
text: up in the notion.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah I got it all worked out.
dialog: Billy, listen to me.
dialog: (looks at Billy,

speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Then we're outside the kogus.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: After we're outside the kogus?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh we... we...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
text: MAX clumsily brushes the burning ash off his shirt where
dialog: it's made a hole.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh shit! Oh Christ!
text: His eyes cloud with tears. He sits down, head between his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There just comes a time you know...
dialog: you know you're never going to git
dialog: it on.
text: Suddenly shifts mood again, stands, pulling out a SHIV,
text: resolute, eyes brightening.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's what I'm gonna do.
dialog: (giggles)
text: BILLY looks up wondering.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (crazily)
dialog: Cut his fucking throat.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh!
dialog: What do I got to lose. And I'd
dialog: really enjoy it.
text: Lurches against the bunk.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Max, sit down. You're in no shape
dialog: to kill anybody.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I want to cut his throat.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's already been cut.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Then I'll cut his balls off.
text: BILLY smiles, shakes his head, then:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If you really wanted to hurt Ziat
dialog: (pause)
text: MAX slumps back down on the bunk, suddenly tired of killing.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (reflective)
dialog: ...His money - steal that, you
dialog: steal his blood... Could you see
dialog: his face when everything he worked
dialog: so hard to get got snatched?
dialog: (plays with the
dialog: thought idly, then
dialog: shrugs)
dialog: If we knew where he hid it.
dialog: (waves it away)
dialog: Anyway, steal from him they'd pick
dialog: up the whole prison and shake it
dialog: sideways. We couldn't hide it
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (head bobbing now,
dialog: murmurs)
dialog: You know where it is?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (a vague grin)
dialog: I know where it is.
text: BILLY glances at him, not sure whether he heard.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: His money?
text: MAX gives him a goofy nod - and a grin. Imitating Robert
dialog: Newton as Long John Silver.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'...
dialog: I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking
text: looks at it late at night, talking
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (beginning to believe
dialog: him)
dialog: Yeah? Where?
text: MAX, distracted, let's his attention wander back. Inaudible
text: his head bobbing now.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hishradyo.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Max - where?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (his mouth hanging
dialog: open, eyes closed)
text: His radio Back of his open, radio...
text: He lurches over gently on the bunk.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's why he never plays it...
dialog: 
text: MAX Sleeps.
text: BILLY surprised, then reflective.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE BACK OF THE RADIO is unscrewed; the cover pulled off.
speaker_heading: EMPTY!
text: MOVE TO ZIAT. The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock,
text: anger, fear. ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek
dialog: widow and:
text: BEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out
text: of the KOGUS wailing, moaning.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE SECOND STORY KOGUS is being" controlled" by the GUARDS.
text: WIDE ANGLE reveals a circus of clockwork destruction as
text: the GUARDS, making abundant NOISE, systematically rip up
dialog: each bunk, locker, mattress, picture, book, etc., their
text: faces flushed with this opportunity for orgy.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE PRISONERS are lined up in the COURTYARD, each one being
text: body searched.Prominent are MAX and BILLY, looking up amused
dialog: at the
text: SECOND STORY WINDOWS - feathers from a mattress fly around.
text: ZIAT Briefly appears, his face at the window, looking at
text: the prisoners in the yard, frustrated.
text: HAMIDOU breaks apart a with his bare hands.
text: ZIAT is stripping MAX's possessions, sure he will find it
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: Down here!
text: Ziat springs up.
text: GUARD calling out from the STAIRS.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: We found it!
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: ZIAT leaning in CLOSE, OVER THE STOVE in the KITCHEN, framed
text: by GUARDS. It is the same crouched posture he always uses
text: to work the stove but now his eyes show complete despair
text: as he sees:
text: A THOUSAND SHREDS OF PAPER MONEY floating in his pots amid
text: his withered tea bags. From ashes to ashes and dust to
dialog: dust.
text: ZIAT folds his head into his hands, sobbing then wailing
dialog: very human, very sad.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: KITCHEN - NEGDIR an Arab, is now running the tea concession.
text: A jolly ebullient man. Pours a cup for MAX. Several OTHERS
text: are at the table.
speaker_heading: NEGDIR
dialog: (heavily accented
dialog: English)
dialog: ...He sell me tea business -
dialog: everything. No the same. Ziat
dialog: lose all...
dialog: (makes the gesture
dialog: towards the heart
dialog: and the gut, using
dialog: the Arabic word)
dialog: Heart! Soul!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He never had one.
speaker_heading: NEGDIR
text: Soon he go back streets Istanbul.
dialog: Thousand enemy. No money.
dialog: (makes throat cutting
dialog: gesture)
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'll drink to that.
dialog: (toasting with the
dialog: tea)
dialog: Just as:
text: ZIAT enters the kitchen; he eyes Max with hatred, sits at
text: the other TABLE and orders tea. Surprisingly, he is wearing
text: a suit and clean shirt-unlike his usual grimy appearance.
text: BILLY, looking shaken, enters the kitchen, glances at ZIAT
text: sits with MAX.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Just got some news on Bell.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Bad. Sent to the City Hospital.
text: They ruptured his hernia again.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (grim)
dialog: Oh shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I Guess he didn't talk...Poor
dialog: bastard.
text: BILLY glances over at:
text: ZIAT drinking tea.
speaker_heading: BILLY AND MAX
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why the suit?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Maybe he's changing jobs.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: SAYIM! SAYIM!
text: BILLY looks over to see:
text: HAMIDOU and a DOZEN GUARDS spreading through the KOGUS,
text: assembling everybody with shouts of "SAYIM!"
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE PRISONERS are lined up in ranks in the FIRST FLOOR
speaker_heading: KOGUS.
text: BILLY glancing at MAX next to him, wondering why.
text: HAMIDOU goes down the line, his FLUNKIES searching each
dialog: man.
text: A GUARD reaches into ZIAT'S pocket and comes out with a
text: matchbox. Yells to HAMIDOU who comes over.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (opening the matchbox)
dialog: Nebu?
text: MATCHBOX Containing a small amount of HASHISH.
text: HAMIDOU reaches over and pulls ZIAT out of the 'line
dialog: roughly.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Nebu?
text: Starts to slap him around.
text: BILLY glancing at MAX.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (worried)
dialog: What's going on? Maybe Ziat can't
dialog: pay off; Hamidou's taking it out
dialog: in trade.
text: HAMIDOU smashes ZIAT again, but pulls the punch.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Where did you get this hash?
text: Raises his arm again.
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: (cowering, pretending
dialog: fear)
dialog: From Max.
dialog: Point at:
text: MAX who stiffens, eyes like cracked eggs.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: You got to be kidding.
text: HAMIDOU peers at MAX, advances.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: What's happening with this hash?
text: Indicates the matchbox in his hand.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I didn't sell it to him. I don't
dialog: have anything to do with this,
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (leans closer)
dialog: I know your face. Where did you
dialog: get the hash?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (interrupting in
dialog: Turkish))
dialog: (He knows nothing about it. Ziat's
dialog: lying.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (turns on Billy, in
dialog: English)
dialog: You, goddamn you, shut up!
dialog: (Back to MAX)
dialog: Take him to the cellar)
text: GUARDS drag off.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Get out of here! He's lying! That
dialog: cock-sucker! Billy...?
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY sits on his his anger building, his imagination
text: running wild.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: MAX being dragged down a CORRIDOR by his feet. A SCREAM.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BELL, his features distorted, being carried into an
speaker_heading: AMBULANCE.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BELL, MAX and BILLY at the wall, digging together, MAX
text: hugging BELL the time they found the shaft.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: MAX twisting out of the grip of a GUARD and, grabbing the
text: glass from his smashed spectacles, he cuts deep into his
text: wrist. GUARDS grab him. A LOUD LAUGH OFF carrying over.
text: BILLY turning on his bunk to see:
text: ZIAT joking with TWO GUARDS as he enters the SECOND STORY.
text: The guards back down the stairs.
text: BILLY already in movement.
text: ZIAT, in his suit, collecting suitcase from his bunk,
text: preparing to leave.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
speaker_heading: ZIAT!
dialog: 
text: Turns and catches a FIST in the side of the face. Staggers
text: into a bunk.
text: BILLY, fists clenched, yells a string of Turkish curse
text: words at him:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Asina covacim, ipnave
dialog: pesankek...yosakt.
dialog: Lunges.
text: ZIAT is bulky, throws the smaller BILLY off and scrambles
text: past a bunk.
text: BILLY is up and after him. Jumps back as a SHIV cuts the
text: air in front of him. His side is cut.
text: ZIAT holding the shiv, feints, cursing BILLY in Turkish.
text: BILLY skips back, takes a MATTRESS off the bed and runs it
text: right into KNOCKING HIM AND THE WHOLE BUNK OVER.
text: THE TWO scramble around, BILLY tackling him into another
text: BUNK which also goes over. Chairs break.
text: ZIAT butts his head into BILLY'S jaw.
text: BILLY staggers back from the blow and ZIAT jumps him, BITING
text: into his ear.
text: ZIAT, getting a better hold, now BITES into BILLY'S NOSE.
text: BILLY slams ZIAT in the nose hard with the palm of his
text: hand. ZIAT relinquishes his hold, grabbing at his broken
text: bleeding nose.
text: BILLY beats him around the head but though the blood now
text: flows and teeth are broken, is like a clumsy bear, hard to
dialog: kill.
text: ZIAT scrambles away on his knees under another BUNK now
text: screaming as loud as he can.
speaker_heading: ZIAT
dialog: HELP ME! GUARDS! HELP ME!
text: SEVERAL PRISONERS watching from further down the SECOND
text: STORY Kogus now move in sync, turning on their RADIOS loud
text: as possible, drowning out the cries for help, others
text: watching the stairs.
text: BILLY takes the BUNK and throws it over, revealing ZIAT
text: cowering in pure terror. He grabs ZIAT by the hair, hauls
dialog: him up and
text: LAUNCHES HIS KNEE into HIS FACE.
text: ZIAT thuds onto the floor.
text: BILLY stomps him in the gut hard.
text: ZIAT screams unnaturally shrill.
text: BILLY, driven by supernatural anger, now jumps on him and
text: CLAMPS HIS MOUTH right on ZIAT'S open SCREAM.
text: A STRUGGLING KISS ensues.
text: BILLY pulls back, his mouth filled with blood, spitting
dialog: out.
text: AN UNIDENTIFIED PIECE OF FLESH which Bits the ground with
text: an odd slow motion grace.
text: ZIAT - CLOSE in terror; throat cords rippling; eyes bulging
text: with disbelief, body quivering, mouth open and screaming,
text: but it is a SILENT SCREAM and the mouth is a dark hole
text: filled with blood and without a TONGUE.
text: BILLY, without a moment's mercy, crashes his fist into
text: ZIAT'S face.
text: ZIAT his strength now broken, collapses on his back.
text: BILLY crashes his fist again into the hated face. He is
text: GRABBED now by a GUARD, but:
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY shakes the GUARD OFF, then as ANOTHER
text: GUARD runs up, BILLY SLAMS him aside and, obsessed, lunges
text: back down on ZIAT and
text: BOTH HANDS CLAMPED TOGETHER high in the air delivers a
text: final blow to ZIAT'S face. The bones shatter. Pause. His
text: ogre unconscious beneath him, BILLY, now in SLOW MOTION,
text: EXTENDS HIS ARMS IN THE AIR - in the fighter's victory
text: gesture, and his eyes glow with the fever in them, and
text: with his mouth and face bloodied, he looks like a savage.
dialog: No longer Billy Hayes.
speaker_heading: SHARP CUT:
text: BILLY bound in a thick leather belt (a kiyis) which screws
text: tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together,
text: is being HAULED in continuing SLOW MOTION through a huge
text: DOOR somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the
text: prison.The door is approximately NINE FEET by SIX FEET,
text: strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of
text: the GUARDS now pulls open; a GLIMPSE of darkness within.
scene_heading: THE DOOR CLOSES. SUPERIMPOSE:
scene_heading: SECTION 13 - ASYLUM FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
speaker_heading: A YEAR LATER
text: MAX, barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a
text: blackened face, comes rushing into a crowded ROOM, screaming
text: louder than any other inmate. marks on his face, He is
text: enraged, blood dripping from scratch ATTENDANTS in white
text: smocks chase him over the beds. Max is yelling in Turkish.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Please, will you listen to me?
dialog: Will someone please listen to me?
dialog: JUST LISTEN To ME!
speaker_heading: ATTENDANTS
dialog: Hamidou! Get Hamidou! Get the
dialog: Kiyisl!
text: The ATTENDANTS wrestle with him, but he throws them off,
text: tearing around the room mindlessly. In the process we see
dialog: that not much attention is paid him because everybody else
text: is crazy! There are 50 other LUNATICS yelling at each
text: other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes,
text: jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to
text: themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing. Several
text: of them (the craziest) are stark naked. some, wrapped in
text: torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets,
text: sharp eyes open for anything they can steal. Others move
text: in meaningless, blank-eyed silence. The walls are filthy
text: black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles,
text: giving the look of an old dungeon. Fifty beds are lined up
dialog: right next to each other so that you walk right into your
text: bed. A constant nerve-racking NOISE.
dialog: 
text: HAMIDOU bursts into the ROOM, the angry look in his eyes
text: spelling real trouble for Max. MOVE with him as he sweep
text: sin on MAX and picks him up with one move and SMASHES HIM
text: against the wall. Max hardly notices.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the leather kiyis from an
text: ATTENDANT, moves in on MAX and starts clamping it around
dialog: him.
text: AN ATTENDANT walks through the room with an apron containing
text: several large pockets bulging with red, green, blue, white
text: PILLS, which he distributes by the handful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: (crying out)
dialog: Hop! Hop! Hop! Full moon. Hop!
dialog: Hop! Hop!
text: THE LUNATICS gobble them up as if they were candy. In some
text: of the clustered areas, nine lunatics occupy as little as
dialog: three beds.
text: MAX is tightly bound now by HAMIDOU, but his body arches
text: against the bindings, his neck straining, his teeth snapping
text: at the air. HAMIDOU grabs him with one hand by the leather
text: waist, hauls him high up in the air and
dialog: 
text: THROWS MAX half-ways across the room, MAX smashing heavily
text: against some beds, continuing to SCREAM OFF as:
text: THE ATTENDANT with the pills-now bypasses BILLY on one of
dialog: the beds.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Hop! Hop! Full Moon - take your
dialog: pills!
text: BILLY gobbles them up. He has changed. Lines in his face.
text: No smile, no sense of humor; a brooding silence about him,
text: a straight ahead look. He pays no attention to MAX off; he
text: is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals. Rolls back
text: onto hi&amp; bed with its filthy torn sheet, totally ignoring
text: the surrounding commotion, and
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - turning onto his shoulder, BILLY suddenly
text: finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage.
text: The MAN is very young and stark naked but for an old black
text: rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin.
text: His eyes are yellow, the voice pleading.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Cigare?
dialog: (pause, same tone,
text: holds out his palm)
dialog: Cigare? Cigare?
text: BILLY shakes his head sharply --too sharply --and barks,
dialog: irritable.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Go away!
text: Turns on his other shoulder, trying to sleep.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (OFF)
dialog: Cigare? Cigare?
text: YOUNG MAN in a surprisingly meek tone.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: S'il Vous plait, Monsieur? S'il
dialog: vous plait?
text: BILLY, really aggravated now, springs up from the bed, and
text: in the quirky way the mad and the eccentric adopt walks
text: determinedly away from the young man, looking back to shake
text: his head bizarrely at him one more time.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: BILLY walking down the aisle bypasses MAX int he kiyis,
text: rolling on the floor, still screaming in Turkish.
speaker_heading: MAX
scene_heading: Will you listen to me? PLEASE LISTEN
dialog: TO ME!
text: Several LUNATICS are gathered around tormenting him, one
text: of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber;
text: another is playing with his ass. A third one, also in a
text: leather kiyis, is leaning over MAX jabbering and drooling
text: into his face.
text: MAX, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences,
text: lunges up sharply and bites the man's FACE. SCREAMS, etc.
text: BILLY, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested
dialog: glance, keeps going into:
text: A SECOND ROOM. MORE LUNATICS. A screaming OLD MAN is
text: chasing after another OLD MAN who has stolen his tespe
text: beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls
text: with rage, frantic to have his beads back. The second old
text: man throws the beads to a THIRD OLD MAN who hops across
text: the beds with the FIRST OLD MAN chasing him. BILLY
dialog: intersects.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Allah! Allah! Yok! Yok! Yok!
dialog: Brack!
dialog: 
text: A LITTLE NERVOUS MAN stares into a broken pocket mirror
text: fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying
text: to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous
dialog: motion.
text: TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a
text: newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out
dialog: the paper.
text: CHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of
text: movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left-
text: overs. AD LIB curses, yells.
text: AN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Hey American. Fik! Fick! Come.
dialog: Fik! Fik!
text: His blackened teeth leer.
text: BILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private
text: island of his own madness, walks in his determined way
dialog: past a PARTITION to:
text: A CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones
text: damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight-
dialog: ahead determination to:
text: A LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost
text: childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks
text: the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL.
text: It is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing
text: the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS
text: trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow.
text: It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding
text: easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging
text: loosely on the floor, watching:
text: THE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace.
text: These are the spokes of the wheel.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: TWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination
text: to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers,
text: etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange
dialog: glow.
text: SOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove. OTHERS
text: are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs
text: the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered
text: with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks.
text: But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They
text: are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left.
dialog: They are the damned.
text: BILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin
text: cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up
text: alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about
text: fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane
text: than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his
text: wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it
text: have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English
dialog: accent.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: You're an American?
text: BILLY is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground.
text: AHMET doesn't wait for an answer.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: Ah yes, America! My name is Ahmet.
dialog: I studied philosophy at Harvard
dialog: for many many years. But actually
dialog: Oxford is my real Alma Mata -
dialog: I've also studied in Vienna. Now I
dialog: study here.
text: BILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: ...They put me here. They say I
dialog: raped a little boy. I have been
dialog: here very long time. They will
dialog: never let me go.
text: BILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on. Glances at
text: him, smiles.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: They won't let YOU go either.
text: The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep
text: inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic
text: who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: No, they'll never let you go.
dialog: They tell you they let you go but
dialog: you stay. You never go from here.
text: BILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation
text: like a father lecturing a child.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: You see we all come from a factory.
dialog: Sometimes the factory makes bad
dialog: machines that don't work. They put
dialog: them here. The bad machines don't
dialog: know they're bad machines, but the
dialog: people at the factory know. They
dialog: know one of the machines that
dialog: doesn't work...
text: They walk on. Ahmet's expression changes.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: (polite)
dialog: I think we have spoken enough for
dialog: today. I say good night to you.
text: He wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we
text: FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and
text: knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy
text: blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing
text: like a cockroach.
text: BILLY plods on.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: AN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his
text: rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his
text: followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or
text: newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving
text: at each other during the prayer.
text: TWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and
text: bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in
text: a ball of arms and legs.
text: A FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills
text: room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from
text: day because there are no windows.
text: ATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their "clubs.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANTS
dialog: Head count! Head count!
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: A MASS OF LUNATICS in the ROOM all at once. Attendants
text: take a redundant and comic head count. The place sounds
text: like a "yadi yadi room" the noise fearsome.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT #1
dialog: Sixty two, sixty three, sixty
dialog: four....
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT #2
dialog: Seventy four, seventy five, seventy
dialog: six.. .get back there, you! . . .
dialog: seventy five, seventy six....)
text: ATTENDANTS poke around underneath a bed and pull out a
text: very old trembling VEGETABLE.
text: OTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth
text: and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him
dialog: away.
text: BILLY amid the LUNATICS. We MOVE closer and closer to
text: him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a
text: torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on
dialog: Billy.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY is led down a CORRIDOR by HAMIDOU into:
text: A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow wooden
text: phone booths.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Kabin on-yedi
text: BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes
text: the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits -
text: indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes
text: separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the
text: panes. An erratic microphone is the method of
text: communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the
dialog: voice.
text: HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks
dialog: in unseen as:
text: TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in
text: holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for
text: her to react, and then her face shows the shock.
text: BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he
text: remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is
text: a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at
text: once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (OFF)
dialog: Oh my God...!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Billy, what have they done to
dialog: you...my God!
text: The MICROPHONE makes her voice jarring, gagged. She looks
text: silently. No sobbing, no big sad looks. Just shock. Shock
text: of recognition, shock of time gone by.
text: BILLY looking at her, his eyes moving down to:
text: BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN, her neck, her breasts straining
text: against the thin shirt.
text: SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and
text: distinct; not sure she is communicating.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...Billy, your family is fine.
dialog: Senator Buckley just made a special
dialog: plea on your behalf in the Senate.
dialog: Newsday has written several big
dialog: articles about you. They've called
dialog: you a pawn in the poppy game between
dialog: Nixon and the Turks. The letters
dialog: are coming in, Billy. People
dialog: care....
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stops, shakes her head. It sounds all wrong in this context.
text: BILLY is still staring at her breasts. He hasn't seen a
text: woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes
text: into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the
dialog: glass, rabid. And in Turkish:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (in Turkish)
dialog: Take it off. Take it off!
dialog: (then remembering
dialog: the English)
dialog: Take it off. Take it off!
text: His voice is savage, demanding.
text: SUSAN understands, startled. Looks around.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Billy - you'll just make yourself
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Take it off! Take it off!
text: (suddenly in a very
dialog: soft voice)
dialog: ...S'il vous plait?...
text: A strange look in his eye.
text: SUSAN slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt.
text: HAMIDOU looks on silently, does nothing.
text: BILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust.
text: SUSAN leans up close to the window. With both hands on
text: the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart.
text: BILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in his
dialog: pyjamas.
text: HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a
text: deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and
scene_heading: loose. FULL SCREEN
scene_heading: BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN.
text: BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly.
text: SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh Billy, Billy, I wish I could
dialog: make it better for you. Please
dialog: don't... don't...
text: Tears. Fear.
text: BILLY tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants,
text: slumps against the window.
text: SUSAN realizes he has come, surprised.
text: BILLY looks at her. Furtive, animal shame. And suddenly he
text: starts to cry. A flood of feelings locked up too long come
text: pouring out. He murmurs some words, Turkish SOUNDS
text: sputtering out in his throat, then:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: S.... Susan?
text: Softly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak.
text: SUSAN yearning. Tears sprinkling her eyes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes, Billy?
text: BILLY straining, not out of physical weakness but an
text: emotional one. Sputters, eyes closed.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ...I love you....
dialog: It sounds pathetic, lost.
text: SUSAN is worked up to the limit, tries to hug him through
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh Billy... Billy! Don't give up.
dialog: Please don't give up. You'll get
dialog: out. I know you will!
text: Remembers something. Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her
text: strength, holding it up for him to see through the
text: glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to
dialog: make sure they're alone and in a contained voice:
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Billy, your father gave me this
dialog: for you. There's pictures of your
dialog: Mom and Dad...Rob...Peg...
text: BILLY looks at it listlessly.
text: HIS P.V.O - SUSAN holding the album open to PICTURES of
text: his MOTHER and FATHER in front of the house, ROB on a
text: bicycle, PEG in her cheer-leading outfit.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And there's pictures in the back
dialog: of your old Mr. Franklin. Remember
dialog: him... From the bank?
text: A certain tone slips into her voice.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He's over in Greece now. He bought
dialog: a ticket.
text: BILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a
text: gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint.
text: An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Visiting is over.
text: SUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden
dialog: weapon.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'll give it to them for you.
text: She buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on Billy.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You were right Billy don't count
dialog: on them, you hear, don't count on
dialog: anybody but yourself!
dialog: 
text: The ATTENDANT now swings open her door, annoyed.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Let's go!
text: Susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to
text: the bars, hard and practical.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: If you stay you'll die Billy! Get
dialog: out of here. Get to Greece, you
dialog: hear me?...Billy?
text: Pause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't
text: think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned.
text: BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door.
text: A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy
dialog: towards
text: A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her
text: arm. The door closes.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes
text: down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and
text: the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar
text: a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he
text: starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the
text: normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are
text: walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for
text: him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking.
text: BILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter-
text: clockwise They motion for him to turn.
speaker_heading: LUNATIC
dialog: (grunting)
dialog: Gower!
text: Tries to block Billy's way, but BILLY shakes his head,
text: brushes by him - determined.
dialog: 
text: AHMET Slides up next to BILLY in his rags.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: Good morning, my American friend!
dialog: There will be trouble if you go
dialog: this way. A good Turk always walks
text: to the right. Left is communist.
dialog: Right is good. You must go the
dialog: other way... It's Good.
dialog: 
text: More LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY.
text: BILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in
text: the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he
text: walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs.
text: AHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: Why you go? Why don't you walk
dialog: the wheel with us?
dialog: (suspiciously leaning
dialog: forward, suddenly
dialog: realizing the answer)
dialog: The bad machine doesn't know he's
dialog: a bad machine. You still don't
dialog: believe it? You still don't believe
dialog: you're a bad machine?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET at the base of the
text: STAIRS. BILLY carries on up the stairs.
speaker_heading: AHMET
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: To know oneself is to know God, my
dialog: friend. The factory knows. That's
dialog: why they put you here. You'll see.
dialog: You'll find out. Later on you'll
dialog: know.
text: BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET. His eyes glint
text: with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his
text: confidence using the latter's tone of voice:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I already know. I know that you're
dialog: a bad machine. That's why the
dialog: factory keeps you here.
dialog: (Lowers s voice)
dialog: You know how I know? I know because
dialog: I'm from the factory. I make the
dialog: machines.. I'm here to spy on you.
text: Eyes narrow. Surprise. Fear. He shuffles away.
text: BILLY looks at him and turns up the STAIRS.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by
text: with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Hop! Hop! Take!
text: He takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows.
text: Reflective, unsure. A RADIO playing OFF blares suddenly
text: with the U.S. Armed Forces Station - JANIS JOPLIN singing
dialog: "Take another piece of my heat now, Baby" then it's switched
text: back to a TURKISH STATION, loud. Billy rises.
text: BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly
text: clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy.
text: Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNATIC
text: shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partitioned
text: HOLES cut into the floor.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy
text: long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the
text: album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up
dialog: absently.
text: THREE LUNATIC FACES stare in at him through wooden slats,
text: tongues hanging out and drooling - playing with themselves -
speaker_heading: OFF.
text: BILLY makes a lunatic face and SCREAM kicking at the
dialog: partition.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
text: THE LUNATICS, petrified, scatter off but ONE LUNATIC skids
text: in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling.
text: BILLY slits open the binder to reveal TEN HUNDRED DOLLAR
text: BILLS with Pictures of Mr. Franklin' neatly inserted.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: BILLY has no particular expression on his face. Reflective,
text: staring at the money; he looks up.
text: A LARGE SILHOUETTE is moving towards him.
text: BILLY just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the
dialog: money.
text: HAMIDOU comes into a faint light, looking down at him;
text: glances at the money. Shakes his head gently.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: No do! No do!
dialog: Reaches for and:
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the money from BILLY like
text: candy from a baby, then takes him by the ear and slowly
text: lifts him up. Billy is like a vegetable in his hands.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (in his broken
dialog: English)
dialog: I tell you I see 'gain...
dialog: (into Turkish)
dialog: I take you down to bath and your
dialog: feet be big like...Breasts
dialog: (a gesture)
text: HAMIDOU leads BILLY roughly out of the lunatic room, pulling
text: him by the ear.
text: HAMIDOU still Pulling BILLY by the ear, guides him through
text: the GUARD QUARTERS.
text: HAMIDOU leads him up a narrow winding flight of STAIRS.
speaker_heading: HAMIDO
dialog: First you make mistake with Ziat,
dialog: now you make mistake with money.
dialog: You're not a new Prisoner, Vilyum
dialog: Hi-yes.
text: The tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this
dialog: time.
text: HAMIDOU pulls BILLY by the ear into a large echoing BATH.
text: BILLY looking, bent over by the ear - a hint of awareness
text: of new surroundings.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - the BATH is deserted, spooky with greenish
text: Yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling
text: around damp mossy arches. Steam rises off a bath. Benches,
text: buckets of water. HAMIDOU swings BILLY around until he is
text: facing him.
text: HAMIDOU makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his
text: falaka stick and holstered gun; he will use his hands.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: You've been in prison too long,
dialog: Vilyum Hi-yes.
text: He takes that: stiff arm all the way back to its full arc
text: and WHACKS BILLY up against the wall.
text: BILLY bounces back off the wall. The print of Hamidou's
text: fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the
text: redness of his left cheek. SLAM - a backhanded whack.
dialog: 
text: BILLY bounces right back from the wall. steadies him.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: You go crazy here Vilyum Hi-yes.
dialog: Many people go crazy here. Best
dialog: thing for crazy people is this...
text: THE BLOW, in SLOW MOTION comes sailing into:
text: BILLY, and we see the brief boxer's distortion of all his
text: face as he flies upwards and back into:
text: THE BENCH smashing it. Echo like jarring F.X.
text: BILLY is held up by the PAJAMAS, steadied. The Turkish
text: words seem far away, incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU (OFF)
dialog: Vilyum Hi-yes. You die here, Hi-
dialog: yes.
scene_heading: WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW, but:
text: HAMIDOU this time holds onto the pajamas using Billy like
text: a punching bag.
scene_heading: WHACK - A REVERSE BLOW.
text: HAMIDOU increasingly excited.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: Babba sikijam! I fuck your mother,
dialog: I fuck your sister...
scene_heading: WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW in SLOW MOTION
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: ...I fuck your father, I fuck your
dialog: brother...
text: RIP! - a loud SOUND as HAMIDOU moves with a blur of speed,
text: and shreds BILLY's pajamas with his hands.
text: BILLY naked, totally passive, semiconscious. HAMIDOU
text: suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous
text: wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He
text: loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back.
text: HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited.
speaker_heading: HAMIDOU
dialog: ...And I fuck your grandmother and
dialog: I fuck your pretty girlfriend...
dialog: And I fuck you Hi-yes!)
text: A bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy
text: through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the
text: sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam
text: bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises,
dialog: moves off as:
text: BILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest,
text: gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up
dialog: horrified at:
text: HAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor.
text: SSSSSSSSSS! The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into
text: every cranny of the little room.
text: BLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge
text: muscular flash of chest,
text: A BELT being snapped open.
text: BILLY waiting.
text: A FIGURE moving through the steam, closer.
text: BILLY backing away from it.
text: STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through. HAMIDOU - his
text: eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun
text: cutting haze. Then disappear again.
text: BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse. Then
dialog: very suddenly:
text: A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the
text: hair. A GRUNT, OFF.
text: BILLY his eyes moving fast.
text: A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting
text: forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from
text: the rest of the body.
text: A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it
text: jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then:
dialog: 
text: BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation
text: distorting his features and:
dialog: 
text: STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION
dialog: and:
text: SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP.
scene_heading: BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE -
dialog: surprise, pain...
scene_heading: BILLY MOVING.
text: A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again
text: with the genitals. Another SCREAM.
text: A BODY hitting the tiles.
text: BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it.
dialog: 
text: A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming
text: now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another
text: thwack! The steam seems to clear and
text: BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with
text: the falaka stick with all his might.
dialog: 
text: HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding.
text: His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and
text: strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face,
text: such is the force of this creature but continues to beat
text: him, harder, harder. His expression filled with a life
text: energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost.
dialog: Again, Again -
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Babba sikijam, Hamidu! I fuck your
dialog: Mother, I fuck your daughter, I
dialog: fuck your sons, I fuck your wife!
text: The BAND slips from his throat, then springs up desperately
text: again and clenches Billy's whole face with one gigantic
text: palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away.
text: BILLY beats on - again, again.
text: BLOOD flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY opens a door gently, moves across an empty CORRIDOR,
text: dressed in and gun in intense. Hamidou's holster. large
text: uniform with his He looks shaken, weak, falaka stick dizzy
dialog: but
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: How about a shoe shine, friend?
text: BILLY starts, clenches the falaka stick ready to spring,
dialog: spins.
text: A LITTLE SHOESHINE BOY is his case down the corridor.
text: BILLY has not seen a child in a long time. get words out,
text: then manages: Surprised. Can't get the words out, then
dialog: manages:
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No!
text: THE KID shrugs, moves on, looking At Billy strangely.
text: BILLY goes up a flight of STAIRS. Ahead, VOICES passing.
text: He stops. Goes on.
text: BILLY goes through an empty GUARD QUARTERS.
text: BILLY is in another CORRIDOR, approaches
text: A SMALL PORTAL, daylight at its edges. Locked?
text: BILLY, tense, tries it. It swings open on:
dialog: DAYLIGHT!
text: BILLY squints. Adjusting to the harsh sensation.
scene_heading: AN ISTANBUL STREET - TRAFFIC, SOUNDS. TWO GUARDS
text: approaching the portal in the distance, drinking soda pop.
text: BILLY steps back, straightens his clothes, steps out briskly
dialog: and at such an angle that
text: THE TWO GUARDS don't notice him in the traffic as they
text: enter the open portal.
text: LONG SHOT - BILLY walking down the street, looking back,
text: almost bewildered, not quiet believing this.
speaker_heading: CUT:
scene_heading: TIGHT - RAILROAD TICKET being stamped. SOUND - SNAP.
text: MOVE UP to TICKET CLERK behind a grill.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OFF)
dialog: Edirne to Uzun Kopru?
text: THE CLERK looks puzzled.
text: BILLY is on the other side of the grill. A ill-fitting
text: new Western style suit, a hat over his dyed black hair;
text: totally paranoid. He hasn't slept in three days and the
text: bruises from the Hamidou beating now show clearly black
text: and blue on his face. His eyes are alert, darting around,
text: his speech clipped and to the point.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What's the matter?
text: THE CLEF!! Shrugs.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: 'What are you crazy? There's no
dialog: train anymore to Uzun Kopru, it'd
dialog: have to go through Greece. The
dialog: border's closed.
text: BILLY taken by surprise.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No train?
speaker_heading: CLERK (OFF)
dialog: No more train.
text: BILLY Moves off a small provincial RAILROAD DEPOT - DAY.
text: He looks at the:
scene_heading: EMPTY TRACKS - No 'midnight express'.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a
text: newspaper at an OUTDOOR STAND to study:
scene_heading: THE MAIN SQUARE of the VILLAGE (EDIRNE) - DAY. SOLDIERS
text: and POLICE are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks
text: and half-tracks. Mountains can be seen in the far distance.
text: BILLY camouflages his face as best he can in the Newspaper
dialog: "Hurriyet" studying:
text: CABDRIVERS in the Main Square. Most of them are older,
text: grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty
text: cabs talking with stray SOLDIERS. Billy's eyes settle on a
text: YOUNGER DRIVER with longish hair, possibly an ally.
text: BILLY glances down at his newspaper as a SOLDIER intersects
text: and his expression goes stony as he sees:
text: FULL COLOR DRAWING (first page) of a ridiculously fierce
text: heavy-muscled barechested MAN beating a facsimile of Hamidou
text: into the ground. Next to it a blurry badly reproduced
text: photograph of BILLY with a superimposed GUN in his hand.
dialog: You can't really tell it's him.
text: BILLY, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into
text: a baton, his eyes everywhere. Be the darting A crosses
dialog: square.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, intersecting a POLICEMAN who glances
text: at him, joins the YOUNG CABDRIVER..
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Listen, I have Swedish friends
dialog: camping south of the town. I was
dialog: supposed to meet them here this
dialog: morning but I was late. Can you
dialog: take me there?
text: DRIVER looks at him neutral.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: You know where they are?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (anxious to get in
dialog: the cab)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: How far?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (impatient)
text: About ten kilometers.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Sixty Lira?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Sixty?
dialog: Billy eyes:
scene_heading: APPROACHING SOLDIERS.
speaker_heading: BILLY (OFF)
dialog: Okay.
text: THE DRIVER, noticing Billy's look at the soldiers, gets in
dialog: the cab.
text: BILLY climbs into the back seat, feeling already he has
dialog: made a mistake. There is something too alert, too hard in
dialog: this young driver.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: BILLY P.O.V. - THE MOUNTAINS as they roll in the taxi.
scene_heading: FORESTS - FIELDS.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR TAXI
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Those mountains? are they?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: (Greece

dialog: again
dialog: (pause))
dialog: How'd you lose your friends?
text: BILLY leaning back in his seat, casual.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Oh, I drank a lot of raka last
dialog: night in Istanbul. Got into a fight.
text: Indicates the bruises on his face.
text: DRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity
dialog: narrowing.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: How come you speak Turkish so good?
text: BILLY casually glances out the window.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Did twenty months in prison in
dialog: Istanbul. Hash
text: THE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: You want to score some? Cheap?
text: BILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (curt)
dialog: No!
text: Cutting off further conversation, he looks out at:
text: THE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing.
text: BILLY stares back at:
text: THE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view
text: mirror under the pressure of the stare. SOUND OFF loud
dialog: machinery.
text: BILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK
text: pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for
text: the cabdriver to get out of the way.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER
text: slows down, with a curse.
text: BILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow
text: THE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past.
text: BILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief.
speaker_heading: CUT:
text: THE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road.
text: BILLY has his MAP out, studying it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The Maritas River? Where is it?
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Two miles! Minefields over there.
dialog: Do you know where this campground
dialog: is or not?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Not far. Just a little way.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: No! I'm not going any further!
dialog: It'll wreck my car.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'll pay extra
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: How much?
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER
text: takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into
dialog: gear.
text: THE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS.
scene_heading: INTERIOR CAB - very bumpy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Where are the minefields?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
text: All over. Turkish Army up there.
dialog: It's against the law. They shoot

speaker_heading: BILLY(VERY SHARP NOW)
dialog: (very sharp now)
dialog: Okay! Ley me out right here. I'm

speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: (looks back, then
text: ahead, suddenly
dialog: brightening)
dialog: Ah, look! they probably know where
dialog: the campers are
text: BILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over.
text: A TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track,
text: with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE.
text: Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks
text: his horn on the approach.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hey officer, we're looking for the
dialog: campground. Do you know where it
dialog: is?
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering
text: over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (curt)
dialog: You're not supposed to be here
speaker_heading: DRIVER

text: at the campground.
scene_heading: FIRST POLICEMAN glances BILLY
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Campground?

dialog: Never heard of one.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Seen any Swedish foreigners in a
dialog: camper-bus?
text: SECOND POLICEMAN meanwhile eases his arm down on the OPEN
text: WINDOW bringing BILLY into foreground. The COP'S mouth is
text: open and exhaling a wave of beer breath over-BILLY.
text: BILLY P.O.V. - BEER FACE FOCUS PAST him to SOLDIER at tank
text: reading "Hurriyet" - the picture of BILLY on page one,

speaker_heading: BEER FACE
dialog: Noldu?
text: DRIVER turning around to address him.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Seen any foreigners in a camper

text: SOLDIER circles the cab from the other side.
text: BILLY motions to the DRIVER.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay, they haven't seen him, let's
dialog: go back to town, it's getting late.
text: THE DRIVER ignores it. Calls out again, louder to BEER
speaker_heading: FACE.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
scene_heading: Foreigners! KAMPER. VOLKSWAGEN
dialog: BILLY rigid. This asshole of a driver!
text: BEER FACE glances at BILLY, pulls his head out the window.
text: Looks down the road. Takes a sip of beer.
text: SOLDIER, disinterested, moves back towards the tank.
text: BEER FACE looks in the other direction down the road,
text: burps.Very conscious of his authority, shakes his head
text: without looking at the driver. Moves away.
text: BILLY nudges the DRIVER.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay, let's go.
text: THE DRIVER impatiently turns and looks straight at BILLY,
text: aware of his anxiety.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Is no Volkswagen, man! Something
dialog: wrong with you?
text: BILLY hardening.
text: DRIVER calling out.
text: BEER FACE turns.
text: DRIVER leans out the window.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: This guy's fishy...I think he might

speaker_heading: DRIVER
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: I don't know, there's

text: BILLY all business, very quiet.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Get out -- right now, move!
text: BEER-FACE advancing looks puzzled, thinks he sees something,
text: then crouches as:
text: DRIVER gets out the door crouching, yells.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: He's got a gun!
text: BILLY firing SHOTS off to distract them has climbed over
text: the front seat, jams the cab into gear. It stalls! Again
text: he tries, and now shoots off.
text: THE CAB Roars past the roadblock.
text: THE COPS AND SOLDIER, scattered by the shots, now scream
text: at each other. They run. SHOTS are fired.
text: BILLY guns the cab down the road, flying.
text: CLOUDS OF DUST trail the cab.
text: THE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK
text: follows, the MEN riding it shouting.
text: BILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something.
text: P.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK.
dialog: BILLY decides, then -

text: SHOTS whistling towards him from the poppy field.
text: TURKISH OFFICER screaming angrily at Billy, cursing, shaking
text: his fist at the sky.
text: BILLY, in the forest, is totally out of breath and out of
text: eyesight of the pursuers. He stops against a tree. FROG
text: SOUNDS. The gurgle of water. Muddy ground. He looks:
text: THE MARITAS RIVER rushing ahead. A strong current.
text: BILLY peels off all his clothing except his pants, not
text: delaying one more moment. He feels he must keep going. And
text: he's right. DOGS are barking OFF.

text: dizzy. Falls. Struggles up again. Looks back. Must keep
dialog: going. Must.
text: THE BASE OF' MOUNTAIN - hilly, rugged.
text: BILLY runs, drags, runs again. He is a lamentable sight -
text: naked except for ripped wet pants, barefoot, bleeding,
text: muddied. Dimly he makes out:
text: A FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT. Some cows, goats, chickens. NO
text: sign of people.
text: BILLY staggers towards it. Wears something. A rooting SOUND.
text: Stops. Something familiar about it.
text: A FAMILY OF PIGS snort and root in the mud, little piglets

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Pigs... You... Beautiful...
text: BILLY BILLY falls to his knees in the confined pen; the

text: his muddy eyes over his shoulder.
