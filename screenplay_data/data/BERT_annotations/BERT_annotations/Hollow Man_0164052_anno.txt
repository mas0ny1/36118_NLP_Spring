speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: On complete darkness.
text: A SMALL DOOR swings open.
text: A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the
text: length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a
text: gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the
text: frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind
text: it. The rat's stark white fur bristles and it begins to
text: pad down the tube's length.
text: After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit
text: cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
text: The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s
dialog: ears.
text: The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a
text: door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
text: The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
text: The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger,
text: but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on
text: the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and
text: dashes toward it.
text: But an invisible force descends.
text: The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its
text: body, crushing it.
text: A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air,
text: halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes,
text: struggling against the unholy force.
text: Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life
text: quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
text: The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white
text: fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
text: HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked
text: ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into
dialog: the rat.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: In the background we hear Jay Leno's monologue from the
text: Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer
text: screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with
text: the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry
text: framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips
text: coffee from an Einstein coffee mug. He peers at a
text: complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his
text: screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts
text: slightly, then falls apart.
text: Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the
text: cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard
text: with renewed vigor.
text: Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian's
text: fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on
text: and off, it trembles and twists apart.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Damnit.
text: Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a
text: light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a
text: BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her
text: living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses
text: it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to
text: the window, getting interested. But when the brunette
text: reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window
text: and lowers her shades.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont d)
dialog: Damnit.
text: Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes.
text: He's obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at
text: the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big
text: red letters is a brief reminder - You Should Be
text: Working. Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins
text: pecking away again.
speaker_heading: LATER:
text: The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm
text: clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his
dialog: computer.
text: He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away
text: again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
text: He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule.
dialog: Nothing happens.
text: He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a
dialog: reaction.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am a goddamn genius.
text: He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on
text: the screen. He dials.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Digital phone rings.
text: In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a
text: deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her
text: desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
text: The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse
text: around and her screen comes to life. She click on a
text: telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later,
text: Sebastian appears in a window on her screen.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian, do you know what time it
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
dialog: You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it
dialog: was waste of time.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What is it this time?
scene_heading: INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM
text: Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer
text: window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the
text: young man sleeping face down.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Who's that?
text: Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer
text: screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Not your business. Not anymore.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Touche.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: So you calling about anything in
dialog: particular, or were you just hoping to
dialog: catch me sleeping in the nude?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I cracked the reversion.
text: Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You cracked it?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Look at this.
text: Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the
text: molecular structure appears on Linda's computer.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Watch this.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: 91% sure.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: Eleven months with no progress and you
text: suddenly come up with it out of the
dialog: blue? How?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
text: The usual. Coffee and twinkies.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I hate you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know. You think you could hunt down
dialog: Matt and get to the lab early. I want
text: Isabelle prepped for a live test.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Yeah, I think I can find him. What are
dialog: you going to do?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Well y know. It's daylight in
dialog: Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
dialog: Committee and tell them to get our
dialog: prizes ready. See you in a few.
text: ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda
text: crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Hey... come on.
text: DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under
dialog: sheets.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian just called. We gotta get to
dialog: the lab.
text: Matt bolts up.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit! You didn t tell him I was here,
dialog: did you?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Give me some credit, will ya.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So what's the rush?
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He cracked reversion.
text: Matt pulls his jeans on.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Wanna ride down?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We better take our own cars.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You re gonna have to tell him about us
dialog: eventually.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I know. It s just You re his best
dialog: friend. He ll feel betrayed.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY
text: From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in
text: the harsh light of morning.
text: CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security
text: fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is
text: surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
text: The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight
text: into the warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY
text: The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space
text: and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts,
text: and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the
text: lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the
text: warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: Morning, sir.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Morning, Ed.
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: Your team s in early. Something
dialog: special going on?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.
text: Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A
text: laser reads his print.
scene_heading: Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN
scene_heading: Clearance: ALPHA ALPHA THREE
speaker_heading: Division:	CLASSIFIED
text: The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: Have a good day, sir.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian
text: taps in his floor code.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR (V.0.)
dialog: Authorization please.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Caine zero zero two seven.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR (V.0.)
dialog: Authorization verified. Good morning,
dialog: Dr. Caine.
text: The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes
text: below us and keeps descending into the belly of the
text: earth, the shaft goes down forever.
scene_heading: INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
text: We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas
text: chambers. Each chamber looks as if it's tailored for a
text: specific animal, although no animals are visible.
text: As we pass one habitat, something slams into the
text: Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then
text: SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen
text: animal cries. THUMP.
speaker_heading: THUMP.
text: The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry
text: animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals
text: are seen.
text: Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES
text: revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but
text: they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a
text: sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly
text: empty cage.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Isabelle ...
text: The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the
text: Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The
text: Plexiglas begins to shake violently.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont d)
dialog: Calm down baby. Calm down. It s
dialog: okay...
text: Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and
text: pulls them down over his eyes.
text: THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in
text: shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the
text: Plexiglas door and reaches inside.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont d)
dialog: It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not
dialog: going to hurt you. Come here.
text: THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs
text: hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt
text: reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont d)
dialog: Just hold still.
text: Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin.
text: Blood erupts in a bite pattern.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont d)
dialog: Ow, shit.
text: Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies
text: open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see
text: the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns
text: around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt
text: pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the
dialog: Corridor.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: She bit me.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Yeah. She s become a lot more
dialog: aggressive in the last few days.
text: Linda takes the goggles from Matt.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont d)
dialog: Go take care of that bite. I ll get
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And give you a chance to pull ahead?
dialog: Never.
text: Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and
text: pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.
scene_heading: AROUND THE CORNER
text: A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us.
text: We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
text: Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a
text: haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed
text: though and something large and angry is throwing itself
text: against it. We can t see anything.
text: A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner,
text: wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (ala Porky)
dialog: Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting
dialog: simians. heheheheh.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Knock it off.
dialog: (soothing voice)
dialog: Isabelle!
text: THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering
text: heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda
text: fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air.
text: Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it
text: stops inches above the ground.
text: THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at
text: Linda s feet.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Good shootin , Tex.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What s that make it?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I m still ahead. 6 to 5.
text: Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from
text: the top of her tranquilizer gun.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: But I m catching up.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met
text: by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Can I have a word?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Most normal people say good morning.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don t you think you should test the
dialog: protocol on the liver samples before
dialog: you inject Isabelle?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: How many tissue samples have we
dialog: successfully regressed? Hundreds,
dialog: right? How many have gone on to work
dialog: on the full system? None.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That s beside the point.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, that is the point. I m not going
dialog: to waste six months of my life on an
dialog: outmoded testing procedure. This thing
dialog: works. I know it. I feel it.
text: Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail
text: end of the conversation.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fine. You can mop up afterward.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You think I m going to kill Isabelle?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Kill? More like liquefy.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but
dialog: I m the project leader. Understand?
dialog: She says ...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes, Sir.
text: ... but somehow it feels like Fuck you. She storms off.
text: Sebastian turns to Linda.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: How did you ever convince me to hire
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You said you wanted the beat vet in
dialog: the country.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yeah, well she cares more about the
dialog: animals than the research.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Maybe that s why she s so good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As
text: it's spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and
text: reaches in, removing...
text: A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.
text: Sebastian peers at the vial.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Who da Man? You da Man.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: As we pull out we see we are.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
dialog: Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech
text: Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical
text: readouts, bizarre medical equipment.
text: On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over
text: a humanoid form, strapped down at it's invisible limbs.
text: The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the
text: body to lots of machinery.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Protocol is hot.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Vitals?
text: Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat,
dialog: blood pressure, the rest.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Normal.
text: CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in
text: a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and
text: pushes aside the sheet.
speaker_heading: BOOMING VOICE
text: THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
text: NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
text: SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.
text: GOD HAS SPOKEN.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: How many times do I have to tell you,
dialog: Frank you aren t God.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
dialog: Sorry, Boss. Forgot.
text: Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the
text: Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You guys ready to roll?
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
text: FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE
text: WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab.
text: They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
text: The room is crammed with electronic and recording
text: equipment. A handful of monitors display different images
text: of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen
text: monitors vital signs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We are live and in color. On your
dialog: mark.
text: Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues.
text: Sebastian nods their way.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay. Roll em.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Okay. We are rolling record on videos
dialog: one through twelve.
text: Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a
text: microphone. Recording.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Frank s voice echoes through the chamber.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in
dialog: phase shift... one hundred twenty six
dialog: days, eighteen hours.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting
dialog: serial protein Caine One Two Five.
text: Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a
text: centrifuge nearby.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Maybe if you stopped naming them after
dialog: yourself, you d have better luck.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for
dialog: that keen scientific observation. I ll
dialog: be sure to include it in my memoirs.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: A whole mention? And I thought I was
dialog: just gonna be a footnote.
text: Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into
text: the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay.
text: Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Tension in the air.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (to Linda)
dialog: Ready.
text: She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it
text: tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface
text: appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in
text: the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the
text: surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a
dialog: vein.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Propped.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Let s make some history.
text: Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the
text: hypo from Matt s hand.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Nice try, Sparky.
text: Matt relinquishes the needle.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Come on, Isabelle. You can do this.
text: Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The
text: needle remains in sight after it slips through the
text: visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger,
text: releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid
text: twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb.
text: It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react.
text: Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of
text: color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Elevated heartbeat.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
text: Janice analyzes the screens.
speaker_heading: JANICE
text: We re still in the green.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal
dialog: range.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex
text: webbing of a bloodstream appears.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: It s reacting.
text: Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes
text: visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Do you see this?
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: It s working. It s actually working.
text: Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to
text: appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Heart rate s up. She s scared.
text: Sarah soothes her.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont d)
dialog: It's okay, baby. It's okay.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
text: Subject began manifesting almost
text: Immediately. Protocol is reacting
dialog: quickly.
text: Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She
text: begins to howl.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Subject may be in pain or extreme
dialog: discomfort.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating.
text: Brain activity going through the roof.
text: The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out.
text: The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the
text: inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont d)
dialog: We ve got a problem.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What? What problem!
text: Sarah checks her monitors.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It s her heart. We can see the heart
dialog: beating in the ape s
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: I got an erratic heart beat.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: She s going into cardiac arrest.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Got the crash cart.
text: Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We re losing her.
text: Her machine flatlines.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No! It s got to work.
text: The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in
text: decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Clear!
text: Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt
text: of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief
text: moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We ve got something!
text: The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its
text: march toward,visibility.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont d)
text: Still. erratic.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do
dialog: it. You can fucking do it.
text: Everybody s pulling for her.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Come on, monkey.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Do it. Do it. Come on.
text: Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists
text: and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin
text: forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being
text: painted on before our eyes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Stabilizing.
text: The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as
text: if it was discharging some stored energy.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
text: Brain activity returning to normal.
text: The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda
text: hovers over it stroking its fur.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Welcome back, Isabelle.
text: Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move
dialog: that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How is she?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I think she s gonna be okay
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HABITAT
text: Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise
text: and walk about the cage. She goes over to the other
text: monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Amazing. She's normal, absolutely
dialog: healthy. If you didn't know any
dialog: better, you'd think nothing had
dialog: happened to her.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (ribbing Sarah)
dialog: Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her
text: brain and trace her neural pathways.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Screw you, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well maybe not right away.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We should celebrate.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: The fanciest one in D.C.
text: The entire eight person team sits around a round table,
text: drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is
dialog: filled.
text: Sebastian raises his glass.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: To the finest research team I've ever
dialog: known.
text: A round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and
dialog: drink.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER
text: The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto
text: the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning
text: against a railing, breathing in the night air.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I thought you'd gone.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Where would I go?
text: He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling
text: lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Twenty years ago there were no
dialog: computers, no fax machines, no cell
dialog: phones. I was just wondering what the
dialog: world will be like twenty years from
dialog: now... if what we're doing will change
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: A little "I am become death... the
dialog: shatterer of worlds"?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Since the day I met, all you wanted to
dialog: do was change the world.
text: She puts her hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Listen, I know we've... I mean... well
dialog: ... I just want you to know how proud
dialog: I am of you. I know it probably
dialog: doesn't mean a lot...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Actually it does.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess since you were there from the
dialog: beginning, you know me better than
dialog: anyone else on this godforsaken
dialog: planet.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You're positively maudlin. You should
dialog: be happy. Do you have any idea what
dialog: you've accomplished?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yeah... but I was working so hard, I
dialog: didn't realize I'd have no one to
dialog: share it with.
text: Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I don't suppose we could turn back the
dialog: clock for a night and you could come
dialog: home with me?
text: Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.
text: He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he
text: passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange
dialog: "Heys".
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Nothing. It's just... He is who he is.
dialog: Sometimes I just have to be reminded.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the
dialog: laboratory.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
text: Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats.
text: He taps on the Plexiglas of one. The cubicle explodes
dialog: with
text: BARKING.
text: We see the Plexi steam up in one part, as if something
text: was breathing on it. As if a nose were pressed against
dialog: it.

dialog: What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell
dialog: me what it's like!
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PENTAGON - DAY
text: Flying over Washington D. C. , we cross the Potomac and
text: circle the five-cornered building, looking particularly
text: gloomy on this grey day.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.0.)
dialog: Six years ago, this committee
dialog: commissioned me with a very specific
dialog: task...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: At the table are six men. A handful of senior military
text: brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to
text: the front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt
text: and Linda, is in the middle of his presentation.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: To successful phase-shift a human
dialog: being out of quantum sync with the
text: visible universe and then return him
text: safely, with no after affects.
text: Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting
text: from the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and
text: skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Well, we found out sending them to
dialog: "never-never-land" was easy, it's the
dialog: getting back that's hard.
text: Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video
text: screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone
dialog: that used to be alive.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Every time we've tried to bring a test
text: subject back from phase-shift.
dialog: Cellular bonds would dissolve, the
dialog: primary DNA strands would decay. But
dialog: now...
text: Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: But now...
text: One of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER,
text: distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: But now?
text: Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But now...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But now, we feel we are closer than
dialog: ever to resolving this issue. We've
dialog: been experimenting with a new
dialog: regression formula that looks rather
dialog: promising.
text: A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.
speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Son, as you can imagine, we are very
dialog: anxious to field test this tactical
dialog: asset. How long till you resolve this
dialog: issue?
text: Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Shouldn't be more than another year,
dialog: Sir.
text: Frustrated sighs all around the room.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe sooner.
scene_heading: EXT. PENTAGON - DAY
text: As Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yo. Reality check! What the hell was
dialog: that about?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: The protocol works. Why'd you tell
dialog: them it didn't?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I wasn't ready for them to know.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But they're the oversight committee.
dialog: They're supposed to know.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm sure he had a reason.
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: You did have a reason, didn't you,
dialog: Sebastian?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I had more than a reason. I had a
dialog: goddamn epiphany.
text: They reach his Porsche.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: What do you think they'd do if they
dialog: know we could send a subject into
dialog: phase shift and pull it back out
dialog: again? How many seconds would it take
dialog: for them to take over the whole
dialog: project, bringing in their soldiers to
dialog: test the formula on. We'd have lost
text: control of it by the end of the week.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: It's their money, Sebastian. It's
dialog: going to happen eventually.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know. But not yet. There's too much
dialog: for us to learn. I don't want my hands
dialog: tied by their political agenda when we
dialog: go to phase three.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, then... mind telling us how
dialog: you're gonna get a human test-subject
dialog: for phase three without the committee
dialog: finding out?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That's easy. I've decided to test the
dialog: procedure ...
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: ... on myself.
text: The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws
text: drop and they stare at him with wide eyes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you nuts?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Was Jonas Salk nuts?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. Pretty sure he was.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And remember, for every Jonas Salk,
dialog: there are a bunch of guys who aren't
dialog: famous cuz they died.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: If we're that unsure, how can we
dialog: morally justify testing it on someone
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Isn't it a little soon to be moving
dialog: into phase three anyway?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: She's right. We haven't even finished
dialog: collating the phase two research.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We'll have plenty of time to collate
dialog: and cross-reference later. Monkey data
dialog: doesn't matter anyway. The only real
dialog: data is human data.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You don't even know if any of the
dialog: protocols will work on humans.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: How are we gonna find out? Besides,
dialog: we've succeeded with a gorilla and
dialog: their DNA is 98% the same as humans.
dialog: And the 2% is not that significant.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian ... humans can talk, build
text: houses and cook in microwave ovens.
dialog: Gorilla's live in trees. That's a
dialog: helluva 2% if you ask me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We're all concerned. I know that. But
dialog: if we're gonna move forward ever, this
dialog: is something we have to do.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Why you? Why not one of us?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: The risks. I couldn't ask...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What if we volunteer?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What if you're too valuable to lose?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm Project Leader. It's my formula
dialog: and my call. The best way to express
dialog: your concern is to make damn sure you
dialog: do your best work. I'll want about
dialog: four weeks to...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: To put your affairs in order?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: To run some more reversions and tissue
dialog: tests and then we'll attempt the phase
dialog: shift. I'll stay shifted for three
dialog: days of testing and then we'll perform
dialog: a quantum regression.
scene_heading: INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
text: A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Come in.
text: Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: In the past six years, I've never once
dialog: challenged your decisions, but this
dialog: ... Sebastian. I don't think you
dialog: should do this.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You don't understand.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh please. How long were we together?
dialog: You must've said it a million times
dialog: ... Nobody knows who built the lunar
dialog: lander. All they remember in the first
dialog: man on the moon.
text: Sebastian shrugs and nods.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: But what if something happens to
dialog: you... what about the project?
text: Sebastian smiles.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Lin, trust me... nothing's going to
dialog: happen.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way
text: up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He refuses to listen to reason.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Can we talk about this later? I'm
dialog: trying to make love to you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sorry. I just can't let it go.
text: Matt props himself up on the pillow.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I know how you're feeling. Hell, he
dialog: and I've been friends since freshman
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: So how can we let him do this?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What if you were given the opportunity
dialog: to be the first person on ,Mars, would
dialog: you go?
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: In a heartbeat.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What if they didn't know whether or
dialog: not they could get you home?
text: Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager
dialog: or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I
dialog: were him I'd do the same thing.
text: Matt goes back to kissing Linda.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Let me ask another question.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is about who gets to be on top?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Is the human race really ready for
dialog: what we're doing?
text: Matt groans and rolls over.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why do you always get philosophical
dialog: before we're about to get physical?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No really. Is it ready? We're
text: barrelling down a road that begs moral
dialog: and ethical questions that I don't
dialog: think we can answer.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They said the same thing about the
dialog: bomb. They said we'd never survive the
dialog: nuclear age... but here we are.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: This night is still young.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean, when you think about it, it's
dialog: creepy. Do we really want to live in a
dialog: world where people can just disappear
dialog: in the blink of an eye?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We made our deal with the devil years
dialog: ago. Might as well stick around to
dialog: cash in.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY
text: Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock
text: on the door.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (his voice catches)
dialog: Yes?
text: Matt sticks his head in.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're ready.
text: Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's not too late to back out. I'm
dialog: happy to take your place.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No. I'm ready.
text: Matt leads him into the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: As they walk down the corridor toward the lab...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Nervous?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ever tell you the one about Superman
dialog: and Wonder Woman?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: So Superman's flying around the city,
dialog: and he's horny as hell. Lo and behold
text: he looks down and sees Wonder Woman,
text: completely nude, sunning herself up on
dialog: the roof of the Justice League. I mean
text: she is lying there naked and spread
text: eagle. So Superman starts thinking,
dialog: "man... this is too easy. I could go
dialog: down there, do a little fast pumping
dialog: and be gone before she even sees me."
text: After all he is faster than a speeding
text: bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down,
dialog: takes care of business so quick, you
dialog: can't even see him. Well ... I tell
text: ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised
dialog: as hell and says "What the hell was
dialog: that." And the Invisible Man replies
dialog: "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like
dialog: hell."
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: Sebastian shoots Matt a look.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You know, that could be the last joke
dialog: I ever hear.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: C'mon, man. That's funny shit.
text: The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified
text: HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump.
text: Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed
text: only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table
text: inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to
text: his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein
text: up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda
text: makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She
text: pats Sebastian on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: O.K. How're you feeling?
dialog: 
text: Sebastian takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Fine.
text: Sarah checks his vitals.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit
text: elevated.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: To be expected.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: No reason for concern. He's ready.
text: Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's
text: almost teary eyed.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Hey... it's gonna be okay.
text: Linda nods. Back to business.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Start recording.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH.
text: Janice hits record on the equipment decks.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: We're hot. All systems nominal,
dialog: Houston.
text: Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the
text: computers. He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into
text: a microphone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, kids. Let's make some history.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Frank's voice echoes through the chamber.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs.
text: Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid.
dialog: Draws up 20ccs.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (to Linda)
dialog: Ready.
text: Linda takes the hypo from Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: If the tests are any indication it
dialog: should work quickly.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'll inject myself. If anything goes
dialog: wrong, they can't blame you.
text: She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian
text: stares at the golden formula silently for a moment.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We can still shut down, Sebastian.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Any last words?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said
text: something deep and clever.
text: Then... Back to business. He inserts the needle into the
text: I.V. Sebastian. Presses into himself and depresses the
dialog: plunger.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Injection was administered at
dialog: (checks watch)
text: ... 18:23:47.
text: The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Keep talking. Tell us what you're
dialog: feeling.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Nothing so far.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Vitals are stable.
text: They wait and watch.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Nothing's happening.
text: Another moment passes by.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Human DNA structure is slightly more
dialog: complex... it's possible that it may
dialog: take more time...
text: Another moment passes.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Maybe we overlooked something.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Recheck the protocol. It can't be non-
dialog: reactive.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Kinda like a firecracker with a bad
dialog: fuse...
text: Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look.
speaker_heading: CARTER (cont'd)
dialog: Don't know if it'll go off.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: (from the booth)
dialog: No change in bio-electric.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Goddammit.
text: Another long pause. Sebastian concentrates.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a
dialog: bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's
text: starting to tingle...
text: Excitement overtakes the room.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Okay... it's spreading to my back...
dialog: like, like a fever...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Here we go.
text: Slowly the flesh on Sebastian's arm begins dissolving,
text: revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels
text: and flesh beneath it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh
dialog: god. It hurts. I didn't think it would
dialog: hurt.
text: The HEART BEAT thumps faster, accelerating
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.
dialog: ... 130 ...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP
dialog: TALKING!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Pain!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure
dialog: 180 over 100. ...
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: He's going to blow out his heart.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: Prop the crash cart.
text: Carter grabs the crash cart, rolls it in. Matt tears off
text: the I.V. leads into Sebastian's arms.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We've got to stop it!
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We can't!
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
text: All the monitors are going crazy.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Something's happening.
text: Frank leans into the microphone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen up! Electric activity
text: increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves
text: are through the roof.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: I didn't think the human brain could
dialog: spike that high.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe it can't.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: Sebastian screams in dire pain. He struggles against his
text: restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass.
text: It's like something's eating away at him. Gruesome. The
text: yells become louder and more painful to hear.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!
text: The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a
text: struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels
text: and stuffed with the major organs. The beating heart, the
text: heaving lungs.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Pulse is 180 .... holding stable.
text: Screaming.... Then the organs go. Then the blood vessels.
text: Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. The jawbones
text: spread wide ... Screaming... screaming...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones,
text: the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Pulse is dropping. 170..
dialog: 150 .... 160..
text: There is NOTHING left of Sebastian Caine.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
dialog: 18:26.
text: The screaming continues and the restraints continue to
text: twist and turn. Suddenly the restraints go limp.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is he dead?
text: Linda checks the readouts.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: No. He passed out from the trauma.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110
text: ... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over
dialog: 75.
text: A long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
text: Electrical activity is stabilizing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Pulse steady at 70.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Un-fucking-believable.
text: A reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what
text: would be his skin. Small electrical charge dance around
text: her fingertips. She gasps.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (whispers in his ear)
dialog: You did it, Sebastian. You're the
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Let's get him into recovery.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER
text: The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the
text: end of the Hallway of Habitats.
text: On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's
text: invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery
text: pound out a dulling rhythm.
text: Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the
text: room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a
text: seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: S'okay. You nodded off.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: His breathing's hypnotic. How long's
dialog: it been?
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Seventeen hours.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Where are the others?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: In the lab crunching numbers. We've
dialog: got enough data there for two
dialog: lifetimes of research.
text: Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: I keep looking at that hole, wondering
text: if he's really there.
text: She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The
text: sheet twitches.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Did you see...
text: The sheet twitches again.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: He may be coming out of it.
text: Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the
text: sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: The lights! Turn off the goddamn
dialog: lights! Ah Christ!
text: Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to
text: the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is
text: lit by the glow of machinery.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
text: I can't... I can't close my eyes. I
dialog: can't close my eyes.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Your eyelids are transparent.
text: The sheets slowly stop thrashing.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: So I ... I'm...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel
dialog: them...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Your arms ... your whole body... It
dialog: worked, Sebastian. It worked.
text: The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly
text: connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and
text: then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Mirror. I ... I want to see.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Over here in the corner.
text: Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a
text: mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection.
text: Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger
text: tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no
text: finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups
text: into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing
text: against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water
text: cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment
text: before dripping away.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: What was it like?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I ... It's hard to think.
text: Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: The transformation... I remember every
text: molecule in my body shattering.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It was painful?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: At first... but then everything went
text: black. I couldn't see or hear or feel
dialog: anything. It was all just black...
dialog: like I wasn't connected.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Your system received quite a shock.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: At least my senses are starting to
dialog: return... You're wearing your
dialog: Shalimar, aren't you?
text: Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair
text: lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her
dialog: spine.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian.
text: Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: This is weird. I'm looking through
text: myself at the floor. I'm looking right
dialog: through myself. I can't tell ...
text: He bumps into a chair.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ... where my body is.
text: A moment of silence.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian?
text: No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly
text: alarmed.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sebastian?
text: An indentation forms on the bed a moment later.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You really can't see me. Can you?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea,
text: headache, body-ache, disorientation.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: No, just tired.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's funny. I can see everything...
dialog: more than before... but I can't see
dialog: myself.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research
text: stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hey. How's he doing?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Why don't you ask him?
text: Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four
text: of them stare at the nothing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sebastian, how do you feel.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Not to bad, considering.
text: They turn round. The voice is coming from behind them.
text: The group rises from their various workstations and turn
text: toward where the voice came from.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Odd, isn't it?
text: A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim.
text: Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He can't close his eyes so they're
dialog: sensitive to light.
text: Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: So, what was it like?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Over here.
text: Sebastian has moved. As everyone turns toward him again,
text: he can't stifle a slight giggle.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Sorry. Couldn't resist.
text: His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, I see the procedure hasn't
dialog: changed your personality.
text: Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No worries. I'm on it.
text: THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a
text: heat signature, including Sebastian. Frank points.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Gotcha, big man.
text: THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Boy, you people have no sense of
dialog: humor.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
text: Just a little longer.
speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

scene_heading: INT. THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
text: As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper
text: corner of the room.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We've set up a thermal camera for
dialog: observation and I've arranged one of
dialog: us to be here 24/7 in case you need
dialog: anything. The team's gonna be on alpha-
dialog: call alert for the duration. If
dialog: anything goes wrong, we can all be
dialog: here within...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote
dialog: the procedure.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I was trying to be reassuring.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You like this don't you?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Being in charge.
text: It's clear she does. But she's certainly not going to
dialog: admit it.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Please. I'm just doing my job.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON: A video screen. A thermal lump lays stretched

text: Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen. We are.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall
dialog: of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in

text: Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You gonna be okay?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fine. It's not like I have anything
dialog: else going on in my sad pathetic life.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Carter'll be in at six to spell you
dialog: and I'll be in by nine. Call me if
dialog: anything happens, okay?
text: Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and
text: waving her out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm fine. Go on ahead.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: The rest of the team straggles into the elevator.
text: Yawning. Exhausted from the day.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Days only get longer from here.
text: Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming
text: over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but
text: Linda. She smiles.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Deserted and dark.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy.
text: She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing
text: fluorescent light isn't helping either.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
text: The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the
text: bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet
text: shuffling against linoleum.
text: CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are
text: following someone walking.
text: The door handle turns and the door pushes open.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
text: WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats. We hear
text: the sounds of sleeping creatures. A couple of them growl
text: at something unseen. The growling follows the invisible
text: something as it passes by.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: The laboratory door opens and shuts again. Ghostly. We
text: see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. A glass
text: moves slightly.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sarah reclines in her chair. Fast asleep, Behind her is
text: the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.
text: But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had
text: just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears,
text: we see the door to the observation room quietly open.
text: ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Sarah. Are you awake?
text: Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Hmm.
text: Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running
text: through it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers
text: were tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her
text: breast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if
text: she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her
text: breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched...
text: softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more
text: labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes
text: wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and
text: looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps
text: over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The
text: heat signature isn't there.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are
dialog: you in here?
text: She listens. It's silent. She tries holding her breath,
text: listening for his breathing. But there's nothing.
text: Sarah reaches over to a microphone. Hits a few switches.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Dr. Caine?
text: VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE COMPOUND

scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS
text: Sarah waits. No response.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Shit.
text: She looks around the room. He must be in here.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this
dialog: isn't funny. I know you're in here.
text: Nothing. No response. Sarah waves her hand around,
text: reaching out, trying to find him. After a few beats she
text: stops and rubs her head.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: I must be going crazy.
text: Suddenly, Sarah gets an idea. She quickly exits the
dialog: observation room.
scene_heading: EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: At a wall storage box, she removes a pair of Thermal
text: Goggles and slips them on.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sarah enters wearing the thermals. She scans the room.
text: THERMAL POV - The room is empty.
text: She pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she
text: glances over at the video screen, she sees Sebastian's
text: thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room.
text: Sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
text: Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I found him later in the lab, running
dialog: samples.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Why didn't you call me?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.
dialog: I mean, I could've easily been
dialog: dreaming.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It doesn't sound like something
dialog: Sebastian would do.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: God, I feel so stupid.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I can talk to him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. I mean...
dialog: (she torn, unsure of herself)
dialog: It was probably nothing. I
dialog: shouldn't've mentioned it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why
dialog: would he do that, right? Just, this
dialog: place at night can be kinda creepy,
dialog: y'know.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY
text: Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination
text: chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his
text: head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So, how was your first night?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't
dialog: close your eyes.
text: As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his
text: jaw pump up and down.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah? What'd you do?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Got up a couple of times. Knocked
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in
dialog: your cubicle. She said she called you
dialog: over the intercom and you didn't
dialog: respond.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell
dialog: whoever's on duty where you're going
dialog: to. I mean, if something were to
dialog: happen, we'd want to know where to
dialog: find you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I didn't think it was a problem.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It isn't. I just don't want it to
dialog: become one.
text: Machines pump out EEG, EKG readouts. Matt studies them.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Readings are normal.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Next I want to run a VV and UVF
text: analysis of the platelets.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We'll have to draw some more blood.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air.
text: She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it
text: tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She
dialog: acts very self conscious.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You just seem a little nervous.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This
dialog: might hurt a bit.
text: The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda
text: searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times,
text: then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin
text: bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it
text: slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on
text: the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid,
dialog: but are you... are you looking at me.
text: The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and
text: down his arm. His vein.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: No. I was looking at the clock. Why?
text: Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood
text: into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Just felt like someone was staring at
dialog: me.
text: Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a
text: grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in
text: Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as
text: does the liquid in the vial.
scene_heading: TESTING MONTAGE
scene_heading: INT. MRI ROOM
text: MATT slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an MRI.
text: Even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the
text: MRI scanner.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LABORATORY
text: CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank.
text: SEBASTIAN'S BODY displaces the water, revealing an empty
text: body shaped cavity in the water.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
text: CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which
text: shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber, huddled
text: over a chess game.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVER CHAMBER
text: on a chessboard... A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP,
text: seemingly all by itself.
text: Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his WHITE
text: KING acknowledging defeat.
scene_heading: INT. SPECTRAL LAB
text: Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank
text: switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots
text: across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center
text: of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern,
text: suddenly the beam splits into a million different
text: spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's
text: entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LABORATORY
text: LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood
text: sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She
text: takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table.
text: She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood
text: sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to
text: make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT
text: ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of
text: her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and
text: sets it down where it was before. She peers into the
text: microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke
text: is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another
dialog: table completely.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian? Goddamnit.
text: We hear Sebastian's laughter echo in the room.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You've no idea how much fun I've had.
dialog: I'm going to hate going back.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That's what worries me.?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What happens when we turn the project
dialog: over to the Army. Ever wonder how much
dialog: fun they're gonna have?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Maybe we won't give it to them. His
text: voice comes from behind her now.
text: We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers
dialog: press down.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: I was thinking... tonight's my last
dialog: night. Ever fantasize about making
dialog: love to an invisible man?
text: Linda pulls away from him.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Well, don't do it for me. Do it for
dialog: science.
text: Linda walks away. Sebastian laughs.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Grow up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Oh well. Missed your big chance.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare.
text: Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and
text: starts it spinning.
text: A sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across
text: his limbs. He is fully wired.
text: Linda looks up to the observation booth.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Recording?
text: Frank peers down at her from the booth, his voice echoing
text: through the chamber.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian
dialog: Caine. Currently in phase shift...
text: Three days, seven hours.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial
dialog: Protein Caine One Two Seven.
text: Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a
text: centrifuge nearby. Carter hands Matt a hypo. Matt jabs it
text: into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. Linda
text: sprays Sebastian's arm with dye.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Not really. I was just starting to
dialog: enjoy myself.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Tough.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay, man. Here we go.
text: Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on
text: the plunger. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of
text: light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the
dialog: vein.
text: Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Wait... something... something doesn't
dialog: feel right.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Heartbeat elevated.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
text: Janice and Frank look over the equipment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Vitals still nominal..
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex
text: webbing of a bloodstream appears.
text: Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible
text: ... the shadow of a skeletal system.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I can't br... br...
text: Sebastian begins wheezing.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: He's not breathing.
text: Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened
text: eyeballs.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Subject manifesting.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Pulse erratic.
text: Sebastian pulls against his bonds. One set tears off.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Carter!
text: Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to
text: hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible
text: man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Sebastian! Sebastian!
text: And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And
text: free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off
dialog: all the wiring.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Sebastian!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Get a tranq. Stat.
text: Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with
text: Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And
text: suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to
text: him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from
text: his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He's reverting. Got him on the table.
text: Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto
text: an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads
text: back to the group.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I got no pulse. No pulse.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Start CPR.
text: Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing
text: because we can actually see it. Carter's hand pushes down
text: in the air inches above the heart. We see the heart being
text: pushed and squeezed. Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian
text: and starts pumping air into his lungs. Sebastian's heart
text: begins to beat again, beat on its own.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Getting a pulse.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Holy shit. What happened?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you
dialog: hear me? How are his pupils?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I can't see his goddamn pupils!
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: I think he's going into shock.
text: We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our
dialog: scientist- doctors working on Sebastian... And the
text: beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat.
speaker_heading: FADE
speaker_heading: UP ON:
speaker_heading: A HABITAT
text: The heartbeat continues. In the shadows, two Rhesus
text: Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker.
text: Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall.
text: We FADE OUT AGAIN...
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the
text: Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter-
text: eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals.
text: Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket.
text: She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as
text: Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Just got the tissue sample results.
text: Cellular cohesion is stable.
text: Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her
text: shoulder. Pulls her close to him.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: How bout you? You gonna be okay?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Guess so.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was just thinking about the Apollo
dialog: missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and
dialog: Chaffee... What it was like for them
dialog: on that launch pad that day, thinking
dialog: they were gonna reach the stars only
dialog: to burn to death.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sometimes the test pilots make
dialog: history. Sometimes the planes crash
dialog: and people die.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: But he didn't die, did he?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What if we can't bring him back? What
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's just a little hitch is all. He'll
dialog: be the first to tell that he'll crack
dialog: it and I'm sure he will. It'll just
dialog: take time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen, let's got out of here. We
dialog: could drive up to the old observatory.
dialog: We'll take some wine and go count the
dialog: stars and forget all this for awhile.
text: She pulls away.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No. I want to be here for him.
text: Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and
text: takes a seat by Sebastian's bedside. A little hurt, Matt
text: heads down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt
text: enters. Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours
text: himself a cup. He takes a seat at the table. They all
text: drink their coffee in silent vigil.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
text: Linda sits by Sebastian's bedside, listening to the

text: The sheets shift.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Hey...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So I guess it didn't work.
text: Linda shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You look worried. It must've been bad.
text: Sebastian's voice is weak and strained.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You almost died.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever
dialog: doesn't kill me, makes me stronger.
text: Linda smiles.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I should be making you feel better.
dialog: Not vice versa.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I guess if I'm going to be stuck this
dialog: way for awhile, I'd better make some
dialog: adjustments.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
text: In a dusty shaft of light...
text: A cotton swab.
text: is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored
text: cream make-up. We follow the hand as it raises the cotton
text: swab into the darkness. The swab strokes over the black
text: and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing...
text: EYE LIDS of a closed eye.
text: The eyelids part, unveiling...
scene_heading: PITCH BLACK. Blink. Blink.
dialog: No eye.
text: Not even a trace of a eye socket. Just darkness.
text: A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air... hovering
text: before the eyelids. It turns and fastens itself to the
text: darkness between the lids.
text: We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK
text: and pulls it over his head.
text: He checks his reflection in the mirror. He looks almost
text: human. Almost. A face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him
text: covered by surgical scrubs.
text: We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Not too bad.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: The latex'll limit the amount of light
dialog: delivered to my optic nerves.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You could almost pass for human.
text: Sebastian rises. He looks eerily removed from reality
text: with his cold blank expression.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Well, it gives you a face to talk to
dialog: at least, and we can all work in
text: normal light again.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Carter draws blood from Sebastian.
text: Samples are placed into the cyclotron.
text: Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope. He makes
dialog: notes.
text: Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a
text: protein strand. Matt looks over. They shake their heads,
dialog: no.
text: Sebastian slides into the MRI.
text: Linda examines a petri dish. She throws her pencil down
text: in frustration.
text: Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams.
text: Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking
text: like he's been dragged through the nine levels of
text: purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by
text: Linda and Matt.
text: He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: The testing's making me sick.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Could be the barium or the radiation.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're physiology has changed and,
dialog: well, all bets are off.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I can't believe I have to spend
dialog: another night here.
dialog: (to Linda)
dialog: Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet
dialog: up with that boyfriend of yours now.
text: Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Do you want me to stay?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No. That's okay. It's just, being a
dialog: guinea pig is more work than I
dialog: thought. I'll be fine.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman
text: stereo and playing gameboy.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
text: Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.
text: He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror
text: and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes
text: his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little
dialog: off, but only if you look close.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's
text: Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded

text: Carter pulls of his earphones.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Dr. Caine. What's up?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Just stopped by to let you know, I'm

text: Sebastian turns back into the hallway.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Going out? Hey wait a sec!
text: Carter scrambles to his feet.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Carter catches up with Sebastian.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What do you mean going out for a bit?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna
dialog: go crazy.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: But you're not supposed to leave the
dialog: compound.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's the rule.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes, but I made that rule. It's my
dialog: rule and I'm changing it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You can't just change it.
text: Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Carter, I was suppose to be like this
dialog: for three days. Three fucking days and
dialog: I'll be damned if I'm going to spend
dialog: the rest of my life as a prisoner in
dialog: this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going
dialog: out. I'll be back in a couple of
dialog: hours. Okay?
text: The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Shit.
text: Carter runs down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carter picks up the phone and dials.
text: A beat then.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The elevator doors open and Sebastian pushes past the
dialog: Marine Guard.
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile?
text: Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his
dialog: Porsche.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yeah, well. You know how it in
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: You got that right, sir. I was
dialog: beginning to worry 'cause your car
dialog: hadn't moved.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Thanks, but everything's cool.
text: Sebastian starts his car. It chugs a few times before
text: turning over and speeding out of the warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights.
text: He looks around his apartment and sighs. It's good to be
dialog: home.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light. He
text: looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and
text: smiles.
scene_heading: INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He could be anywhere. Hell he could be
text: right behind us.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna
text: swing by his place, just in case.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: See you there.
text: Matt tries to give her a quick pack. Linda backs away.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (quietly, looking around)
dialog: I don't want him to see.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (looking around too)
dialog: What a mess.
text: They get in their cars.
scene_heading: INT. SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an
text: overnight duffle. He crosses to his bookcase and pulls
text: out some books and throws them into the bag.
text: But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window
text: across the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom
text: light and moves toward the window. He peers across the
text: courtyard into the Brunette's apartment.
text: He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room
text: from her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table
text: and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the
text: window. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she
text: pulls her blinds shut.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Shit.
text: Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then
text: stops. Something has occurred to him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Don't even think it...
text: He looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His
text: breathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches
text: a glimpse at himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: (almost whispering)
dialog: Once...just once.
text: The Brunette's living room light switches off and the
text: bathroom light switches on. We see him fighting an
text: internal battle and we see him lose it. He grabs a hold
text: of his hand and peels the latex skin off.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black
text: Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb,
text: jumps out of her car and heads into the building.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower.
text: The doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette
text: rises.
scene_heading: AT THE FRONT DOOR
text: She peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as
text: she turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the
text: door, steps out into the hallway and looks around. Empty.
text: Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment.
text: We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment
text: later, the bedroom door closes on its own.
text: We hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another.
dialog: Then a muffled struggled. And we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's
text: door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again.
dialog: Waits.
text: And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes
text: the door open.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian?
scene_heading: INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian?
text: She notices that the bathroom light is on.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the
text: vanity she sees his latex face and hands.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh shit.
text: She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No.
dialog: He's taken his make-up off. I don't
dialog: know...He must be outside somewhere.
dialog: I don't know where he went. I'm coming
dialog: back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed
dialog: to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM!
dialog: We're going on alpha call. I want
dialog: everyone at the lab now. We're gonna
dialog: need thermal visors and we may need
dialog: tranqs.
text: As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA
text: doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and
text: out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to
text: hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's
dialog: window as we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and
text: curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of
text: heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The
text: door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see
text: indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT
text: The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors
text: close shut behind her. A beat later we see the
text: indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We
text: follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...
scene_heading: INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on
text: and the water starts running.
text: We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against
text: Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water.
text: Then the water slips away.
text: For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear
text: something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and
text: passes out tranquilizer guns.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: What are the tranqs for?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Use your imagination.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Are you saying he's dangerous?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're just saying we need to be
dialog: cautious.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: The Metro stops running after midnight
text: and he's on foot, so he can't have
dialog: gotten too far.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Look, this isn't a monkey we're
dialog: talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't
dialog: you think you're over reacting?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: This program is classified. If he's
dialog: out there it means someone might find
dialog: out about him. He could destroy the
dialog: whole program.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out.
text: They all turn around. At the door is Sebastian, back in
text: his latex outfit.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I got a little stir crazy, so I went
dialog: to my apartment to pick up some stuff.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Bullshit! I went to your apartment and
dialog: I happen to know you did a helluva lot
dialog: more than pick some stuff up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You, of all people How could you?
text: Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He
dialog: thinks she knows.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: You put yourself and this project at
dialog: risk.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Just what did you see in my apartment?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I saw your face and your clothes.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It was bad enough you left without an
dialog: escort, but to take off the...
text: (he motions to his face)
dialog: out in public?
text: Sebastian realizes that they don't know.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Don't make a mountain out of molehill.
dialog: I didn't let anyone see me.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That's not good enough. When you're
text: outside the lab there are a thousand
dialog: variables none of us can control. It's
dialog: just not safe for you to be out there.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to
dialog: be some kind of prisoner.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You volunteered for this, Sebastian.
dialog: You knew going in there could be
dialog: consequences.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: For the security of this project, I'm
dialog: gonna have to ask you to confine
dialog: yourself to the compound.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's
dialog: my decision to make.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You're right. It's your decision. But
dialog: if you leave the compound again, I'll
dialog: notify the oversight committee. Then
dialog: they can make the decision. You
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Matt?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it
dialog: were the other way around.
text: A long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda
text: with a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her
text: silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity. Linda rolls
text: up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Hold still.
text: She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it
text: tight. She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (contentious)
dialog: How much blood do you think you've
dialog: taken so far?
text: The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda
text: searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times,
text: then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Not enough to worry about.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Every day... feels like you're sucking
dialog: me dry.
text: Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a
text: dye into his bloodstream.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: It's funny. All these years I've known
dialog: you, I never pegged you for a
dialog: megalomanic.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: The shoe being on the other foot. You
dialog: getting to run things.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when
text: a classified experiment disappears in
text: the middle of the night, someone's
dialog: gotta run the show.
dialog: (tries sympathy)
dialog: Look, I know how hard this has been
dialog: for you.
text: He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Don't patronize me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And for the record, you've got no idea
dialog: what it's like. I get up every morning
dialog: and you people stick needles in me.
dialog: You bombard me with radiation until I
text: vomit. And then at six it's over for
dialog: you. You get to go home. But Sebastian
text: is still here. Sebastian can't leave,
dialog: or else. That's the worst part, you
dialog: know. Here I have this ... this GIFT
dialog: and I can't even use it.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Now it's a gift?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You're goddamn right it's a gift. And
dialog: if you weren't so goddamned short
dialog: sighted, I'd be out there right now
text: trying to master it.
text: Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at
text: him. He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the
text: instrument tray and heads toward the door.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Where're you going?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Looks like I'm going nowhere.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests
dialog: scheduled today.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Do them yourself.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected
dialog: works of T.S. Elliot.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Want to talk about it?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No.
text: Linda looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: "We are the hollow men, the stuffed
text: men, headpieces filled with straw."
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Funny, huh? I've become a literal
dialog: metaphor.
text: He puts the books down.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I don't want to fight you. I just want
dialog: what's best for the program.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know. And you being right doesn't
dialog: make it any easier for me.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You can be scared. That's okay.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm not scared of being stuck this
text: way. With a little more make-up and
dialog: practice, I could...
text: (he motions to his face)
dialog: ... pass. Y'know, get by in the world.
dialog: But the testing...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You're talking like you've given up.
dialog: It's only been a few months.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What if it's years? I don't know how
dialog: much more testing I can take.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER
text: Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at
text: an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in
text: a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and
text: more cells appear, filling the gap.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: 60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...
dialog: 85 ...
text: The others in the lab listen. They start to get excited.
text: Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to
dialog: watch the screen.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We've got it. We've got it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: 93% ... 95%... 95%
text: They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That's all we need.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Come on, baby. Come on.
text: But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out
text: existence, and then those around them also blink away
text: until after a beat, the screen is empty.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Full quantum cascade at 95%.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You're sorry? You're fucking sorry?
text: Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against
text: the wall. It shatters.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Six weeks of this shit and you're
dialog: sorry!
text: He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage.
text: Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him. After
text: struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms
text: down and pushes away from them and heads out the door.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: I don't blame him.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'll go talk to him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Leave him alone. He just needs to blow
text: off some steam.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security
text: camera. The camera stares back at him.
text: As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream
text: and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold
text: eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in
text: forth in panic and confusion.
text: Sebastian suddenly rises.
text: He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel
text: on the underneath of the camera.
text: He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of
text: the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the
text: intercom button on the phone.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm going to the lab.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: Don't you sleep?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. I'm here if you need me.
text: He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a
text: circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring. He seems
dialog: be assembling something.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Sebastian crosses underneath the camera... just out of
text: its range... reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews
text: the access panel. He scans the electronics and attaches
text: two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board.
text: Trailing a long length of wire, Sebastian crosses back to
text: his bed and lies down. He holds a black project box with
text: a button on it. He lies perfectly still and press the
dialog: button.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: The video image of the Recovery Chamber flickers
text: slightly, before returning to normal.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
text: Sebastian's POV - Various animals stir restlessly. A DOG,
text: visible, leaps against the Plexiglas, barking wildly. We
text: push further down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Again, Sebastian's POV as he pushes through the open door
text: of the observation room. We see Frank sorting through
text: various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding
dialog: sequences.
text: We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at
text: the video monitor. According to the video, Sebastian is
text: sleeping soundly in his room.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: The rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank glances over at the video monitor. He can see
text: Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed.
text: Frank feels something on his neck. He flicks whatever it
text: is away with his hand and goes back to work.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The elevator door opens. The Guard turns around. The
text: elevator is empty.
scene_heading: INT. METRO STATION, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
text: A Metro Subway train draws to a halt. With a cautionary
text: "BING BONG" its doors slide open. A handful of people
text: exit and enter. One man bumps shoulders. He turns round
text: to apologize, but there's no one there. The doors close
text: and the train pulls out of the station.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT
text: A couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their
dialog: apartments.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: One of the girls enters her apartment. The door half
text: closes behind her and then reopens and closes again.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
text: Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Quiet. He worked in the lab till about
dialog: 10:30 and then went to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
text: Close on the security camera. The wires have been removed
text: and the access panel replaced.
text: Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes
text: applying his makeup. The door opens and Linda and Matt
dialog: enter.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Ah, my two favorite people. Good
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why so cheery this morning?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You know some days you just wake up
dialog: feeling the world is full of
dialog: potential. Like your eyes have been
dialog: opened.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm happy if I make it to my coffee
text: machine.
text: Linda hands Sebastian a disk.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I restructured the third genome on
dialog: your radiated protein strand. Thought
dialog: you might want to take look.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Cook up a batch and let's see where we
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I thought you'd want to take a look at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me,
dialog: I need to have my head examined.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER - DAY
text: Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the
text: walk-in storage freezer.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm telling you, I know him.
dialog: Something's going on.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Think he knows about us.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: If he knew about us, he'd be angry and
dialog: that wasn't angry.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on
text: the floor catches her eye. She bends down and takes a
text: look at it. Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of
text: a BAREFOOT FOOTPRINT.
text: She runs her finger along the dried mud. It turns to
dialog: dust.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG
text: leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head.
text: Carter analyzes the results.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: When you were a kid, you ever dream
dialog: about being invisible?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sure... all the time.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: What did you imagine you'd do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The usual.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: What's the usual?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Hanging out in the girl's locker room.
text: Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Jimmy Margiani?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am.
dialog: Back then, I was the size of a small
dialog: planet and made a rather large target.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Ever think up anything along the grand
dialog: scale?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sure. World domination. Manipulating
dialog: stock markets, consolidating a
dialog: political power base. But those are
dialog: more recent fantasies.
text: Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on
text: his latex facemask.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: And what if it weren't fantasy? What
dialog: if you were out there in the world and
dialog: could do whatever you wanted with no
dialog: consequences whatsoever. How far would
dialog: go? I mean... if it were real?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't know, man. Out in the real
dialog: world... I mean, there's a
dialog: responsibility...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Let's say you saw a woman with amazing
dialog: tits. Would you brush against them?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hell, I try and do that now.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Human nature. So if you could get away
dialog: with more, would you do more?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I read that in a survey at a major
dialog: university they asked college students
dialog: "Would you steal if you were
dialog: guaranteed to get away with it?" 82%
dialog: said yes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder
dialog: if the world's ready for what we're
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So, Doc what did you do?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: When you were out.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I just walked around. Y'know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Aw, you just walked around? Come on.
dialog: There's more, right?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Man, I'd be walking up to people
dialog: saying shit like "This is God, go,get
dialog: a haircut." Or hanging out in the
text: changing room at Victoria's Secret.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Kind of sophomoric, don't you think.
dialog: Besides, it was late and I wasn't out
dialog: that long.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, did you see anybody?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: There was this one girl.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah? And did you mess with her?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Naw...
text: Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Well maybe a little.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I tell you though, a man could get
dialog: used to it.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening.
text: Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We
dialog: realize we are in...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S POV
dialog: Then ...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Goodnight.
dialog: Linda-jumps.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: It's fine. I just didn't know you were
dialog: there. Goodnight.
text: As she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway.
scene_heading: EXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment
text: building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of
text: wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind
text: her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and
text: forth. It's locked.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to
text: the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if
text: something were climbing it.
text: We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window.
text: Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see
text: Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from
text: Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by
dialog: itself.
text: But then through the window we see Matt walk into the
text: living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We
text: hear a shocked intake of air.
text: He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her
text: dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat
text: and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the
text: buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging
dialog: kisses.
text: Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses
text: his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to
dialog: her.
text: Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and
text: Linda jump back covering themselves.
text: We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the
dialog: fire escape.
text: A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He
text: sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: MATT
text: I don't know. I don't see anything.
text: Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
text: It's like something hit it.
text: Linda picks up the phone and dials.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carter picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hello?
text: Carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery
text: room. Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed.
speaker_heading: CARTER (cont'd)
text: No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at
text: him. He's right there in his room.
scene_heading: INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Linda breathes a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.
dialog: (hangs up phone)
dialog: Phew.
text: Matt pulls her into him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: BARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible
text: repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese
dialog: water torture.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Be quiet!
text: A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles
text: atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and
text: turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A
text: beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in
text: the shape of hands and splashes against his face,
text: dripping away.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
text: And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is
dialog: it who blinds me?" and Odysseus
dialog: replied "Nobody is my name". And the
dialog: Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody
dialog: is killing me. Nobody".
text: The barking continues. A moment later the chamber door
text: slides open. We push down the...
text: HALLWAY OF THE HABITATS
text: ... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.
text: The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and
text: some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck.
text: The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the
text: barking stops.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Nobody's gonna hurt you.
text: The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes
text: limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and
text: over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door
text: swings closed again and moments later the door to
text: Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in
text: Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half
text: visible hands.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING
text: Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She
text: eyes it curiously and opens the cage door.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER
text: Sarah stares at the empty chamber.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You awake?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I am now.
text: The sheets raise and drape off of him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Notice anything unusual last night.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: No. Why?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Franklin Three. He's dead.
text: Sebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the
text: dimly lit room like a ghost.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What of?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: His neck was broken and his windpipe
dialog: collapsed.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: How'd that happen?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I thought maybe you could tell me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Sarah... You saying I had something to
dialog: do with it?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He was alive last night when I left
dialog: and he was dead this morning. And you
dialog: were the only one down here.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I was in my room all night.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
text: Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security
text: video tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's all twelve hours.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He never left the room.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: A windpipe doesn't just suddenly
dialog: collapse. Someone or something killed
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You saw the tape. The man was in his
dialog: chamber.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Then we have a problem, because I the
text: cage was locked from the outside. That
dialog: means it was opened, the dog was
text: killed and the cage was closed and
dialog: locked again. Only a human could do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, it wasn't me.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And it wasn't him.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Are we sure?
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Linda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Any big plans for tonight?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Really? Whatever happened to that guy
dialog: your were seeing?
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He's still in the picture. Why?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Being locked down here, I'm forced to
dialog: live vicariously. Someday you'll have
dialog: to tell me what he's like.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Maybe someday I will. See you in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Au domain.
text: Sebastian watches Linda walk away. He glances at the
text: camera and starts to peel off his face.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The elevator door opens. It's empty.
text: SEBASTIAN'S POV - as we push past the guard and down onto
dialog: the street.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Empty street. We hear whistling. Splashes of water splat
text: out from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through
dialog: them.
text: SEBASTIAN'S POV - A car approaches. As it drives by we
text: see Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse.
text: The footsteps stop.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hmmm.
text: We see the footsteps start to head back toward the
dialog: warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Linda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the
dialog: elevator.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (to Marine Guard)
dialog: Forgot something.
scene_heading: INT. STREET IN FRONT OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles
text: toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: What the hell?
text: He breaks into a run. Feet splash water and he races back
text: toward the warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Empty. The elevator door opens and we push out into the
text: hallway. Sebastian's POV
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
text: We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But
text: as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The
text: entire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly
text: approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video
dialog: board.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Pretty clever really. All it does is
text: recycle the signal. He flips this
dialog: switch, it takes a snapshot and that's
dialog: all we see.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Asshole.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: And you think he's violent?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: He killed a dog with his bare hands.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Dogs aren't people. Are we in any
dialog: danger?
text: Linda doesn't know.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Either way, we aren't equipped to
dialog: handle this. We have to inform the
dialog: committee.
text: Everybody murmurs in agreement.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: What if he doesn't come back?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: They'll go after him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who has tonight's shift?
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just
dialog: do what you're doing so he doesn't
dialog: become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll
dialog: go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot
dialog: the committee deal with it.
text: Sebastian's POV - He backs away and races down the hall.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. KRAMER'S HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT
text: The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn
text: in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. Linda's car
text: is parked on the curb in front.
text: We break from a typical establishing shot and as the
text: CAMERA tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S POV
text: We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some
text: bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the
text: Kramer living room.
text: Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across
text: from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it
text: certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and
text: strokes his beard, shaking his head.
text: Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and
text: the three of them head toward the front door.
text: We move away from the window and track toward the front
text: door. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of
dialog: the conversation.
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: I'll call General Caster right now and
dialog: convene the oversight committee
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What do we do in the meantime?
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Just sit tight and wait for my call.
text: Matt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears
text: a the upstairs railing.
speaker_heading: MRS. KRAMER
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Just a little trouble at work.
speaker_heading: MRS. KRAMER
dialog: You coming up?
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: In a minute. I have to make a few
dialog: calls.
text: Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer
text: crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver
text: and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone
text: goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to
text: get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on
text: the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The
text: line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in
text: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: KRAMER (cont'd)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
text: Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door
text: leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to
text: it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling
text: dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings
text: lightly. Kramer steps out.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to
text: the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is
text: open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks
text: around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his
text: pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is
text: visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and
text: the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp
text: cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and
text: his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out
text: his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues
text: a beat until Kramer manages to break free.
speaker_heading: KRAMER
text: Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!
text: As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there.
text: WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling
text: into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one
text: splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped
text: AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And
text: because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two
text: arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface.
text: MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at
text: the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his
text: flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around
text: him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails
text: for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A
text: moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR
text: POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the
text: pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of
text: water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall
text: until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of
text: tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the
text: light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape
text: disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha
text: emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face
text: down in the pool. She screams.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
text: Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: What? No good morning for me? Don't
dialog: you like me anymore?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: That's okay. It's going to be busy
dialog: day.
scene_heading: INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand.
text: They both stare at the phone.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: When did he say held call?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's probably meeting with the
dialog: committee trying to figure out what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm gonna call him.
text: Linda picks up the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?
dialog: (inhales sharply - surprised)
dialog: When? I'm so sorry.
text: Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He's dead. Drowned in his pool last
dialog: night.
text: Linda picks up the phone again and dials.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, General Thompson please. Thank
dialog: you.
text: As she waits the phone line clicks dead.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
text: She clicks on the hookswitch.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Let me see that.
text: He tries it too. Same result.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
text: Intercom's working, but there doesn't
text: seem to be an outside line.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR
text: They waste no time getting to the elevator. Linda and
text: Matt step in.
speaker_heading: LINDA

scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank's fingers fly over the keyboard.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How long before anybody starts looking
dialog: for us?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: There's no set check in procedure. It
dialog: could be weeks.
text: A graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen.
text: Frank highlights the security terminal. Frank hits a few
text: more keys. The screen reduces to a series of numbers.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: You think you can got in?
text: Frank rewrites a few of the numbers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Already in. It was only a second level
dialog: encryption.
text: The Security System specifications pops up.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Some security system.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm
dialog: just extraordinary.
text: Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: But apparently someone is more
dialog: extraordinary than me.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's nothing wrong with the system.
dialog: Our codes have been removed.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Removed? By who?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Here's a clue. Only one code remains.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: FRANK

text: THERMAL POV - The chamber is empty.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: He's not in there.
text: Linda enters the chamber. She notes that Sebastian's face

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us
dialog: where you are.
text: She waits. Then...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian... where are you?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
dialog: You have no idea what it's like. The

dialog: that go.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me.
dialog: Tell me where you are and we can talk
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
dialog: There's nothing to talk about. See ...
dialog: I've done things that can't be undone.
text: A long beep as the intercom clicks off.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian! Sebastian!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want search parties. Thermal goggles

scene_heading: INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian?
text: No response. They push through the door. The room seems
text: deserted. Signs of a struggle. File cabinets opened,
text: drawers tossed.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: This is bad.
text: THERMAL POV - Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight
text: heat signature peeking from the corner.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: There's something over there.
text: Linda moves toward it. Whatever it is its hidden from
text: Matt's POV by the supply cabinet. As Linda gets close she
text: pulls of f her thermal goggles to see...
speaker_heading: JANICE -
text: Her face blue, eyes bulging. An I.V. cord wrapped around
text: his neck. Linda jumps back.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Jesus. Oh my god.
text: Matt rushes over. Sees the lifeless corpse.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What happened?
text: Linda lowers the body to the floor.
speaker_heading: LINDA

text: Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body.
text: Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: We got a big problem here.
text: A lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor.
text: Both Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the
text: thermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt
text: notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out
text: to her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Get everybody to the conference room.
dialog: Now!
text: Matt picks up the phone. Clicks the hookswitch. Clicks
text: the hookswitch again.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Intercom... the phone lines. They're
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Gimme that.
text: She checks the phone, punches some numbers. Nothing.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: It was just working.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What the fuck is going on here?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Matt and Linda head toward the lab.
text: Linda suddenly stops.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Shhh.
text: Linda takes a few cautious steps. Senses something.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Give me the visor.
text: Matt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor.
text: THERMAL POV - Linda checks out the corridor. Empty. Linda
text: takes Matt's hand.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)

speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Linda scans the room with her thermal scope.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: It's clear.
text: Matt, Frank, Janice and Sarah step in, locking the door
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The man has checked out of reality.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What happened? I don't understand.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the
dialog: only ones who knows he exists. If he
dialog: gets rid of us, no one knows and he
dialog: becomes the most powerful man on
dialog: earth.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But he's not a killer.
text: They all look at Linda.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He wasn't. He is now.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Can you fix the elevator? Restore our
dialog: codes?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It'd take hours to crack the
dialog: encryptions.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Right now that sounds like good news.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So what do we do until then. Sit
dialog: around waiting for him to kill us off?
text: Everyone looks around for some leadership. Finally.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: No. We find him, before he finds us.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The group moves quickly, passing under an air vent. As

text: air disturbance drops to the ground.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
text: As they enter...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You sure this'll work.
text: Linda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We designed it to help find the rats
dialog: we kept dropping in year one. They
dialog: were too small for thermal scans.
text: A map of the compound appears on the screen.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Systems hot. Activating motion
text: detectors.
text: Matt toggles a switch. Linda stares at a map of the
text: compound. Blips appear on the display... in the
text: observation room... in the Habitat Area and in one of the
dialog: corridors.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I've got movement in Corridor Six.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's him.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: A shadow edges down the tunnel. It settles for a moment,
text: disappearing completely, then is back on the move. At the
text: tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing
text: passes by.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Carter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a
dialog: locker.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Got 'em.
text: Matt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies. He tosses one to
dialog: Linda.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Check. Check.
text: Her voice echoes from the other unit.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Be careful.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Just watch our backs. Hey Carter,
dialog: ready?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Let's do it.
text: Matt and Carter exit. Linda locks the door behind them.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: Matt and Carter trot toward corridor six.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
text: Linda huddles over the display, tracking the two.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (into Walkie)
text: Take a right at the next accessway.
text: He's working his way back to the
dialog: offices.
text: We see Matt and Carter on one of the working video
text: screens as they push down the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Matt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (Walkie - sotto)
dialog: If we split up, can we trap him on
dialog: corridor eight?
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.0.)
text: If he keeps heading in that direction.
text: Matt nods to Carter. The pair splits, heading down
dialog: separate accessways.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Going Thermal.
text: Matt pulls the visor down over his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
text: Linda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian
text: in a pincer move.
text: Suddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda
text: grabs the walkie.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I lost him. Matt, I lost him.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Matt makes his way forward.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: He probably just stopped moving.
text: But Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly
text: ... approaching a corner...
text: He rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far
text: end of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It's me.
text: Matt pulls off his goggles.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Do you have anything?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How did he get by us?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He couldn't.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sebastian! We're here to help.
dialog: Sebastian.
text: No response. They both don their visors and move forward
text: slightly. Carter holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: There. Behind those pipes. He's not
dialog: moving.
text: Carter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat
text: signature clings to the wall.
speaker_heading: CARTER (cont'd)
dialog: Doctor Caine?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can you hear me?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (into walkie)
text: We see him. But he's not responding.
text: The heat signature doesn't move.
text: Matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer
text: gun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat
text: signature huddles behind pipes.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: C'mon... C'mon...
text: The two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear
text: shot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Covered.
text: Matt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off
dialog: the wall ... Nothing there.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What the...
text: He crosses to the heat signature.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.0.)
dialog: He was there.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Looks like... looks like we're pumping
dialog: out heat...
text: Suddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the
text: air, kicking wildly. SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR BY HIS NECK. He
text: gasps for air.
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.0.)
dialog: I got movement again! He's right on
dialog: top of you!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No fucking shit!
text: Matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the
text: ceiling until he spends his dart rounds.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (choking)
dialog: H...Help... MMmmphg
text: Carter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack,
text: he's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up
text: across his head and his body goes limp.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
text: Linda huddles over the display.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Right on top of you.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Matt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down
text: from the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves
text: through the cloud of steam.
text: Around the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his
dialog: tranquilizer.
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.0.)
dialog: What's going on? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from
text: a head wound.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Linda watches the screen. Two blips, one traveling
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Matt, he's coming toward you.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Matt takes a few steps back.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Got outta there.
text: Matt breaks into a run.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Linda watches one dot chasing the other, down several
dialog: corridors.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He's close!
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: Matt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of
text: footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast
text: doors begin to close.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's
dialog: shutting me in.
text: Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make
text: it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt
text: turns and pulls on his thermals.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Where is he?
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Linda huddled over the screen. Tense.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He's coming right at you!
text: Then checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature
text: dot the tunnel.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: Twenty, maybe thirty feet.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the
dialog: place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must
dialog: be ghosts.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Linda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the
text: room. Sees a heating vent in the corner.
dialog: Beat.
text: She grabs the walkie.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Those signatures ... they're coming
text: from the heating vents.
text: Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm starting to lose resolution on my
dialog: thermals.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Get out of there!
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If the room temperature is the same as
dialog: his body temperature, thermal
dialog: visors'll be no good.
text: Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm going!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Linda...it's not safe.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That's why I'm going.
dialog: (to Frank and Sarah)
dialog: Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to
dialog: the lab. We'll meet you there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Do it.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Matt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt
text: sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But
text: the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt
text: can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore.
text: He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him
text: sweeping the hallway.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...
text: His voice keeps shifting. Matt fires.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Not even close.
text: Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind
text: man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He
text: sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes
text: it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING
text: LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling
text: down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood
text: coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more
text: foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and
text: FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit.
text: Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So... just out of curiosity, how long
dialog: has my best friend been fucking my ex-
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You
dialog: aren't thinking rationally.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk
text: this through. It's not too late.
text: The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder
text: swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm
dialog: your friend.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I'm sorry, but I just feel that our
dialog: friendship is holding me back. I'm
dialog: sure you understand.
text: THE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She
text: pulls him to his feet and through the door.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down
text: the corridor.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This way.
text: They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor.
text: Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side.
text: Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his
text: pulse while Frank takes a protective position.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
text: Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He'll be okay.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's pretty severe. We have to get him
text: to the lab.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's got to be okay.
text: Frank stands frozen.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: For godsakes, help me.
text: Frank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up
text: and carry him down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
text: Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He was going to kill me.
text: Linda pulls him close.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I know. He's gone.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We've got to got out of here.
text: Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter
text: headed toward the Laboratory.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he?
text: Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Habitats.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh god. That's right between us and
dialog: the lab.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: His pulse is faint.
text: Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and
text: presses it against the head wound.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold
dialog: this.
text: She guides Frank's hands to the wound.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Keep applying pressure.
text: Sarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on
text: the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to
text: find a vein.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Don't move your hand until I got back.
text: Sarah heads to the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This'll hold him but he needs blood.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Supply is right down the hall. I'll be
dialog: two seconds.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sarah, wait for the others
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on
dialog: the wound.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Sarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end
text: of the cramped tunnel is the supply room.
text: She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while
text: glancing side-to-side and behind her.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY ROOM
text: Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the
text: supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts
text: through blood bags.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying
text: with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts,
text: Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.
text: A noise behind them. Footsteps.
text: Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white
text: chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the
text: tunnel. But it isn't a human shape.
text: Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws
text: fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry
text: face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ahh! Shit!
text: Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke.
text: Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl.
text: Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which
text: collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty
text: chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape
text: appears, still twitching.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Karl Three. Nice shot.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He's let the animals out. It wasn't
dialog: him we were tracking.
text: Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq
text: gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs
text: are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from
text: her brow.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It won't kill me unless it gets
dialog: infected. You?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Me .... Don't ask about me. If he
dialog: freed all the animals, we could have
text: dozens running around the lab.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So he could be anywhere right now.
text: Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud
text: mist. Nothing else appears.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors
dialog: and pray to God Frank can reprogram
text: the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY ROOM
text: Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door
text: to the fridge/freezer.
text: The DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Frank?
text: She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: (frightened whisper)
dialog: Who's there?
text: She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's
text: starting to panic.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Dr. Caine?
text: She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner.
text: She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to
text: aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an
text: idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the
text: floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the
text: linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming
text: more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more
text: blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she
text: searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement.
text: But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching
text: the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.
text: Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She
text: heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper
text: in her ear.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You missed.
text: Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She
text: tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands
text: struggling against the force.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me
dialog: go.
text: The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: What are you doing? No!
text: Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me!
speaker_heading: FRANK!
text: Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and
text: around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her
dialog: stomach.
text: Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: No... please. Don't do this to me.
text: She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In
text: anguish and in fear.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You.
dialog: The trigger pulls .... Pop!
text: A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's
text: stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly
text: she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless
text: to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is
text: the sound of someone breathing.
text: On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her
dialog: cheek..
text: Almost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation
text: runs across her breast and strokes down her body. The
dialog: sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian
dialog: sighs.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I've always liked your feistiness.
text: Sarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently,
text: accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping.
text: Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the
text: intoxication of power.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Frank applies pressure to the wound, waiting for Sarah to
text: return. Carter's vital signs are weakening..,.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sarah! Sarah!
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you
dialog: let up... Sarah! Sarah!
text: No response. Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go
text: after her. He starts toward the door several times but
text: can't leave Carter. Finally the door opens.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Sarah! I'm losing him.
text: But it's Linda and Matt.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Did you see her?
text: Linda rushes over to check on Carter.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: She went to the supply room. Carter
dialog: needed blood.
text: Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I said no one goes anywhere alone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She didn't listen.
text: She-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He's dead.
dialog: Linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford
dialog: herself the luxury.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: The three of them approach the supply room door slowly.
text: Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints
text: extend down the hallway.
text: They swing open the door.
text: The floor is covered in blood and broken glass. But no
dialog: body.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily
text: jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down
text: the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of
dialog: habitats.
text: All clutch their tranquilizer pistols.
text: The footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastian's
dialog: chamber.
text: They see Sarah's body in the dim light.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh god. Sarah!
text: The group breaks into a run. Linda pushes into the
text: chamber and falls at Sarah's side. Matt cradles Sarah's
text: head. They look for some sign of life as Linda fights
dialog: back the tears.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Her too?
text: Matt nods. Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: This didn't happen. This hasn't
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It happened alright. Now we have to
dialog: deal with it.
text: Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her. She
text: pushes him off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah? And just what are we supposed to
dialog: do now?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Now? Now you die.
text: The three of them whip around.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He's here!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian!
text: Silence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back
text: to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door
dialog: of the Chamber.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.
text: No response. They all their tranq pistols level waiting
text: for some sign. Hearing each other breathe. They slowly
text: move outside the Chamber into the corridor.
speaker_heading: LINDA (CONT1D)
dialog: I don't know if you can understand
dialog: this, but what you're experiencing is
dialog: a psychological breakdown. This isn't
dialog: who you are.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I would say that what I am
dialog: experiencing is psychological
dialog: awareness. I like you being in
text: complete and absolute control.
text: They identify the general area the voice is coming from:
text: Back inside the Chamber! They slowly move toward the
text: Chamber door. With lightning speed they slam the door
text: shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You goddamn bastard! You goddamn
dialog: bastard. You're gonna pay for this.
dialog: I'm going to bring you back to
dialog: visibility and then I'm going throw
dialog: your ass in jail.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: You're never gonna bring me back
dialog: Linda. I never want to come back.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Fuck you!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time
dialog: for old times sake.
text: Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Don't listen to him. It's not worth
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on, Matt. Let's go get the
dialog: elevator back on-line so we can got
dialog: out of this hell hole.
text: Matt gives Linda a kiss...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He does anything, anything at all,
dialog: come get us. I'll be back to check on
dialog: you in five.
text: Matt and Frank head off down the corridor.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Imagine you two, carrying on right
dialog: under my nose. Out of curiosity, what
dialog: did he give you that I couldn't?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man
dialog: than you'll ever be.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber
text: door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If
dialog: that's what you want...
text: Sebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to
text: one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank
text: stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the
text: observation room door swings open slightly.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER
text: Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing
text: moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ...
text: stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead
dialog: Sarah.
text: Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom.
dialog: Its on.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...
text: Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no
text: nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Matt! Frank!
text: Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Matt! Matt! Frank!
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood,
text: his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab
text: wounds with an extension cord around his neck being
text: pulled tight.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Jesus!
text: Linda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the
text: ground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps
text: back and her lips erupt with blood.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: Figured it out? You were always so
dialog: clever.
text: Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his
text: neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda
text: watches him being pulled away.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No!
text: She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is
text: tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart
text: pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing
text: but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads
text: for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: Hang on!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Get out of here!
text: Linda pulls Matt toward the door.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: You won't get away with this. They'll
dialog: find out about you. They'll hunt you
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: The villagers with their torches? Lock
dialog: up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's
dialog: not gonna happen that way.
text: Linda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: See, I've spent all my time down here
text: thinking up this plan. When they find
dialog: you, they'll find a pile of charred
text: corpses. The result of a terrible
dialog: accident, I'm afraid.
text: Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She
text: navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack
text: of light at the front door.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: How can you be so brutal?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
dialog: I guess because I don't have to look
dialog: at myself in the mirror anymore
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Remember that first night I was out? I
dialog: did something bad, just to see if I
dialog: could get away with it. And when I
dialog: did, I realized I could have it all. I
dialog: can kill in broad daylight. And
dialog: nobody's gonna tell the police they
dialog: were fucked by a ghost. Anything I
dialog: desire I can make happen, but not if
dialog: people know.
text: Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She
text: pushes through it and slams it behind her.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Linda pulls Matt along.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Just keep going. I'll fix you later.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY
text: The doors explode open.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
text: Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside
text: the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier.
text: Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.
text: Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls
text: to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now.
text: Linda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and
text: deep.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He surprised us. We weren't
dialog: expecting...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Shhh. Don't talk.
text: BAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against
text: it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks
text: around the room and sees the storage freezer.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: We gotta move. Hang on.
text: Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks
text: on the door and the jam.
text: BAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down
text: next to Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Lin...
text: He entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having
dialog: trouble breathing.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: I can't feel anything.
text: Linda picks up his hand. Grips it tight.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You feel that?
text: Matt smiles.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: A little...
text: She rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs
text: a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then
text: probes the wound.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Your losing blood, but he didn't hit
dialog: the vitals.
text: She looks around.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
text: Sutures and thread.
text: She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room.
text: Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She
text: stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda
text: scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place.
text: Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no
text: avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The
text: door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly. Still.
text: Then she hears the click of the door locking.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE FREEZER
text: CLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five
dialog: degrees, down to negative twenty.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE FREEZER
text: Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints
text: heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and
text: pushes on the door. It won't move.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Goddamnit.
text: Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of
text: duct tape and pulls off a length.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: This is temporary.
text: She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She
text: tapes it, using duct tape.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: You still with me?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Barely.
text: A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air
text: into the freezer.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Just keeps getting worse.
text: Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBER - DAY
text: We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out
text: into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear
text: rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens.
text: The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy
text: tears from her face.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh shit.
text: The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.
text: Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against
text: the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.
scene_heading: INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
text: A drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly
text: folded. Shirt, pants, shoes. They begin to move.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall,
dialog: defeated.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: There's no way out.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: There's got to be.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They say freezing to death isn't so
dialog: bad. You just kinda pass out.
text: Matt's head rolls back.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Matt! MATT!
text: She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but
text: he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting
text: to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the
text: shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she
text: sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then
text: she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the
dialog: shelf.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: We're not dying in here.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the
text: mirror applying make-up to his latex mask.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric
dialog: cord.
text: She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold
text: fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out
text: the plastic tube.
text: She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the
text: stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in
text: the mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up,
dialog: he could pass as normal.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda furiously winds wire into a coil.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists
text: in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian
text: pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the
text: hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he
text: pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping
text: and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch.
text: With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The
text: tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing
text: tumbles over.
text: Sebastian continues down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other
text: end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an
text: outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead
text: lights.
text: A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap*
text: a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch
text: she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: Sebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be
text: hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off
text: the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and
text: begins mixing.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to
text: the lightbulb, socket.
text: Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies
text: against the nearest metal surface. She's made an
dialog: electromagnet.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the
text: centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He
text: takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment
text: and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The
text: vial shatters and...
scene_heading: EXPLODES.
text: A powerful explosion that rocks the room.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FREEZER
text: Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up
text: against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda
text: shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DOOR -
text: We see the lock twitching. Shaking...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE DOOR -
text: Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze
text: and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once
text: soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes
text: herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath
text: hangs as a low cloud of Mist.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes,
text: calculating their combined power in his mind. Then he
text: closes the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands
text: into its timer.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY ROOM
text: The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door
text: swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a
text: supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble
text: every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.
text: She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling
text: his cold body out of the storage locker.
text: She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a
text: trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the
text: paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she
text: does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He
text: heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in
text: front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it
text: reeling with a swift violent kick.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up
text: the tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors.
text: The vault doors open revealing the elevator.
text: The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
dialog: Authorization please?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Caine. One One One One One.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
dialog: Authorization valid. Thank you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sebastian!
text: And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds
text: a oxygen container with a cut line.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: I can't let you leave. Come on out and
dialog: I'll give you one last chance.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't
dialog: hold on to the past.
text: The door starts to shut.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Aaaaaaahhhh!
text: She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A
text: line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator.
text: WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs
text: toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close,
text: she slides. Her foot jamming into it.
text: She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed
text: into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in
text: pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical
text: scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives
text: toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body
text: fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the
text: tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights
text: flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of
text: sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her
text: feet and turns to see...
text: Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a
text: gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned
text: revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like
text: deformed blackened bubble wrap.
text: Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with
text: another shot of flame.
text: Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh God!
text: Linda stalks toward him.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You wanna see God? I'll show you God.
text: Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex
text: and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian,
text: looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the
text: corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering
text: and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose
text: another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and
text: doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks
text: pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the
text: blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he
text: pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb
text: themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet
text: moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable
text: she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing.
text: But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She
text: blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE
text: SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water
text: sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the
text: downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes
text: toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs
text: Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand
text: smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor,
text: she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She
text: crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to
text: her feet and slams her against the wall.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm gonna find everyone in your family
dialog: and kill them-. Your sister... she
dialog: never liked me. I think I'll go after
text: her and her little boy first.
text: Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head
text: cuts open, blood dripping down.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I just wanted you to know that before
dialog: you die.
text: Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses
text: against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath.
text: But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see
text: something also... a watery smudge.
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian
text: slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.
text: Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there.
text: He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he
text: sinks to his knees by Linda.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Thought I'd... thought I'd save you
dialog: for a change.
text: He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Let's got out of here.
text: Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar.
text: He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the
text: way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The
text: conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The
text: VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the
text: current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His
text: blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his
text: skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly
text: electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and
text: more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in
text: and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the
text: sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.
text: Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of
text: chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Nitro...
text: Matt peaks inside.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He said it himself... All they'll find
text: is a pile of charred corpses.
text: She sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face
text: counts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty
dialog: seven...
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He's rigged the centrifuge.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out
dialog: the whole lab.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the
dialog: burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We
text: know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar
text: at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: Grab on.
text: Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls
text: herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Forget about me. You go.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Fuck you. Give me your hands.
text: Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth.
text: She struggles, but they both manage to got him through
dialog: the hatch.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.
text: The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.
scene_heading: INT. VENT
text: Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator.
text: Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the
text: smooth metal surface.
text: From the little light below she can see a maintenance
text: ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube.
text: They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Climb!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Climb!
text: Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right
text: behind him.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are
text: starting to rattle.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
text: Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as
dialog: they can.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: I can't. I'm going to pass out.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Keep moving.
text: He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his
text: wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much
text: further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in
text: from the maintenance hatch below.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY
text: The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The
text: vials shake violently.
text: Then... one of the vials shatters.
text: A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the
dialog: laboratory.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE
text: FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in
dialog: its path.
text: One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the
text: flames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In
text: a wall of fire.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
text: The ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to
text: rumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward
dialog: safety.
scene_heading: INT. EXHAUST VENT
text: The FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it
dialog: also.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNELS
text: More explosions.
scene_heading: CHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
text: THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming
text: into it... The elevator flies upward.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
text: The rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the
text: ladder. They looks down to see...
dialog: The elevator...
text: SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the
text: explosion's SHOCK WAVES.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh God!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Don't look.
text: The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster.
text: Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the
text: walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls
text: herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's
text: pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ...
text: 30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM.
text: When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF
text: FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Move!
text: Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares
text: down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates
text: before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames
text: reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.
text: They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the
text: elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and
text: BEGINS TO FALL.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's coming down!
text: FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete
text: free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it.
text: Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes
text: shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's
text: tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda
text: sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as
text: it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access
text: ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but
text: continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the
text: elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams
text: there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and
text: look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended.
text: There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the
dialog: ladder.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: C'mon. Before it slips.
text: They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the
text: tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed
text: by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs
text: there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed
text: throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her
dialog: leg.
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont'd)
dialog: It's him.
text: She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of
text: dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the
dialog: ladder.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Sebastian, you fuck.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Get off me.
text: Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent
text: dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda
text: tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian
text: grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath.
text: Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks
text: down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She
dialog: lets go!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No!
text: She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam
text: against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a
text: few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below
text: her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But
text: metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet.
text: Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing
text: dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from
text: him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over
text: to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Let go of me.
text: Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into
text: her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand
text: reaches out and strokes her hair.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Remember the day we met? You were
dialog: wearing a red dress and you were so
dialog: pretty. Now... Now look at you.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Get off of her!
text: Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with
text: his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.
speaker_heading: MATT (cont'd)
dialog: Sebastian, stop it.
text: Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try
text: and grab her, help her.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You fucked it all up.
text: Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency
text: brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold
text: of the ladder.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Go to hell.
text: Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES
text: ... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a
text: hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto
text: the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her
text: back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine.
text: Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens
text: roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into
dialog: the sky.
text: An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop
text: out, immediately putting a blanket around her and
text: treating Matt's wounds.
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: We lived.
text: Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin
text: and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground...
text: almost as if something was there.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
