speaker_heading: WOMAN (0.S.)

text: --then DOES. Incredible quickly gages distances, and then
text: dives off the edge, making a spectacular LEAP--

dialog: mind.
text: Bob and the Omnidroid grip each other like wildly

text: ground. Bob is STRAINING, desperate... then something in

dialog: itself.
text: Bob looks down. The ground is splitting into chunks

text: itself wildly to get at him... puncturing itseif again
text: and again and tearing itself apart.
text: Until... sparking and sputtering, it staggers and shuts

scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - OUTER CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING
text: A TRANSPOD arrives and Bob steps out, dressed in a tux.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL
text: Bob opens the door, peeks inside. The hall is massive,
text: with an open terrace that overlooks the tropical forest.
text: In the center of the room is an enormous dining table,
text: placed parallel to a fall of hot LAVA.
text: Bob checks his watch; realizes he’s early. A sudden
text: RUMBLE makes him look up. The LAVA FALL PARTS, revealing
text: a SECRET PASSAGEWAY. MIRAGE emerges.
text: Bob instinctively pulls back, leaving the door opened
text: just enough to watch. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE follows after
text: Mirage, gesturing animatedly. They pause at the entrance
text: to the passageway, their talk too distant to be heard.

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I take it our host is--
speaker_heading: MIRAGE
dialog: I’m sorry. He’s not able to dine with us
dialog: tonight. He hopes you'll understand.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Of course. I usually make it a point to
dialog: know who I’m working for.
speaker_heading: MIRAGE
text: He prefers a certain amount of anonymity.
dialog: Surely you of all people understand that.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I was just wondering... of all the places
dialog: to settle down, why live--
speaker_heading: MIRAGE
dialog: --with a volcano? He’s attracted to
dialog: power. So am I. It’s a weakness we share.
speaker_heading: BOB

scene_heading: MONTAGE: INCREDIBLE AGAIN
text: His self-esteem back, Bob returns home with renewed

text: After he says goodbye to Helen several mornings, clearly
text: pretending to go off to the job he no longer holds at

scene_heading: INT. E'S HOUSE

speaker_heading: CHECKPOINT

scene_heading: EXT. BASE
text: Bob pulls up behind some trees. There are several GUARDS;

text: With sudden RAGE Bob bursts free of his leg cuffs,

text: Bob is yanked back into the grid, his arm cuffs pulled in

speaker_heading: SYNDROME (CONT‘D)
dialog: I knew you couldn’t do it. Even when you

scene_heading: AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER THE OCEAN

text: Violet sits impassively, her long hair streaming in the

scene_heading: NOMANISAN BEACH - EARLY EVENING

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Shh. It isn’t your fault. It wasn’t fair
dialog: for me to suddenly ask so much of you.
dialog: But things are different now. And doubt

speaker_heading: SYNDROME
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIRAGE
dialog: Valuing life is not weakness.

speaker_heading: SYNDROME
dialog: Hey, if you're talking about what

speaker_heading: MIRAGE
dialog: And disregarding it... is not strength.

speaker_heading: SYNDROME
dialog: I called his bluff, sweetheart, that’s

scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: Helen enters a clearing and looks up. A monorail track

text: Helen throws her hands high, stretching them up to the
text: pod passing overhead. It yanks her offscreen.
text: MOVING THROUGH THE TREES
text: Helen hangs suspended beneath the pod on long arms,
text: alternating hands to swing around the support columns.
text: Gaining momentum with each swing, she throws her body
text: above the roof of the car, landing expertly on top.
dialog: 87.
text: ON TOP OF THE POD
text: Helen squints into the rushing wind, sees the track
text: slicing through the dense jungle canopy and leading
text: directly into the base of the towering volcano.
text: A familiar HUM causes her to hide, and she slips down one
text: side of the pod, out of view, as TWO HOVERJETS buzz by.
text: Helen watches the jets descend to a landing strip inside
text: the Volcano just as the pod plunges into a tunnel and--
scene_heading: INSIDE THE TUNNEL - MOVING WITH HELEN ON THE POD
text: Darkness. Suddenly an opening in the tunnel rushes by,
text: and Helen catches a glimpse of the ROCKET... and WHOOSH--
text: the pod is back into a tunnel.
text: Helen stretches her torso out like a sail. It catches
text: wind and she releases from the pod, reforms and drops to
text: the tracks with catlike grace.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BASE ~- TUNNEL ENTRANCE
text: Helen peeks out of the tunnel, looks out at the heavily

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: A rocket?
text: Visible inside the open tip of the rocket sits a huge

scene_heading: ANOTHER CORRIDOR - LATER
text: Two armed GUARDS march past CAMERA. Unseen above them,
text: Helen is stretched thin and hiding between a cluster of
text: pipes which run down the center of the corridor. She
text: watches as the guards exit through a sliding door.
text: She drops like a liquid cat to the floor, and begins to
text: move down the corridor.
text: As Helen passes a metal door, she catches sight of her
text: reflection in its shiny surface, She stops, FROWNS. It’s
text: been a while since her last Supersuit; her butt is a bit
text: bigger than she remembered. She wonders if she should
dialog: lose a few--

dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: A GUARD
text: comes through the door at the far end of the hall. As he
text: enters another junction, we see that Helen has contorted
text: herself, arching perfectly around the door frame.
text: The GUARD doesn’t see her. He slides a CARD KEY through a
text: reader to enter a restricted corridor. The doors WHOOSH
text: open. Directly behind him, Helen silently REFORMS and
text: begins to back through the doorway when the doors behind
dialog: her SLIDE SHUT-~
text: --trapping HELEN'S LEG. She winces, tries in vain to pull
dialog: it free. It’s stuck. Leaving one hope--

text: guard on the palms of her hands, following him into the--
speaker_heading: INNER CHAMBER
text: The guard stops at the ELEVATOR and presses the call
text: button, his back to Helen. Just behind him, stretched far
text: and held upright on one hand, Helen reaches with the
dialog: other for the card key. She almost has it--
scene_heading: AT THE CORRIDOR
text: The DOOR suddenly closes on her stretched torso. Her

scene_heading: RESUME MIDDLE CORRIDOR

text: They level their guns at her. At the same moment--
speaker_heading: BLUE CORRIDOR
text: ANOTHER GUARD (#5) comes upon Helen’s LEG in the closed

scene_heading: RESUME BLUE CORRIDOR

scene_heading: THE RIVER - UNDER THE WATER’S SURFACE

speaker_heading: DASH (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay away from my sister!!
text: Disoriented, the guard swings and--

text: GRINS wickedly... and pulls the trigger--
text: Violet suddenly APPEARS in mid-air, diving in front of
text: Dash as she THROWS A FORCE FIELD around them! A hail of

scene_heading: INSIDE THE FORCE FIELD

text: CHOPS a second passing velocipod-- it PLOWS straight into

text: lifting him high above the ground. Miraculously, Bob has
text: held on to the remote, and he quickly stabs at the
text: buttons, hoping to get lucky.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: With a BOOM one of the bot‘’s limbs RELEASES, sending it--
text: and Bob-- crashing to the ground.
scene_heading: AROUND THE CORNER
text: Violet sees this. She turns to Dash.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: The remote controls the robot!
scene_heading: WITH BOB AND THE OMNIDROID
text: The Omnidroid knows this too, and it fires laser blasts
text: at Bob to try to stop Bob from using the remote. Bob
text: jumps clear, then hears his son from down the street.
speaker_heading: DASH
dialog: Hey, Dad! Throw it! Throw it!!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: GO LONG!!
text: Bob gives the remote a MONSTER THROW, flinging it high
text: into the air and across the river. Dash pivots and takes
text: off after it. The Omni sees Dash and starts firing after
dialog: him
speaker_heading: WITH DASH
text: as he hits the water, jetting across the water’s surface
text: as the Omni fires away. The water EXPLODES around Dash,
text: but he concentrates on the remote, following it into his
text: hands like an NFL receiver.
speaker_heading: DASH
dialog: I GOT IT!!
text: Dash crosses the river and hits the streets on the other
text: side, seemingly home free. But the Omni is still FIRING,
text: and it hits some cars in Dash’s path, igniting their gas
text: tanks. Suddenly Dash is surrounded by a wall of FLAMES!
speaker_heading: WITH BOB
text: He runs toward Helen, who is closer to the Omnidroid.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: HONEY! TAKE OUT ITS GUNS!!
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: hears him. She grabs a heavy MANHOLE COVER, winding her
text: elastic arm around a light pole to fling it-~ like an
text: arrow-- at the OMNIDROID’S gun. Bull’s-eye.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE RIVER
text: What follows amounts to a game of hot potato between the
text: Supers and the robot over the remote:
text: Frozone saves Dash from the circle of burning cars. The
text: Robot sees this and goes after them. With Dash on his
text: back, Frozone races across the river, freezing it in
text: front of him as he goes.
text: The robot JUMPS-- almost on top of them, creating a
text: MASSIVE WAVE and throwing Dash and Frozone high into the
text: air. Thinking fast, Frozone turns the wave into a wall of
text: SNOW. It crashes over the streets, cushioning their fall.
scene_heading: IN THE STREET —- NEARBY
text: The remote clatters to the ground. Bob sees it and runs
text: for it. The bot sees Bob and fires a claw-- catching Bob
text: just as he was reaching for the remote. The CLAW-- with
text: Bob inside-- tumbles end over end down the street. With
text: Bob out of the way, the bot heads for the remote.
text: Frozone ices the robot's path, causing the bot’s metal
text: feet to slip and slide. Helen runs ahead of the bot,
text: stretching herself into a tripwire across the stumbling
text: robot's path. It CRASHES to the street.
text: The bot LOOKS UP. The remote lies on the street just in
text: front of it, easily within its grasp. The bot reaches out
text: with a claw to destroy the remote. The remote magically
text: JUMPS CLEAR. The bot tries again, and again the remote
text: darts away. Riled now, the bot rears up and STABS wildly
text: at the remote with all of its arms. We hear VIOLET
text: shriek, as the remote repeatedly eludes the robot’s
text: grasp: finally tangling its legs so badly that it topples
dialog: over.
text: Vi REAPPEARS, running back to rejoin the group in the
text: middle of the street.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Mom, I got it! I got the remote!
speaker_heading: FROZONE
dialog: A remote? A remote that controls what?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: il7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Violet begins to fiddle with the remote’s CLICK-WHEEL,
text: poking its buttons to no effect. The robot has gotten to
text: its feet and lunges toward them.
text: Violet shrieks and presses the button a last time.
text: ROCKETS FIRE underneath the robot’s clawed feet, lifting
text: the enormous machine into the air.
speaker_heading: FROZONE (CONT'D)
dialog: The ROBOT???
text: Everyone ducks as the robot rockets overhead, crashing
text: into a building at the end of the street. Like a woozy
text: prizefighter, the Omnidroid gets back on its feet.
speaker_heading: DASH
dialog: It's coming back!
text: Dash snatches the remote from Violet, aims it at the
text: robot, spins the click-wheel and presses a button. Behind
text: Dash (and unseen by all) the claws on the robot’s
text: detached arm SPRING OPEN-~ flinging Bob into the air.
speaker_heading: DASH (CONT'D)
dialog: That wasn’t right.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (snatching remote back)
dialog: Give me that!
scene_heading: DOWN THE STREET - WITH BOB
text: He climbs to his feet, muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We can’t stop it...! The only thing hard
dialog: enough to penetrate it is...
text: A thought hits him. He turns, staring at the metal claw.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-itself.
scene_heading: WITH FROZONE, HELEN & THE KIDS
text: Helen has the remote now and is trying to figure it out.
text: The Omnidroid has them all in its sights and is lumbering
text: toward them. The kids are starting to panic.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No, this'll work! This’1ll work!

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: FROZONE
dialog: (re: button, exiting)
dialog: Try the one next to it!
text: Lucius takes off, throwing ice and skating down the
text: street toward the approaching robot. He JUMPS off an ice
text: ramp, his skates CONVERTING into a circular ski-disc in
text: mid-air. He lands, throwing a massive ICE WALL in front
text: of the robot.
speaker_heading: WITH BOB
text: As he closes the claw into a massive arrowhead and starts
text: charging down the street.
scene_heading: WITH HELEN & THE KIDS
text: Helen dials the click-wheel on the remote, pokes a
dialog: button.
speaker_heading: RESUME BOB
text: The back of the claw suddenly FIRES a rocket engine. Bob
text: veers crazily, trying to control it.
scene_heading: RESUME HELEN & THE KIDS
text: She pokes the button again. Now close to the group, Bob’s
text: claw rocket SWITCHES OFF. Bob gets an idea.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wait a minute--!
dialog: (yells to Helen)
dialog: Press that button again!
text: Helen presses a button. The claw blades start to spin.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT'D)
dialog: No-- the other one! The FIRST ONE!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: First button-- got it!
text: The Omnidroid has broken through the first ice wall, and
text: pounding away at a second one. Though Frozone's giving it
text: all he’s got, the robot's starting to get through.
speaker_heading: FROZONE
dialog: HELEN???
text: Helen looks at the remote, gestures at her kids.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: HELEN

scene_heading: BOB (FROM DOWN THE STREET)
dialog: PRESS THE BUTTON!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: NOT YET!
text: The Omnidroid is pounding through the second wall. Bob
text: shouts from behind them.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: WHAT’RE YOU WAITING FOR??!
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: A CLOSER TARGET! YOU GOT ONE SHOT!
text: The Omnidroid SHATTERS the last wall-- it’s almost on top
text: of them. Helen presses the button. The claw-rocket FIRES.
text: Bob aims it directly at the Omnidroid’s metal underbelly--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: EVERYBODY DUCK!!
text: --and RELEASES IT. The giant metal arrow roars overhead
text: and drills clean through the robot’s body, coming out the
text: other side. For a long moment nothing happens. Then the
text: gargantuan machine KEELS OVER and EXPLODES. It’s over.
text: The family looks at each other, stunned. Frozone starts
text: to chuckle. Bob smiles as he looks at his Super family.
text: It feels like his best memories... only better.
text: The seemingly empty city begins to come to life, as
text: people emerge from their hiding places, converging in the
text: street. People begin to spontaneously CHEER the heroes,
text: welcoming the Supers’ return. Two ELDERLY GENTLEMEN stand
text: together in the crowd. One nudges the other.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: See that? That’s the way you do it.
dialog: That's Old School.
speaker_heading: OLLIE

speaker_heading: SYNDROME
dialog: No--1!
scene_heading: WITH FROZONE AND THE INCREDIBLES

speaker_heading: FROZONE

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: FROZONE
dialog: Yeah. Hurt then, too.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS ~ MOVING - DUSK

scene_heading: INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: DICKER
dialog: We've frozen all his assets. If Syndrome

speaker_heading: BOB
