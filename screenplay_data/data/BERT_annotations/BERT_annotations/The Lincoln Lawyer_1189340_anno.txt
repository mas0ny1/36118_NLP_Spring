text: MICKEY HALLER, 40, lawyer-- TIGHT on him, as morning light

scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR (MOVING) IN A HARD RAIN--
text: GRADUALLY FADE IN, under the SOUND of rain &amp; freeway, his

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty-
dialog: Two gets to four thousand miles,
dialog: that's two cars ready, that's
dialog: enough to start the airport runs...
dialog: (then, realizing)
dialog: You gettin' any of this, Mr.
dialog: Haller?
text: Not this morning. Mick watches the rain without seeing it.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Just keep your speed up, Earl.
text: Earl kicks it, passes cars...
text: Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him. Also laptop, cell-
text: phone rack: His back seat is his rolling office. Opens the
dialog: file. Top sheet:

dialog: This is Haller.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE OVER CELL
dialog: Where are you this morning?
dialog:

text: This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers,
text: open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: On my way to Lancaster for a
dialog: calendar call. Why, have you got
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (VAL)
dialog: I got a franchise player is what.
dialog: Reaction Mick: He's heard it before...
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: I mean it, this guy could be money.
text: But he goes before the judge at
dialog: eleven.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Van Nuys by eleven could be hard--
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: But this client, listen Mick, his
text: mother's lawyer just waltzed in
speaker_heading: HERE--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: He's already got a lawyer?--
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: Strictly real-estate, doesn't know
dialog: his ass about criminal. Will you
dialog: listen?
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: GO AHEAD--
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
text: Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the
dialog: family's beach house in Malibu
dialog: against the million in bail...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: A million? What'd they book him on?
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: He picked up a girl last night--
dialog: Whatever went down she ended up
dialog: pretty bad. Cops want Aggravated
dialog: Assault with G.B.I.--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Has the D.A. filed yet?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: No. See? I'm giving you ground
dialog: floor. So make it work for me,
dialog: Mick. Don't let him use the house,
dialog: get him to go for my bond--
text: Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse,
text: there are cars, people-- a traffic jam. To Earl--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Bring me around to the employee's
dialog: gate, I'll talk my way in.
dialog: (into cell, writes)
dialog: I'm at the courthouse. Give me the
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: That would be Louis Roulet...
speaker_heading: (PRONOUNCED ROO-LAY)
scene_heading: R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's not how you spell the wheel
dialog: but I got it, thanks.
speaker_heading: VAL'S VOICE
dialog: Remember: I steered him to you.
speaker_heading: MICK

text: the Judge shows up, as a few PRISONERS are led into the
text: holding pen-- Mick picks out his client, HAROLD CASEY, 30s,
text: lanky, with a ponytail and skull &amp; halo tattoo... Mick tries
text: catching his eye but Harold's clearly avoiding him...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Harold. Hard Case.
speaker_heading: (HAROLD DUCKS)
dialog: Don't hide from your lawyer,
dialog: Harold, you know what I want to
dialog: talk about.
text: Caught, Harold slouches towards him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen. when the judge comes in
dialog: he's going to want to know if we're
dialog: ready for trial...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We are.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We're not and you know why not. You
dialog: haven't paid me. Rule one, remember
dialog: Rule one, Harold? I get paid or I
dialog: don't work.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Don't worry, I have your money...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Right, you have my money, I don't.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It's coming. I talked to my boys.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Harold-- I looked at the list of
dialog: people I trust, and you know what?
dialog: You're not on it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: The law says you can't just quit.
dialog: The Judge won't let you. I looked
dialog: it up.
text: Mick's about to react to this jailhouse lawyering-- when a
text: hush falls, and the JUDGE comes out: ORTON POWELL, 60...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Pay close attention, Harold.
dialog: Goes to his seat...
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER
dialog: Harold's case has been called, Mick stands--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Mickey Haller for the defense, your
dialog: honor. If I may, I'd like to carry
dialog: this over.
speaker_heading: JUDGE ORTON
dialog: Do you have a reason, Mr. Haller?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm having trouble locating a
dialog: witness, your honor. An
text: indispensable witness. A Mr. Green.
text: With emphasis. A look goes between the Judge and Mick.
text: Meantime Harold stares from the pen. The Judge, to Mick--
speaker_heading: JUDGE ORTON
dialog: How much time do you need? Would a
dialog: week be enough?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I hope so, your honor. As your
dialog: honor knows, Mr. Green can be hard
dialog: to track down.
text: A look of understanding. Judge nods--
speaker_heading: JUDGE ORTON
dialog: I'm holding this over pending
dialog: notification from counsel...
text: Then gavels down, for the next case-- As Casey's led off,
text: Mick joins him along the rail-- He hisses--
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That was bullshit, askin' for a
dialog: delay-- I know what that was about.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And so does Judge Powell. He spent
dialog: a lot of years as a defense lawyer,
dialog: so he knows all about having to
dialog: chase "Mr. Green," and he doesn't
dialog: look kindly on defendants who don't
dialog: pay their attorneys. Now do you get
dialog: it, Harold?
text: Casey won't look him in the eye-- RAP MUSIC IN AGAIN, TUPAC'S

speaker_heading: LORNA'S VOICE
dialog: And this is your office.
scene_heading: INTERCUT: LINCOLN (MOVING)/ INT. LORNA'S CONDO -DAY
text: It's a one-bedroom in Studio City, Lorna's 33, redhead,
text: pretty as hell, works at her kitchen table in her bathrobe,
dialog: among breakfast dishes...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Actually I'm in my office. On my
text: way to court in Van Nuys.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: That means Val reached you about
dialog: his customer.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Oh yeah: "This is the franchise,
dialog: Mick." According to Valenzuela
dialog: every case is "the franchise." I'd
dialog: have paid my mortgage ten times
dialog: over by now--
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: It could be he's right. I ran the
dialog: name, the family's got a real
dialog: estate business in Beverly Hills.
dialog: The Times has them down for some
dialog: big house sales, movie-star
dialog: dollars...
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (CONSIDERS)
dialog: Sounds like the media might be
dialog: interested. Call Sticks, tell him
dialog: to show up. Any other calls?
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: A couple of DUI's, I quoted them
dialog: the house number. That's it, you're
dialog: free after Roulet.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Good. Then I can go to County lock-
dialog: up.
text: Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road...
text: while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: You're going to see Gloria. Why do
dialog: you waste time on her, Mickey?
text: Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES,
text: HARLEYS, IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS... They pull up alongside:
text: gang jackets, black leather vests... Big guys...
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Want me to do somethin' about this?
dialog: 'Cause I can.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Ignore them, you're doing fine.
text: FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through
text: window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re "Gloria":
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: What can I say, Lorn, I've got a
dialog: soft spot for redheads. Why do you
dialog: think I married you?
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: The divorce papers called it
dialog: temporary insanity.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Lucky for you there was a cure.
text: When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now--
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Mr. Haller?
text: Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN
text: FRONT. The leader signals Earl to pull off. Mick sees they're
dialog: surrounded. Shit.
scene_heading: EXT. OFF-RAMP FOR VASQUEZ ROCKS STATE PARK - CONTINUOUS
text: The Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot
text: at the crest of the exit. Jagged rocks, craggy peaks.
text: The leader gets off his bike. EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs.
text: Skull &amp; halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo.
text: The "Road Saints." Mick lowers a window.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Counsellor, how's it hanging?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Fine, Eddie, how's it with you?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
speaker_heading: (CASUAL)
dialog: Hard Case called me from the pen,
dialog: he said I might catch up to you.
dialog: Said you're stalling his case til
dialog: you see more green, is that right?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: If you want me to work you've gat
dialog: to pay me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We paid you. Five thousand.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's long gone. I could tell you
dialog: half went to the aerial-photo
dialog: expert. He's going to blow the
dialog: state's case by showing that the
dialog: DEA violated the air space over
dialog: Harold's farm by flying too low...
dialog: but you don't need to know that.
dialog: All you need to know is, we had a
dialog: deal. Time to refill the tank.
text: Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I
dialog: heard you got three more. What's
dialog: one man need with four Lincolns?
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: EDDIE--
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What? You want another five grand?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Ten. I'm flying the guy in from
dialog: Kodak in New York, he wants
dialog: business class...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: And I want Harold back on the farm.
dialog: He's the best farmer we got, if you
dialog: know what I mean...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I don't. And I don't want to.
dialog: Either pay me my money or go with
dialog: the Public Defender the judge finds
dialog: you. Of course he won't know much
dialog: about air space, but--
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We
dialog: want you.
text: He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope.
text: Mick takes it. Starts to count, and realizes:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You had the whole ten ready. What
dialog: if you'd backed me down to five?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This vest got lots of pocket.
text: Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing.
scene_heading: INT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: CAMERA MOVING ON: EIGHT MEN, prisoners in grey jumpers. Six
text: are black. Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky
text: JUNKIE, 40s. The OTHER is a tall young man, somehow polished
dialog: even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Louis Roulet?
text: LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: My name is Michael Haller. I had a
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes-- Mr. Haller--
text: Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell.
text: Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk. Louis approaches,
speaker_heading: FREAKED--
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I-- called you because I need
speaker_heading: SOMEONE--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You want me to represent you for
dialog: your first appearance. I get twenty-
dialog: five hundred for that. We can work
dialog: out what comes next.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr.
dialog: Haller-- I made a mistake with that
dialog: woman, she was setting me up--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Keep your voice down. And don't say
dialog: anything about the case, not til
dialog: I've got you out on bail. Okay?
text: Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm. Louis nods.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand your family lawyer's
dialog: in court?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That's him. Cecil Dobbs.
text: Points to-- DOBBS, balding dignified WASP, a few rows in.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Is he ready to post bail?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He'll do whatever he has to.
text: Mick nods, noting the tinge of desperation in Louis's voice.
text: Takes out a notebook...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay, tell me about yourself. How
dialog: old are you?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Thirty-two...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Ties to the community? You grow up
dialog: here, go to school?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Both. Beverly Hills, UCLA. I work
dialog: for my mother's business...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: "Windsor Estates?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's named for her second husband.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How much did you make last year?
dialog: (when Louis hesitates)
dialog: If I'm going to get you out I need
dialog: to know everything.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: My taxes last year said four
dialog: hundred thousand.
text: Just then, the White Junkie lurches forward towards Mick--
speaker_heading: JUNKIE
dialog: I want a lawyer too, you got a
dialog: card?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: They'll have one for you out there.
dialog: I need you to back up and leave us
dialog: alone. Can you do that, pal?
text: Junkie backs off, does just what Mick says. Impressing Louis.
text: Then Mick, low-voiced--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen. They've put some heavy
dialog: charges on you. The DA will
dialog: probably ask for No-Bail...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No bail?
text: Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I said they're going to ask it.
dialog: When was the last time you were
dialog: arrested?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So if I checked your record--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: --you'd find parking tickets.
text: Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared,
text: fragile -- but sincere. He sputters--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: This whole thing is--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We're not talking about the case,
dialog: remember? Not even to the judge.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don't I even say "Not guilty?"
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Today's about setting arraignment,
dialog: period. You say nothing.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Are you going to get me out?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm gonna try, Louis.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: One more thing: There are lots of
dialog: lawyers. Why pick me?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I.. remembered your name from some
dialog: case in the papers...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: What case?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: A drug case, I don't know.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You remember the name or anything?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No-- but you got the evidence
dialog: thrown out against some guy-- Does
dialog: it matter?
dialog: (when Mick hesitates)
dialog: I need your help, Mr. Haller.
dialog: Off Mick, GO TO,

text: Maggie's in a navy suit, raven-black hair: smart and strong
text: and a beauty. Coming up behind her--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Are you the prosecutor who used to
dialog: have the Roulet case?
text: She starts to smile-- until his emphasis registers.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Don't tell me. Son of a bitch,
dialog: Haller.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Rules are rules.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I wanted this one...
speaker_heading: (YIELDS)
dialog: Alright I'll go quietly. But after
dialog: today's hearing, if you don't
dialog: object.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Depends. You going for no-bail?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That won't change with the
dialog: prosecutor. Not with what your guy
dialog: did.
text: With which she shows him the photo: gruesome.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: If he did it.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Sure. "If." They only picked him up
text: in her home with blood all over
dialog: him, but it's a valid question...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I love it when you're sarcastic.
dialog: Can I at least see the arrest
dialog: report?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Get it from whoever takes over. No
dialog: favors on this one.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: Mick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How's Hayley?
text: A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting
dialog: away the things on her desk...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: She's good. She likes the things
dialog: you send her but would rather you
dialog: show up yourself...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How about this weekend?
text: This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight.
dialog: Only Mick-- don't cancel on her.
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: A TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he

text: FRONT OF THE JUDGE...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Judge, there is no way the state
dialog: can claim my client is a flight
speaker_heading: RISK--
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: With resources like this man has,
dialog: it's always a risk-- let alone the
dialog: fact that the victim was brutally
speaker_heading: ASSAULTED--
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Ms. McPherson, the extent of her
dialog: injuries are not the point. I'm
dialog: setting bail at a million
dialog: dollars...
text: Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances--
scene_heading: WE'RE-- INT. DOORS TO THE COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us

speaker_heading: MICK

speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: There's the lawyer-guy, you get him

text: MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY
text: CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Cecil Dobbs?
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: Mr. Haller.
dialog: (They shake hands.)
dialog: It was depressing to see the boy
dialog: caught up in that cattle call...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Boy?
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: I've represented the family so long
dialog: I think of Louis that way.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: He did look a little frail. My
dialog: advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix
dialog: you up with a bond and take "the
dialog: boy" home.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was
dialog: thinking of putting up property...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No good. Assessing it will take
dialog: days. By then Louis might be
dialog: carrying somebody's child.
dialog: (before Dobbs can argue)
dialog: So just tap Val for the bond,
dialog: spring Louis, and take him to your
dialog: office. We'll meet there at Four.
text: And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to...

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yep. Media's already picked us up.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the
dialog: press...
text: Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I saw you in there filming. What's
dialog: your name?
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN
dialog: Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks."
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You freelancing on this, Sticks?
speaker_heading: STICKS
dialog: Your client's got profile, I figure
dialog: I can sell it to local news.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: STICKS
dialog: 'Scuse me?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How much will they pay you for what
dialog: you shot today?
speaker_heading: STICKS
dialog: That depends. Seven, seven-fifty.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Suppose we take it off your hands
dialog: for eight.
text: Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Or do we make it a thousand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
text: Sticks hesitates no longer. Takes the tape from the camera
text: and hands it to Mick... who's already counting out money from
dialog: the roll of cash Ted gave him. To Dobbs--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I can expense this, right?
speaker_heading: DOS
dialog: Of course. Absolutely.
text: Sticks takes the money, goes. Dobbs, impressed, beaming now--
speaker_heading: DOBBS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't
dialog: my choice. You were Louis's.
dialog: Frankly I'd never heard of you. But
dialog: maybe I should have. Seems to me
dialog: I've underestimated you.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Then let's talk about my fees.
dialog: (before Dobbs can reply)
dialog: I'll need a hundred thousand up
dialog: front. Working off five-fifty an
dialog: hour, it'll come to another hundred
dialog: thousand if we go to trial. That's
dialog: estimating the trial at a week.
dialog: Appeals, we start over.
text: Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb.
text: Mick, hand on the door--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)

text: Mick says nothing. Gaze out the window. Then...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I've got an hour til he's released.
dialog: Til then I'll be at county. With
dialog: Gloria.
dialog: (before she says anything)
dialog: Any calls?
speaker_heading: LORNA'S VOICE
dialog: Only Sticks. He says he owes you
dialog: five hundred next time he sees you.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah he does.
scene_heading: INT. VISITING AREA, COUNTY DETENTION CENTER, DAY - ON:
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Mickey Mantle. You're going to bat
dialog: for me again?
text: GLORIA, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets
text: the arriving Mick in a client/attorney booth.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You don't even know who the Mick
dialog: was. You don't look good, Gloria.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Thanks. For coming, not for the
dialog: compliment.
text: Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Something new for you, getting
dialog: booked on possession of coke, along
dialog: with the usual.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Dumb, I know. A guy paid me with
dialog: it, I had it on me when I went to
dialog: my next.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And your next was a cop.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: She shrugs/nods. Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a
dialog: break... while...
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Can't you get me into one of those
dialog: rehab places where they get you
dialog: straight?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We did a pre-trial rehab, last
dialog: time. The D.A. won't go for it
dialog: again. You may have to do some jail
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah you can. They've got programs
dialog: in jail, too. Look, you've had a
dialog: long run. Maybe after this you can
text: finally get out of the life.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: And do what? Have kids and plant
dialog: flowers? Look at me.
text: Mick doesn't have an answer. Opens a notebook, gets to work.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay, tell me what happened.
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on
dialog: Santa Monica...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: The one who paid you coke instead
dialog: of money?
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: He had a shitload in there. I saw.
text: Which gets Mick's attention. His wheels suddenly turning...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Do you know who he was?
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: No. He reached me on my website. He
dialog: was Mexican or something.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (writes, likes this--)
dialog: Did you screen him?
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: Don't I screen 'em all?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: off what, his driver's license?
speaker_heading: GLORIA
dialog: No, his passport. I think his name
dialog: was, Hector, or--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Hector what? Last name. Think.
scene_heading: INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING, L.A. - D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Moya. Hector "Arrande" Moya is what
dialog: you get if you run a trace. He's
text: Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand
dialog: Jury indictment down in Florida.
dialog: The DEA wants him for drug
dialog: trafficking.
text: The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Leslie? They want him a lot.
speaker_heading: LESLIE FAIRE
dialog: And your girl's looking to trade?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: She'll give you his motel and room
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: LESLIE FAIRE
dialog: She'll also have to testify on the
dialog: coke.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's a No. Location only. Your
dialog: guys take it from there. My
dialog: investigator says Hector hasn't
dialog: checked out yet.
speaker_heading: LESLIE FAIRE
dialog: (as she weighs it)
dialog: What's she want in exchange?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You drop charges, and all she does
dialog: is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation. The
dialog: facility at USC-Med would be nice.
dialog: (when she hesitates)
dialog: Or do I take this straight to the
dialog: Feds?
text: Which, though veiled, is a threat. Leslie hates this.
scene_heading: INT. DOBBS'S CENTURY CITY LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: HIGH FLOOR, TALL WINDOWS. DOBBS, ON THE CUT, lets in MICK.
text: Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way
text: to the Pacific, as the OTHERS enter behind him: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: (distinguished, 60), LOUIS (suit, silk t-shirt, Ray-bans.)
text: Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin.
dialog: Mr. Levin's my investigator.
text: Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long,
text: blonde-wood conference table. Mick can't help run his hand
text: over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the-
dialog: fly office... Dobbs, to Mrs. Windsor...
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr.
dialog: Haller highly enough for his
dialog: performance in court this morning.
text: Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased.
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I have a check for you, Mr. Haller.
text: And slides it towards him in an envelope. Mick, tries not to
text: seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside--
text: ANGLE, we glimpse the amount, the zeroes... $100,000... BUT:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm going to need that to come from
dialog: your son, Mrs. Windsor.
dialog: (slides it back to her)
dialog: You can give him the money so he
dialog: can write the check. But I want the
dialog: check to come from Louis. He's my
dialog: client and that's got to be clear
dialog: from the start. No offense.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
text: She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS.
text: He takes out a checkbook, writes. Mick continues to Mary--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. I'll expect you to
dialog: support your son through this in
dialog: other ways. If you're willing.
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: Don't be silly. I'll back my son
dialog: come hell or high water. These
dialog: ridiculous charges. That ridiculous
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: It's good to know you'll be there
dialog: when we need you.
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: But not now, is that it?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We'll be going over the case. The
dialog: D.A. could make you testify about
dialog: what you hear. Attorney privilege
dialog: doesn't cover you.
text: Mary Windsor's motionless a moment. Rather than respond, she
dialog: simply rises. To Louis--
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I will see you at dinner.
text: And goes. Dobbs gets the door for her. When she's gone:
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: My mother built a good business.
text: From the ground up.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I've got no trouble believing that.
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I say we get started.
text: All agree, they sit, Mick starts up--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Our first choice is whether we
dialog: waive our right to a speedy trial.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No. I want this behind me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You sure? You can stretch things
dialog: out, enjoy your freedom. Most
dialog: clients...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Guilty clients, you mean. I want
dialog: this over.
text: Mick's struck by how firm.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Fine. We go to trial right away.
dialog: Puts more pressure on the D.A.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: Or maybe the case never even goes
dialog: to trial.
text: (They look at him.)
dialog: Our firm's clout is considerable.
dialog: Pressure can be brought to bear--
speaker_heading: MI C K
dialog: Don't kid yourself, Cecil.
dialog: (to Dobbs and Louis)
dialog: No way the state is dropping these
dialog: charges. In fact, they've already
dialog: upped them-- to improve their
dialog: negotiating position.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: There won't be any negotiating.
dialog: (before Mick can speak)
dialog: No plea bargain, no nothing. I'm
dialog: not going to jail for something I
dialog: didn't do.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: It might not be jail.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Even if I walk. I'm innocent and if
dialog: there's a trial I want to get on
dialog: the stand and tell the jury I'm
dialog: innocent. If that's a problem we
dialog: can part company right now.
text: Mick looks at the young man. Evaluating. Then...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Time to tell me what happened.
text: Louis. Removes his Ray-Bans. SUDDENLY:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
text: WE'RE IN A BAR (MORGAN'S, STUDIO CITY)... NIGHT...
text: CAMERA MOVES among L.A. yuppies, night-players. The scene's
text: low-key but sexy, expensive... Waitresses roam...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O.)
dialog: I was having a drink at Morgan's,
dialog: Ventura Boulevard...
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.)
dialog: Morgan's, that's a singles bar,
dialog: right?
text: Camera finds LOUIS at the bar, checking out the action...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O. )
dialog: Right, nice place, good for pick-
dialog: ups. That's why I was there.
dialog: Looking to get laid, pure and
dialog: simple.
dialog: BACK TO, LAW OFFICE
text: Mick, to Raul, who's holding a dark blue file:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Raul, what's the file say about the
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: (reads-- Chicago accent)
dialog: Regina Campo, goes by "Reggie."
dialog: Twenty six. An actress and a
dialog: telephone solicitor.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: And hoping to retire. Soon as she
dialog: sues my client.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (ignores Dobbs; to Louis)
dialog: Did you know her before last night?
scene_heading: BACK TO, MORGAN'S, NIGHT... HAND-HELD, CLOSE ON...
text: REGGIE CAMPO, mid-20s, the finest sexual kitten imaginable,
text: humor enlivening her face and eyes and mouth, moving...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O.)
dialog: I'd seen her around, but never
dialog: spoke to her. She was always with a
dialog: guy. She was with one last night.
text: She slows as she passes Louis, whispers, her lips brush his
text: face as she discreetly hands him something...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V. O.) (con t' d)
dialog: She just laid her address on me. On
text: a napkin.
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.)
dialog: But she was still with a guy?
text: Reggie returns to: THE GUY at the bar: 40s, hard like a vet.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.0.)
dialog: I got it that she wasn't too into
dialog: her date. She told me he'd be gone
dialog: by ten if I was interested.
dialog: BACK TO, LAW OFFICE
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't keep the napkin. I work in
dialog: real estate, I remember addresses.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Raul. Check that file you've got
dialog: and see if the Police report has
dialog: any of this.
text: While Raul looks, Mick explains to Louis and Dobbs, can't
dialog: hide some professional pride in Raul Levin's work--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Raul's already worked us a little
dialog: miracle. He's managed to score a
dialog: copy of the discovery file,
dialog: everything the D.A.'s got. They'd
dialog: have to turn it over eventually but
dialog: it could have been weeks.
dialog: Under which, Raul's checked the blue file, and...
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Nope. They don't have the other
dialog: guy. They don't even have the bar.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: All they've got is, Louis shows up
dialog: and beats the crap out of her?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That is such bullshit--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Just keep telling me.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT, REGGIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX... NIGHT...
text: LOUIS is sitting in a Porsche Carrera...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.0.)
dialog: I didn't want to walk in on
dialog: anything, so I got there early.
text: His POV, shadow-figure of Hard-Guy approaching in the dark..
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I waited til the guy came out.
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.)
dialog: You see what he was driving?
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.0.)
text: A Corvette. Yellow.
text: Hard-Guy gets in the Corvette, pulls out.
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.)
dialog: So he leaves, and you go in...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/ DOOR TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT... HAND-HELD...
text: Arriving up the stairs is Louis, knocks. A little while, and
text: the door opens a crack. Reggie, part of her face, peers out.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O.)
dialog: She saw it was me...
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS AS LOUIS ENTERS HER APARTMENT...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V. O.) (coast' d)
dialog: The hallway inside was tight. I had
dialog: to walk past her, y'know, so she
dialog: could close the door. So I had to
dialog: turn my back to her.
text: We SEE this, she's behind him... as we hear, simply...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
dialog: Then, that was it.
scene_heading: BACK SUDDENLY TO, LAW OFFICE. MICK, SURPRISED.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: What was what?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She hit me with something and I
text: went down. It got black fast.
text: SUDDEN POP TO, LOUIS STRUCK FROM BEHIND... Blacking out as he
dialog: tumbles... BACK TO,
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE
text: Conference table's silent. All looking at Louis.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay then. What do you remember
dialog: next?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Waking up with two guys sitting on
dialog: me. Holding me down.
scene_heading: QUICK CUT TO, REGGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM...
text: TWO GUYS straddle Louis who is face down on the floor.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
text: Couple of faggots from next door.
dialog: BACK TO, LAW OFFICE
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Police report has them, homosexual
text: couple from down the hall...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Like I said. Faggots.
text: To which Raul says nothing. After a beat--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Go on, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I was still foggy when the cops
dialog: came...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
text: BACK TO, LIVING ROOM... Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind
text: him, COP looms over...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O.) (cont'd)
text: She was on the couch telling all
dialog: these lies...
text: PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE
text: COP (MAXWELL), through sobs, still frightened--
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: .he was like an animal! He said
dialog: he'd rape me and kill me... then
dialog: rape me again when I was dead...
text: Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O. )
dialog: That's when I saw she'd set it up.
text: BACK TO, LAW OFFICE.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Set it up how?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Put blood on my hand. My left hand.
dialog: But I'm right-handed, I'd use my
dialog: right if I was going to... punch
dialog: someone. Which is crazy.
text: Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air. Inept.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: Louis never hit anyone in his life.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: What she did made sense. It's the
text: right side of her face that was
dialog: hit, she had to bloody your left.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Louis: You said she opened the door
dialog: a crack. Did you see her face?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Not all of it...
text: CUT TO, DOOR OF REGGIE'S APARTMENT... OPENING AGAIN...
text: It open a crack. Enough for her look out, half her face...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
text: Mainly her eye. Her left eye.
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.0.)
dialog: That's it!...
text: BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. Raul... mimes the opening of the door...
speaker_heading: RAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: She already had the injuries, on
dialog: the right. She was hiding it from
text: him when he steps in...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And then she clocks him?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So our case is, she beat herself
dialog: up?
text: Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE...
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: We're saying, she pounded her face
dialog: into hamburger meat, or had her
dialog: boyfriend do it, hoping some far-
dialog: off day a jury would give her a big
dialog: fat reward?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She must have.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
text: Of course. She saw his Porsche, his
dialog: Rolex, it's known the family has
dialog: money... I'll wager she's already
dialog: filed in civil court.
dialog: Mick. Thinks. Then, to Raul--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay, the police report. Let's hear
dialog: how Reggie tells it.
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. DOORWAY TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: She's opened a crack, peering out... Raul reads...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: RAUL (V. 0. )
dialog: "According to the victim, she was
dialog: at home alone when the suspect
text: presented himself at the door as
dialog: someone she knew..."
text: Louis is there, talks MOS. Reggie opens the rest of the way.
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.0.) (cont'd)
dialog: "Upon letting him in, she was
dialog: immediately struck..."
text: WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face,
text: bloodying her, but it's too fast &amp; jumbled for details...
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.)
dialog: Does it say he knocked her down?
text: She falls... Louis flies down on top of her...
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.0.)
dialog: Yeah, then straddled her. "Held the
dialog: victim by the neck until she agreed
dialog: to cooperate..."
text: Louis does as described, strangle-hold... Eventually lets her
text: up, turning her toward the bedroom. And...
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: "The suspect maintained a position
text: behind her, holding a knife against
dialog: the left side of her throat..."
scene_heading: CLOSE, HAND-HELD, KNIFE-POINT TO NECK, SLIGHT CUT, BLOOD...
scene_heading: RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE.
text: Raul takes something new from the file: PHOTO OF A BLOODY
text: KNIFE. Sharpened to a point. Louis looks at it. Seethes.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This isn't my knife.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Raul, are his prints on there?
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: That's what the report says. I'm
dialog: not surprised, if she put blood on
dialog: his hands she's gonna put prints on
dialog: his knife...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I told you, it's not "my" knife!
text: Mick ignores, still intent on Raul's reading...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay, how's she say he went down?
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: "As Ms. Campo entered the hallway,
text: she pushed the intruder backwards
text: into a large floor vase..."
scene_heading: GO TO, INT. REGGIE'S APARTMENT - LOUIS FALLING...
text: And Reggie scurrying free... STAY ON the fallen Louis as...
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.0.)
dialog: "Realizing her attacker would catch
text: her at the front door, she ducked
text: into the kitchen and seized a
dialog: bottle of vodka..."
text: Louis, struggling to his feet, HIT ON THE HEAD from behind..
speaker_heading: MICK (V. D. )
dialog: And clonked him when he got up?
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.0.)
dialog: That's how she tells it.
scene_heading: RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Those are all lies, this is bull--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: If everything she said is a lie,
dialog: this will be the easiest case ever.
dialog: I'll tear her apart and throw her
text: entrails into the sea. But Louis...
dialog: (He moves closer, for:)
dialog: You swear it's all lies? Is there
dialog: anything you aren't telling me?
text: Mick's eyes burn into him. Louis answers simply.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Nothing.
text: Mick holds him in a long, hard, assessing stare. Over which,
dialog: eventually, we PRE-LAP--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: MICK (V.O.)
dialog: The way Louis tells it...
scene_heading: INT. BAR (SMOKEHOUSE) - NIGHT - THE ENTRANCE
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: .it's just quirky enough.
dialog: Mick and Raul coming out, after having a few. It's a lawyers'
dialog: hangout at this hour, others are coming/going...
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Quirky enough for what?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: To be true. Maybe it went down just
dialog: like he says.
dialog: (off Raul's look)
dialog: Anyway there's a. chance.
text: In a party of law-types, we GLIMPSE MAGGIE, who catches sight
text: of Mick in the doorway... while Raul mulls what Mick said...
speaker_heading: RAUL
text: An innocent client. Jeezus.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah. But you know what my father
dialog: said about innocent clients...
text: Maggie's overheard this, gives the answer.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He said there's no client as scary
text: as an innocent man.
text: Mick, seeing her, smiles and continues, a little tipsy...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's right. Because if you screw
text: up and he goes to prison, it scars
dialog: you for life. There's only one
dialog: verdict. You've got to put an N.G.
text: on the board.
speaker_heading: (ADDS)
dialog: Hey Mags.
text: She reads the state he's in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Raul, if you let a man drive in his
dialog: condition I think I can charge you
dialog: both.
text: The guys look at each other. Maggie swipes the keys--
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll drive him to his house.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: And how will you get home?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: My friends brought me. I'll keep
dialog: the car, he can pick it up at my
dialog: place in the morning.
speaker_heading: (TO MICK)
dialog: Get in.
text: And she gets in the driver's side, waits. Mick to Raul--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay, you know the moves. Make the
dialog: rounds, check out Morgan's Bar...
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: And Mr. Corvette...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And Regina Campo. The way Louis
dialog: says she came on's got me
dialog: wondering.
text: Mick gets in and closes the door. As Maggie starts it up and
text: pulls away, and we SEE the "NT GLTY" PLATES again... go to...
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - NIGHT
text: Ride in silence. Then Mick, mischievous, turns on the RAP.
speaker_heading: TUPAC
dialog: "God bless the dead and buried
dialog: nigga,
dialog: Don't worry if you see God first,
dialog: Tell him shit got worse..."
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You've got to be kidding me.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Earl lays this stuff on me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Where is Earl tonight?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I never keep him this late.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hasn't he worked your fee off yet?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: A while ago. But he likes driving,
dialog: keeps him out of trouble... He's
dialog: taking courses, too, in music.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You can't tell by this stuff.
text: She snaps the rap OFF.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You get used to it. Besides, Tupac,
dialog: he helps me understand my clients.
dialog: Most of them go to school on his
speaker_heading: LYRICS--
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Not Roulet.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Not Louis, no. Louis is my
dialog: franchise player, he pays for all
dialog: the rest...
text: After a beat... Office gossip...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I heard Smithson assigned Ted
dialog: Minton to your case.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He's brand new. Bright, though.
dialog: Smithson's protegee. Naturally.
text: Georgetown, buys his suits at
dialog: Brooks, above all he's a guy...
text: Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms... Moonlight
text: lines her profile. Made self-conscious by his watching her,
text: she moves her hair from her face. Beyond pretty: Beautiful.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Lorna made me my schedule.
dialog: Saturday's fine to take Hayley.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob
dialog: movie...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm all over it. How's she doing?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'll know when I drop you and get
dialog: home to relieve the sitter...
dialog: (catches him looking)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MICK

dialog: just came back here--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's okay, Robin. You can go.
text: Robin exits. Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and
text: rings off. Looks annoyed at Mick.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I was setting up a showing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: There won't be any showings in

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: It's a supermax prison where they
dialog: send violent sex offenders. You'll
dialog: fit in real good in your loafers.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to
dialog: go and see the new prosecutor,
dialog: who's doing everything he can to
dialog: put you away, and now I find out
dialog: you've been lying.
dialog: (before Louis can deny)
dialog: Tell me about Reggie Campo.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What about her? I've told you--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You didn't tell me. That you were
dialog: going to pay her for sex.
dialog: (off Louis's surprise)
dialog: You think it's hard to find out
dialog: somebody's not Snow White?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Alright yes, I was going to pay.
dialog: She wrote down a price on the
dialog: napkin, four hundred dollars...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Why didn't you tell me this in
dialog: Cecil's office?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I didn't want my mother to know.
dialog: Cecil tells her everything. And can
dialog: we keep it down? Her office is on
dialog: the other side of that door...
text: Mick looks at Louis's concern. Believes it. Easing up...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: This changes things. You see that,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm not a lawyer. Explain it to me.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Alright I will. You know that guy
dialog: on the Venice boardwalk? The one
dialog: who has all those plates spinning
dialog: on sticks?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What does this have to do with--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Just listen. A bunch of spinning
dialog: plates: that's the state's case. In
dialog: the middle is a big one. It's a
dialog: fucking platter. And if that falls
text: it takes the others down with it.
dialog: (He gets closer to Louis)
dialog: The big plate is the victim. The
dialog: only witness against you. I knock
text: her down, the act is over and the
text: crowd goes home. No trial.
text: Mick has Louis' attention now.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You can make this trial go away?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We've lost time. You concealed from
dialog: me the fact that could do it. It
dialog: comes down to why.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Why what?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Why would a guy with a Porsche and
dialog: a Rolex need a knife to get sex
dialog: from a woman who sells it anyway?
dialog: The answer is, he wouldn't. And
dialog: when you see that you see the set-
text: up, the trap. And suddenly it's the
dialog: defendant who looks like the
dialog: victim.
text: Louis gets it. Penitent.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're going to the prosecutor now?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted
dialog: Minton. He wants to give me the
dialog: discovery file. Poor guy doesn't
dialog: know that Raul already got it. He's
dialog: new to felonies but he's no dope.
text: When he hears his vic's a hooker
dialog: he'll know we've knocked all his
dialog: plates down.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Then it'll be over?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No promises, Louis.
text: Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to
text: the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised
dialog: to see Haller.
speaker_heading: MRS. WINDSOR
dialog: I didn't know you were here. Is
dialog: there news?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: There will be, Mother.
text: And puts out a hand to Mick. Grateful. Hesitating half a
text: beat, Mick shakes it and goes...
text: Louis and his Mother. Regard each other. Face to face.
scene_heading: INT. VAN NUYS CIVIC CENTER - D.A.'S OFFICE, RECEPTION - DAY
text: Mick in a chair. Impatient. Legal secretaries, prosecutors,
text: etc., come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, DETECTIVE
text: KURLEN, fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers--
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Are these for A.D.A. Knight?
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: Yeah, and they're my only copies.
dialog: I'll wait while you copy them.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I'll have to ask her...
text: But, he holds them back. Stares. She yields...
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll run them for you now.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: Just what I wanted to hear.
text: She goes. Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late--
speaker_heading: KURLEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, look who's come callin'.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Detective Kurlen.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: (re papers he dropped off)
dialog: Puttin' a case away. Guy drowned
text: his neighbor's kid in a tub to see
dialog: what it felt like. It won't shock
dialog: you to hear he was high...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Thanks for clearing that up.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: If he gets San Quentin, maybe he
dialog: can look up your boy Jesus
dialog: Martinez.
text: Mick bristles at this reference. Turns away again. To a
scene_heading: PASSING SECRETARY:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (to a passing secretary)
dialog: Is Minton back yet?--
speaker_heading: SECRETARY #2
dialog: He'll be a few more minutes, sir.
text: Kurlen, seeing he's drawn blood, continues to needle.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: How's he doin' up there, anyway? He
dialog: make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me
dialog: team?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I haven't talked to him.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: I guess once they plead guilty,
dialog: they're not much use to you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: KURLEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (rubbing it in)
dialog: He went down forever, right?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: He got life, but he'll be out. I
dialog: don't know when.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: Too bad. 'Cause his victim, Martha
dialog: Renteria? She's dead forever.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You don't have to remind me you
dialog: were lead dick on that.
text: Kurlen grins. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: How's a guy like you sleep at
dialog: night? With the scum you represent.
text: Mick's had enough. Moves closer. To tell him a story.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I had a client once, he decapitated
text: his ex-wife, then kept her head in
dialog: the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
speaker_heading: (DISGUSTED--)
dialog: Naturally you got him off.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: The D.A. got greedy. Tried to pile
text: on two unsolved murders, trick up
dialog: evidence to stick my guy with them.
dialog: It's called the justice system, we
dialog: don't do things that way.
speaker_heading: KURT. EN
dialog: So your guy's out walkin' around.
dialog: He ever do it again?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I don't know. I never heard of him
dialog: after that.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: But he could have. Fuck you,

speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (THE POINT:)
dialog: No. Fuck the D.A.

text: Before Kurlen can react-- TED MINTON arrives. Fresh-faced,
dialog: Ivy League, 30.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Mr. Haller?
text: (Mick stands, relieved.)
dialog: Sorry you had to wait. I hope it'll
dialog: be worth your while.
text: He gives Mick a thin, white-covered file from a briefcase.
text: Mick, leaving the still-sneering Kurlen behind, takes the
text: file and follows Minton off-- tapping the file with a finger--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Looks kinda thin for a discovery
speaker_heading: FILE--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes well-- We can go to my office--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I've got a question first.
text: He takes from his pocket: Raul's DISC. The DVD Raul gave him.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: You have something to play this on?
scene_heading: INT. TED MINTON'S OFFICE - AT HIS DESK - MOMENTS LATER
text: ANGLE the young prosecutor's face as he watches the bar-tape.
text: And Mick watching him for his reaction...
text: When it's done, Ted clicks it OFF. Not much reaction at all.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What else do you have?
text: The simple, polite question throws Mick.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Look Ted, let's cut the bullshit.
dialog: Not only is your so-called victim a
dialog: working prostitute, but we've got
dialog: her on tape soliciting my client!
dialog: Maybe you're new, but you gotta
dialog: know how hard it's gonna be to
dialog: convince a jury a guy would have to
dialog: rape a hooker to have sex with her--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Nothing you're telling me's going
dialog: to change my offer.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Offer? You're making an offer?
dialog: going forward?
text: Not the way Mick thought it would go. Ted goes on...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We'll drop the charges to Assault
dialog: with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual
dialog: Battery. The guidelines put him at
dialog: seven years, maybe he'll do four.
text: Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time...
speaker_heading: MICK

scene_heading: EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - KID'S AREA, PONY RIDES - SATURDAY

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Got you the good stuff, Hayley...
speaker_heading: HAYLEY
dialog: Thank you, Earl.
text: Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds
dialog: it for Hayley.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Man's got your ride ready...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Go on, I'll hold your ice cream.
text: Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and
text: The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring...
text: Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the
text: ice cream, returns to his files--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
text: There's something right in front of
dialog: me and I'm not seeing it.
text: On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the
text: blue-covered one Raul gave him. The white-covered from Ted.
text: Mick starts turning pages, compares... The same, the same...
text: When he turns the next one over:
text: It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
dialog: the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office.
text: Turns to the matching page from Ted's file. Reaction Mick...
scene_heading: HARD CUT TO, EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER
text: In the parking lot, pulls up. Louis is in front of the club,

speaker_heading: HAYLEY
dialog: You said we',re going to the movies!

speaker_heading: MICK

scene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS
text: Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in
dialog: order not to be seen or heard-- eager--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What's happened? Is it over? You
dialog: said it would be over by now--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That was before I found out you
dialog: were still lying to me.
text: He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
text: but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what that is? It's a
dialog: picture of your knife. The one you
dialog: had on you when you went to Reggie
dialog: Campos. The one the cops have.
text: Look at the blood on the blade.
dialog: Look at the initials.
dialog: Louis is stuck for an answer--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why Ted Minton didn't care
dialog: when I told him Reggie's a
dialog: prostitute. What's it matter, when
text: he's got a knife with her blood and
dialog: your initials on it?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This wasn't the knife in the file--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (scowls, sore)
dialog: That's right. The file Raul got us
dialog: was a loaded deck. The cops must
dialog: have been on to him, because they
dialog: used it to set us up. So we'd think
dialog: they had nothing, when in fact they
dialog: had enough to put your Hugo Boss,
dialog: golf-playing ass away for twenty
dialog: years!
text: Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.
text: He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.
text: Mick sees him looking her way...
text: Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
text: moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Explain to me why you lied about
dialog: the knife.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I didn't lie. I said the one in the
dialog: picture wasn't mine.
text: Mick frowns/grins at the answer...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I said it twice! Nobody listened!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (MOCKING)
dialog: What are you now, a lawyer? A
dialog: clever, third-rate fucking lawyer
dialog: with smart-ass technicalities? "You
dialog: said it wasn't yours"-- What you
dialog: should have said was, "I had a
dialog: knife but this isn't it!" What did
dialog: you think, it would just go away?
dialog: (closing in on him)
dialog: You brought a murder weapon to a
dialog: meeting with a prostitute, Louis!
dialog: How am I supposed to make that look
dialog: like she set you up?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: 1. Did. Not. Do this.
text: Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look.
text: Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Then kindly tell me why you went to
text: her apartment with a custom-made
text: knife, serrated tip, with "LR"
dialog: engraved on the blade?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I always carry it.
text: For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You always carry it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes. In real estate we show homes,
dialog: to people we don't know. This one
dialog: time...
text: He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: My mother. She was showing a place.
dialog: It was in Bel-Air, so she thought
dialog: it was okay to go alone, even
dialog: though there was a man at the time
dialog: who had raped some women that way.
dialog: He was there.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Who was there?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: The man. He raped her. When she
dialog: didn't come back, I went to the
dialog: house and found her.
text: Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: That's when she stopped showing
dialog: property. I do the selling now. And
dialog: I started carrying a knife. Always.
text: Mick turns it over. Finally...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's quite a story, Louis.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Your mother will have to testify.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We don't want that.
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (COLD)
dialog: I don't give a damn what you think
dialog: we want. From now on you do what I
dialog: tell you while I try this case. Do
dialog: I make myself clear?

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'll keep it in mind.

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (How'd she know?)
dialog: Yeah, that's exactly what--
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: With that guy Corliss, right? I
dialog: told them using that dirtbag was a

text: Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (catches herself, giggles)
dialog: Whoops, I shouldn't say that...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (to keep it alive)
dialog: So Ted talked to you about Corliss?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Huh? It was me who sent him to Ted.
dialog: Corliss thought it was my case

dialog: I'm telling you too much.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Nah, nothing I don't know, they

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: MICK

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: MICK

scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against

speaker_heading: MICK'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: That's not my problem.
speaker_heading: MICK

speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: It's okay. I owe you, the way I let

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: It wasn't you. The cops set you up.
dialog: Who was it slipped you the file,
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Some guy in vice I play cards with.
dialog: Lonnie Fry. You don't know him.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You're right, I don't. But I know
dialog: who his partner was, when he was in

speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: That prick. I'll make him sorry.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Don't bother. We've got bigger

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Cell phones don't work too well

speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I came to tell you a story. About

speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: You were at San Quentin.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: It's about what happened after he
text: left Martha Renteria's apartment.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: After he killed her?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: He never killed her. He went there,
dialog: had sex, flushed the condom--
speaker_heading: RAUL
text: Wiped his prick on the pink towel--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And then went home. The story
text: starts after he left.
speaker_heading: RAUL
speaker_heading: (GETS IT)
dialog: The real killer.
speaker_heading: MICK
text: The real killer. She lets him in.
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. MARTHA RENTERIA' S APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Maybe he fakes like it's still

dialog: Or maybe it was an appointment...
text: We see the door open but we don't see who enters...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: RAUL (V.O.)
dialog: The other guy from the club? The
dialog: one Jesus said he bid against?
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
text: Right. He comes in, punches her a
dialog: few times to soften her up...
text: Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun...
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
text: Then takes out a knife and holds it
text: to her neck while he walks her to
dialog: the bedroom...
text: We SEE the knife-tip against her throat...
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
dialog: Only she isn't lucky like Reggie
text: Campo will be. He climbs on top,
text: puts on a condom, rapes her...
text: CUT TO, BEDROOM, as Mick gives us the action...
speaker_heading: MICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
text: And when he's done he stabs her
dialog: over and over, fifty-two times,
text: while he works out something in his
dialog: sick fucking mind.
dialog: We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then--
scene_heading: RESUME, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Do you need to ask what kind of
dialog: knife it was, based on the wounds?
speaker_heading: RAUL
text: A short-blade folding knife...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Or whose face Martinez picked out
dialog: of the mug-shots I brought him?
text: No. No need. A beat. Raul's dog barks from outside.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course the story goes on from
dialog: there. From there it's about the
dialog: lawyer Martinez gets himself...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Don't do this to yourself...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (ignores, on a roll now)
dialog: The lawyer who just assumes he did
dialog: it because of the DNA. The lawyer
dialog: who gets him the best deal he can,
dialog: and feels pretty good, because the
dialog: deal keeps his client off Death
dialog: Row... and this guy, this lawyer,
dialog: he's all about the deal, see?
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Mick-- You can't beat yourself up
dialog: for what you didn't know--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I just saw him and he's twenty-six
dialog: going on forty. He's a little guy.
dialog: You know what happens to the little
dialog: ones up there.
text: A beat. Mick drinks.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: He has a type. Roulet. It's more
dialog: than a type, Renteria and Campo,
dialog: you put their faces together you
dialog: get the same face...
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: (off the drink Mick takes)
dialog: You better take it easy...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Listen, I was thinking about this
dialog: the whole way down on the plane--
dialog: That night with Renteria? It was
dialog: like he hit the jackpot-- got to do
dialog: his thing and get away with it.
text: Then he's in a bar, sees Reggie--
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Who he's seen before, remember--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah but tonight he sees who she
dialog: looks like.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Renteria?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Right. And he's right back there.
speaker_heading: RAUL
speaker_heading: (DOUBTFUL--)
dialog: Mick, we're talking about a really
speaker_heading: STRANGE--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We're talking about a killer at
dialog: work. You know that video from the
dialog: bar? Just like you, he saw that Mr.
dialog: X was left-handed.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: (struck by this)
dialog: Smart as the devil--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: He knows what he's doing. Reggie's
dialog: the luckiest woman alive.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: You think there are others? With
dialog: that face, or--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You find out. Dig into Roulet.
dialog: (recalls...)
dialog: "All you'll find is parking
dialog: tickets," I don't buy that anymore.
dialog: Check out knife-murders of women.
dialog: Not just the unsolved ones, Martha
dialog: Renteria was a closed case.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: Look man, I can't throw a net like
dialog: that. I'm just one guy! You gotta
dialog: bring the cops in.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I can't. He's my client.
dialog: (clear on this:)
dialog: That's why he hired me.
text: Raul looks up, startled by this. Mick lays it out...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I was thinking about that on the
dialog: plane too: He was worried I might
dialog: hear about the case and put it
dialog: together. But if he was my client,
dialog: I'd be bound to keep my mouth shut
dialog: and protect him.
speaker_heading: RAUL
speaker_heading: (SEES)
dialog: Attorney-client privilege.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I told you: He knows what he's
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: RAUL
dialog: You got one guy in prison for what
dialog: your other client did. What are you
dialog: going to do, Mick?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm working on it.
scene_heading: CUT TO, EXT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

speaker_heading: MAGGIE'S VOICE

speaker_heading: MAGGIE'S VOICE
dialog: You'll need to pick her up at noon.

speaker_heading: MICK

dialog: for my life, Mick, and I get
dialog: nervous when I can't reach yout
dialog: And you were away all day. Like you
dialog: told "Maggie."
text: Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You don't come near this house
dialog: again, do you understand me? We
dialog: aren't friends, we aren't partners,
dialog: you're my client, eriod--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Just what I wanted to remind you
dialog: of. I'm your client.
text: Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then:
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides, I like it in your house,
dialog: Mick... Pretty pictures of your
dialog: kid, Hayley...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Fucken don't.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don't what, don't say she's pretty?
dialog: But I saw her, the other day at the
dialog: club...
text: At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick,
dialog: solid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
text: His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just
text: as suddenly, he steels himself. Glares coldly at Mick.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Okay I'm going. But--
text: And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: --first I think I should give you
dialog: back your key. It isn't right that
dialog: I have it. Now that we can trust
dialog: each other.
text: Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the
dialog: fucking steps.
scene_heading: SUDDEN CUT TO,, EXT. ON HAYLEY: SOCCER MATCH IN PROGRESS
text: Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another
text: girl, a forward, dribbling towards her...
text: ANGLE MICK, on the sideline... among other parents...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's it, Hayley, get in her way!
text: Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her,
text: goes in for the score. Hayley looks despondently at Mick--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay, honey!
text: When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Haller...
text: He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even
text: from the field, Hayley sees this...
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - DAY
text: MOVING ON THE CUT, WITH MICK, as he ENTERS... It's a CRIME
text: SCENE, swarms with cops, forensics, technicians...
text: Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water. DETECTIVES
text: are leading him: LANKFORD, 38, clean-marine-- and HEIDI
text: SOBEL, 30. They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Levin was back in his office...
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: We wouldn't have found him if a
dialog: neighbor hadn't brought the dog
text: back. It was running loose.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: (shows a desk calendar)
dialog: Your name's all over this. Were you
dialog: the only guy he worked for?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No, but I've got a big trial next
dialog: month, attempted rape and murder.
dialog: He was helping me.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Is that the Roulet case?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Because every file that's been
dialog: rifled has the name.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Only thing, Roulet himself is
dialog: already cleared for this. We've
dialog: checked the tracking on his tracer-
dialog: anklet and it doesn't show him
dialog: anywhere near this place. And
dialog: there's no way to trick those
dialog: things, no way in the world.
text: We see Mick register this-- wants to ask about it, but before
speaker_heading: HE CAN--
speaker_heading: LANKFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way, Counsellor, where were
dialog: you this morning?
text: Mick rocked by the question. What it means.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm a suspect?
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: He knew whoever shot him. There are
dialog: no signs of forcible, he even let
text: the killer into the back room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I was watching my daughter play
dialog: soccer. A couple of dozen people
dialog: can confirm I was there.
text: Provisionally buying this, Lankford takes out booties.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Put these on and don't touch

scene_heading: INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - HOME OFFICE
text: Raul face down on the floor, in front of his desk chair.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Can you tell us if you see anything
dialog: unusual?
text: Mick draws close. Lankford, abruptly--
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
text: All I see are pictures of a guy.
dialog: Was he a fruit?
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (BITTER)
dialog: He was a hell of an ex-cop, is what
dialog: he was. Crimes Against Persons,
dialog: back in Chicago. And yeah he was
dialog: gay, and what the hell's that got
dialog: to do with it? If the murder was
dialog: some kind of gay thing, why'd they
dialog: ransack the office? Isn't it
dialog: obvious they were looking for
dialog: something to do with his work?
text: Lankford can't argue with this. When Sobel, near the body:
speaker_heading: SOBEL
text: Look. The position of his hands.
text: ANGLE: Two middle fingers point down. Two outside fingers up.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Was this guy a Longhorns fan or
dialog: what? Or is it some kind of sign,
dialog: like he was trying to tell us who
speaker_heading: SHOT HIM--
speaker_heading: (MAKES "HORNS")
dialog: --"The devil did it?"

dialog: Seen from the POV OF--
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - MICK AT THE WHEEL - SAME TIME

text: to: A HOUSE, its garage door wide open. Mick pulls into the

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - MICK ENTERS
text: What he FINDS inside, beside a family van, is a LARGE THIN
text: CARDBOARD BOX... It's upright, marked "Fragile."
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mick stands there KNOCKING at the door. It's opened by:
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Hey Mick!
dialog: Val's surprised... a mix of emotions...
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doin' here?... and I
dialog: heard about Raul Levin, man...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (ignores all that)
dialog: You know your garage door's open?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Shit: I just had a plasma
dialog: delivered...
text: And rushes to... the GARAGE. Mick trails... Val's relieved to
dialog: find the box is okay.
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh man, if we still lived in Van
dialog: Nuys this sucker'd be gone. Set me
dialog: back eight grand, too. But it's
dialog: gonna be great for the games...
dialog: (notes Mick's silent mood)
dialog: What's up anyway? What brings you
dialog: out here?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Raul's murder.
dialog: (Val waits, listens.)
dialog: I've been with the cops. They can't
dialog: tie Roulet to it, because your
text: ankle bracelet doesn't put him near
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I know, I gave them the trace. The
dialog: bracelet's got a mass detector,
dialog: there's no way to beat that.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Did the cops ask you where you were
dialog: this morning, Val?
text: Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking...
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Somehow, some way, Louis killed
dialog: Raul Levin. And it didn't show up
dialog: on the trace.
text: Mick looks at the plasma TV, then back at Val. Val reddens--
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: You better not be sayin' what I
dialog: think-- that I cut him loose-- to
dialog: let him kill Raul--?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Maybe you didn't know what he was
dialog: going to do--
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: (over, angry--)
dialog: You think I'd let that happen? For
dialog: a fuckin' TV?
text: And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick
text: shoves back, harder, backwards into the TV box-- it hits the
text: cement floor, hard, and Val falls on top of it--
text: Sickening snap/crunch from within the box--
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit, man--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Where'd you get the money for an
dialog: eight thousand dollar TV, Val?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: That's bullshit! I didn't do that!
dialog: How dare you say that to me-- I'm
dialog: inocente, man--
text: Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at
text: him from the ground.
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Get outa here; Get out of here,
dialog: Mick, and get outa my life!
text: Mick's already backing off-- towards the car--

speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: That's it. You're done here, pal.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'll be your first customer. First

text: And rolls him onto the bed. He looks at her. Drunk as he is:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Lemme ask you something. Corliss.
dialog: The name Corliss. You didn't just
dialog: give me that just because you'd
dialog: been drinking. You wanted me to
dialog: have it.
text: She doesn't confirm or deny. Just gets him into bed-- says
scene_heading: POINTEDLY--
speaker_heading: MAGGGIE
dialog: I'm not staying.
dialog: He knows, but-- one thing more--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Maggie-- Raul. Did I get him
dialog: killed?
text: Moved, she shakes her head no. Straightens his pillow.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: How do you do it, Haller? You're a
dialog: sleazy defense lawyer with two ex-
dialog: wives and a daughter, and we all
dialog: still love you.
text: We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes. To no one:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I can't do this anymore.
scene_heading: INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: He's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom. Stares at

text: Presses STOP. Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal. But
text: pulls the pencil &amp; pad near him, and presses START again...
speaker_heading: RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: First, that witness name you gave
dialog: me. Corliss? Turns out he's this
dialog: hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss,
dialog: sometimes goes by "DJ." When you
dialog: run it that way you find out he's
dialog: played the courtroom snitch a lot,
dialog: mostly in Arizona. But here's the
dialog: thing: One time down there? It blew
dialog: up on him. I'm working on it, it
dialog: can be good for us... Don't know
dialog: how we get to him, though. They
dialog: put him in USC lock-up, just to
dialog: make it harder...
text: Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS...
dialog: ARIZONA... then USC, circles this last...
speaker_heading: RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Other thing is, you asked me to dig
dialog: deep-on Roulet? Mick, I found
dialog: something. I found Martinez' ticket
dialog: out of the Q.
text: When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING... and a DOOR BELL...
speaker_heading: RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Uh, that's somebody at the door...
dialog: Look, have a good time with your
dialog: kid. Gotta go, boss.
text: And MESSAGE goes OFF. Mick thinks a moment. Tries to clear
text: his head. Then pulls out a card and dials a number...

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I-- just checked my phone
dialog: messages. It turns out Raul called
dialog: me. Just before he was killed. I
dialog: didn't know.
speaker_heading: (SHE REACTS)
dialog: The message came at Eleven-oh-
dialog: seven. He said, "I think I found
dialog: Martinez' ticket out of the Q."
speaker_heading: SOBEL
speaker_heading: (WRITING)
dialog: Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a
dialog: former client of yours--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: In San Quentin. Right.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Did he say anything else?
text: Looks down at his notes. At "Corliss." "USC." A beat. As he
text: tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No-- No, that's it. Then the dog
text: barked, somebody was at the door.
dialog: He hung up.
dialog: (before she can ask more)
dialog: Look, maybe you can tell me if
dialog: there's any progress on the case.
dialog: (when she hesitates)
dialog: He was my friend.
dialog: Sobel, makes a decision...
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Well, we did catch a break. We
text: found a bullet casing in the room,
dialog: from a 22. It turns out Levin owned
dialog: a .22, but when we checked it out
dialog: it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun
dialog: that killed him...
text: To which, Mick reacts... as she goes on...
speaker_heading: SOBEL (CONT'D)
dialog: The other thing is we can't find
dialog: his cell-phone...
dialog: (noticing Mick is silent)
dialog: Are you still there?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah... just, I'll let you know if
dialog: I think of anything. About his cell-
dialog: phone, I mean. Thanks.
text: And hangs up. Too sudden. Leaves Sobel wondering...
text: CUT TO, MICK MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH HIS HOUSE...
text: Down the hall, to a closet, climbs clumsily above to a shelf--
text: Tossing clothes out of the way... Finds: AN OLD WOODEN GUN

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Better make it fast.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're my lawyer, right? So I can
dialog: tell you anything, even a crime
dialog: I've committed, and you have to
dialog: keep it secret.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (a beat, uncomfortable--)
dialog: That's right. Unless it's one

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I've killed people, Mick.
text: Reaction Mick. Just then, Courtroom clerk gives a warning--
speaker_heading: COURTROOM CLERK
dialog: Two minutes, people...
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (TO LOUIS)
dialog: Now? Now? Why now, are you telling
dialog: me this...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Because I know your plan.
text: Mick looks at him. Before he can deny--
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Your plan is to defend me on this--
dialog: then, when I'm not your client,
dialog: throw me to the cops.
dialog: (when Mick says nothing)
dialog: I can't let that happen. So I'm
dialog: telling you: I've killed people and
dialog: guess what? Martha Renteria was one
dialog: of them. There now. If you use what
dialog: I've told you you might get Jesus
dialog: Martinez out of jail, but you'll
dialog: never practice law again. And I'll

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What this case is about is a
dialog: predator... On the night of March
dialog: Sixth, Louis Roulet was out
dialog: stalking his prey...
dialog: Jury of twelve, two alternates...
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: You are going to hear from the
dialog: victim herself about her lifestyle,
dialog: one that we would not condone. But
dialog: remember that anyone, anyone, can
dialog: be the victim of a violent crime.
dialog: (approaches the jury box)
text: The case is clear. Straightforward.
text: A man attacked a woman in her home
text: in order to rape and kill her.
dialog: It is only by the grace of God that
dialog: she's here to tell you the story.
dialog: Over Ted,
speaker_heading: MICK (V.O.)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: My name's Michael Haller, and I'm
dialog: representing Louis Roulet.
dialog: (glances at Ted)
dialog: Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the
dialog: word prostitute for the woman who's
text: supposed to be Louis's victim. He
dialog: needn't worry, this case isn't
dialog: about how she makes her money...
dialog: But it is about her actions. How
text: she saw a young man with signs of
dialog: wealth, and chose to target him...
dialog: (closes in on the jury...)
dialog: What she didn't count on, was you.
dialog: The fact that you'd put two and two
dialog: together, and let your common sense
dialog: tell you who was the real predator.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Thinks?
speaker_heading: LORNA
text: Corliss has the same meal time. She
dialog: can try.
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (DISCOURAGED)
dialog: Let her try. But it may not matter.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I mean, Corliss isn't on the
dialog: witness list. It could be Ted
text: Minton is holding him back. He
dialog: won't use him until he has to.
dialog: Until I screw up his case so bad he
dialog: has no choice.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Mickey? Can you do that?
text: Off Mick, tries for a confident smile...
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON THE STAND:
speaker_heading: FEMALE COP (MAXWELL)
dialog: I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got

speaker_heading: OFFICER MAXWELL

speaker_heading: OFFICER MAXWELL
dialog: "The victim does not know the man
dialog: who assaulted her or why she was
dialog: attacked."
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Why did you write that she didn't
dialog: know him?
speaker_heading: OFFICER MAXWELL
dialog: Because that's what she said.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So, she just opened the door at ten
dialog: o'clock to a stranger?
speaker_heading: OFFICER MAXWELL
dialog: She didn't put it like that...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Was there blood on his right hand?
speaker_heading: OFFICER MAXWELL
dialog: (confused by the shift)
dialog: No, his left. Or we would have
text: bagged his right one, too.
scene_heading: INT. CAMERA TRAILS THE JURY...
text: As a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss
dialog: Campo on the night of March Sixth?
text: CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video. Blurred
text: tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Yep. Had a date with her at
dialog: Morgan's. Then from there we went
dialog: to her place and had another date,
dialog: if you know what I mean.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: B5.
text: Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Had you known Miss Campo before?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Nope. Just called her up.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How did you know to call her?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: From her website. She's got a real
dialog: good website.
text: Jury laughs a little. Fascinated but repulsed by this guy...
text: but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Did you have sexual relations?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Four hundred bucks worth. And she
dialog: earned every cent.
text: Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval. Mick catches
text: his reaction, likes it. Ted goes on...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And what time did you leave?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
text: About five minutes before ten.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: She say she had another engagement?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: No, she acted like she was done for
dialog: the night...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Objection, I don't think Mr.
dialog: Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms.
dialog: Campo's thinking or plans...
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: I just mean she acted satisfied...
speaker_heading: FULLBRIGHT
speaker_heading: (OFFENDED--)
dialog: Sustained! Go on, Mr. Minton.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: When you left, what condition was
dialog: she in? Was she hurt?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: No, she was fit as a fiddle. I know
dialog: because I'd just played her.
dialog: (before Fullbright bursts)
dialog: Sorry, your honor. She was fine.

text: up PHOTOS of the Reggie's battered face.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: She didn't look like this?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Man. What kind of bastard does
dialog: something like that?
speaker_heading: FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Answer the question.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: No. We made consensual and
dialog: pleasurable love. Which is what
dialog: life is all about. Then I paid her.
text: CUT TO, MICK HAS TALBOT ON CROSS...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Mr. Talbot, are you right or left-
dialog: handed?
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Left.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Left. And isn't it true that before
dialog: you left Regina Campo asked you to
dialog: strike her repeatedly in the face?
speaker_heading: TED
speaker_heading: (OBJECTING)
dialog: Your honor, there's no basis for
dialog: this sort of questioning. Mr.
text: Haller is just muddying the waters
text: with outrageous statements.
text: Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply. Mick half-shrugs...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Part of the defense theory, Judge.
speaker_heading: FULLBRIGHT
dialog: The witness can answer.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: I never hit her or any other woman.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Do you know a prostitute named...
dialog: (checks his sheet)
dialog: Shaquille Barton? "Shaquilla
dialog: Shakels" is her work name.
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: Okay, yeah. I seen her one time...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And if I brought her here and she
dialog: said you had struck her with your
dialog: left hand...
speaker_heading: TALBOT
dialog: She'd be lying. I tried Shaquilla,
dialog: that rough stuff's not for me. I'm
dialog: a missionary man.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: With a strong left. Thank you.
text: And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last,
text: and a pleased one from Louis. CUT TO,
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Where Mick, as he exits the courtroom for the day, is
text: SURPRISED TO FIND: DETECTIVES LANKFORD AND SOBEL WAITING FOR
text: HIM. Sobel holds documents. Reaction Mick: Oh shit.
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. BACK SEAT, DETECTIVES' CAR (MOVING) - LATER
text: Mick looks over the pages Sobel hands him. Lankford drives.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: This warrant is bullshit--
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Good enough to search your house.
dialog: For a Woodsman registered to you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BB.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: We need to run ballistics on it.
text: She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt:
speaker_heading: SOBEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It would have been better if you'd
dialog: told me that you had a Woodsman.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I don't anymore. It was stolen.
text: The worst yet. Lankford laughs: "How convenient..."
scene_heading: INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - LATER - ON:
text: The BOX FOR THE WOODSMAN: Sobel in gloves, examines, while--
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: We got the history on the piece.
dialog: Turns out it belonged to Mickey
text: Cohen the gangster, in the forties.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I know. My father represented him.
dialog: He got him off for using it in self-
dialog: defense, so Cohen made him a
dialog: present of it.
text: Sobel, careful, opens it... It's empty. Like Mick said.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Why didn't you report it stolen?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Because I knew who took it.
text: (They look at him.)
dialog: A client. He told me, so I couldn't
dialog: turn him in without breaking a
dialog: trust. They do that.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: (doesn't buy this)
dialog: Still and all, mind if I look
dialog: around? Just in case you haven't
dialog: had time to toss it off a pier?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Go crazy. You've got the warrant.
text: Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Heidi-- bag the box.
text: He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You can't do ballistics on a box.
text: She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: That old Mickey Cohen shooting?
dialog: It's kind of famous. It turns out
dialog: the county still has the evidence
text: in storage. The bullet.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You can match casings to a slug
dialog: that's fifty years old?
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: It'd be easier with the gun, but
dialog: yeah.
text: She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Detective? How long will ballistics
dialog: take?
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: Careful. You'll make me think
dialog: you're worried what we'll find.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm in the middle of a trial.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
text: A day. Maybe forty-eight hours.
text: She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - NEXT MORNING - ARRIVING...
text: Mick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Morning, Haller. Word is, you had
dialog: interesting visitors last night...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Worry about yourself, Ted. You're
dialog: dying the death of a thousand
dialog: razors up there and you don't even
dialog: know it.
text: They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits
text: for him. Before Louis can speak: Low--
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, you little shit: This gun-
dialog: scheme of yours is about to blow
dialog: up, and I'm not going down for it.
dialog: If I have to drive people to the
dialog: airport the rest of my life.
text: Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED RISES...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: One last witness, your honor. The
dialog: prosecution calls Regina Campo.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND...
text: Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty
text: face-- none of the aggressive sexiness. Hesitant but frank.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It's true that I lied. I knew him
text: when he came to the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: In fact, you'd arranged his coming
dialog: Miss Campo: why did you lie?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I was scared. I wasn't sure the
dialog: police would believe me and I
dialog: wanted to make sure they arrested
dialog: him... because he's an animal...
text: She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she
text: looks away. Louis is blank. Mick takes it in. Ted follows up--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do you regret that decision now?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes. If it helps him to get free
dialog: and do this to somebody else.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Your honor, prejudicial--
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Sustained.
text: But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done. Reggie's moved them.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have no further questions for
dialog: Regina, your honor.
text: Ted sits.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Your witness, Mr. Haller.
text: Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand. Low-voiced----
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I want to remind you of your words.
dialog: You were going to tear her apart
text: and throw her entrails into the
dialog: sea.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's it, keep acting like you
dialog: pull the strings.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Mr. Haller.
text: Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched
text: by Louis. Then all at once, to surprise her--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Ms. Campo have you engaged an
dialog: attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the
dialog: events of March Sixth?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (recovers,
dialog: No I haven't.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: But have you talked to an attorney?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I haven't hired anybody or--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I asked if you talked to one. About
dialog: a possible lawsuit.
text: Mick's crisp like he knows for sure. She wilts a little.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It was nothing more than talk...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Did you ask if you could sue Mr.
dialog: Roulet for damages?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I thought what you say to lawyers
dialog: is private.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: If you wish, you can tell the
dialog: jurors.
text: Faces her. Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I think I want to keep it private.
text: Ted squirms again. Wrong answer.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Okay, let's go back to the night at
dialog: Morgan's. Had you ever seen Louis
dialog: Roulet before that night?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes. There and other places.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: NO--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Or that he drove one of two cars, a
dialog: Porsche or a Range Rover?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I never saw him driving.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And what made you approach him?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I knew he was in the life. You
dialog: know. A player. I had seen him
dialog: leave with girls who do what I do.
speaker_heading: MICK
text: With prostitutes. To go to a hotel,
dialog: or their apartments...?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know where.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So how do you know they left? Maybe
dialog: they just went out for a smoke...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Because they got in his car and
dialog: drove away.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: But you just testified that you
dialog: never saw Mr. Roulet drive! Now you
text: saw him leave with a prostitute
dialog: like yourself. Which is it?
text: The contradiction rings round the room. Reggie, tries...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I saw him get in a car but I didn't
dialog: know what kind it was.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Do you know the difference between
dialog: a Porsche and a Range Rover?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: one's big and one's small, I guess.
text: Reactions... Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making
text: it... But Mick, like he's just getting started...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: The women he left with, when you
dialog: saw them again, had they been
dialog: beaten or injured?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know, I didn't ask.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: But girls in your profession talk
dialog: about customers, don't you? Warn
dialog: each other if someone's a freak...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yeah, usually...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And how many had warned you about
dialog: Louis Roulet?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: None. No one.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So you believed you'd be safe?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I, thought he was a known quantity
dialog: and I needed the money, so...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So you thought he could solve your
dialog: need for money?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: NO--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No? Isn't that why we're sitting
dialog: here? Because you zeroed in on him?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No! I mean yes, but not like that--
dialog: (looking round, a plea to
speaker_heading: BE BELIEVED)
dialog: He attacked me, I swear!
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON A VIDEO PLAYING:
text: The BAR TAPE, blown-up projection, SHOWS REGGIE PASSES LOUIS
text: SITTING AT THE BAR, LEANS HER BODY INTO HIM SEXILY...

scene_heading: RESUME ANGLE SCREEN, REGGIE HANDS LOUIS A NAPKIN, PASSES BY.
text: RESUME COURT, Mick signals the TECHNICIAN. It goes OFF.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: My name and address...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And your price?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes. Four hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: It's a hard line of work...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: And dangerous.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: In fact, haven't you told friends
dialog: you were looking for a way out?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes. I'm not proud of what I do--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And so, isn't it true-- nothing
dialog: would be easier to understand--
dialog: that you saw Louis Roulet and his
dialog: money as a way out?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No! That's not what this is about!
dialog: That man hit me and tried to kill
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yes, we've heard you say that--
speaker_heading: (TO FULLBRIGHT)
dialog: Judge may I ask the witness to
dialog: stand up?
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: (surprised, but)
dialog: The witness will stand. I hope
dialog: you're going somewhere with this,
dialog: Mr. Haller.
text: Reggie stands.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Now if you please, walk over to my
dialog: client.
text: She goes, stands before Louis. Who rises on cue from Mick.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the man you broke free
dialog: from, overpowered, knocked out?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes-- You can do amazing things
dialog: when you're afraid--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo?
scene_heading: Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN-
dialog: DOT-COM says one hundred three...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That's right.
text: A beat. Louis sits. Reggie stands there... suddenly cries.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I've got no further questions for
dialog: the witness, your honor.
text: Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table. Where
text: we pick up TED MINTON. Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of
text: damage as best he can... He's startled when:
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Mr. Minton? Do you have another
dialog: witness for us?
text: Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises...
dialog: WHILE, ASIDE, Louis to Mick, re Ted...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: He looks worried.
text: Mick watching Ted, waits, tense...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The state rests, your honor.
dialog: Mick's disappointed: No Corliss.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Not worried enough.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: (raises a gavel...)
dialog: Then the defense will call its
text: first witness after lunch.
text: And the gavel comes down.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, AFTER THE BREAK - MICK, ON DIRECT, HAS...
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: Yes, I recognize this knife.
dialog: (holding an evidence bag)
dialog: It's the one my son carried with
dialog: him for protection for the last
dialog: four years. Almost exactly.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Why would he need protection?
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
text: Because realtors alone in a house
dialog: are sometimes robbed or hurt...
dialog: Even raped or murdered.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: But has Louis ever been the subject
dialog: of such a crime?
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: No. But he knew someone who...
dialog: (hesitates...)
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Go on, please.
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
text: She was raped and robbed by a man.
dialog: Louis found her. It was terrible.
dialog: The first thing he did afterwards
dialog: was get himself a knife to carry,
dialog: at all times.
dialog: (looks at Ted Minton)
dialog: March Sixth would have been no
dialog: different.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED HAS MARY WINDSOR ON CROSS...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty
dialog: exact, about when your son started
dialog: carrying around this, this weapon,
text: a five-inch folding knife...
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I am. The incident took place on
dialog: June ninth, two-thousand-one.
text: Mick watches Ted, carefully... Cat and mouse...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Was it in the newspapers?
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Or, do you somehow remember because
dialog: the police came to talk to Louis...
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: There was no police investigation.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Then how can you remember the exact
dialog: date so well?
dialog: (sly look at Mick)
dialog: Were you given the date before
dialog: testifying here?
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I know the date because I'll never
dialog: forget the day I was attacked.
text: The news falls on Ted. She goes on before he can rally...
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR (cont'd)
dialog: Louis will never forget it either.
dialog: He found me in that house, tied up.
dialog: Naked. It was traumatic for him.
text: She's perfect: a strong woman, unused to showing emotion.
text: Mick smiles, impressed. When, with some sarcasm:
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Mr. Minton-- anything else?
text: Ted, still thrown, stares down at his notes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: As Louis's mother, you'd do or say
dialog: anything to save him, wouldn't you?
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I wouldn't lie. Not about what
dialog: happened that day...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We have no police or hospital
dialog: record that it even occurred...
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I never reported it...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: I was ashamed. If you don't
dialog: understand that I can't explain it
dialog: to you. And yet I live with it
dialog: every day.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But it's only you who says so:
text: Mary looks at Ted, and at the Judge, as if confused:
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: Is that a question?
dialog: Off Mick, admiring, GO TO,
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - POST-ADJOURNMENT, END OF DAY...
text: Mick packing his stuff-- looks up, as Ted approaches.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I've been thinking about the
dialog: thousand razors.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE - MINUTES LATER
text: Louis waits on the steps, Mick comes out. Where they're
dialog: alone...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: We've had an offer. Want to spend
dialog: six months in county jail?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I told you from the beginning--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I know: The only verdict's Not
dialog: Guilty. Okay. We'll get there.
text: Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm. But:
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't touch me, Louis. You want to
dialog: show your gratitude give me my gun
dialog: back.
dialog: Louis grins: meaning No way.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought so.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: You still sure you want me to put
dialog: you on the stand?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I insist on it.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Then get some rest tonight, you're
dialog: up next.
text: Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the
text: Lincoln waits. He gets in.
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS
text: Earl in the front seat.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: There's something I need you to get
dialog: me, Earl.
text: A tone Earl never heard him use before. Earl turns around.
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY - CRISP...
text: Mick steps past Ted on his way to his desk. As he passes--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Did you talk to your client?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yes. No deal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
text: Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance... While, TO THE JUDGE:
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: The defense calls Louis Ross
dialog: Roulet, your honor.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, LATER - LOUIS ANSWERS ON DIRECT...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I turned toward the living room,
dialog: the way she pointed...
text: ANGLE MICK, has a floorplan of the apartment, on an easel.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And what happened when you turned?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Something hit me and I blacked out.
dialog: I don't know for how long.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That was all?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Then when I woke up these guys were
dialog: on me, telling me not to move. I
dialog: couldn't anyway. I was too scared.
text: Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: But, there was blood on your jacket
dialog: and your left hand...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Someone put it there because I
dialog: didn't.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Are you left-handed?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You didn't strike Ms. Campo with
dialog: your left fist?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Threaten to rape her, or kill her?--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You're angry. Why?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (passionate but simple--)
dialog: Do you know what it's like to be
dialog: accused of something like this? To
dialog: listen to people tell lies about
dialog: your having done something so sick
dialog: and awful? I, I understand I had to
dialog: be quiet and wait my chance and not
dialog: say anything-- but if guilty people
dialog: have rights, what about innocent
dialog: people? I am innocent!
dialog: Mick. Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Nothing further, Judge.
text: Ted already up &amp; moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: According to you, Ms. Campo punched
dialog: herself or had a man she never met
text: before punch her lights out as part
dialog: of a set-up?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: All I know is that I didn't.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And this knife you always carry,
dialog: how did she know she'd find it on
dialog: you as part of the set-up?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
speaker_heading: ("HONEST")
dialog: She couldn't, could she? I mean, I
dialog: never took it out or showed it to
dialog: anybody-- so she must have just
dialog: found it when she went into my
dialog: pocket for the money I had that I
dialog: was going to pay her with, right?--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: M.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'd really prefer it if I ask the
dialog: questions, and you answer them!
dialog: (then calming himself)
dialog: Would you look at this, please--
text: Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Please tell us again if you think
dialog: Regina Campo would or could have
dialog: done this to herself.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don't know who did it, but it
dialog: wasn't me. Nobody deserves that to
dialog: happen...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (seizes on this)
dialog: What do you mean by "deserves?" Do
dialog: you mean crimes of violence come
dialog: down to a whether a woman gets what
dialog: she "deserves?"
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (right back at him)
dialog: I mean no matter what she does for
dialog: a living or who she is-- No woman
dialog: deserves that.
text: Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have no more questions.
text: At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION--
text: Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat,
text: passing Mick as Mick rises--
text: Louis gives Mick a "How'd I do?" look, Mick nods,
text: unmistakably, "You did fine..."-- Mick's look finds Ted--
text: Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a
dialog: kind of smile, Ted grim--
text: As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling
text: eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted-- RESUME NORMAL SPEED for
text: Mick's confident, fateful words:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Your honor, the defense rests.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: Ted hears this, sets his jaw. Fullbright turns to him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Mr. Minton?
dialog: Ted is uncertain...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your honor...
dialog: (She waits.)
dialog: The state needs the night to
dialog: decide, your honor...
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: To decide what?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Frankly I wasn't anticipating the
dialog: defense would rest after two
dialog: witnesses. I-- I'd like the night
dialog: to consider calling a rebuttal
dialog: witness.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (reacts, "objects--")
dialog: Your honor, first we've heard of
speaker_heading: THIS--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I said `-consider." I need to find
dialog: out if the witness is even
speaker_heading: AVAILABLE--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: The state still has an obligation
dialog: to disclose the identity--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Not if I decide not to use him.
dialog: (a note of pleading)

text: It's the vast view from Mick's porch. He has a drink in his

speaker_heading: MAGGIE'S VOICE
dialog: There's a rumor in the office...
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How I'm the one who shot Raul?
scene_heading: INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - ON THE PHONE IN THE KITCHEN
text: In the BG we SEE HAYLEY, in pajamas, jumping on her bed...

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Haller, is this serious?
scene_heading: INTERCUT: MICK ON THE PORCH, RAIN/ MAGGIE IN HER KITCHEN
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'd say so. I'm being set up for
text: his murder. Couple of detectives
dialog: from Glendale are following me
text: around, just waiting for the go-
dialog: ahead to hit me with an arrest
dialog: warrant... Could be any minute...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: How is this possible?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Bad timing, bad client, me being
dialog: dumb...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Is it Roulet? Is that the client?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I can't talk to you about my
dialog: clients. How is Hayley?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Fine. But Haller, if she ever hears
dialog: anything about this--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: She won't. Not if I play it right.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: A long beat. Then he says, just as he told Raul--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'm working on it. I have a plan.

speaker_heading: EARL

scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - ON MICK'S BACK...
text: As he moves down the hall. Everything counts today. Enters:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - EMPTY, EARLY - CONTINUOUS
text: Ted prepares at his table. Look at each other without

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Bill, I'm getting coffee. Any for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CLERK BILL
dialog: No man, I'm off caffeine...
dialog:

speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Hey, is that the custody list? Can
dialog: I see if any of my no-good clients

text: Bill lets him have it. Mick, casual, looks over the names...
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - COFFEE COUNTER - DAY
text: LORNA, she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops
text: her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Minton's putting on Corliss. He's
dialog: got him in lock-up already...
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: But Gloria still hasn't let us know
dialog: if she got to him!
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You said she had mealtimes to work
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Yes but...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'll take my chances. Meantime did
dialog: you serve Kurlen?
text: Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed &amp; fast--
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Yes but I didn't like forging the
dialog: judge's signature...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yes you did.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Yes I did.
text: Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL &amp; LANKFORD: Are they
text: coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with
dialog: others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Now go, and be ready for my call.
text: Lorna starts to go-- then pauses.
dialog:

text: No sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: What shit is this, Haller? I got
dialog: nothing to do with your case!
text: Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers. With surprise--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Subpoena to appear as a witness?
dialog: You'll just have to wait and see.
dialog: It's a legal document, Detective.
text: Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick
text: with the "legal document." He tucks it away--
text: And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY
text: WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table. OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP:
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.)
dialog: Mr. Minton--
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - COURT'S IN SESSION...
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Does the state have any rebuttal?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (rises, ready)
dialog: The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey
text: Corliss as rebuttal witness.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Judge? Who is this witness? Why
dialog: wasn't I told before now?
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: A fair question. Mr. Minton?
speaker_heading: TED
text: Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating
dialog: witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet
text: in custody, following his arrest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (shouts, suddenly--)
dialog: Bullshit! I didn't to talk to--
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller,
dialog: control your client!
dialog: Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That was good. Now leave it to me.
dialog: (to the court)
dialog: I do share my client's outrage,
dialog: your honor. I'd at least like to
dialog: know how long the state has been
dialog: sitting on this testimony...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Mr. Corliss did not come forward
dialog: until yesterday.
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (OUTRAGED)
dialog: This is incredible...
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Do you want to go back and talk to
dialog: him? Given the timing I'd allow it.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No, Judge, we all know what this
dialog: is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and
dialog: anything he'd say would be a lie--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's groundless, your honor--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: --I just want my objection noted.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Then I'm going to rule he can
speaker_heading: TESTIFY--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Can I ask one indulgence? Can I
text: step into the hallway and make a
dialog: call to an investigator? For
dialog: whatever good it will do at this
dialog: late date.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM

speaker_heading: LORNA'S VOICE
dialog: Yep, here.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Put your watch at quarter of. At

speaker_heading: LORNA'S VOICE
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: With the printouts.
speaker_heading: LORNA'S VOICE

scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - DWAYNE CORLISS ON THE STAND
text: Prison jumpsuit. We recognize him: the holding-cell junky.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated
dialog: at this time?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Um, no, now I'm just in the
dialog: courtroom.
text: Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But you are currently held in the
dialog: jail-ward at USC hospital?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Yes. Since I got arrested.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: For burglary and drug possession?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Now. Do you know the defendant?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Yes. I met him in lock-up. We was
dialog: bussed over from jail, and then we
dialog: was together in the tank when we
dialog: came for first appearance.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And did you talk at that time?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Yes... we talked about how bad we
dialog: needed cigarettes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: You know, "what are you in for?"
dialog: Like that.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Did he say what he was "in for?"
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: He said, "For giving a bitch
dialog: exactly what she deserved." Those
dialog: were his words.
text: Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal. Mick steadies...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have only one more question. Have
dialog: I, or has anyone, made you promises
dialog: to get you to testify?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: No. It's the right thing to do.
text: Ted sits. Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily.
text: Then rises. Like he doesn't know what to do. Louis, the
text: others, watch anxiously. Mick crosses to the front, steals a
text: glance at the rear, SEES KURLEN standing against the wall,
text: LANKFORD AND SOBEL seated in front of him. Then...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How many times have you been
dialog: arrested, Mr. Corliss?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: About seven in L.A. Couple of times
dialog: in Phoenix if you count those.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So you know how the system works?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: I try to survive...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And sometimes that means ratting
dialog: out fellow inmates, is that it?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Objection, your honor...
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Take a seat, Mr. Minton. I gave you
dialog: leeway bringing this witness in.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Thank you, your honor. But I'll
dialog: rephrase: How many times have you
dialog: snitched on an inmate? Testified
dialog: against a fellow inmate for the
dialog: prosecution?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: This makes my fourth.
speaker_heading: MICK
speaker_heading: (LOOKING SURPRISED)
dialog: Four times? People just come up and
dialog: tell you they committed crimes so
dialog: you can testify against them--
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: People talk to me. I'm a friendly
dialog: guy.
text: Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: So you and my client were friends--
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: That's right, we was friendly--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: And he just said what you said he
dialog: said, about what the woman
dialog: "deserved," and then you went back
dialog: to talking about cigarettes?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Not exactly. He was like, bragging.
dialog: He told me he did it before...
text: Mick freezes... Like he's in a mine field and can't move...
speaker_heading: CORLISS (CONT'D)
dialog: He said the other time he killed
dialog: the bitch... He got away with it
dialog: then and he would get away with it
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (staring at Corliss)
dialog: You... Wait...
text: All eyes on Mick. The Judge prompts...
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Mr. Haller?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: No more questions, your honor.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Re-direct, your honor.
text: Fullbright nods permission. While Louis leans over to Mick...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You tell me! What did you say to
dialog: this guy?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (through gritted teeth)
dialog: Nothing! This is a set-up! You're
dialog: doing this!
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How? How am I doing this?
text: But Louis has no answer. Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You said he was bragging. How?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Well, like, he told me the details.
dialog: About the other one, that he
dialog: killed.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CORLISS (CONT'D)
dialog: He called her a snake dancer. She
dialog: danced in some joint where she was
text: like in a snake pit.
text: ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this...
text: SAME TIME, REACTION at the defense table: Mick, "alarmed,"
dialog: low to Louis--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How does he know this?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Do you think I know?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: If you didn't tell him this shit
dialog: somebody did. Who? Start thinking!
text: RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Is there anything else he told you?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: No, that snake-girl stuff was it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Then no further questions, your
dialog: honor.
text: Ted sits. The look he gives Mick in passing is one of
text: abounding confidence. Mick stews... Swivels around...
text: Covert glance, MICK'S POV, looks to see if Kurlen is where he
text: was, against the wall. He's not. He's gone. So is Lankford.
text: And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've
text: just left... While IN FRONT:
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Any re-cross from the defense?
text: Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see
text: Lorna enter and approach down the aisle.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: A moment with my staff, Judge?
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Be quick.
text: He meets Lorna at the gate. Brings his head close to hers--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: This is where I whisper in your
dialog: ear, tell you stuff...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (takes a file from her)
dialog: It's all here, right? You go now, I
dialog: don't want anyone talking to you.
speaker_heading: LORNA
dialog: Damn.
text: She goes, he returns to the table. Before Louis can speak:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I don't know what's going on here,
dialog: but it won't matter if it's two
dialog: murders or a hundred if I can show
dialog: he's a liar--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: If you set me up I swear I'll--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Just tell me if there's anything
dialog: else he knows. Anything else I have
dialog: to stay away from.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don't know because I never talked
dialog: to him. I'm not that stupid.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: It doesn't matter. If I destroy him
dialog: none of it counts...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (from his gut)
dialog: Then destroy him.
text: A command. Mick nods. Returns to the witness Corliss--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Dwayne, if I can call you that--
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: It's what people call me--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Don't they also call you D.J.? For
dialog: example, down in Phoenix, right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Maybe.
text: He's a bit wary. Mick looks through the file Lorna brought--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Because you know, my assistant, she
dialog: was just reading on the internet
dialog: about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in
dialog: Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges--
dialog: Hometown of Mesa, Arizona?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Yeah, that'd be me. But--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You remember Fred Bentley, right?
text: Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I object, your honor, where is the
dialog: defense going with this?
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller.
text: But the witness can answer.
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: I don't remember any Bentley--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Sure you do. You testified that he
dialog: confessed to you the crime he was
dialog: charged with-- rape of a ten-year-
dialog: old girl-- even though he denied
dialog: his guilt in court. Am .I ringing
dialog: any bells, D.J.?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot,
dialog: there's not much I recall--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Then I'd like you to read this to
dialog: us, D.J. It's a printout of a news
dialog: story from the Arizona Star, 1997,
dialog: that's eight years after he was
dialog: convicted. I ask that it be
dialog: admitted into evidence--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your honor? A news report?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Let's see where it takes us. The
dialog: state can object later.
text: Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I've marked the paragraph.
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: I ain't too good at reading...
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: "A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly
dialog: convicted of rape, was released
dialog: Saturday after con--
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: --conclusive DNA results cleared
dialog: him of the crime. The case was
dialog: bolstered at trial by testimony
text: from an informant, D.J. Corliss of
dialog: Mesa, who claimed Bentley had--
text: bragged to him about the rape while
dialog: together in a holding cell--"
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That's enough.
dialog: (takes it from him)
dialog: Were you charged with perjury for
dialog: that incident, D.J.?
speaker_heading: CORLISS
dialog: No I was not.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Was that because the police were
dialog: complicit in your confession?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (rises, angry--)
dialog: Judge, how can the witness know
dialog: what went into the D.A.'s decision?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (ignores, over--)
dialog: Were you promised the same deal
dialog: here, Mr. Corliss? To say that
dialog: Louis Roulet "bragged" to you in
dialog: the "holding cell?"
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Alright, Mr. Haller, that will do!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (Ceases. Angry.)
dialog: Sorry. I have no more questions.
text: And Mick sits. Courtroom's hushed. Until--
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: I'm excusing the jury for an early
dialog: lunch. Bailiff, see them out.
text: Maintains a smile as the jurors leave. Then her smile dies.
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE FULLBRIGHT'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER
text: No sooner through the door-- than Fullbright wheels on Ted:
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: Mr. Minton do you know what you
dialog: have done? You've put a documented
text: liar on the stand, a man with a
dialog: record of putting innocent people
speaker_heading: IN PRISON--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your honor, I--
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: You shut the fuck up when I'm
dialog: talking to you! I can think of
dialog: nothing more prejudicial or corrupt
dialog: than what I just saw out therel

dialog: Do you realize what you've done to

scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Mick and Ted exit into hall-- Ted hurrying off, angry--
text: Mick to LOUIS, DOBBS, and MARY WINDSOR-- tells them re Ted:
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: He's going to see his boss. To
dialog: decide what to do before the judge
text: comes down with a directed verdict.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What's a directed verdict?
speaker_heading: MICK
text: She takes it out of the jury's hand

speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
speaker_heading: (GLAD/HOPEFUL)

speaker_heading: MICK

scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - MEN'S ROOM
text: Mick at the urinal. Louis enters in and slides behind him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm not celebrating just yet, Mick.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah I can see that.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I want to know how Corliss got that
dialog: shit he was saying.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Let it go. You're getting what you
dialog: want, I'm getting you off...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What I want is get off for good.
text: Leans into him. Pushes a hand into his back. A threat.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You'd better understand that.
dialog: You've got enough reasons to be
dialog: afraid of me already.
text: When-- DOOR OPENS-- the courtroom CLERK, BILL, enters.
speaker_heading: CLERK BILL
dialog: It's starting.
scene_heading: CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER - ON...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I just spoke to the District
dialog: Attorney, your honor. The state

dialog: Here's a motion...
text: Mick, Louis, watch Ted hand it to Fullbright...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: It acknowledges that the procedures
dialog: which guarantee justice were not
dialog: followed in this case...
speaker_heading: JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
dialog: (as she reads)
dialog: This is a motion to dismiss with
dialog: prejudice. No coming back. Ever.
speaker_heading: TED
speaker_heading: (WITH DIFFICULTY)
dialog: Yes, your honor.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, CORRIDOR - LATER - MARY WINDSOR...

speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: Mr. Haller, thank you for my son...
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: You were splendid--
text: And Louis. Private, a few feet away. Smiles...
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I knew I wasn't wrong about you...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I want the gun.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Of course you do.
text: No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick--
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: Mr. Haller, this time I insist you
dialog: come to Orso for a celebration--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR
text: comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL. Mick freezes, expects
text: the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON:
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: Louis Roulet, you are under arrest.
dialog: Turn around and place your hands
dialog: behind your back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (as Kurlen cuffs him)
dialog: Mick? This shouldn't be happening.
text: Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back--
speaker_heading: MARY WINDSOR
dialog: No! Take your hands off my son!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Mother.
text: Louis' voice controls her. Stricken, Mary gives up. Then--
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: What are you arresting him for?
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: (starting to take Louis)
dialog: Suspicion of murder. The murder of
dialog: Martha Renteria.
speaker_heading: DOBBS
dialog: That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you
dialog: crazy? Everything that man Corliss
dialog: said was a lie!
text: Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed.
speaker_heading: KURLEN
dialog: If it was all lies, how'd you know
dialog: I meant the snake dancer?
text: Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: A moment with my client, Detective?
text: Kurlen nods, why not. Mick leads Louis a few steps away.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: This is it, Louis. I got you off.
dialog: Now get yourself a new lawyer.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're forgetting I have the gun...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Yeah, and you'll have to explain
dialog: how you got it. But you know what?
dialog: I've stopped giving a shit. You're
dialog: going down, and Martinez is getting
dialog: out, and that's all I care about.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
dialog: When they stick that needle in your
dialog: arm, that will be me.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And what if I don't go down?
text: But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Because I don't think they have
dialog: enough to hold me. I could be out
dialog: by tomorrow... You've got women,
dialog: you've got a daughter...
text: At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily...
speaker_heading: LOUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't protect everybody.

text: while Lankford makes another call...
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell
dialog: them it's over, they can grab

speaker_heading: (LISTENS-- SURPRISED)
dialog: So, bring him to the Emergency Room
dialog: first, then bring him in!
dialog: (rings off; to Sobel)
dialog: Dig this. The uniforms had some
text: help picking up Roulet. Some
dialog: motorcycle gang was already beating
dialog: the shit out of him.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: (figures it out--)
dialog: The police were tailing him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: SOBEL
dialog: (She levels.)
dialog: We thought he'd come after you. We
dialog: couldn't tell you. The truth is we
dialog: had plenty on him for killing
dialog: Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be
dialog: released. But we wanted Roulet for
dialog: Levin, too. I told you: We had to
dialog: find out how he beat the trace. Now
dialog: we know.
dialog: (her glance goes to Mary
speaker_heading: WINDSOR)
dialog: It was almost perfect. He's still
dialog: wearing the anklet...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: SOBEL
text: And it puts him half a city away.
dialog: Just like last time.
dialog: They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--
speaker_heading: LANKFORD
dialog: Look at this.
text: Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove,
text: lifts Mary's gun. Pearl-handled: The WOODSMAN. Admiring--
speaker_heading: LANKFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: They don't make'm like this
dialog: anymore.
text: Mick, makes a shape with his free hand. The "Longhorns" sign:
text: inner fingers pointing down. Like Raul made.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: "W." Mrs. Windsor.
text: Which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: FADE IN, EXT. HAYLEY, CLIMBING A TREE - DAY OF BLUE SKY
text: L.A.'s best weather: Smog-blue. The tree off Mick's porch.
text: Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch.

text: beside him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I didn't know you were awake.
text: He looks at her. Questioning.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, we haven't been living
dialog: here. We did, for a while. When you
dialog: were touch and go.
text: Mick. Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd better get her down, she can
dialog: get hurt up there--
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: You can get hurt anywhere. Let her
dialog: climb.
text: An almost normal tone of voice. She smiles. CUT TO,
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY
text: RAP BLASTING, EARL AT THE WHEEL...
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Keep your speed up, Earl...
text: He's IN THE BACK-SEAT, IT'S A MESS... He's scribbling on

speaker_heading: MICK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO CELL)
