dialog: and it's a story that might bore you but
dialog: you don't have to listen because I always
dialog: knew it was going to be like that, and it
dialog: was, I think, in that last year, or,
dialog: actually, weekend, really a Friday, in
dialog: September, at Camden, and this was years
dialog: ago when I was a different person, and I
dialog: was so drunk that I ended up losing my
dialog: virginity...
text: A WIDE SHOT of Windham House dorm, filled shoulder-to-
text: shoulder with PARTY-GOERS from ALL WALKS OF COLLEGE LIFE.
text: There is a DRONING WAH-WAH of PEOPLE TALKING and drinking
text: beer. Breaking through it is a SYNTHESIZED TOMANDANDY POP
text: SONG. On a makeshift dancefloor a guy named STUART has taken
text: off his shirt and is performing a wild solo dance.

text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM
text: LAUREN is trying to be inconspicuous despite how shitfaced
text: drunk she is -- using the walls gravitational pull to keep
text: her from swaying and revealing her inebriated state. She
text: lifts a big red plastic cup (the kind you buy by the hundreds
text: at Price Club) to her lips and takes another sip of beer.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ---I lost it to some guy who I thought
dialog: was a Ceramics major but was actually
dialog: either an NYU film student, just up to
dialog: Camden for the End of the World...

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I’m telling you, with European girls it’s
dialog: just a numbers game. If you stand on a
dialog: street corner of any major European city
dialog: and consecutively ask every girl you see
dialog: if she'll fuck you, one out of twenty
dialog: will say yes -- right then and there.
dialog: (as if to illustrate)
dialog: Do you wanna fuck? Do you wanna fuck?
dialog: Do you wanna fuck--
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing over Victor's
dialog: illustration)
dialog: Victor. A Junior, a Drama major, just
text: back from Europe, only a little gay, with
dialog: jet black hair, a great body, and these
dialog: amazing gray eyes...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: --Do you wanna fuck? Do you wanna fuck?
dialog: Do you wanna fuck? Do you wanna fuck?
dialog: Do you wanna fuck? One out of
dialog: twenty...bam. You’re fucking. It’s a
dialog: confirmed statistic. That’s the
dialog: difference between American and European
dialog: girls.
text: Victor lift his eyes with a smile to nod to someone across
dialog: the room.
text: SWISH PAN and TRACK IN ON: A BEAUTIFUL FRENCH GIRL across the

scene_heading: INT. WINDHAM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: CLOSE ON: The guy who might be a Ceramics major, but
text: probably is an NYU film student is sitting on a ratty, old
text: couch covered with a pale blue sheet, talking to her about
text: movies but really trying to jump into her pants.
text: GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT
dialog: So you know the movie I'm talking about.
dialog: It was unfairly labeled a Tarantino film
dialog: even though he’s only listed as an
dialog: Executive Producer. Remember the sex
text: scene with Nosferatu on the TV in the
dialog: background? Mindfuck if ever there was
dialog: one...
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So this guy from NYU, or wherever, who
dialog: wasn’t even a good Victor facsimile...
text: QUICK PAN/TRACK IN ON: Lauren, trying to keep focus and
text: nodding as if she knows (but doesn't) what he’s talking
text: about, is sitting opposite from him on the couch.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah. Yeah.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: WIDE ON: Lauren and the possible Ceramics major but probable
text: NYU Film major. He's CHATTING HER UP and she's kind of
text: nodding in agreement and sipping her beer -- occasionally
text: BLURTING OUT SOME INANE COMMENT.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: .---and I kept agreeing with his likes and
dialog: dislikes all the time thinking that while
dialog: he might not be Victor he was cute
dialog: enough, and I was sure that I was
dialog: mispronouncing all these filmmakers’
dialog: names, remembering all the wrong actors,
dialog: naming the wrong cinematographers, but I
dialog: wanted him...
text: His eyeline wanders and focuses on someone else across the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: .---and I could see that his gaze was
text: drifting toward Kristin Notneff...
text: SWISH PAN AND TRACK IN ON: The Louise Brooks-looking KRISTIN
text: NOTNEFF, who turns her eyes, from WHATEVER CONVERSATION SHE'S
text: IN, to meet the eyes of the guy who may be an NYU student.
dialog: Smile.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
text: ---and she was looking back at him with
dialog: confidence because she knew that
text: underneath her clothes she was wearing a
dialog: black bra and black panties -- complete
dialog: with garter belt -- which I wasn't.
dialog: CLOSE ON: Lauren, knowing that if she wants this guy, who
dialog: might be an NYU Film major, she's going to have to make a
dialog: move, or else the garter belt girl is going to steal him
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But I had the next best thing...
text: Lauren leans in and WHISPERS into the guys ear.
speaker_heading: LAUREN

text: SLAM! The guy who may be from NYU shuts the door and smiles.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Except it wasn't my room. It was Lorna
text: Slavin's room, who was off campus at her
dialog: boyfriends house...probably swallowing
dialog: his DNA.
text: Lauren sits down on the bed, totally fucked up, but seductive
dialog: despite her condition.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And I didn't have a joint either -- and
dialog: if I did I didn't know where it was
dialog: because it would have been Lorna Slavin's
dialog: joint. He didn't really even care when I
dialog: told him I didn't have one.
text: The guy who might be from NYU sits down on the bed next to
text: her and makes his move. He leans in and starts kissing her.
text: Almost immediately her eyes roll into the back of her head
text: and she passes out.

dialog: I must have passed out around then...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:

text: laying on her stomach and her face is buried into a pillow.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: When I came to I tried to take off my
dialog: bra, but was still too drunk...and he was
dialog: already fucking me.
text: She looks back, kind of annoyed, and sure enough, she's being
text: fucked from behind. GRUNT, GRUNT, GRUNT -- with every
text: exhalation comes a thrust. She starts MOANING with every

speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)

dialog: But he didn't know I was a virgin and
dialog: that it hurt -- not that badly, only a
text: little bit of sharp pain, but not as bad
dialog: as I had been taught to expect, but not
dialog: exactly pleasant either -- and that's
dialog: when I heard another voice in the room...
text: She lifts her head and tries to look back behind her to
dialog: determine the source of the VOICE.
scene_heading: GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT (0.S.)
dialog: Do her how Ron Jeremy would.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: .---and I remember the weight on the bed
dialog: shifting and realizing that this person
dialog: behind me wasn't the NYU film student
dialog: guy, but someone else--
text: TRACK UP FROM Lauren to a TOWNIE is grasping her ass and
text: fucking her from behind with porn movie thrusts. He has a
text: blue Viagra pill on his tongue and is holding a plastic beer
text: cup in one hand. He swallows the pill with a swig of beer.
speaker_heading: TOWNIE
dialog: Leave that up to Vitamin “Vv”.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ohmygod, it was some townie. I had
dialog: actually lost my virginity to a townie.
text: TRACK BACK DOWN TO Lauren as she lays her drunken head back
text: onto the pillow and shuts her eyes, trying to block out the
dialog: thrusting.
text: LONG, SLOW ZOOM IN ON: her closed eyes.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This wouldn't have happened with Victor.
dialog: He would have taken me gently in his big
dialog: strong Drama major arms and undressed me
text: quietly, expertly, taken the bra off with
dialog: grace and ease, kissed me deeply,
dialog: tenderly, and it probably wouldn't have
dialog: hurt. I should have given myself to
dialog: Victor last term, when I had the chance--

text: GUY ROLLING A KEG
dialog: Dude, we have to put the keg somewhere.
text: It rolls forward and SLAMS into the bed, shaking her.
text: The door closes again and the room is again shrouded in
dialog: darkness.
scene_heading: GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT (0.S.)
dialog: I'm next...
text: Suddenly, mid-thrust, the townie heaves up a mouthful of
text: barf, spraying it onto Lauren's back with a satisfying
speaker_heading: SPLASH.
dialog: The disruption causes all three people, Lauren included, to
text: slip and fall off the bed, pulling the sheets with them and
text: CRASHING into a desk or something.
text: GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT
dialog: Gross, dude! Leave me with sloppy
dialog: seconds, why don’t you?
text: The townie lurches forward and grabs a cheap wicker waste
dialog: basket, the kind you buy at Target, and lets round two come
text: gushing out into it. Of course, it splashes out and
text: splatters onto Lauren and the guy who might be an NYU film
dialog: student.
text: For a moment she focuses on the townie's shirt, it's a short
text: sleeved button-down with a cartoony donkey pattern printed on
dialog: it.
text: Lauren shuts her eyes.
text: FREEZE FRAME: Lauren sits there, locked in time, a wretched
text: moment that's almost humble in its horrible nature.
text: THEN WE READ THE TITLE:
speaker_heading: LAUREN

text: TRACK SLOWLY AWAY AND OUT OF THE ROOM as Lauren finds herself
text: back on her face and knees getting it from behind, but with
text: strange REVERSE thrusts.

dialog: (his voice running backwards)
dialog: -..txen m'I

text: The townies GRUNTS HAVE REVERSED into a SUCKING SOUND.

text: braking of the rolling keg with their fingertips.
text: They're laughing and the MUSIC, which we can now hear clearly
text: is still WINDING BACKWARDS.
text: They come to some stairs and with an erratic BACKWARDS
text: MOVEMENT the keg jumps up into the air and into the hands of
text: the guys who carry it, BACKWARDS down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. WINDHAM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (REVERSE) - NIGHT 9
text: The guys with the keg come walking down the stairs -- all

text: TRACK BACKWARDS (IN REVERSE MOTION) through the room,
text: following them with the keg as they roll it BACKWARDS across
text: the small dance floor where COLLEGE STUDENTS are dancing (in
speaker_heading: REVERSE, of course).
text: The keg rolls up to a bucket of watery melted ice. The guys
text: rolling it hoist it up and out of a bucket of ice. The tap
text: pops on and the last dribbles of foamy spray suck back into
text: the spout...all REVERSE MOTION.
speaker_heading: THE WATERY ICE (REVERSE) 10

text: CLOSE ON: The beer flows out of cups and into the spout.
text: The keg must be full.
text: TRACK BACKWARDS past a GUY WITH A LARGE BEER BONG. He lifts

text: filling up the long tube.
text: TRACK BACKWARDS past a GUY WATCHING THE BEER BONGER with a
text: bag of chips, he’s pulling them out of his mouth and putting
text: them into the bag.
text: TRACK BACKWARDS past a beat up Sean Bateman (who I’11
text: describe later). Some ripped apart purple envelopes and
text: their accompanying letters come lifting up and out of a

text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL: The entire room. We can see Victor,

dialog: Kristin Notneff scoping around for someone other than the guy
dialog: who might be an NYU student.
text: TRACK in-between a GROUP OF GUYS near a fireplace with a TV
text: in it instead of wood. On the TV is a video of an actual
text: fireplace. PAUL DENTON, one of the guys, is talking. He's
dialog: definitely one of the beautiful people. At 20, he has the
text: brooding good looks of a supermodel, but is clearly too sharp

dialog: Station, which was kind of pretty. Stayed with some friends
dialog: in someone's basement. Smoked a lot of hash in Amsterdam
dialog: too, but lost most of my stash in some museum. The museums
dialog: were cool, I guess. Lots of Van Goghs and the Vermeers were
dialog: intense. Wandered around, bought a lot of pastries, ate some
dialog: intense waffles. The Dutch all know English so I didn't have
dialog: to speak any Dutch, which was a relief. Wanted to rent a car
dialog: but couldn't. The people I was staying with had bikes
dialog: though, so I went biking one day and I saw a lot of cows and
text: geese and canals. I pulled off to the side of the road, got
dialog: stoned and fell asleep, woke up, wrote a little, took some
text: acid, made a few drawings, and then went to the red light
dialog: district in Den Haag, because I heard the whores are cleaner
dialog: and better looking than the whores in Amsterdam -- which they
dialog: were. I fucked one so hard that I skinned my knees. Ate
dialog: lunch at a Burger King, which was better and no more
dialog: expensive than the States. Stayed in the Amsterdam Youth
dialog: Hostel where there were some cool German guys who spoke
dialog: better English than I do. We bought some coke and I cruised
text: the red light district until I found a brunette with big tits
dialog: that reminds me of KJ. I gave her a hundred Guilders. She
dialog: worked me up, mounted me, put on a good show, and in the end
dialog: she pulled me out and I came between her tits -- even though
text: I’m wearing a rubber. Afterward we made small talk about
text: AIDS, her Moroccan pimp, and herself. I wake to the sound of
text: a wino singing. It is eight AM and hot as blazes. Had a
text: beer and then headed South to Paris. Climbed the Eifel Tower
dialog: with this Canadian guy named Tim for only seven Francs
dialog: because the ticket machine was broke. Got the hang of the
text: Subways. Told Tim to get lost. Met a French girl who’s
dialog: going to Camden. I think she gave me mono. Went to Pamplona
dialog: for the running of the bulls. Never saw one bull but I
text: almost got trampled by the crowd. Dropped acid at the Museo
dialog: Gala-Dali, which was a trip. Went to the lamest circus ever,
text: a goat and two guys on unicycles. Went to Nice and ate
dialog: Mexican food at a place called Calexico -- or Mexicali. Then
dialog: went to Switzerland where I, ironically, couldn’t find anyone
dialog: who had the time. Took the Glacier Express to Zermatt, the
dialog: Matterhorn, and found out that I could ski it, which, when
dialog: you’re there, you have to do -- but I didn’t have gloves so I
dialog: used socks instead and froze my hands. It was slushy but
dialog: fun. Ate some Sourdough bread that tasted like it was made
text: with sour milk. Eurail Pass’d into Italy and accidently
dialog: slept through Florence. Ended up in Rome which was big and
dialog: hot and dirty. It was just like L.A., but with ruins. I
dialog: went to the Vatican but couldn’t get in because I was wearing
dialog: shorts. I could get into the Sistine Chapel, which now that
dialog: it’s been cleaned looked fake. At the train station I met
dialog: two girls from Germany who I drank warm beer with. They’re
dialog: living for a full year on only nine dollars a day. I tease
text: them and then turn the couchette into a huge bed and we all
dialog: fuck. I wake dirty and tired in Brindisi, which is hot and
dialog: filthy. I go with the German girls to get a ferry to Greece,
dialog: but we have to take different boats because I’m on Eurail and

text: they’re on Interail. On the ferry to Corfu I meet three
dialog: American girls and a guy from Turkey who used the word
dialog: “nigger” constantly. This offends the American girls and I
dialog: use it to my advantage. When we get to Corfu the girls and I
text: ditch the Turkish guy and rent a house on the beach together.
dialog: I dry hump one of the girls, whose name I think was Sue. I
dialog: wake to Sue’s fat face and go off on my own to get wasted.
text: When I stumble back I make out with Sue for a while until she
dialog: tells me that I’m being cold to her. So I leave again and
text: get drunk on Ouzo and the waiters break plates onto my head.
dialog: When I get back that night Sue is asleep and I go skinny
text: dipping with her friend out to some rocks. We sit on the
text: rocks for a while and then she grabs my dick and we start to
dialog: make out. She calls me Mr. L.A. I come close to fucking her
text: but she says she can’t because she’s engaged, which is
dialog: bullshit. I leave the next morning before they get up and
dialog: take the ferry back to Italy. On the train I meet some Dutch
dialog: guys. We started drinking heavily. The Dutch guys seem like
dialog: fags to me. I got so drunk I couldn’t see and exchanged my
text: shirt with one of them. In Venice I try to fart and instead
text: shit my pants. Back in my hotel I masturbate and have a pain
text: in my groin. That night I dream about a beautiful girl half
text: in water, stretching her lean body. She asks me if I like it
dialog: and I tell her she could clean fish with it. I wake well
text: rested, masturbate in shower, and check out. I make my way
text: back to London and hang out in Piccadilly Circus at a comic
dialog: book shop. I meet a cute girl from Amsterdam at a Whimpys
text: while eating a Spicy Bean Burger. She’s an Oreo with a
text: diamond in her front tooth. We get stoned and fuck at her
dialog: flat to Michael Jackson records and the next morning I wake
text: up talking to myself. I have a big bump on my head from
text: flailing in my sleep. I get my stuff and barely make my
dialog: plane back to the United States. I no longer know who I am
