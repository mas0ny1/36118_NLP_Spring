scene_heading: EXT. SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
text: From high above, we look straight down a FOREST OF TOWERING
text: PINES standing in a field of moonlit snow.
text: We glide over the treetops, floating just above their peaks
text: as a light snow falls, the flakes corkscrewing lazily away.
text: All seems peaceful, silent.
text: Then we notice a strange light playing against the fresh
text: powder. Red, then blue. Then red again.
text: We crest a final stand of trees to reveal: AN ENTIRE
text: ENCAMPMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, some three hundred or so
text: police, fire and ambulance, situated in what appears to be
text: the middle of nowhere.
text: From this angle, directly overhead, the SQUAD CARS and SWAT
text: VANS almost look like toys. Nothing moves. The POLICE
text: OFFICERS and SWAT Team members, hunkered down in firing
text: positions, point their weapons at something unseen.
text: We tilt from our isolating top-down view to reveal that this
text: paramilitary phalanx is surrounding: a MODEST FARMHOUSE.
text: It's a standoff of some kind, clearly.
text: Then we see an ANT-SIZED FIGURE moving urgently across this
text: frozen tableau. We slowly zoom in on the ant, revealing him
text: to be a MAN IN A WINDBREAKER.
text: We move with him now, tracking a FOLDED NOTE that he carries
text: in his hand, as he brings us to a TACTICAL TRAILER with a
text: seal emblazoned on the door:
scene_heading: FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
speaker_heading: HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM
text: The Windbreaker Man enters and we go with him...
scene_heading: INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
text: ...moving through the narrow trailer, past HIGH-TECH
text: OBSERVATION EQUIPMENT manned by SPECIALISTS, to a BACK DOOR.
text: The Windbreaker Man opens the door to reveal a
speaker_heading: SMALL COMMS ROOM
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: and a NEGOTIATOR on the phone, flanked by the HOSTAGE RESCUE
text: COMMANDER ("HR1i") and the ON SCENE COMMANDER, the man
dialog: running the show.
text: The Windbreaker Man hands the On Scene the folded note. He
text: reads it and nods. Meanwhile, the Negotiator works the
text: phone in a last ditch attempt to talk this through...
dialog: -.-yes, I
dialog: do. And I
speaker_heading: NEGOTIATOR
dialog: hear what you're saying. I
dialog: would be angry too. But
dialog: you have to listen to me now. This
dialog: has gone on long enough and it needs
dialog: to end, okay? Can you help me here?
dialog: Help me find a solution so we can end
dialog: this peacefully for you, for your
dialog: family, for everyone. We don't want
dialog: anyone to get hurt -- and I know you
dialog: don't want to hurt anyone.

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
text: Clutching the phone to
speaker_heading: - NIGHT
text: his ear is RAY HUTCHINSON (38),

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You don't want to hurt anyone? I'm
dialog: already hurt. You hear me? I'm
text: already hurt.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You say you're giving me a choice but
dialog: this isn't a choice. Ending this
dialog: peacefully means I go to prison and
dialog: my wife and my kids grow up without a
dialog: father?
dialog: me?
dialog: That's what you're offering
dialog: (beat, deciding)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RAY (cont'd)
dialog: It's alright. Everything's gonna be
dialog: alright now. I promise.
text: Ray moves to a HEAVY CHEST and throws it open, staring at
text: what's inside. A grim look washes over his face.
scene_heading: INT. TAC OPS COMMAND TRAILER / COMMS ROOM - NIGHT
text: The Negotiator looks up gravely from dial tone in his hand.
text: The On Scene looks to HR1.
speaker_heading: HR1
text: Gold Unit is in position. They have
dialog: compromise authority and are at ready
dialog: green. We're set, sir.
speaker_heading: ON SCENE
dialog: (re: the note)
text: 7th floor approves escalation.
dialog: (to the Negotiator)
dialog: Can you get him back on the phone?
speaker_heading: NEGOTIATOR
text: He's done talking.
speaker_heading: ON SCENE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Very well.
text: The On Scene exits the COMMS ROOM and moves into the main
text: trailer where he picks up a headset.
speaker_heading: ON SCENE (cont'd)
dialog: Gold Unit, this is "Tock", be advised
dialog: you have control. Repeat, you have
dialog: control.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The REFLECTION in the farmhouse window shows SWAT UNITS
text: backing off. Ray's request, it seems, has been met.
text: The window curtains crack to reveal Ray watching the action.
text: We drop down from the window and pivot off of Ray to reveal:
text: THE FARMHOUSE YARD.
text: A blanket of snow, some bushes, a woodpile.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We hold on this frame -- but nothing happens. A moment
text: more. Still nothing.
dialog: Then...
text: One of the BUSHES moves. Then part of a WOODPILE seems to
text: detach. And a section of snow right in front of us this
text: whole time, rises revealing itself to have GREEN EYES.
text: And now we see it: a SIX-MAN FBI HRT ASSAULT TEAM moves from
text: their camouflaged hides and stacks up tight against the wall
text: just below the farmhouse window.
text: They slough off their elaborate camouflage, revealing each
text: man to be kitted out in body armor and loaded for bear.
text: We land on the team leader, WILL FORD, a seasoned operator.
text: Will speaks softly into his comm...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Gold Unit in position.
text: Will looks at his second in command, his best friend and a
text: man we'll know later as HORACE. Will nods. Horace moves,
text: setting a heavy-duty BREACHING CHARGE on the farmhouse wall.
text: Finished, Horace slides back into position giving Will the
text: thumbs up. Will nods and begins the countdown...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Five, four, three, two, one...
dialog: Execute. Execute. Execute.
text: Will depresses a THUMB PLUNGER, igniting the breaching
text: charge -- BANG! The sound is deafening as the wall explodes,
text: leaving a gaping hole of smoke and dust in its wake.
text: Will rushes in, primary through the door. We go with him,
text: pushing through the thick haze to find
speaker_heading: RAY HUTCHINSON
text: standing there, his back to us. Will and Horace go to guns
text: on him, their sites leveled, fingers poised on triggers.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Turn around! Show us your hands!
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: Do it! Now!
text: The rest of the HRT UNIT fans out near Will, securing the
text: mother and daughter who won't stop screaming.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Slowly, Ray turns to face Will revealing that he's HOLDING
text: HIS SIX YEAR-OLD SON in his arms -- the boy's head wedged
text: into the crook of his father's neck.
speaker_heading: HORACE (cont'd)
dialog: Boss...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hold your fire.
dialog: (to Ray)
dialog: Put him down.
text: Ray hesitates. Horace grips his M-4, staring down it.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: +..-I've got him clean...
text: The boy's eyes lock with Will's.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No. Don't. I got this.
text: Will turns to Ray, speaking with authoritative calm...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Ray, look at me. Look at me. It's over
dialog: now. It's over. Put your son down, get
dialog: on your knees and interlace your
dialog: fingers behind your head. Do it now.
text: Ray takes it all in, the madness he's caused. The pain.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Ray lets his son slide off of him to the ground, revealing
text: something horrifying: RAY IS WEARING A SUICIDE VEST.
text: Will's eyes go wide -- he dives for Horace, tackling him
text: behind the KITCHEN COUNTER just as:
text: THE VEST DETONATES.
dialog: boom.
text: A ring of tinnitus in our ear. Screaming. Will,
text: disoriented, catches glimpses of his team shattered -- dead
text: or dying. A living nightmare.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: The horror of it washes over Will: his call to hold fire has
dialog: cost the lives of those he cares about most in this world:
text: his team, his men, his brothers.
text: Devastated, Will mumbles over and over...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No-no-no-no...
text: Sound falls away. Everything goes to white.
text: We're in a hallway now somehow. The strobe of overhead
text: florescent lights rushing past us.
text: Then a face looks down at us. A Naval surgeon we'll come to
text: know as SARAH. She smiles at us and says...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're gonna be okay.

scene_heading: TEN YEARS LATER
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: A sun-dappled city park. Green grass. Trees. A little
text: creek babbles nearby. Two kids, seven year-old fraternal
text: twins, HENRY and GEORGIA argue about what to play: hide &
dialog: seek or tag. Georgia gets her way: they'll play tag.
text: We find Will, older now, a sadness behind his eyes. But
text: sitting on the grass watching the children play, he can't
text: help but smile.
speaker_heading: SARAH (0.C.)
dialog: She takes after you, you know.
text: Will turns to see his beautiful wife, Sarah, the surgeon who
text: saved his life, enjoying the moment with him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh yeah. Stubborn. Too hard on
text: herself. Cries during sports movies.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't cry during sports movies.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Will laughs.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Rudy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well, come on. It's Rudy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Field of Dreams.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Everyone cries at Field of Dreams--
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: A League of Their Own.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That was one time. And I was on
dialog: medication.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Benedryl.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Extra strength -- and fine, maybe
dialog: she's got my personality. I'm just
dialog: glad she got your looks.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Me too because you'd make a really
dialog: ugly woman. Like if we put a dress
dialog: on you, the only thing missing would
text: be neck-bolts.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hang on -- back up. Did you call me
dialog: stubborn?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You are stubborn.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Since always. Now say it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on. I got it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Then let me hear you say it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: (2)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who's being stubborn now?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm being insistent. There's a
dialog: difference. Besides, don't you want
dialog: to make a good impression?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm serious, Will. It'll go a long
dialog: way with him -- it's a cultural
dialog: thing. Just say it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hen gaoxing de wen ni.
dialog: It's Cantonese. And it actually wasn't that bad...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Perfect. Perfectly done. The
text: intonation, the enunciation. A+.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thank you. See? I'm not stubborn.
dialog: I can be taught.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: One thing though.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I taught you how to say: Hou hoi sam
dialog: sik dou nei, "It's an honor to meet
dialog: you." But you said, "Hou hoi sam sek
dialog: dou nei."
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And what does that mean?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's an honor to kiss you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ah. And that's bad?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Depends on what kind of meeting you
dialog: wanna have.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Alright -- I give up. No more
dialog: Chinese. I've gotta get ready.
text: Will stands up calling out to the kids...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Henry! Georgia! Time to go!
text: The kids look at their father. Georgia capitalizes on the
text: distraction, tagging her twin brother...
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Tag! You're it!
text: ...then bolting. Henry cries foul and gives chase. The two
text: kids run toward their father with abandon. Will smiles.
text: Georgia reaches Will first, wrapping her arms around her
dialog: father's leg...
speaker_heading: GEORGIA (cont'd)
dialog: Base! Dad's base! I'm safe!
text: ...and that's when we see that Will's right leg isn't made
text: of flesh and bone but rather metal and plastic -- a
text: PROSTHESIS FROM THE KNEE DOWN. A scar he bears from that
dialog: fateful night ten years ago.
text: Henry arrives grabbing hold of Will's other leg.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Safe!
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: I'm already safe, you can't be safe
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes I can.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: That's stupid.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey -- not nice. And your brother's
dialog: right. You're both safe. Daddy is
dialog: safe for everyone because-- WHOA!
text: -- suddenly Will jumps a foot as Sarah dumps an entire
text: bottle of water down his back.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Tag you're it!
text: Sarah takes off running, laughing. Will gives chase, his
text: kids squealing with delight at their parents playing.
text: Will catches Sarah, planting a big kiss on her before she
text: tickles him and trips him to the ground, falling on top of
text: him as both Henry and Georgia join in: a dog pile on daddy.
text: Will lets himself get pinned, laughing -- in heaven.
text: It's then that we PULL BACK from this idyllic familial
text: scene, past the grass and the trees and the babbling brook.
text: We continue pulling back, further and further still, until
dialog: we reveal something shocking.
dialog: This park isn't in a city. And it's not in a small town.
text: This entire THREE ACRE PARK exists on the 100TH FLOOR OF THE
text: TALLEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD.
text: A newly completed, three-thousand foot tall work of stunning
text: architecture called THE PEARL rises gracefully from
text: shoreline of VICTORIA HARBOR, dwarfing the surrounding
dialog: skyline. We're in...
dialog: Hong Kong
text: Then a SOOTHING VOICE...
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Welcome to The Pearl...
text: Quickly, we find ourselves in a highly polished PROMOTIONAL
dialog: VIDEO...
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE
text: +..a marvel of modern engineering.
text: Standing at over three-thousand feet,
dialog: The Pearl's 225 stories make it the
dialog: world's tallest building...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: We get our first good look at this work of art: a TOWERING,
scene_heading: TWISTING, SKYSCRAPER with an OPEN-AIR CENTER CORE running
text: its entire length, from top to bottom, giving the structure
text: an airy, sunlit translucent grandeur.
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...it's so tall, you could fit the
text: Empire State building inside of it
dialog: twice! And you'd still have room for
dialog: a 50 story building on top!
text: -- B-roll of construction and slick computer generated fly-
text: through designs fill the frame.
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Completed just last year, China's
text: newest beacon of progress boasts a
dialog: five-star hotel, three full gyms, two
dialog: 16-screen cinemas, a driving range,
dialog: as well as world-class shopping and
text: dining at its six-story indoor mall
dialog: and three star Michelin-rated
text: restaurant with rotating views of the
dialog: spectacular Hong Kong skyline -- all
dialog: within its confines...
text: -- we see cutaways of each feature, happy people enjoying
dialog: every amenity.
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...And that's just half the story!
text: A DIVIDING LINE bisects the building halfway up...
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Next month, The Pearl will open its
dialog: upper half to permanent residents --
dialog: already sold out, with a ten year
dialog: waiting list, these luxury apartments
dialog: will serve as home to many of China's
dialog: most successful citizens. With Pangu
dialog: Park -- the world's first fully
dialog: functional high rise garden --
text: located on the hundredth floor,
dialog: residents will have their every
dialog: possible need met, from outdoor sun
dialog: to indoor fun -- you'll never need to
dialog: leave The Pearl!
text: It's then we PULL BACK to reveal we're...
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - DAY
text: A stunning three-bedroom apartment on the 98th floor with
text: jaw-dropping views. Henry and Georgia are transfixed by the
text: television playing the promotional video...
speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE
dialog: But that's not all. The Pearl's
dialog: crowning achievement -- the singular
dialog: feature that makes this building
dialog: unlike any other, anywhere else in
dialog: the world is...
text: ..-but just before we reveal what that might be, the TV cuts
text: off. Henry and Georgia turn to see Sarah standing there.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: TV goes off, shoes on. It's Panda
dialog: Time!
text: Excited, Georgia zips up her PANDA HOODIE, pulling the cowl
text: over her head, turning her into a mini-Panda bear.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Nice, Georgia. Subtle.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where's your dad?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Bathroom.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
text: He's talking to himself again.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Dressed nicely, Will ties the laces on his BROWN WINGTIP.
text: Only the shoe is facing him on the bathroom sink counter,
text: attached to his PROSTHETIC LEG -- a handy way to do it.
text: He talks to himself in the mirror as he goes, practicing the
text: Chinese phrase over and over, stumbling every time. Will
text: shakes his head muttering to himself...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Screw it. I'm just gonna high-five
dialog: the guy.
text: Finished tying his shoe, Will uses a Kleenex to wipe off a
text: smudge on it, then tosses the tissue paper into the toilet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Will attaches his prosthesis, sliding his pant leg down over
text: it. He goes to flush the toilet but can't find the
text: handle -- there doesn't seem to be one. It's a mystery.
text: Will looks at a BIZARRE ARRAY of touchscreen buttons next to
text: the toilet -- none of which look like "flush". He presses
text: one and gets a BIDET SPRAY right in the kisser.
text: One cue, Sarah walks in.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Everything okay in here?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yep, just thought I'd take a shower
text: in the toilet.
text: Sarah walks over...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: It's broken. We should call--
text: .»..and presses a button, the toilet flushes normally.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: I was gonna pick that one next.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sure you were, big guy.
text: Sarah fixes Will's outfit, drying him off, fussing over him.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Hey -- you think it's weird that
dialog: we're the only ones on this floor?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We're the only ones on any floor from
dialog: the 96th on up -- so not really.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, I mean why not put us up in the
dialog: hotel in the bottom half? Why give
dialog: us an entire ghost town floor to
dialog: ourselves?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't know -- maybe he's trying to
dialog: impress us.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You think a billionaire, real estate

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You think I'm reaching?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think you drive a Kia. So, yeah.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm just saying: don't over-think it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Have you met me?
text: Will smiles, grabs his jacket, closes his LAPTOP and puts it
text: in his SHOULDER BAG.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Horace is coming to get you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Any minute now.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Can I just say one thing?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don't give him any money.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's not going to ask me for money.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Because he's head of security for
dialog: this entire building and they pay him
dialog: for that.
text: Will and Sarah move into the other room and tag-team getting
text: Georgia and Henry ready, backpacks, shoes, etc. Will puts
text: Georgia's hair into a ponytail, clearly he's had practice.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: And how much of that does he double
dialog: down with?
text: Will frowns. Moves toward the front door, Sarah follows.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's not -- he doesn't have a
dialog: gambling problem.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Not anymore -- you helped him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Look, that was three years ago -- he
dialog: got in over his head with the wrong
dialog: kind of people. He would've done the
dialog: same thing for me. He made a
dialog: mistake -- we all make mistakes.
dialog: (beat)
text: And he's sticking his neck out for
dialog: me. They could've gone with a higher
dialog: profile guy to handle the security
dialog: assessment but he put in a good word.
dialog: He's the reason we're here -- and we
dialog: could use the money.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You have a soft spot for him. That's
dialog: all I'm saying.
text: DING-DONG. Doorbell. They look at each other -- time's up.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Me!
text: Will rapidly points between them repeating his question,

text: Finally, Will kisses each of them on the tops of their
text: heads. Sarah watches the sweet moment, sighing...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I gotta get a chant.
text: Will winks at her, then moves to the door, opening it to
text: reveal Horace his second-in-command from his HRT days and
text: the only other member of the team to survive the blast.
text: Nearly Will's size, with some telltale BURN SCARS on his
text: cheek and neck, Horace offers up a big smile.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: Brother.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Brother.
text: The two friends embrace. The observant might notice
text: Horace's right hand is severely misinformed -- mangled from
text: the explosion. The hug breaks and Horace spots Sarah...
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: Sarah -- you look beautiful.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nice to see you, Horace.
text: Sarah gives Horace a polite hug just as Henry and Georgia
text: arrive. Horace can't believe it.
speaker_heading: HORACE

speaker_heading: HORACE

text: Horace pulls out a trio of GOLD TICKETS.
speaker_heading: HORACE (cont'd)
dialog: These'll let you stay for the
text: nighttime feeding -- after they close
dialog: Ocean Park to everyone else. Very
dialog: hard to get.
text: He hands the tickets to Sarah.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's amazing. Thank you, H.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What do you guys say?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Are you gonna ask my dad for money?
dialog: Off of Will's look we move to...
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - INNER ATRIUM - DAY
text: Horace and Will move toward the cylindrical INNER ATRIUM of
text: The Pearl, an open-air center column that runs from the
text: ground floor to the very top of the structure.
text: The internal circumference is lined with a series of GLASS
text: ELEVATORS and SKYWAY BRIDGES that span the vast opening,
text: connecting various floors directly, giving the space the look
text: of a BRAIN STEM with synapses firing.
text: Horace jabs the button, they wait.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sorry about that. Georgia doesn't

speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: Why, does she cry at sports movies
dialog: too?
text: DING. Elevator arrives. Horace and Will step on.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - ELEVATORS - DAY

speaker_heading: HORACE

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: HORACE

speaker_heading: HORACE

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HORACE

speaker_heading: ZHAO

text: A pregnant pause, then Zhao lets him off the hook...
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I'm kidding.
text: Will exhales.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, thank god. My wife only taught

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: And your children, Henry and
dialog: Georgia -- twins?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You do your research.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I've got a good team around me. But
dialog: I wasn't aware that your wife speaks
dialog: Cantonese. I thought she was a Naval
dialog: surgeon.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She is. But she minored in language
dialog: and East Asian studies at Annapolis.
dialog: She was gonna work for Doctors
dialog: Without Borders in rural China after
dialog: her service.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, real neat.
text: Mr. Pierce jumps in...

speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: I think what Mr. Ford is trying to
dialog: say is that it would be imprudent of

dialog: comment whatsoever about The Pearl's
dialog: qualities, aesthetic or otherwise.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: With all due respect, he's not much

dialog: look but toes the party line...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's right. I'm only here as a
dialog: certified independent third party to
dialog: assess your safety and security
dialog: measures and, if they're compliant,
dialog: sign off on them so Mr. Pierce's
dialog: company can give you the thumbs up to
dialog: officially open the top half of your
dialog: building. It's not really my place
dialog: to comment.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I know why you're here, Mr. Ford.
dialog: And I know it's not your place to
dialog: comment -- which is precisely why I'm
dialog: asking you to. Please, your honest
dialog: opinion.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's been my experience that when
dialog: people ask for someone's honest
dialog: opinion, that's usually the last
dialog: thing they want.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Humor me.
text: Will glances at Mr. Pierce who gives him a stiff "go ahead"
text: nod. Will clears his throat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well, let me start by saying that
dialog: what you've built here is truly
dialog: incredible. You should be proud.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: But...?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But...if it were up to me, I would

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: And why is that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You've built a vertical city here,
dialog: Mr. Zhao, which is impressive sure,
dialog: but you've brought with it every
dialog: single fire, safety and security
dialog: challenge I can think of -- and
dialog: you've not only brought them all
dialog: indoors, you've trapped them three
text: thousand feet in the air.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everything in this building has to go
dialog: right every single time and too
dialog: little has to go wrong once for there
dialog: to be a very serious problem without
dialog: a viable solution.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, I'm a simple man. I like my
dialog: beer cold, my wings hot and fireworks
dialog: on the 4th of July. But if you're
dialog: asking for my honest opinion about
dialog: what you've built here, it would be
dialog: this: I don't get it.
text: Then Will looks at Mr. Pierce.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: But, Hell, I'm just a glorified
dialog: security guard. So what do I know?
text: The room sucks in. Mr. Pierce shoots daggers at Will. But
text: Zhao smiles and says with all sincerity...
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Wonderful. Now I know I can trust
dialog: you.
text: Zhao pulls out a TRANSLUCENT FLASH DRIVE.
speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: This drive contains the machine codes
dialog: for The Pearl's fire and safety
dialog: control measures -- a master key, if
dialog: you will, to the entire building.
dialog: They're linked to your laptop alone
dialog: and, once installed, will only be
dialog: accessible for a twenty-four hour
dialog: window before self-deleting. I trust
dialog: that will be enough time for you to
dialog: thoroughly vet our security and
dialog: submit your final analysis for Mr.
dialog: Pierce's approval?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: More than enough. Thank you.

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Come on, if we hurry there's still
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Time for what?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: For you to get it.
text: Zhao smiles. Will looks a little confused.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEARL - OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
dialog: And finally we see it -- the crowning achievement of this
dialog: incredible structure, and the very thing that gives the
dialog: building its name:
scene_heading: A STUNNING 360-DEGREE GEODESIC DOME
dialog: 
text: encases the upper most echelon of The Pearl -- an
text: observation deck fashioned entirely out of laser-cut
text: crystalline glass whose triangular facets fit so perfectly,
text: one into the next, that they almost disappear entirely.
text: What's more, the footprint of the glass deck itself extends
text: beyond the profile of the building's rooftop allowing for
text: the stout-hearted to walk out beyond the roof and look
text: straight down to the ground, nearly a mile below.
text: It's nothing short of breath-taking.
text: We find Zhao and Will up here alone. Will takes in the
text: sight dumb-founded. Zhao stares across the Victoria Harbor.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I grew up over there, across the
dialog: water on the Kowloon side. My father
dialog: sold fish. His father sold fish and
dialog: his father before him. So I grew up

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm sorry for your loss. But why are
dialog: you telling me all this?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Because you and I aren't so different

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah -- next time remind me to invite

speaker_heading: WILL

text: Suddenly, as if by magic, the deck, the glass, the entire

speaker_heading: HORACE (cont'd)

scene_heading: A _(reasonably-priced) HONG KONG STYLE MOTORCYCLE CHASE,

speaker_heading: TECHIE
dialog: I can get access to nominal

speaker_heading: XIA

speaker_heading: XIA (cont'd)
dialog: Time for Plan B.
speaker_heading: HORACE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: How come you didn't pick up his gun?
scene_heading: INT. HORACE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: A well-appointed but modest one-bedroom apartment on the
text: second floor. Horace inspects Will's wound.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: I mean you could've picked it up but
dialog: you didn't. Why?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't know. I haven't touched one
dialog: in such a long time -- I guess I just
dialog: didn't want to hurt anybody today.
text: There's more to it, but Horace leaves it alone. He stands.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: You're gonna need stitches. I'11l get
dialog: my kit.
text: Horace stands up and moves into the adjacent BATHROOM and
text: starts digging out his med kit.
text: Will's phone rings. Sarah is FaceTiming him. He answers.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey baby -- how are the pandas?
text: But, surprisingly, Sarah is back at The Pearl. [INTERCUT AS
scene_heading: NECESSARY].
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We didn't really get to see them --
dialog: Henry ate some weird candy and
dialog: started throwing up, so we came back.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: Horace gets a text message. He reads it. Looks at himself
text: in the mirror -- a haunted man stares back.
speaker_heading: IN THE PEARL
text: Sarah ushers Henry and Georgia off the elevator and toward
text: their luxury apartment door.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Is he okay? Did he have an attack?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, his breathing is fine. No fever or
dialog: anything, he just needs to lie down.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay -- I'm coming back right now.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don't rush -- we're cool. Just, you
dialog: know, no pandas. Which sucks.
text: Henry chimes in...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It sucks!
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: Alright, I'm gonna hustle back. Love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Love you.
text: Sarah hangs up, unlocking the door to their apartment when
text: suddenly out of an adjacent APARTMENT DOOR, SIX SECURITY
text: GUARDS appear, carrying HEAVY BLACK DUFFLE BAGS, two of them
text: wheeling a HANDCART with a CONTAINER on it. They stop short
text: at the sight of Sarah and her kids.
text: The LEAD SECURITY GUARD, sporting a Samurai topknot haircut,
text: smiles kindly...
scene_heading: LEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Sorry, miss. We thought this floor
dialog: was empty.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah -- me too.
text: The kids stare at the men. It's a strangely charged moment.
text: Sarah notices a faded word stenciled on the container:
speaker_heading: TMlapalmlwot
text: Sarah doesn't know what it means but her Spidey-sense starts
text: tingling. Something about these guys isn't right.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Everything okay?
scene_heading: LEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Everything's fine. Routine floor
dialog: check.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Takes six guys to check an empty
dialog: floor, huh?
text: The Lead Security Guard smiles tightly.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
scene_heading: LEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: We like to be thorough.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'll say.
scene_heading: LEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: You have a nice night, ma'am.
text: With that, the team moves down the hall toward an EXIT DOOR,
text: one of the Guards shoots a glance over his shoulder,
text: clocking her. He asks under his breath...
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Want me to clean that up?
scene_heading: LEAD SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Nah. It'll take care of itself.
text: They push through the exit door, disappearing downward.
text: Sarah watches them go.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Mom -- were those guys the police?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, honey. They're not the police.
text: Her mind ticking, Sarah hovers her thumb over Will's number
text: about to call him back. Then she thinks better of it and
text: pockets her phone, opening the door and ushering her kids
text: inside. A beat later and we hear her throw the deadbolt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: WHITE SAND
dialog: being poured onto the ground. We're...
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - 96TH FLOOR LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The six guards, now sporting serious CHEMICAL MASKS pour out
text: streams of GRANULATED WHITE POWDER over every surface as
text: though they were salting a road -- a winter wonderland.
text: The Lead Guard holds the exit door open as his team moves
text: past him, pulling off their masks and heading up the stairs.
text: The last man standing, The Lead Security Guard, his hand
text: poised above a RED FIRE ALARM HANDLE, takes in the powdered
text: landscape in front of him: a entirely frosted floor.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He yanks down the alarm handle and exits through the door.
text: We wait in the 96th floor lobby as the alarm blares.
text: Emergency lights flash. Then the SPRINKLER SYSTEM engages,
text: dousing the entire floor with a wet down from on high.
text: BUT THE MOMENT THE WATER HITS THE POWDER, IT IGNITES.
scene_heading: INT. HORACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Will hangs up. In the bathroom, Horace looks concerned. He
text: calls out to Will...
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: They went back to The Pearl?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Henry wasn't feeling well.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yup -- no pandas.
text: But something else is bugging Will...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Hey -- did you notice the ink on that
dialog: guy's forearm?
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: Who the little guy?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: Didn't notice.
text: Horace grabs his med kit and exits into
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
dialog: where Will continues...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Looked like an affiliation -- maybe
dialog: gang ink. I'11l sketch it out for the
dialog: cops.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: We're not gonna call the cops.
text: Horace's voice has changed, it's colder now, darker...
speaker_heading: HORACE (cont'd)
dialog: You couldn't just let him take the
dialog: bag, could you? Had to be a hero.
dialog: Always gotta be the hero.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What are you talking about--
text: Horace pulls out a .45 AUTOMATIC from the med bag and points
text: it squarely at his friend. Will stands, wary...
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: I tried to do this clean -- but now
dialog: you're gonna have to take the fall
dialog: for all of it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Whoa -- H -- what's going on? Talk
dialog: to me. Put the gun down and let's
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: I don't have a choice -- I don't have
dialog: a fucking choice now. It's too late.
dialog: You messed it up. Why'd you have to
dialog: mess it up?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Slow down--
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: -- BANG! Horace fires just as Will dives out of the way,
text: taking cover behind the kitchen counter divide.
text: Horace rounds that corner and pulls the trigger but Will has
text: already closed the gap, knocking the muzzle aside causing
text: the shot to go wide, disarming Horace.
text: The pair find themselves in close quarters hand-to-hand
text: melee; each man expertly trained. A brutal affair unfolds
text: as Will and Horace fight to the death.
text: The confines of the apartment take the brunt as books fall
text: from bookshelves, lamps are sent crashing, pictures shatter.
dialog: Only one man will make it out alive.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Horace catches Will with an elbow stunning him; he KICKS OUT
text: WILL'S PROSTHETIC LEG -- a dirty move -- then sweeps the
text: other, dropping Will to the floor -- THUD.
text: Horace spots the wayward .45 and snatches it up, turning to
text: fire only to have Will use his good leg to kick out
text: Horace's, dropping him to the floor as well.
text: Will pounces on top of Horace as the two former teammates
text: struggle mightily against each other for control of the .45
text: when suddenly -- BANG.
text: The gun goes off. A moment as we don't know who got the
text: worst of it. Then Horace coughs up blood, his eyes rolling
text: back in his head.
text: A look of dismay washes over Will's face. He releases his
text: death grip on his longtime friend.
text: Without missing a beat, Will checks Horace's injury: a
text: gunshot wound just below the breast bone. Blood pumps out
text: rhythmically, air sucks in -- a mortal blow.
text: Will applies direct pressure with his hand as best he can
dialog: but he knows he's gonna need something to stop the bleeding.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're gonna be alright -- sit up --
dialog: lean forward.
text: Will maneuvers Horace's body as he starts to wheeze from a
text: collapsed lung. Horace apologizes, rapidly turning pale.
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: I'm sorry -- I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey -- just stay with me -- Look at
dialog: me -- fight it now. You gotta fight it.
dialog: Will moves into
scene_heading: THE ADJACENT BATHROOM
text: and grabs a HAND-TOWEL to help staunch the bleeding. That's
text: when Will stops short at the sight of:
text: A_HAND PROTRUDING OUT FROM BEHIND THE SHOWER CURTAIN.
dialog: 
text: Will yanks the curtain back, revealing the BODY OF A DEAD
text: MAN IN A SUIT, crumpled lifelessly in the tub.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Will nearly stumbles at the shocking sight. He rushes out
dialog: of the bathroom and back to
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: Where Horace is paper white and not long for this world.
text: Will kneels down next to him.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Tell me what's going on -- if you
dialog: tell me, I can help you. Horace?
dialog: Horace?
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: ...They weren't supposed to go
dialog: back...they weren't supposed to be
dialog: there...
text: Will's blood goes cold.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who wasn't supposed to be there?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What did you do?
text: Horace chokes out a ragged...
speaker_heading: HORACE
dialog: I -- I'm sorry.
text: And then he's gone. Will lets go of his friend. And that's
text: when he hears it: SIRENS. In the distance -- a lot of them.
text: Will moves to Horace's window, yanking open the blinds to
dialog: see a horror unimaginable:
text: THE PEARL IS ON FIRE.
text: An entire floor, maybe two, are ablaze halfway up the
text: building. Based on the silhouette of the structure, Will
text: knows Sarah and his kids are above the fire line.
text: His heart sinks.
text: Then more SIRENS. But these are much closer. Will glances
dialog: down to:
scene_heading: THE STREET BELOW
text: where a swarm of HONG KONG POLICE (HKP) and SWAT VANS
text: screech to a stop out in front.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: The van doors open and out pours an ASSAULT TEAM. They
text: hustle into the apartment building.
text: His mind racing, Will only has moments to form a plan.
text: Quickly he snags his prosthesis, securing it to his leg.
text: He slings his laptop bag and grabs the .45, tucking it away.
text: He hears HEAVY FOOTFALLS as the assault team ascends the
text: stairs. Will moves to the door, snugging up against it.
text: He glances down at his feet -- at first we're not sure why.
text: Then a little BLACK SNAKE slithers under the door. A FIBER
speaker_heading: OPTIC CAMERA.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
text: the ASSAULT TEAM stacks up. The OPTICS MAN crouches at the
text: the door working the snake-cam -- its MONITOR showing the
text: battered apartment and a portion of Horace's slack body.
text: WILL watches the snake-cam's head twist around and just as
text: it bends toward him he snatches it up and yanks it hard...
speaker_heading: THE OPTICS MAN,
text: holding the other end of it, is yanked head-first into the
dialog: door -- WHAM!
text: Will opens the door and grabs the dazed Optics Man --
text: snapping him back into the apartment and shutting the door.
text: The Assault Team on the other side of the door unloads on
text: it -- shredding the wood to pieces.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE APARTMENT
text: Will headbutts the Optics Man out cold, then he snatches a
text: FLASHBANG GRENADE off of his webbing, pulling the pin.
text: The limp Optics Man in one hand, Will tosses the flashbang
text: through one of the GUNSHOT HOLES in the Swiss Cheese door.
text: Shouts of alarm followed by a THUNDEROUS BANG.
text: Will opens the door just wide enough to kick the Optics Man
text: through the opening onto his stunned comrades, knocking a
text: few of them over like bowling pins.
text: Will slams the door shut and moves to a STANDING CABINET,
text: shouldering it, tipping it over to block the front door.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: The assault team on the other side begins battering the door

text: He races to the window, tearing off the blinds and throwing
text: open the pane.
text: CRACK -- the door breaks open and the Assault Team rushes in
text: just as Will disappears out the window, dropping from sight.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: Will hits the ground hard -- his leg goes out from under him
text: as he cries out in pain.
text: He gathers himself quickly, getting to his feet to find
dialog: himself
scene_heading: SURROUNDED.
text: The HKP have both ends of the alley blocked off. They inch
text: toward Will from either end, closing in on him like a vice.
text: Will glances up to see the ASSAULT TEAM in the apartment
text: aiming down on him from the window above.
text: He's trapped. It's over. Will puts his hands up, pointing
text: desperately at The Pearl, ablaze in the skyline...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My family! My family is trapped in
dialog: that building!
text: But they don't speak English and he doesn't speak Chinese.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Please! Listen to me! You have to
dialog: listen! My family--
dialog: BANG!
text: A shotgun blast strikes Will in the chest -- a non-lethal
text: BEANBAG round knocking the wind out of him. Then another,
text: then a third. The big man drops to a knee, weakened, unable
text: to catch his breath. The HKP close in, subsuming him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: WILL'S BIG WRISTS

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THE PEARL

text: high rise in their blacked-out windows.
text: The doors recede from us -- moving away from The Pearl, away
dialog: from the very place Will wants to be most.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
text: Distraught, Sarah finishes leaving a voicemail for Will.
text: The fire alarm blares. EMERGENCY LIGHTS flash brightly. An
text: ALARM VOICE repeats itself in CHINESE. Henry and Georgia
text: look scared. Sarah hangs up and ushers them to the couch.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Get on the couch.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Mom -- what's going on? Are we gonna
dialog: be okay?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We're going to be fine. There's a

dialog: here -- everything's going to be
dialog: okay. I'm going to go talk to the
dialog: firemen.
text: Sarah moves into the bathroom and turns on the cold water in

text: Exiting the bathroom, she kneels down in front of her kids.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Look at me: stay on this couch and do
dialog: not move until I comeback.
dialog: Understand?

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - FIRE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

text: and nearly to the next landing when -- KA-BOOM!
text: The door to the 96th floor ROCKETS OFF ITS HINGES, slamming
text: into the wall opposite, crumpling like tinfoil. Hungry for
text: fresh oxygen, the flames from the raging fire snake through
text: the new opening into the stairwell.
text: Sarah scrambles backward -- turning to run back up the way
dialog: she came. There's no way down.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN

speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF

dialog: And the fire will never get there.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF
text: The automatic fire doors and
dialog: dampening measures have engaged,

dialog: it'll burn itself out in under two
dialog: hours, even if we don't do
dialog: anything -- no fuel, no fire.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: You're telling me the building is

speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF
dialog: That's an oversimplification, Captain.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: Really? Cuz it sounds to me like

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Answer it!

speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)

text: Will's eyes narrow, he's gonna--
speaker_heading: WHAMMMMM!
text: OUR WORLD GOES UPSIDE DOWN. We're trapped in a violent

scene_heading: EXT. HONG KONG STREET - SAME

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

text: the ROARING WHINE of a gas-powered blade saw.
text: Suddenly a showering of hot sparks rain down inside the
text: van -- the doors are being cut open from the outside.
text: Then a CROWBAR is wedged in prying this prize box open --
text: one thrust, then two. The doors crack free revealing:
scene_heading: THREE DRAGON-MASKED GANGSTERS,
text: smoke roiling past their horns in wicked slow motion.
text: The Smirking Guard goes for his gun but takes two rounds in
text: the chest from the LEAD GANGSTER. The Lead Gangster swings
text: the barrel of his carbine to Will.
text: A moment as it looks like this might be the most expensive
dialog: short film in the history of cinema.
text: But then the Lead Gangster drops his weapon and reaches past
text: Will, snagging the thing he came for -- the LAPTOP BAG.
text: The Lead Gangster makes sure the laptop is inside, then he

text: Fast approaching sirens. No time, the masked Gangsters back

speaker_heading: IN THE VAN
text: Will hears sirens and weighs his options: stay here and stay

dialog: For a guy like Will, there's only one answer.

speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE VAN
text: the SIRENS have grown louder, he's got only seconds to make

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE PEARL

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Pierce, our bodies are the result

dialog: When faced with heat, we sweat. When
dialog: faced with danger, our blood courses
dialog: with Adrenaline and Cortisol. When
text: faced with extreme cold, hypothermia,
dialog: our bodies act to conserve heat,
text: cutting off blood to the extremities
dialog: -- any sacrifice to keep the core

speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: The ninety-sixth floor will burn to

scene_heading: EXT. HONG KONG STREETS - NIGHT
text: The broadcast plays inside a bar, patrons are rapt by it.
text: We find Will watching too from an ALLEYWAY. He scans the
text: area, every TV screen he sees is playing the same thing: his
text: face right next to the burning Pearl. He's a wanted man.
text: Will's mind churns: his image is everywhere and he's a foot
dialog: taller than everyone in this city -- he'll stick out like a
dialog: sore thumb on the street. Unless...
text: Catercorner, Will spots a BEGGAR in a WHEELCHAIR panhandling.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE BEGGAR

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: (to Georgia)
dialog: Dunk them all the way, make sure the

text: Georgia does as she's told. Sarah looks back to her son...
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: HENRY

scene_heading: EXT. OFF-SITE CONTROL FACILITY - NIGHT

text: Clutching Will's laptop bag, the Biker roars through.
scene_heading: INT. OFF-SITE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Biker rushes into the room and hands the laptop to Xia.
text: She tosses it to the Techie who snags it out of the air and
text: quickly boots it up, gaining access the precious control
dialog: protocols he needs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: XIA
dialog: Do it.
text: ON SCREEN we see full access granted. The Techie expertly
text: engages all of the anti-fire measures from the 95th down, a
text: cascade of GREEN COLORED FLOORS all the way to the bottom.
text: Then he deactivates all of the anti-fire measures from the
text: 96th to the top -- all of those floors BLINK RED.
text: With a swipe on the touchscreen, the FIRE DOORS from the
text: 97th on up slide open, feeding the fire with fresh air.
scene_heading: ON THE 96TH FLOOR
text: we see the flames ROAR UPWARD, like a living creature -- a
text: twisting tornado of fire thirsty for fuel and hungry for
text: oxygen. The blaze climbs higher -- a kiln burning white-hot.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: TECHIE
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you a
dialog: 6.5 billion dollar chimney.
speaker_heading: XIA
dialog: Lock it in.
text: Some fancy keystrokes add an encryption code to the changes

speaker_heading: TECHIE
text: Encrypted.
text: He pops up and hands Will's laptop to Xia.
speaker_heading: TECHIE (cont'd)
dialog: You've got full systems control from
dialog: that laptop and that laptop only. No
dialog: pass code needed. Plug and play.
text: Everyone else is locked out.
speaker_heading: XIA
dialog: How long will it take them to crack

speaker_heading: TECHIE
dialog: I don't know -- seven hundred years?

speaker_heading: XIA

text: into her messenger bag for safe keeping, pulling out a
text: GLOSSY BLACK BRICK with a BLINKING RED LIGHT in exchange.
text: The phone in the control room starts RINGING madly. She

scene_heading: EXT. OFF-SITE CONTROL FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: TOUGH GUY

speaker_heading: XIA

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - 98TH FLOOR HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Choked with smoke. Licks of flame are visible through the

dialog: matter of time before the fire claims this floor as well.
text: The door to the apartment opens, revealing Sarah sporting a
text: wet hand towel tied around her nose and mouth like a cowboy.
text: She's cut a hole through the sopping bath towel for her
text: head, wearing it like a poncho.
text: She steps into the hallway, holding hands with Henry and

speaker_heading: GEORGIA

speaker_heading: SARAH

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - NIGHT
text: Zhao stares at his giant WALL MONITOR: every floor above the
text: 95th is BLINKING RED, the anti-fire measures all read as
text: OFF-LINE. Clearly, something is rotten in Denmark.
text: The suits are agitated. One sips a bottle of water, his
text: hand shaking as he does. Mr. Pierce paces, nervous.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: I thought you said the fire wouldn't
dialog: spread. You said it would be
dialog: contained. What's wrong with your
dialog: building? Don't you have sprinkler
dialog: systems?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Yes and the sprinkler systems on the
text: 96th floor engaged as designed.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Really? Then why didn't the fire go
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Because the water caused the fire.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: It's the only conclusion. And
dialog: there's only one way water itself can
dialog: cause a fire: through an exothermic
dialog: chemical reaction. Which means this
dialog: wasn't an accident -- it was arson.
text: Dov, Zhao's body man, returns...
speaker_heading: DOV
dialog: Local control is completely locked
text: out and off-site's not answering.
dialog: The entire system's been
dialog: compromised -- our techs are trying
dialog: to crack it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And there's something else.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DOV
dialog: Our log codes show Will Ford's family
dialog: swiped into their residence two hours
dialog: ago, before the fire.
dialog: That news puzzles Zhao, but he's got bigger fish to fry...
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: How long to get control of the
dialog: building back?
speaker_heading: DOV
dialog: I don't think they really know, sir.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: What was their estimate?
speaker_heading: DOV
text: Eighteen hours.
text: The suit drinking the bottle water nearly chokes on it.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Eighteen hours?! We don't have
dialog: eighteen minutes! This thing's
dialog: burning like a match!
speaker_heading: ZHAO
text: Matches burn from the top down.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Oh fuck you, Buddha! We need to leave!
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: You're missing my point. With the
text: fire doors open above the fire and
dialog: closed below them, this building
dialog: isn't burning like a match -- it's
dialog: burning like a kiln. It's super-
dialog: heating.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Are you saying it'll collapse?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: No -- The Pearl could burn to cinders
dialog: and never collapse. Collapse isn't
dialog: the issue.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Then what is?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: The real issue is that the building
dialog: doesn't know it's on fire. And if it
dialog: doesn't know it's on fire, it can't
dialog: act to preserve itself. Which means
dialog: the fire will grow hotter and hotter
dialog: and spread faster and faster until it
dialog: has nothing left to feed on. Until
text: it eats itself to death. Until it
dialog: consumes us whole.
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Fantastic. Wonderful. I think we've
dialog: all learned something really valuable
dialog: here today. I know I have. Now can we
dialog: please get on the fucking helicopter?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: You know what's interesting about
dialog: you, Mr. Pierce?
speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Nothing.
text: Dov chimes in, speaking softly...
speaker_heading: DOV
dialog: Sir, you know as well as I do that if
text: the fire gets within twenty floors of
dialog: us it will over-heat the air around
text: the helipad making liftoff
dialog: impossible. If we're going to
dialog: evacuate, we need to do it now.
text: Zhao weighs the situation. Then he makes his decision.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Alert the authorities that we'll be
dialog: departing.
text: With that, Zhao exits.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Zhao moves through his lavish bedroom and into his WALK-IN
text: CLOSET. Passing racks of $5,000 suits, he stops at the back

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Zhao places his hand on the glass causing hidden scanners to
text: read his palm print. GREEN BEAMS shoot out from a secret
text: source behind the glass and scan his retinas.
text: Suddenly, the pane of glass reveals itself to be a cleverly
text: constructed false wall -- it's a 6K LED SCREEN playing a
text: VIDEO IMAGE of the skyline below. A perfect forgery.
text: The LED PANEL opens inward. Zhao steps through it into...
speaker_heading: A VAULT
text: about the size of a small bathroom. Zhao moves to an old
text: school 1820's FLOOR SAFE and dials in a combination.
text: He cracks it open, pulling the heavy door back to reveal a
text: single object inside: A TINY RED MEMORY CARD, the size of a
text: thumbnail. Zhao reaches for it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT
text: Tumult as EVACUEES from The Pearl are directed this way and
text: that way by EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. Meanwhile, hundreds of ON-
text: LOOKERS, cellphones blazing, stare up at The burning Pearl:
text: an awesome sight, nothing short of a Towering Inferno™.
text: Amidst the chaos we find a ONE-LEGGED HOMELESS MAN, dressed
text: in rags and a tattered ball cap, pushing his way through the
text: throng in a wheelchair. No one pays him any mind, which is
dialog: just how Will Ford likes it.
text: Will pauses and looks up at the burning skyscraper above
text: him, the mountain he must climb to rescue his family. The
text: sheer size of it takes his breath away.
text: The task seems impossible. Will's mind races -- there has
text: to be a way. Suddenly he spots the answer. He wheels
text: toward us as we pivot around him to reveal a:
scene_heading: 65-TON SUPER CRANE
text: perched at the very top of an ADJACENT 90-STORY BUILDING
text: still under construction.
text: We hold a beat longer than we might as suddenly XIA STEPS
text: INTO FRAME. She must've spotted Will. She moves after him.
scene_heading: EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER
text: In the ALCOVE ENTRANCE, a POLICE OFFICER waves the crowd
dialog: along: keep it movin' people. Nothing to see here.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Will rolls into the alcove in his wheelchair, holding out a

text: The Police Officer scowls, then barks at Will in Chinese.
text: But Will keeps at it shaking the cup.
text: Finally, the asshole cop slaps the cup out of Will's hand
text: and in a blink, Will grabs the man's wrist yanking him down
text: into a vicious head-butt -- CRACK. The cop goes slack.
text: Will catches him before he falls.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sorry, pal. Next time maybe give a
dialog: little.
text: Quickly, Will hops up on one leg and swaps places with the
text: police officer, dropping him down into the wheelchair and
text: covering him up with his ball cap and tattered coat.
text: Will places the cup in the cop's lap and pushes him forward
text: just as a PASSERBY tosses some change into the his cup.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Thanks.
text: The English startles the Passerby but he keeps moving. Will
text: locks the wheelchair in place and pulls out his prosthetic
text: leg from the satchel on the chair-back, attaching it.
text: Will pats the cop on the shoulder and moves off inside the
text: building. A beat later, Xia appears in the alcove.
text: She moves to the officer, digging under his hobo jacket and
text: unhooks the RADIO MIC from his shoulder...
speaker_heading: XIA
text: Shots fired. Shots fired. Officer
dialog: down. Request immediate back-up.
dialog: Suspect Will Ford has entered the
dialog: Scion Capitol building. Armed &
dialog: dangerous.
text: She presses the barrel of her SILENCED 9MM against the

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't look down...don't look down...

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: THE STRIKE TEAM

scene_heading: ON THE CRANE SPIRE
text: Two-thirds of the way to the top, Will watches as the CRANE
text: CAR descends past him. Will can't believe it...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Shit. There was an elevator?
text: It's only a matter of moments before the elevator reaches
dialog: the Strike Team on the roof. No (more) time for jokes, Will

text: Just then, a JET BLACK POLICE HELICOPTER swoops down from
text: the night sky like a bird of prey on the hunt.
scene_heading: ABOARD THE POLICE HELICOPTER
text: we see a SNIPER, sporting serious-looking night vision
text: goggles, readying his JS 7.62mm bolt-action long gun.
scene_heading: EXT. CRANE CONTROL PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: At last, Will pulls himself up and onto the CONTROL PLATFORM.
text: Exhausted by the effort, Will collapses flat on his back for
text: a second, breathing hard. It's eerily quiet up here.
text: Will gets to his feet and looks at The Pearl. He's roughly
text: 110 stories up -- above the fire line, above the park even.
text: Will looks down to the rooftop and sees the STRIKE TEAM
text: boarding the crane car. Will chides himself...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Great plan, Will. Way to really
dialog: think this through. Now what, genius?
text: He's got only seconds to do whatever it is he's planning to
text: do. Will spots the GLASS-ENCASED CONTROL CAR -- inside it a

text: He moves to it, scanning the area looking for anything to
text: help him break the door handle and gain access.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He spots a nearby TOOL CABINET. He rushes to it, yanking it
text: open to reveal a set of tools -- among them a SLEDGEHAMMER.
text: Will grabs it and rushes back to the Control Car. He's just
text: about to bludgeon his way in when he thinks better of it
text: and -- what the hell -- tries the door handle.
dialog: Click.
text: It opens. Will almost laughs. But the sound of the
text: approaching elevator snaps him back into the moment. He
text: rushes over to the platform's ELEVATOR CAGE, grabbing hold
text: of a LENGTH OF CHAIN and a SCREWDRIVER along the way.
text: Will slips the thick chain through a STEEL LOOP on the
text: ELEVATOR CAGE DOOR, securing it with screwdriver. It'll slow
text: "em down, but only for so long. Will hurries into the
speaker_heading: CONTROL CAR
text: where he turns the crane on. After some quick and comedic
dialog: trial & error and he's got the hang of it.
text: Will rotates the BOOM ARM, swinging it toward The Pearl.
text: Then he EXTENDS toward the face of the building. The crane
text: BEEPS an alert -- it can't extend any further. A THIRTY
text: FOOT GAP remains between the end of the crane and The Pearl.
text: Will exits the Control Car just as the Strike Team arrives
text: to find themselves locked in. Immediately, they go to work
text: on the door, trying to break the makeshift chain lock.
text: Time running out, Will grabs the sledgehammer and hustles to
text: THE FAR END OF THE CRANE.
text: He stares off the end of the diving board, looking at the
text: building in front of him, calculating something in his mind.
text: Will moves back a few paces then charges at us, holding the
text: sledgehammer high and screaming like a medieval warrior...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Ahhh!!!
text: Will HURLS the sledgehammer with all his might -- whoosh!
text: The sledgehammer hurtles through the air, descending
text: gracefully until it strikes the GLASS EXTERIOR of The Pearl
text: --CRASH!-- punching through the glass but not shattering it,
text: sticking there. Will throws up his hands.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: EXT. CRANE CONTROL PLATFORM - NIGHT

text: CAR, when he's hit with a WASH OF BLINDING LIGHT.
text: The Police Helicopter drops down, calling out a DISTORTED
text: WARNING IN CHINESE over its loudspeaker as it swings its
text: body broadside. The light peels away from Will revealing
text: the SNIPER hanging out of the bay door.
text: Will's eyes go wide -- BANG! -- a high velocity round cracks
text: an inch from his head. Will breaks for it, bolting down the
text: boom arm -- running with everything he's got.
text: The sniper fires again and again but Will's inside the

scene_heading: WE'RE WITH WILL

text: above the fire in the pitch black of night
scene_heading: THE POLICE HELICOPTER

text: Aiming nearly straight down, the Sniper pulls the trigger.
speaker_heading: CRACK!
text: The bullet races at Will who's falling toward the window pane
text: -- the HIGH VELOCITY ROUND RIPS INTO WILL'S LEFT SHOULDER.
dialog: 
text: Will cries out as the 7.62mm brass tears through flesh and
text: continues onward, piercing the EXTERIOR WINDOW -- shattering
text: it completely -- a split second before Will hits that very
dialog: same opening -- THUD!
text: Speed returns as Will slams into the newly-formed window

text: choice but to use his other hand -- his injured arm.
text: He throws it up there, grabbing hold of the window's ledge
text: just as the sledgehammer dislodges, falling away.
text: Will hangs by his damaged arm. Enduring ungodly pain, he
text: manages to get his good arm on the ledge. Using both arms
text: now, Will pulls himself inside the building. He made it.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: the crowd goes WILD -- a folk hero is born.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE PEARL

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Excellent.

speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: DOV

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: What's on your mind, Dov?
speaker_heading: DOV
dialog: Sir -- I can't protect you if you
dialog: don't tell me what's going on. This

dialog: need some answers.
dialog: Zhao knows his body man is right.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I can't say for sure.
speaker_heading: DOV

speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE (0.S.)
dialog: Can we go?

speaker_heading: MR. PIERCE
dialog: Is there something I should know?
speaker_heading: DOV
dialog: Yes -- the helicopter's ready.

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Flanked by Dov and his security detail, Zhao, Mr. Pierce,

text: Zhao places a palm on a wall-mounted HAND-SCANNER.
text: The titanium double doors swing open. They exit.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE PRIVATE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - 110TH FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Bizarrely, Will finds himself on a floor filled with LUXURY
text: STORES -- a high-end shopping mall in the sky.
text: Bleeding on the imported Emperador marble floor, Will
text: staggers past CARTIER, GUCCI and TOM FORD -- all closed. He
text: spots an abandoned JANITOR'S CART up ahead. He rushes to it.
text: Will digs through the cart, looking for anything that might
text: help him. Quickly, he finds a roll of DUCT TAPE and a
text: bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL.
text: Will inspects his gunshot wound: a grisly quarter-sized hole
text: in the meat of his shoulder. Not good. He rips his shirt
text: sleeve off and rolls the fabric into a short tube.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Will unscrews the rubbing alcohol and dumps it onto his
text: wound -- the sudden pain hits him like a wave. Will braces
text: himself against the wall to keep from doubling over.
text: A breath, then Will thumbs the rolled fabric into his wound,
text: end-first. The pain is enormous, but the deed is done. The
text: wound has been packed. Will grabs the duct tape.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If you can't fix it with duct tape...
text: He winds it twice around the meat of his shoulder, tearing
text: the tape with his teeth, securing the ad hoc bandage snugly.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: ...then you aren't using enough duct
dialog: tape.
text: Will tests his arm. He can move it, but it hurts like a
dialog: bitch when he does. It'll have to do.
text: Will loops the duct tape to his belt and moves to the INNER
text: ATRIUM to get his bearings. All of the elevators are off-
text: line due to the fire. NEWS COVERAGE plays on an in-wall TV
text: SCREEN -- from the looks of it, the fire is about to reach
text: the park. Will talks to himself...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: I'll find you. Just hang on.
text: Will moves to the STAIRWELL DOOR, throwing it open only to
text: stagger back as he's struck with a blast of heat and smoke.
text: Will tears his other sleeve off, tying the fabric around his
text: face. He gathers himself and enters the
speaker_heading: STAIRWELL
text: which is choked black by smoke. Will spots a RED EMERGENCY
text: BOX with a WOODEN PICK-HEAD AX inside. A sharp elbow is all

text: KA-BOOM. A bone-rattling explosion.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT

text: Samurai topknot, now called FENG.
text: Instantly, it's a fire-fight. Pierce and his five men with
text: sub-machine guns versus Dov and his three men with handguns.
text: Caught in the crossfire, the suits are quickly dropped by
text: the assailants as Dov and his squad take cover.
text: Hunkered down with Zhao behind a METAL TOOL CHEST, Dov pops
text: up and clips a bad guy, causing him to fall off of the

text: Dov drops down, slapping in a fresh magazine.
speaker_heading: DOV (cont'd)
dialog: When I tell you, run for the elevator.

speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
text: where he unloads eight shots through the windshield,
text: stitching the pilot in the chest. The pilot slumps forward
text: onto the controls CAUSING THE HELICOPTER TO LIFT AND TILT

speaker_heading: XIA (cont'd)
dialog: The penthouse isn't linked to the

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's okay, baby. Just slow down.
dialog: Slow down and breathe. In for three,

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Run!
text: Sarah hustles her kids through the park as from all angles
text: the fire begins to claw its way into the floor.
text: Fire breaks through the seams in the sod -- ZIG-ZAGGING
text: through the grass like snakes, chasing Sarah and the kids.
text: They rush for a STAIRWELL DOOR just as it EXPLODES LIKE A
text: PIPE BOMB. They duck as the door WHIZZES overhead shearing
text: through a METAL LAMPPOST behind them.
text: Sarah grabs her kids and yanks them in the other direction,
text: pushing them toward their only escape: THE INNER ATRIUM.
text: Henry struggles. Sarah picks him up, carrying her son, as
text: the trio rush across
text: THE SKY BRIDGE,
text: a narrow footbridge with a glass canopy that spans the
text: diameter of the INNER ATRIUM.
text: From above, we watch as Sarah and the kids race across the

text: ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
dialog: they find respite -- this part of the park hasn't been

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Run!
text: Henry and Georgia take off running back across the sky
text: bridge, as Sarah dives for Feng's H&K, snatching it up and
text: turning back just in time to take a boot to the mouth.
text: Sarah goes sprawling as Feng rises, yanking the scissors
text: from his leg and tossing them aside. He picks up his pistol
text: but tucks it away and pulls out a TACTICAL KNIFE, spinning
dialog: it menacingly -- he's gonna do this old school.
text: Sarah gets to her feet, unarmed and out-muscled.
text: Easy prey in front of him, Feng attacks. But Sarah is more
text: than he bargained for as she side-steps his swing, blocking
text: his knife arm expertly before kicking his knee out.
text: Feng goes down hard, howling. Sarah turns and takes off
text: running back across the sky bridge.
speaker_heading: IN THE PARK
text: Holding hands, Henry and Georgia find themselves in the

text: madness, they get turned around quickly -- burning trees

text: hand. And that's when a MASSIVE PIECE OF CEILING COLLAPSES.
text: Henry and Georgia dive out of the way just as the section
text: smashes between them through up smoke and fire.
text: Like a pilot in the fog, Henry gets turned around -- he

text: A HAIL OF HOT EMBERS explodes as the END OF THE BRIDGE drops
text: at a sharp angle, nearly taking Sarah with it.
text: She turns back to see Feng hobbling toward her. He tucks

speaker_heading: FENG
dialog: I wasn't supposed to kill you -- but

text: The CARRIAGE SHAKES AND SHUDDERS as a staccato of light
text: strobes the glass car -- fire then smoke, then fire again.
text: A descent into Hell itself. Seven...six...five...
text: The elevator glass SHATTERS from the unbridled G-Force.

text: The centripetal force pinning her, Sarah reaches for the RED

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She yanks the handle. Nothing happens. They keep falling.
text: Sarah yanks the handle again -- then a loud CHUNKING noise

text: Sarah looks at Henry -- the boy smiles. They made it.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - 360 RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: With its kitchen a concentric circle around the inner
text: atrium, this fancy-ass restaurant offers up stunning 360°
text: views of the Hong Kong skyline. The priciest meal in town.
text: What's more, the floor itself is comprised of GLASS PANELS,
text: offering up views of the park below. With the fire raging
text: unchecked, the setting is lit with an unearthly orange glow.
text: We find Georgia standing in the middle of the space,
text: breathing hard. Panic setting in. She hears a noise and
text: spins to see the two GUNMEN rushing up from the stairs.
text: Instinctively, Georgia ducks -- hiding a split second before
text: the men arrive on the scene.
text: The Gunmen scan the restaurant. They know she's here.
text: Gunman #1 motions to his partner, they split apart, stalking
text: through the Michelin-rated finery.
speaker_heading: GUNMAN #1
dialog: It's okay -- we're the good guys.
dialog: You can come out now, you're safe.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA,
text: hiding under a table, is anything but convinced. She spots
text: a STEAK KNIFE on the setting above her.
text: She sneaks her fingers up to snag it -- her hand
text: disappearing just as Gunman #2's eyes sweep that exact spot.
text: The Gunmen close in on her location, tossing over tables as
text: they go. Closer and closer to her hiding spot. Tension
text: squeezes us like a vice as Gunman #2 stops in front of
dialog: Georgia's table.
scene_heading: UNDER THE TABLE
text: Georgia dare not breathe. She clutches her steak knife and
text: spies Gunman #2's foot right in front of her. The young
text: girl screws up her courage and drives the knife home.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Gunman #2 ROARS. Georgia bolts from cover. Gunman #2
text: FIRES -- but his pained shots are wild, lighting up
text: glassware and cutlery all around Georgia as she dives behind
text: the CIRCULAR KITCHEN WALL against the inner atrium.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PANGU PARK - SAME
text: Will, searching feverishly in the fire, hears the gun shots
text: from above. He spots the glass staircase and breaks for it.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - 360 RESTAURANT - SAME
text: Gunman #1 grabs Gunman #2's carbine, jerking it aside.
speaker_heading: GUNMAN #1
dialog: We need her alive! She's the bait.
speaker_heading: GUNMAN #2
dialog: She fuckin' stabbed me!
speaker_heading: GUNMAN #1
dialog: Get over it.
text: He motions and the pair split up again -- each taking
dialog: opposite entry points into
scene_heading: THE CIRCULAR KITCHEN AREA
text: where Georgia crawls on all fours, staying low. She opens a
text: low STAINLESS STEEL CABINET and crawls inside, shutting it.
text: The hunters stalk their prey slowly, opening each cabinet as
dialog: they go -- it's only a matter of time.
text: In the small darkness, Georgia begins to cry, terrified.
text: Gunman #2 throws open Georgia's cabinet, revealing her.
speaker_heading: GUNMAN #2
dialog: Found you, you little shit. You're
dialog: gonna pay for what you--
text: WHAM! Out of nowhere, Will freight trains him, sending
text: Gunman #2 smashing him against the inner atrium glass.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to Georgia)
dialog: Go!
text: She does as Will turns his focus to Gunman #2 who fires at
dialog: point blank range.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: But Will side-steps the shots, grabbing the muzzle and
text: stitching the atrium glass panel with them before kicking
text: Gunman #2 in the back, sending him through the panel and
text: down to the first floor the hard way.
text: Will pivots just as Gunman #1 opens fire on him. Will ducks
text: as pots and pans dance and pinwheel overhead.
text: Gunman #1 goes dry and reloads allowing Will to grab a CAST
text: IRON SKILLET and, using it like a medieval shield, charge.
text: Caught between reloads, Gunman #1 jerks his sidearm and
text: unloads into the iron plate, but Will is already on top of
text: him -- the beat down is merciless.
text: Will's about to end it when he hears...
speaker_heading: PIERCE (0.S.)
dialog: Enough!
text: Will turns to see Pierce standing there, holding Georgia, a
text: pistol to her head. All the fight goes out of him.
text: For a moment, Will's confused -- the last time he saw Pierce
text: was in Zhao's penthouse boardroom. Quickly though, Will
text: puts together the double-cross. His eyes narrow. Then he
text: looks to his frightened daughter and reassures her...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's gonna be okay, honey.
text: The Gangster gets to his feet and drives the stock of his
text: weapon viciously into Will's gut, dropping the big man to
text: his knees -- Will never takes his eyes off Georgia.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN

dialog: to take any chances.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN

speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: Captain...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: There's nothing I can do. We've got
dialog: thirty minutes to resolve this
dialog: scenario or it becomes a military
dialog: operation and we're on the sideline.
dialog: So unless someone can tell me
dialog: something different is going on
dialog: inside of that building, they're

dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: OFFICER (0.S.)
dialog: Sir...
text: Chan turns to see: an OFFICER standing there with SARAH AND

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Pierce holds Georgia at gunpoint. The young girl whimpers
text: and shakes, tears rolling down her face, scared for her
text: life. Flanked by Pierce's three remaining men, Will is on
text: his knees, his hands zip-tied behind him.
text: Will does his best to console his daughter...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Honey -- look at me. Look at my

speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: (shaking)
dialog: I love you too, Daddy.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: I'm afraid I'm going to have to

speaker_heading: WILL
text: The dead man in Horace's bathtub --
dialog: Singh -- that was you?
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: No -- that was your pal. That's the
dialog: nice thing about dealing with
dialog: degenerate gamblers, they'll do
dialog: anything to pay a debt. Even sell
dialog: out their dearest friend. Now -- you
dialog: still haven't answered my question.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I already told you: the only way that
text: door opens is if Zhao opens it from
dialog: his side or if this floor's fire
dialog: alarm triggers it -- but that can't
dialog: happen because you guys took the
dialog: entire system offline. You
dialog: understand? It can't be done.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Nonsense. Anything can be done with
dialog: the proper motivation. So let me
dialog: help. You're gonna get in there and
dialog: you're gonna bring Zhao, and what
dialog: he's holding, to me or I'm gonna
dialog: throw your daughter off the fucking

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: PIERCE (cont'd)
dialog: I hear it's like heaven up there.
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Daddy!
text: Will lunges to his feet, charging at Pierce. One of Pierce's
text: MEN cracks him on the skull, sending him to the floor.
text: Will coughs and writhes, his eyes watering. Pierce shoves
text: Georgia to one of his men, then he moves over to Will,
text: kneeling down to cut his zip tied hands, smirking as he does.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Tick-tock...
text: Pierce grabs Georgia by the hair and yanks her toward the
text: STAIRWELL EXIT DOOR. The girl yells for her father -- Will
text: reaches out for Georgia from the ground, a futile gesture.
text: Pierce and his men disappear through the STAIRWELL EXIT.
text: His daughter's cries cut short as the door seals shut.
text: Will gets to his feet, shaking out the cobwebs. He moves to
text: the stairwell door, trying it with no luck -- it's locked.
text: He starts pacing, muttering to himself, his mind racing...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on, Will...think...think...
text: Will moves to an exterior-facing TWENTY-FOOT WIDE PANORAMIC
text: WINDOW, its CURTAINS drawn back like an elegant movie house
text: to reveal the skyline and fire raging five floors below.
text: He spots an in-wall FIRE ALARM BOX -- its digital display
text: flashes: OFFLINE. Will pulls the handle a couple times,
dialog: nothing. He's fucked.
text: Will tries to pry the Fire Alarm box off the wall, to get at
text: its innards, but without any luck. It's on there tight.
text: It's then that Will spots something on the other side of the
text: panoramic window...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Hello, beautiful.
text: Sitting directly opposite the fire alarm, on the exterior of
text: the building, is its CONTROL BOX resting there on the
text: exposed fascia. He spots a METAL TRASH CAN and picks it up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Will slams the trash can against the panoramic window --
text: CLANG! Nothing. A chip maybe. Will tries again, no luck.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Damn it.
text: Will moves down the PANORAMIC WINDOW, away from the FIRE
text: ALARM until he comes to the window's end.
text: He stops at an ADJACENT PANEL OF GLASS, just as tall but
text: only about four-feet wide -- an easier target.
text: Will presses on it with his hand, judging its thickness.
text: Knowing now what it takes now, Will backs up and then
text: charges: using the trash can like a battering ram -- WHAM!
text: INSTANTLY THE WHOLE SECTION SHATTERS INTO A MILLION PIECES
text: and Will's momentum carries him THROUGH THE OPENING!
dialog: 
text: He lets go of the trash can, barely managing to grab hold of
text: the WINDOW TRANSOM to keep from falling through completely.
text: Will gathers himself and scans the penthouse level. His
text: eyes land on a BRONZE STATUE of a CHINESE WARRIOR resting on
text: a four-foot MARBLE PEDESTAL.
text: He shoulders the pedestal sending the statue crashing. The
text: Warrior's HAND breaks free and in it a SIX-INCH SHORT-SWORD
text: ("Dao"). Will picks up the thin blade -- it'll do.
text: He looks at the CURTAINS hanging to one side of the
text: panoramic window. He yanks them down, quickly finding the
text: BRAIDED CORD that the mechanism uses to retract them. Will
text: loops the cord around his elbow like a length of rope.
text: Finished, Will knows he's still missing one more thing. He
text: reaches for his belt and holds up the DUCT TAPE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: WILL'S HANDS
text: wrapped like a boxer's before a bout but with duct tape,
text: STICKY SIDE OUT. Will finishes the last strip and tests his
text: new hand adhesion by placing his palms together.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE MARBLE PEDESTAL
text: lying on its side at the foot of the shattered window panel.
text: One end of the curtain rope is tied around its the pedestal,
text: the other end Will lashes around his waist, knotting it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: We see that Will has also duct taped his feet. He checks
dialog: the stickiness of one, talking to himself...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Can never be too careful when you're
dialog: doing something this stupid.
text: Standing at the open window, the wind howling madly, nothing
text: but a three-thousand foot fall and certain death below him,
text: Will steadies himself...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Kids, don't try this at home...
text: ...and then he steps out, pivoting around the window
text: transom. But his first step is a poorly place one and Will
text: stumbles, nearly falling.
text: HE CLUTCHES THE TRANSOM AND PULLS HIMSELF BACK IN -- his
text: life flashing before his eyes. Will lets out a little
text: laugh -- nerves getting the better of him. Two steadying
text: breaths and Will gives it another go.
text: He pivots out stepping onto the SIX-INCH LEDGE that runs
text: along the base of the panoramic window. Will presses his
text: body as close as he can to the glass -- his duct taped hands
text: sticking nicely to the window.
text: Slide step by slide step, Will crosses the twenty-foot wide
text: section of glass, eyeing the CONTROL BOX on the far side.
text: Below him, the fire rages -- climbing ever-closer.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT
text: Being tended to by an EMT, Henry breaths through an oxygen
text: mask as nearby Sarah sketches something for Chan.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It looked like this...
text: Sarah flips around a clipboard to reveal a crude facsimile
text: of the Black Lotus Triad tattoo. Chan and Han share a

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN

dialog: saw?
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: And you claim your husband isn't

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: Lieutenant Han pulls his boss away for an aside, speaking in
dialog: Cantonese.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: Captain -- this doesn't pass the
dialog: smell test. None of it does. If the
dialog: Black Lotus are there to get
dialog: something -- to steal something --
dialog: why light the building on fire? And
dialog: if they're trying to cover their
dialog: tracks -- fine -- but why trap
dialog: yourself above the fire line and then
dialog: destroy your only means of escape?
text: It doesn't make any sense.
text: A sudden realization hits Sarah. She cuts in in Cantonese,
text: surprising the officers.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's not their only means of escape.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: Really? Then how are they planning
dialog: to get out?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They're gonna jump.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: TIAPAMOT

speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: That's the word I saw on the

speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: (to Han)
dialog: Gimme your pen.
text: The lieutenant hesitates, looking to Chan for the okay.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: Give her your pen...
text: He obliges and Sarah snags it, checking its length against
text: the map's scale legend. She marks an X on the map.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: The Pearl is here.
dialog: (beat)
text: A base jump from a thousand meters up
dialog: gives you about triple that in
dialog: lateral descent distance -- call ita
dialog: mile to be safe, two pen lengths.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: How do you know that?
text: She turns her phone's screen to them and shrugs...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I Googled it.
text: The Captain shoots his Lieutenant a look: she got you there.
text: Sarah measures out two pen lengths from the X in all four
text: directions, then connects the points with a crude circle.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: That's your search area. If they
dialog: land, they'll land within that
dialog: circle -- and if they have friends,
dialog: they'll be waiting to pick them up at

dialog: open.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: Sarah points
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: And secluded.
dialog: (scanning the map)
dialog: They won't go for Victoria Park --
dialog: too obvious and too many trees to get
dialog: hung up on. South, but you'd never
text: clear the peak. West, maybe, but
dialog: it's a longer haul to an open spot.
dialog: Risky.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: There. What's that -- on the other
dialog: side of the harbor? The Kowloon side.
text: to a BROWN RECTANGLE in the water.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: That's nothing. It's a construction
dialog: sand barge -- bay dredge.
text: Sarah gives Chan a look. He's thinking.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN (cont'd)
dialog: Captain, you can't seriously be
dialog: considering this. For all we know,
text: she's in on it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You think I'd willingly trap my own
dialog: children in a burning building?
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT HAN
dialog: I think you could be playing a role.
dialog: You could be a distraction to allow
dialog: your husband to escape. This could
dialog: all be part of his plan.
text: Sarah can't believe this guy. She turns to Chan...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Captain, I know you wanna get this
dialog: right and the last thing you want to do
dialog: is to point your gun at the wrong guy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Take me out to the sand barge. If
dialog: it's empty and I'm wrong, what have

text: door, followed by Lieutenant Han and Sarah.
scene_heading: EXT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
text: The trio come to a stop just outside the trailer. They

text: ON SCREEN, we see long-lens news footage of Will inching
text: across the PANORAMIC WINDOW, nearly a mile above them.
text: They turn from the giant video screen and look up with their
text: own eyes to see Will's ant-like form, clinging to the side of
text: the building -- an insane act. The act of a desperate man.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Captain, does that look like someone
dialog: with a plan to you?
text: Chan glances at Sarah -- his wheels turning.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEARL - PANORAMIC WINDOW - NIGHT
text: 220 stories above the earth, Will presses himself against
text: the glass, inches from his goal. One more step.
text: Will makes the step --BOOM!-- a glass panel on the floor
text: below him explodes like a car bomb.
text: Will lunges for the control box, clutching it to keep from
text: falling. Two more explosions rock the tower from below.
text: Will finds footing around the box. He reaches into his
text: waistband and pulls out the statue's sword, wedging it into
text: the seams of the box, prying at it.
text: With a crack, it pops open and Will goes to work on the
text: wiring. He finds what he's looking for -- a GOLD WIRE.
text: Using the statue sword, Will strips the wire, cuts another
text: one, and hot-wires them together. A GREEN LIGHT on the
text: conduit panel turns off and a RED LIGHT starts FLASHING.
scene_heading: THE FIRE ALARM BOX

scene_heading: FIRE-FIRE-FIRE.

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - SAME

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - SAME

dialog: exits.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zhao rounds the corner to see the front doors to his
text: penthouse wide open. He moves to the nearest control panel
text: and tries to shut the doors, but the programming won't allow
text: it -- the fire alarm overrides his controls.
text: Thinking fast, Zhao pulls his smartphone out of his pocket,
text: snags a nearby USB cable and plugs his phone directly into
text: the panel itself. He starts thumbing away like mad.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEARL - PANORAMIC WINDOW - NIGHT
text: Will lets go of the control box and begins to make his way
text: back across the panoramic window, slide step by sli -- BOOM!
text: A DEAFENING EXPLOSION rattles the world.
text: Will falls.
text: Everything goes topsy-turvy as we plummet. Suddenly, we're
text: jerked to stop as Will's securing rope snaps taught.
dialog: That's the good news.
text: The bad news is that the sudden force of the fall has caused
text: Will's securing rope to slip down his body -- coming to a
text: snug cinch point around the ankle of Will's prosthetic leg.
text: Fire raging around him, Will dangles upside down by his
text: ankle, a mile up, like a rabbit caught in a rope snare.
scene_heading: THE MARBLE PEDESTAL
text: is yanked against the window frame at a poor angle, wedging
text: itself against the transom in anything but a secure fashion.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Swinging upside down, Will gets his bearings. He tries to
text: curl his body up toward the rope -- like a hanging sit-up --
text: but the added strain of the move causes his prosthetic
text: sleeve to loosen -- WILL'S LEG IS SLIPPING OUT OF IT.
text: Will falls back, dangling by a leg that's coming loose.
text: Like a car teetering on the edge of a cliff, any movement
text: from Will might cause his leg to come undone completely.
text: The earth a postage stamp below him, Will steadies himself,
text: becoming as still as possible, barely daring to breathe.
text: Will knows he's going to have one shot at this. He gathers
text: his courage and makes one sharp move.
text: With a grunt, he breaks into action using his free leg to
text: kick off the face of the building while throwing his hands
text: toward his toes, propelling himself upward with such force
text: that his RESIDUAL LIMB POPS OUT OF THE PROSTHESIS.
dialog: 
text: For a blink, Will is in complete free fall -- no rope, no
text: leg -- but his hands snag hold of the CARBON FIBER FEMUR at
text: the last possible second.
text: A strange sight indeed: a one-legged man, clinging to a
text: metal leg, attached to a rope, 3,000 feet in the air.
text: Will starts pulling with everything he's got. A dead-hang
text: rope climb. The weight of this undulating action causes
scene_heading: THE MARBLE PEDESTAL
text: to strain against the window transom, inching closer and
text: closer to dislodging completely.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: free-climbs for all he's worth, hand-over-hand, a man of
text: undying determination: his arms burning, but his eyes
text: focused on the open window ledge ten feet above him.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT
text: At the control panel for the doors, Zhao has used his
text: smartphone to hack bypass the fire alarm function and he
text: instructs the doors to reset.
text: Zhao jabs the "SECURE DOORS" button the panel and watches as
text: the titanium Goliaths lurch toward each other.

dialog: 99.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Will's forearm slaps over the marble pedestal. He pulls
text: himself up and over the final hurdle.
text: Exhausted, Will collapses. But only for a moment as he
text: suddenly sees the penthouse doors closing -- he's only got
text: seconds before they shut again, sealing him out for good.
text: Leaping into action, Will starts pulling up the rope, his
text: prosthesis dangling on the other end like fish on a hook.
text: Just then, another explosion from below rocks the penthouse
text: floor causing the marble pedestal to break free and plummet
text: through the window like an anchor.
text: The cord rips through Will's duct-taped hands, smoking them
text: as Will's prosthesis whips back to him like a boomerang.
text: Will clutches his leg as it's being pulled from his grip by
text: the four-hundred pound pedestal on other end of the rope.
text: Will glances back at the penthouse doors -- they're almost
dialog: closed now: he's gotta make a choice his leg or the door.
text: But Will makes a third play: he pulls the statue's sword
text: from his waistband and cuts the rope with one downward hack.
text: The rope whips through the window opening as Will tumbles
text: back, his prosthetic leg in his hand.
text: Will jams his leg into the PROSTHETIC SLEEVE and spins to
text: see the penthouse doors a foot from sealing shut.
text: Will bolts for them, diving into a head-first slide on his
text: side -- like a car up on two wheels -- and narrowly SKIMS
text: THROUGH THE OPENING. He made it.
dialog: Only, he didn't.
text: Will's PROSTHETIC ANKLE is caught in the door like a bear
text: trap. Will tugs on it with both hands, it won't budge.
text: With one final pull, Will yanks his leg through the doors,
text: which quickly seal shut behind him, tumbling back into a
text: heap on the foyer. Then:
speaker_heading: ZHAO (0.S.)
dialog: Don't move.

speaker_heading: WHACK!
text: With cat-like quickness, Will slaps the Beretta out of the

speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)

dialog: We need to talk.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A SMALL MAN IN A SHARP SUIT.

speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN
dialog: I know this is difficult.
dialog: We're...
scene_heading: INT. GANGSTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Opulent, dark. The den of a powerful man. Zhao sits opposite
text: Jun. Xia sprawls on a nearby chaise as Feng looms in view.
text: Behind Jun, the most striking feature: a wall comprised of
text: GLASS TERRARIUMS, each containing a solitary SNAKE.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN
dialog: For a man like you, this must come

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)

dialog: The glory of The Middle Kingdom.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Forgive me, but I don't see how
text: extortion glorifies China.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN
dialog: This isn't extortion, Mr. Zhao, this
dialog: is business.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: And if I refuse?
text: Wu-Sai Jun smiles. This man might take more convincing. He

speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN
dialog: There are ten snakes in the world to
dialog: which there exists no known antivenom.
dialog: (re: the terrarium wall)
dialog: I've made a home here for each one.
text: Jun slides out one particular terrarium from the wall like a
text: drawer in a bureau. The BLACK & BLUE STRIPED SNAKE inside
text: it coils, ready to strike.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
dialog: The snake handlers of Burma practice
text: an ancient art called Mithridatism.
text: He opens the top of glass box. The snake hisses, a warning.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
dialog: They believed that by ingesting small
text: amounts of a snake's poison over
dialog: time, they would become one with the
text: animal, rendering its venom harmless.
text: Jun rolls up his sleeve, revealing his BLACK LOTUS TRIAD
text: TATTOO. He places his arm in the terrarium, holding it
text: there in front of the hissing reptile but never taking his
text: eyes from Zhao.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
dialog: The Blue Krait's venom has been used
dialog: for centuries by indigenous Malaysian

text: sharp motion that causes the snake to strike -- biting Jun
text: on his forearm, just under his tattoo.
text: The gangster winces but doesn't waver -- watching Zhao the
dialog: entire time.
text: The snake recoils. Jun lifts his arm out of the terrarium
text: and observes two trickles of blood running down his forearm.
text: Pointedly, he licks the blood from his arm and then, gentile
text: as you please, rolls his shirt sleeve back, buttoning it.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
dialog: I know this arrangement may seem
dialog: poisonous to you now but, over time,
dialog: once you've completed your building, I
dialog: promise you: you won't feel a thing.
text: Zhao looks pained. A moment, then...
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Give me the account number.
text: Jun nods to Xia. She slides over a piece of paper with a
text: lengthy number on it. Zhao takes it and enters the info
text: into his phone. By the looks of things, he's transferring
text: $50 million from his account into a different one.
text: He hits transfer. His phone chimes: complete.
speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: Are we done?
text: Jun gives us a reptilian smile.
speaker_heading: WU-SAI JUN

speaker_heading: WILL (PRE-LAP)

scene_heading: INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So you caved. But if he got what he

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I didn't cave. I could never let The
text: Pearl become corrupted by the likes
dialog: of Wu-Sai Jun.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As soon as he accepted my payment, he
text: chopped it up, dispersing it to all
dialog: of his other off-shore accounts in
text: smaller increments.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He laundered it.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Essentially, yes. But what he didn't
dialog: know is that I hid a Trojan Horse in
dialog: my wire transfer -- a digital dye
dialog: pack that infected every account any
dialog: portion of my payment touched,
dialog: feeding the routing and account
dialog: information back to me.
text: Zhao holds up the RED MEMORY CARD.
speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: This card contains the account

dialog: have. Over half a billion dollars in
dialog: illicit monies in thirty-six separate
text: holding banks around the globe.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hand this over to the Chinese

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Then why didn't you turn it over to

speaker_heading: ZHAO

dialog: signing my own death warrant.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As long as I hold onto this, we have
dialog: detente. They had to leave me alone
dialog: and let me build The Pearl without
dialog: interference.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But how does getting that particular
dialog: card help them -- you must've made
dialog: copies.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I did, of course. But this is the
dialog: original. With it, they can reverse
dialog: engineer my Trojan Horse payment and
dialog: scrub their accounts clean again --
dialog: no digital dye, no way for the
dialog: authorities to trace the money and
dialog: find their secret accounts. If they
dialog: get their hands on this, all of my
dialog: other copies would be worthless.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides, their plan isn't to let me
dialog: live. Their plan is to get their
dialog: hands on this and the moment they do,
dialog: I'm a dead man.
text: Will paces, putting it all together now...
text: Will stands.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So they lit the building on fire
dialog: because they knew you'd grab the most
dialog: valuable thing in the world to you
dialog: and flee -- just like anyone would.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: No one could get it out of my safe

speaker_heading: ZHAO

speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Daddy!
text: Pierce and his men turn to see Will pushing Zhao forward
text: like a prisoner, his wrists duct taped together in front of
dialog: him.
text: Pierce grabs Georgia roughly, yanking the girl to her feet as

speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: See? I knew you'd find a way.
text: Pierce nods at his biggest guy.
speaker_heading: PIERCE (cont'd)
dialog: Check 'em.
text: The BIG MAN moves to Will and starts patting him down. He
text: gets to Will's leg -- feels something funny. Will pulls up
text: his pant-leg to reveal his metal prosthesis.
text: Will shrugs. The Big Man moves on to Zhao, patting him down
text: as the billionaire lifts his duct-taped hands above his head.
speaker_heading: BIG MAN
dialog: They're clean.
text: The Big Man returns to his post. Pierce nods his approval.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Smart.
text: Will holds up the RED MEMORY CARD.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Here it is. Now let her go.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Go to your daddy, sweetheart.

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: I can't let you do it.

text: of Will's hand and steps behind him for cover.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What the hell are you doing? This
dialog: isn't the plan.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: The plan's changed.
dialog: (to Pierce)
dialog: I want a parachute.
text: Pierce grabs Georgia, jamming his gun against her cheek.
speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: I don't care about the girl -- a
dialog: parachute or your boss gets nothing.
text: Will's jaw sets -- the tension high. Pierce calculates the
text: angles, then turns to his BALD GOON.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Give him your parachute.
speaker_heading: BALD GOON
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Give him your fucking parachute.
text: Pierce points his weapon at his subordinate. The Bald Goon
text: hesitates, then pops the chest buckle on his chute and slips
text: it off, holding it out.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Bring it here.
text: The Bald Goon checks with Pierce who nods: do it. Baldy
text: moves closer, too close now.
speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)

speaker_heading: ZHAO (cont'd)
dialog: Here's your card.

text: mini-Frisbee. Instinctively, everyone turns to watch it go.
text: But not Will -- he looks at his daughter and yells:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Run!
text: And she does. Georgia bolts as Zhao opens fire. Will
text: reaches into the SIDE POCKET of his right pant leg, taking
text: hold of something and PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO REVEAL:
text: THE CHINESE SWORD WHICH HE'D DUCT TAPED TO HIS METAL LEG.
text: It shears through Will's pant leg with ease and he now holds
text: a three-foot razor-sharp blade in his hands. In a flash,
text: Will lunges, driving it through the Bald Goon's sternum as
dialog: Pierce and his men OPEN FIRE!
text: The entire observation deck erupts into a gunfight as
text: everyone moves to what cover they can find.
text: It's a gunfight in a glass house -- panels shatter, raining
text: down shards left and right, each new opening ushering in a
text: howling rush of wind like an airplane emergency door being
text: thrown open at 40,000 feet.
text: What's more -- with the firelight from below, the entire
text: space takes on the eerie effect of a house of mirrors.
dialog: Reflections dance in double and triple exposure as this
text: life-and-death finale unfolds in triplicate before us.
text: Amidst this maelstrom of glass and wind and gunfire we find:
speaker_heading: WILL
text: wedged up behind some cover, his sword at the ready. Out of
text: the corner of his eye he spots the REFLECTION OF GEORGIA
text: tucked into a ball covering her ears. He has to get to her.
text: Just then, Will sees the BIG MAN rushing toward him. Will
text: throws this sword -- it strikes the Big Man in the chest
text: but, strangely, the Big Man doesn't react -- instead he
text: SHATTERS into a thousand pieces: a reflection.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Which means: THE BIG MAN IS BEHIND WILL.
text: Will spins just in time to knock the muzzle of the Big Man's
text: sub-machine gun aside at it looses a rip of automatic fire.
text: In a blink, the two are in a close-quarters grapple to the
text: death. Will quickly gains the upper-hand.
text: The Big Man sees the tables turning against him and drives
text: his thumb into Will's shoulder wound. Will cries out as the
text: Big Man headbutts him, dropping Will to the deck in a daze.
text: The Big Man pounces, wrapping his meaty forearms around
text: Will's neck, putting him in a deadly sleeper-hold.
text: Will's seconds away from blacking out. He reaches for the
text: sword -- lying on the rooftop just out of his reach.
text: The Big Man jerks Will away from it, placing himself between
text: Will and the sword, his back to the SHATTERED GLASS PANEL.
speaker_heading: BIG MAN
dialog: Nighty-night...
dialog: cur TO:
speaker_heading: ZHAO

text: Pierce pulls a GRENADE and tosses it at Zhao.
text: The grenade lands perfectly. Zhao sees it and dives from

text: Pierce unloads, clipping Zhao in the leg as the magnate
text: scrambles for safety.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: WILL
text: being choked out. His fingers stumble numbly over the Big
text: Man's face. The Big Man almost smiles -- it's over.
text: And that's when Will grabs hold of the PARACHUTE'S RELEASE
text: HANDLE. With his last remaining strength, Will pulls it.
text: The Big Man's parachute ejects from his back -- quickly
text: catching the rushing wind and yanking him through the broken
text: glass panel like he was shot out of a cannon -- WHOOM!
text: The Big Man's scream is cut short when his head catches the
text: window transom on the way out -- offering up a meaty THUNK.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)

scene_heading: THE RED MEMORY CARD

text: for cover when he comes face-to-face with the FINAL GOON.
text: No words -- the Goon fires at point blank range: BANG!
text: But the Goon's gun doesn't go off. His torso jerks in three
text: successive spasms, as he's punched through by three shots,
text: falling to reveal Zhao, clutching his gunshot leg.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're a pretty good actor for a
dialog: billionaire.
speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: How do you think I got to be one?

speaker_heading: ZHAO
dialog: Great. Now let's get your daugh--

scene_heading: BEHIND COVER.
text: Will checks Zhao's wounds -- he's been gut-shot badly.
text: Blood pours from his mouth. Not good.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hang on -- stay with me.

text: Pierce holds a grenade in one hand and Georgia against his
text: body -- making a crack shot difficult.
text: The tableau is a haunting mirror of the farmhouse standoff
text: that cost Will so dearly. Will is struck cold.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: You shoot me, I drop this, she dies.
dialog: Disarm.
text: A pained moment. With no choice, Will obliges -- crouching
text: down to place his gun on the deck. But...
text: At the last moment, Will fires!
text: But he doesn't fire at Pierce -- HE FIRES AT THE GLASS PANEL
text: BENEATH HIS FEET. The entire floor panel SHATTERS -- PIERCE
text: AND GEORGIA FALL STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
text: Will leaps for the opening -- diving through the hole,
text: reaching out with everything's he's got and, at the last
text: possible second, he catches hold of GEORGIA'S HOODIE.
text: Surprise and horror on his face, Pierce falls away from
text: us -- the GRENADE EXPLODES next him, obliterating the

scene_heading: WILL, GEORGIA AND ZHAO
text: moving away from The Pearl's MAIN ENTRANCE DOOR. Will
text: carries Georgia in one arm and supports Zhao with the other.
text: The trio collapse. Will calls out to the gawking crowd...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Call an ambulance!
text: Suddenly a RUSH OF POLICE OFFICERS push through the crowd
text: surrounding Will, weapons drawn. Will puts his hands up.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: No -- no -- this man, he needs help!
text: But no one moves. Will implores them...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Please!
text: Will's shoulders slump -- after all of this, he's still seen
text: as a criminal. It's almost more than he can bear.
text: Just then, a bark of Chinese and the cops part to reveal
text: Captain Chan striding up. A quick nod from Chan allows EMT
text: TECHS to pass by and rush to Zhao's aid.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: Will Ford -- I've been dying to meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My wife and son? Are they okay? Are
dialog: they alive?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHAN
dialog: Ask them yourself.
text: Chan swings out of the way to reveal:
speaker_heading: SARAH AND HENRY
text: pushing through the throng, rushing toward them...
speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: Mom!
text: Sarah drops to her knees to hug her daughter as Will
text: watches, emotion overwhelming him -- his family safe.
text: Will moves to them, kneeling down as the trio envelop him in
text: their arms. Overcome, tears begin to fall down Will's dirt-
text: streaked face.
text: We HOLD ON this familial embrace, RISING UP and then, as if
text: by miracle, it begins to snow. Tiny swirling flakes that
dialog: won't survive impact -- but it is snowing all the same.
text: From above we watch the snow fall as a tumult of PEOPLE and
text: PARAMEDICS and POLICE eddy around the quartet.
text: But Will, Sarah, Henry and Georgia remain solid, together --
text: a rock amidst a rushing stream.
text: The moment is unmistakable: Will has finally saved the
dialog: family he couldn't save those many years ago -- his own.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
