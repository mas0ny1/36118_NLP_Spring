scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY
text: The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the
text: middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;
text: shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the
dialog: screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:
dialog: "1:52"
text: Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
text: face is visible because of his thick white hair, large
text: bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The
text: rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He
text: wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered
text: package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing
text: it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
dialog: "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears
text: quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than
text: he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,
text: CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:
dialog: "SUBWAY."
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY
text: A level above the locals, two above the express trains.
text: Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.
text: Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives
text: his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes
text: through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending
text: stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:
scene_heading: "IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY
text: Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a
text: placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
text: the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the
text: point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the
text: sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green
text: turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the
text: track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the
text: far end of the platform.
scene_heading: SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV
text: as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white
text: sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train
text: roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with
text: the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair
text: of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now
text: MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the
text: still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing
text: on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).
