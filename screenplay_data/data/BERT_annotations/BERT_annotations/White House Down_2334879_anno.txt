dialog: by

dialog: March 1, 2012
speaker_heading: FADE IN ON:
text: A snow globe.
text: Sitting on a little girl's desk. Inside it, among the water
text: and glitter, is a model of THE WHITE HOUSE.
text: The flakes swirl and gleam in the reflection of a night light.
text: Framed pictures on the desk. A little girl in front of the
dialog: Capitol. The Lincoln Memorial. We are in
scene_heading: INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Cramped. EMILY CALE (10) slumbers. A stack of magazines by
dialog: her bed. US Weekly. Teen People. The Economist.
text: We hear a cell phone BOOP. Emily stirs. Checks her battered
text: first gen iPhone. An email notification. The screen reads:
dialog: President's Treaty With Iran Draws
text: Criticism at G8 Summit.
text: Emily goes to the CNN app. Pulls the covers over her head.
dialog: A kid sneaking TV, except in this case, it's not cartoons,
dialog: it's Wolf Blitzer:
speaker_heading: WOLF BLITZER
dialog: ...The proposed treaty with the newly
dialog: elected moderate President of Iran,
dialog: Mehrak Al-Said, is drawing huge
dialog: criticism for the Sawyer
dialog: administration. The President was
text: booed when he took the stage to speak
dialog: in Geneva over the weekend...
text: Drowned out by a LOW RUMBLING. Windows rattling. Emily's
text: bed begins SHAKING. Earthquake? Emily leaps up, huge smile
text: on her face. Throws the window open and looks up to see
text: A COLUMN OF HELICOPTERS thundering overhead! Three dark
text: green VH-3D Sea King choppers, each with United States of
text: America emblazoned on the side...
speaker_heading: MARINE ONE
text: Leads the Presidential Motorcade of the sky. Emily looks up
text: in wonder as Marine One and her two thundering companions
text: bank East towards the dawn...
scene_heading: INT. MARINE ONE (FLYING) - NIGHT
text: The cabin holds ten. Nine men in suits. One woman in the
text: front jump seat. Secret Service AGENT CAROL FINNERTY (30's).
text: Smart pant suit, gun on her hip. She keys her wrist mic:
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Castle, this is Hummingbird, we are
text: inbound from Andy, three minutes out--
speaker_heading: AGENT GRIGGS
dialog: Carol?
text: Finnerty looks up to see Agent BRIAN GRIGGS across from her.
speaker_heading: AGENT GRIGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: He wants to do the thing.
text: Finnerty sighs.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: AGENT GRIGGS
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Mr. President, it's not a good idea
dialog: to deviate from the flight plan...
text: She's now looking into the smiling face of PRESIDENT JAMES
text: SAWYER, the 46th Chief Executive of the United States.
dialog: Handsome, 40's, African-American.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Come on, Carol, pretty please? Leader
dialog: of the free world here, saying 'pretty
dialog: please' here. Oughta count for
dialog: something.
text: A beat. Finnerty keys her radio mic.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Captain Joffrey, this is Agent
dialog: Finnerty? The President would like
dialog: to do the thing.
text: The others grin as the helicopter banks left...
scene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - NIGHT
text: Beautifully illuminated. A JOGGER and his dog, huffing and
text: puffing by when
text: MARINE ONE sweeps in low overhead, coming down 23rd Street.
text: The two escort choppers playing follow-the-leader behind it,
text: circling the Memorial, saying hello to Mr. Lincoln.
text: The column of choppers turns East, flying out over the
dialog: reflecting pool! An air tour of the sights...
scene_heading: INT. MARINE ONE (FLYING) - NIGHT
text: President Sawyer smiles in his seat as he watches Lincoln
text: recede. As they make a wide arc around the Washington
text: Monument, their destination comes into view --
text: THE WHITE HOUSE. All lit up. Spectacular.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Be it ever so humble...
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: (into wrist walkie)
dialog: Castle, this is Hummingbird, we are
dialog: one minute out, I need a go/no go.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE GUARD HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A structure on the North side of the White House Grounds, on
text: Pennsylvania Avenue. Inside, packed with electronics.
text: The GUARD sits hunched over a monitor system that shows dozens
text: of traffic camera feeds from the streets around the complex.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground,
dialog: you are clear.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Low lit. Two dress MARINES sit in the outer office. A NAVY
text: RADAR TECH watches his screen sweep for nearby air traffic.
speaker_heading: RADAR TECH
dialog: Hummingbird, this is Castle Sky, you
text: are clear.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT
text: High atop the famous columned central building, a black clad
text: SNIPER TEAM scans the night sky with their rifle-scopes,
text: checking surrounding buildings for movement.
speaker_heading: LEAD SNIPER
dialog: Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep,
dialog: you are- Hold.
text: THROUGH HIS NIGHTSCOPE - We see movement on the eighth floor
text: balcony of a building a half mile away. He frowns. Enhances
text: magnification. The suspicious behavior comes into focus...
text: A couple having sex on their balcony. The Lead Sniper grins.
speaker_heading: LEAD SNIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep,
dialog: you are clear.
text: The column of helicopters swoops in, circling the South Lawn.
text: The Lead Chopper pulls a slow turn, coming in for a landing.
text: A pair of MARINES in dress blues come out to meet it.
text: The door does not open. The Chopper sits there for a good
text: twenty seconds as the snipers continue to scan. Then:
speaker_heading: FINNERTY (0.S.)
dialog: (through radio)
dialog: Castle Keep?
speaker_heading: LEAD SNIPER
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY (0.S.)
dialog: (through radio)
dialog: All right, Decoy up, Marine One in.
text: The chopper on the ground rises up and the second helicopter -
text: the real Marine One - swoops in for a landing on
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE SOUTH LAWN - NIGHT
text: The MARINES open the door and President Sawyer steps off the
text: bird, flanked by Finnerty, Dawson, and aides. Sawyer snaps
text: the Marines a salute as they head for the White House.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: It's really not a bad way to travel,
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: It beats Dupont Circle, sir.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: When's my wife back?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Not until tonight.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I'm gonna get some shut-eye. Wake
dialog: me if we need to attack anything.
text: In front of him, more Marines hold open the door to the West
text: colonnade. As the President passes them, walking inside:
speaker_heading: MARINE GUARD
dialog: Welcome home, sir.
text: Finnerty looks back at Marine One as it lifts off the South
text: Lawn. An incredible sight. Griggs smiles next to her.
speaker_heading: AGENT GRIGGS
dialog: Tell me we don't have the best job
dialog: in the world.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Two other Secret Service Agents stand a very different detail.
text: Guarding a broken down row house in Georgetown. The first
text: is handsome, close cropped hair. This is JOHN CALE (30's).
text: A HORRIBLE COUGHING comes from inside. Wheezy and phlegmy,
text: like a grown man trying to hack up a furball.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, God...
text: The coughing resumes. Awful. The agents wince. Then:
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there any kleenex out there?
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Clutching a box of kleenex, Cale raps on the bathroom door.
text: It opens and ELI RAPHELSON (70) sticks his head out. Clad
text: in a ratty bathrobe, still wheezing.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Thank you, John. When I'm done in
dialog: here, I'll make you some coffee.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm fine, Mr. Speaker-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I insist.
scene_heading: INT. RAPHELSON'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Raphelson stands at the stove, mixing what looks to be the
text: world's worst cup of instant coffee. A TV tuned to CNN
dialog: replays the President's Geneva Speech:
scene_heading: PRESDIENT SAWYER
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: ...-There are those who will say we
dialog: are foolish, those who treat every
dialog: opportunity for peace as a show of
dialog: weakness. To them I say I have found
dialog: a friend in President Al-Said. And
dialog: together, we will prove that the pen
text: truly is mightier than the sword.
text: Applause mixed with boos. Raphelson adds way too much cream
text: to the coffee. Looks to Cale.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What do you think of all this?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I don't know, sir. It's good to
dialog: have less enemies.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
text: All he's doing is legitimizing them.
dialog: Geopolitics is chess, not checkers;
dialog: you have to see the whole board.
dialog: The President is very naive sometimes.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Why didn't you run against him?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Because that is the one job I never
dialog: wanted. I like my constituents, I
dialog: like being a thorn in the side of
dialog: the administration. Not all of us
dialog: are looking to move up.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (casual)
dialog: You have your interview today?
text: Cale looks at him, surprised.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you want to be on the
dialog: President's detail. Are you not
dialog: pleased with your life of excitement
dialog: and adventure here?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Sir, I- I appreciate everything you've
dialog: done for me, but-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: It's all right, son. It's good to
dialog: have ambition. I'll be sorry to see
dialog: you go is all. This may not be the
dialog: White House, but there's coffee.
text: He slides a mug over to Cale. Cale takes a sip. Awful.
text: Hides it well. He likes the old guy. Raphelson nods, happy.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna get a shower.
scene_heading: EXT. RAPHELSON'S HOUSE - DAWN
text: Now in a suit, Raphelson climbs behind the wheel of his
text: battered Toyota Camry and fires it up. Cale slides into the
text: SUV idling behind him - the follow car. Into his wrist:
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Pinball is rolling, we are enroute
dialog: to Punchbowl.
text: As they roll out after Raphelson, we pan around to see their
text: destination in the distance, what "Punchbowl" really is
text: THE U.S. CAPITOL DOME. Silhouetted against the rising sun...
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN
text: McLean, Virginia. An alarm clocks wails. The lone figure
text: wakes. This is MARTIN BISHOP (late 50's). Fit, trim. He
text: sits a moment. Alone in a house for two. Then rises.
text: A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS - Bishop showers, shaves. Pulls on
text: pants, a button down shirt. Selects a tie. Withdraws a
text: GLOCK. Checks the load. Straps it into his shoulder holster.
text: A small silver cross hangs from his mirror. He takes it.
text: Slips it around his neck. Looks at himself.
text: He stands there for a long time.
text: Bishop takes the cross off. Hangs it back on the mirror.
text: Pulls on his suit coat and is out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAWN
text: Cale and Dunleavy shadow a briskly walking Raphelson as he
text: climbs the famous steps. Cale, scanning passersby for any
text: sign of potential threat. Everything okay until he spies
text: A long haired FIDGETY GUY. He keeps scratching his beard
text: and eyeing the Speaker. Cale, about to say something when
text: the Fidgety Guy suddenly reaches into his coat and --
text: TIME SLOWS DOWN. Cale pivots to block Raphelson, his own
text: hand drifts to the holster on his hip, about to pull, but
text: Fidgety Guy's faster and his gun hand emerges brandishing
text: A banana. Fidgety Guy's breakfast. Cale exhales.
speaker_heading: DUNLEAVY
dialog: You okay there, Tex? Too much coffee?
text: Cale doesn't respond. They head up the steps and inside.
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING
text: Raphelson walks the halls, saying hello to various Congressmen
text: as they arrive for work. Stepping into a big office where
text: AGENTS KELLERMAN and BRIGHT stands guard. Cale steps up.
speaker_heading: CALE
text: He watched Jeopardy, went to bed to
text: at 8:00, got up to pee twice, and is
dialog: still having that allergy thing. We
dialog: need to start keeping kleenex in the
dialog: downstairs bathroom. He's all yours.
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN
dialog: I'll try not to die of excitement.
text: Cale smiles. Heads down the hall to an even bigger office...
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT - MORNING
text: Hustle and bustle. An assistant sits at the front desk,
text: rolling calls. JENNA (30's), sweet and flirty.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Office of the Vice President. Hold
dialog: please.
text: She sees Cale and flashes him her best smile.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Did you get them?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What do I get if I did?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: JENNA
text: Dinner, candlelight, and a sincere
dialog: promise that you'll try to get to
dialog: second base.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Done.
text: She hands him an envelope and a card with her phone number
text: on it. Cale looks inside the envelope.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: She's gonna love these, Jenna.
dialog: Thanks!
text: He kisses her on the cheek and is out the door...
scene_heading: INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Emily sits at the kitchen table, sullenly picking at her
text: cereal. Her mother MELANIE (30's, hard), mixes vodka from
text: the freezer in with her morning OJ. The former Mrs. Cale.
text: A knock on the door. Melanie opens it. Cale.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You're late. She thought you weren't
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Of course I was coming. Emily, get
dialog: your stuff.
text: Emily grabs her bag and heads out the door. As she passes
text: Cale he tries to kiss her on the forehead, but she dodges.
text: Melanie smiles at this. A small victory for her side.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You missed her talent show.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: When was her talent show?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Thursday.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: What did she do?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: She was a flag twirler.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: That's a talent?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: She practiced for like six weeks and
text: her own father can't be bothered to
dialog: show up...
scene_heading: INT. CALE'S CAR - MORNING
text: Emily, sitting in the car, listening to her parents fight.
text: Old news. She slips on her headphones...
scene_heading: INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Cale nods to the vodka bottle.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Getting an early start, I see.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Why not? It's my day off.
text: Cale has a retort, but swallows it. Instead:
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Listen, I wanted to talk about custody-
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I'm sure you do. That way you don't
dialog: have to cut me that check every month-
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You really think this is about the
dialog: checks, Mel?
dialog: 11.
text: He stares at her drink. She shifts her weight from one foot
text: to the other, then shakes her head and chuckles.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Jesus, John. She doesn't even like
dialog: you.
dialog: That lands. Hard.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You have a good day.
scene_heading: INT. CALE'S CAR - MORNING
text: Cale gets into the driver's seat. Emily listening to music,
text: checking the Drudge Report on her phone. Cale looks at her.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You pissed at me?
text: She doesn't even look up at him. Hell hath no fury.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: You gonna be on that thing all day?
text: She's texting now. After a moment, Cale's own phone chimes.
text: He checks it. Text from Emily - Yes.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so glad I got you that phone.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Well, I guess you won't be wanting
dialog: these then...
text: He puts the envelope from Jenna on the dash. A beat.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Lame.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You don't even know what it is.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Do you really think that's going to
dialog: work? We're both adults here, John.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Speak for yourself. Open the
dialog: envelope.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CALE
text: A pony. Just open it.
text: Dubious, Emily opens the envelope. Her face lights up.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Are you serious? I didn't think
dialog: they even gave White House tours
dialog: anymore!
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: They don't. It's a six month waiting
dialog: list unless you know people. I
dialog: thought a budding policy wonk like
dialog: you might want to see where the most
dialog: powerful man in the world lives.
text: She looks up at him. Genuinely happy.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: This is really cool, John.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: (starting the car)
dialog: We're really sticking with the John
dialog: thing, huh?
text: As Emily nods, they pull out into traffic...
scene_heading: INT. CALE'S CAR (MOVING) - MORNING
text: Cale drives as Emily surfs her phone.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Listen, when we get there I have to
dialog: go to a quick meeting, okay? Then
dialog: we can go on the tour.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (reading off her phone)
dialog: Did you know that 1.5 million people
dialog: visit the White House every year?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That works out to about 5000 people
dialog: a day.
speaker_heading: CALE
text: Fascinating.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm sorry I missed your talent show.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm not. Did you know the White
dialog: House was originally called the
dialog: Presidential Palace?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm serious. I wish I'd been there.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No you, don't. All I did was twirl
dialog: a flag, it was stupid.
text: Cale looks at her.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You don't have to do that, you know.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Have a thick skin. You're ten.
text: Emily doesn't respond. A beat.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you really think I wasn't coming?
text: But Emily's not looking at him, she's looking at...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, wow...
text: THE WHITE HOUSE. Approaching from the South Side, with the
text: fountain blasting. Enough to take Emily's breath away.
text: Cale smiles at her reaction, driving up to
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE GUARD HOUSE - MORNING
text: Cale pulls up to the massive guard gate. The Officer in
text: Charge leans out of the structure.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: Morning folks! Gonna need some photo
dialog: ID!
text: Cale hands it over. Instantly two other guards appear from
text: nowhere, each holding long mirrors at the end of poles.
dialog: 14.
text: They sweep the bottom of the car for explosives.
text: One guard checks the trunk while the other roots through the
text: back seat. Emily takes a picture of him with her phone.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you guys looking for?
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD 2
dialog: Explosives.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: This is awesome.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: (handing ID's back)
dialog: Park up on the left and you're going
dialog: to the East Lobby. Have a good one.
text: Cale drives on.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Cale pulls to a halt next to a parked SOUNDTEK van. A HUGE
text: MAN with a SHAVED HEAD is pulling a large speaker box out of
text: the back onto a dolly. Cale, watching him...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Did you know the President travels
text: in an eight ton military armored
dialog: modified Cadillac CTS, built to
dialog: withstand gas, chemical, and missile
dialog: attacks?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: That's on the internet?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Wikipedia. You guys are doing a
dialog: bang-up job with the secrecy thing.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST LOBBY - MORNING
text: Honey wood panelling. A GUARD DESK to the right, by set of
text: metal detectors. Beyond, two more security checkpoints. X-
dialog: ray, body scan, bag search, facial rec. Serious stuff.
text: On the walls hang Presidential Portraits. Roosevelt.
text: Eisenhower. They lived here. Emily stares at them as Cale
text: loads their stuff into the x-ray machine.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Welcome to the White House! We're
dialog: going to take you through three levels
dialog: of security today. First, I'm going
dialog: to need to empty your pockets - all
dialog: metal objects in the tray please.
dialog: Cell phones and cameras are permitted
dialog: on the premises, but need to be
dialog: examined by the agents first!
text: OVERALLED WORKMEN lay tools on the x-ray belt. Photo ID's
dialog: checked against internet records. Cale, to the officer:
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm Secret Service, off duty, I'm
dialog: carrying.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: You're going to have to check your
dialog: weapon, sir.
text: The officer produces a LOCKBOX. Cale unholsters his Glock
text: and places it inside. The officer locks it and hands it to
text: an AGENT. As Cale and Emily continue through security...
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS the Agent carrying the lockbox, as he takes
text: it down into the bowels of the White House. Down a
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - BACK STAIRCASE - MORNING
text: Concrete stairs, dimly lit. Past another agent into
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING BASEMENT - MORNING
text: A dark carpeted hallway. Down the corridor, round a corner...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE ARMORY - MORNING
text: A WEAPONS CAGE. The Armory Master looks up briefly as the
text: Agent logs in Cale's lockbox. Pan off this to the countless
text: ASSAULT RIFLES and SHOTGUNS locked behind steel mesh...
scene_heading: INT. BACK OFFICES - MORNING
text: Cale and Emily sit, waiting. Awkward silence again. Emily
text: on her phone, surfing. After a beat:
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: How's school?
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: School blows.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm glad we can have these talks.
text: The outer office door opens and Finnerty enters.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering to Emily)
dialog: Do me a favor, for the next twenty
dialog: seconds pretend you don't hate me.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: John Cale? I'm Carol Finnerty, I
dialog: run the President's detail.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: (vising)
dialog: This is my daughter Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: My father is a very special man.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: That's... good to know. If you'll
dialog: follow me?
scene_heading: INT. FINNERTY'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Finnerty settles in behind her desk as Cale takes a seat.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You often bring small children to
dialog: job interviews?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Diversionary tactic. While I'm in
dialog: here, she's out there stealing
dialog: everything that's not nailed down.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Sorry, that was a joke.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: All evidence to the contrary.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Mr. Cale, I'm going on seventeen
dialog: hours of no sleep, so let's just get
dialog: through this, okay?
text: She opens the file sitting in front of her and reads.
dialog: She looks
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY (CONT'D)
dialog: John Cale, born 1983, Columbus, Ohio,
dialog: public school, track and field, and
dialog: then one single solitary semester at
dialog: San Diego State University. Married
dialog: your childhood sweetheart five months
dialog: later, bounced from job to job.
dialog: Mechanic, limo driver, construction-
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Is my credit score in there too?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Yes, and you should be ashamed of
dialog: yourself. You finally landed in the
dialog: Army Reserve. Enlisted for the bonus.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Is that a crime?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: We tend to prefer God and Country to
dialog: "in it for the paycheck". Did two
dialog: tours in Afghanistan, was wounded in
dialog: the Kunar Province, received the
dialog: Purple Heart. A Lance Corporal Brian
dialog: Dawson put you up for a Silver Star,
dialog: but you did not receive it.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: It's an honor just to be nominated.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You pulled Corporal Dawson from a
dialog: burning Humvee. Why?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I was somewhat concerned he was
text: getting too warm in there.
text: at him.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: It's funny to me that you think glib
dialog: is the way to go here.
speaker_heading: CALE
text: There was an IED attack, the Humvee
dialog: flipped, and we were taking fire.
text: Everyone else bolted, I grabbed him.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Because we don't leave men behind.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And he owed me money.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Corporal Dawson happens to be the
dialog: nephew of the Speaker of the House.
dialog: And when you were discharged from
dialog: the Army, the Speaker urged you to
dialog: go into the Secret Service.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: He was kind enough to recommend me
dialog: for a job.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You're on the Speaker's detail now.
dialog: He did you a favor.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You could say that.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I did. Why do you want to be on the
dialog: President's detail?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Nothing against the Speaker, but no
dialog: one's ever going to take a shot at
dialog: him. This is the big leagues.
text: She studies him.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Look, I appreciate your service, but
dialog: this is clearly the record of a man
dialog: who's slid by mostly on looks, charm,
dialog: and favors-
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Mostly on the looks, actually-
speaker_heading: FINNERTY

speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I know I've bounced around, but this
dialog: is something I can do. Giving
dialog: yourself up for something greater
dialog: than you... that's what I need.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I'm sorry, but the Secret Service is
dialog: not somewhere to find yourself.
dialog: Thanks for coming in.
text: She rises and offers her hand. Cale blinks. Surprised it's

scene_heading: INT. BACK OFFICES - MORNING
text: Emily looks up as Cale emerges.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: How'd it go?
text: Cale's face says it all...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - WEST LOBBY - MORNING
text: Finnerty strides through the lobby, passing the Photo Office
text: and Homeland Security. Keycards through another door into
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF SECRET SERVICE - MORNING
text: The on-site security hub of the White House.
text: 40 odd agents, some in uniform, some in suit and tie, stand,
text: drinking coffee, talking with each other. Shift change coming
text: up, but before that, the morning briefing.
text: Finnerty slides into the back of the room as MARTIN BISHOP
text: walks to the front. Head of the Secret Service. The Boss.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: All right, listen up. First and
dialog: most importantly, who owes me money
dialog: on the Wizards?
text: Grumbling throughout the agents, some come forward and hand
dialog: him cash.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right. Thank you. I hope

speaker_heading: AGENT HOPE
text: Empress is wheels down at 18:45.
dialog: They're supposed to have dinner of

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Assuming they call an audible on
dialog: going out, we need to have advance

speaker_heading: AGENT HOPE
dialog: What if she wants sushi?
text: From the back of the room, Finnerty speaks up:
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: No, she's off sushi, she had that
dialog: thing on the Japan trip.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Jesus, Carol, how are you still awake?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Five Hour Energy Drink and patriotism,

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: You have a Threat Matrix for us?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Homeland says a guy they were sitting

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: This guy a lone nut or well financed

speaker_heading: AGENT HOPE
dialog: AV guys, they're replacing the

dialog: Eagle wants it ready for football on

speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: The First Lady should be thrilled.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: All right, that's game. Grab an
dialog: Order of the Day and let's get to
dialog: work.
text: The Agents grab top-sheets from a stack by the coffee. As
text: they file out Finnerty approaches Bishop.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: For the love of all that is holy, go
dialog: get some sleep.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I'm going.
text: (as he watches the

dialog: You know you're going to miss this.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: I'm not, actually.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I can tell when you're lying, you

speaker_heading: BISHOP

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST LOBBY - MORNING
text: Cale and Emily stand with a tour group of ten. At the front
text: stands DONNIE THE TOUR GUIDE (40's). Way too chipper.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: I'm Donnie and I'm going to be your
dialog: guide today as we take a walk through
dialog: American History! First I want to
dialog: give you a big Washington DC welcome
dialog: to the White House, where we get
dialog: millions of guests a year from all
dialog: corners of the globe!
dialog: (to Cale)
dialog: Where are you folks from?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Washington DC.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: Okay, bad choice.
dialog: (to a Fat Woman)
dialog: How about you, ma'am?
speaker_heading: FAT WOMAN
dialog: I'm from North Carolina.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: And what brings you to the White
dialog: House today?
speaker_heading: FAT WOMAN
dialog: I wanna see the tunnels where JFK
dialog: snuck Marilyn Monroe in.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: Unfortunately, those don't exist.
dialog: (the Fat Woman is
dialog: crestfallen)
dialog: But we do have some other really
dialog: exciting sights to show you! If
dialog: you'll follow me?
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - GARDEN ROOM - DAY
text: A beautiful solarium with a corner windows looking out onto
text: the South Lawn of the White House. Bright and sunny. As
text: Donnie talks he leads them through.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: Does anyone want to guess how old
dialog: the White House is?
dialog: (sees Emily raising
dialog: her hand)
dialog: Young lady?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: 221 years old.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: That's... very accurate. Construction
dialog: was begun in 1792 on what was then
dialog: called the President's House. Article
dialog: One, Section Eight of the US
dialog: Constitution set forth that a district
dialog: of not more than ten miles square
dialog: should house the new seat of
dialog: government. Does anyone know why?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So no one state could claim the
dialog: President's House.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: Right again. The founders were
dialog: crafty. They figured if the President
dialog: lived in one state then he would be
dialog: beholden to that state above all
dialog: others. But if he lived in a district
dialog: separate from all of them, then he
dialog: and his government could serve all
dialog: the United States equally and fairly.
dialog: In many ways, the entire city of
dialog: Washington, the whole District of
dialog: Columbia, was built from the ground
dialog: up in order to hold this one house.
dialog: 24.
text: As they step into
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST COLONNADE - MORNING
text: A long white corridor with a red brick floor wall of windows
text: looking out to the South Lawn.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: The White House is actually three
dialog: buildings; the East Wing, where you
text: came in, the West Wing, which houses
dialog: the Oval and Executive offices of
dialog: the President, and the Residence,
dialog: which is the big famous building in
dialog: the center. These three buildings
text: are connected by two long hallways
dialog: called colonnades; we're in the East
text: Colonnade right now. The colonnades
dialog: were originally built by Thomas
dialog: Jefferson to house horses, but now
dialog: function to connect the complex
dialog: together. And trust me, it needs
dialog: connecting - the White House is big.
dialog: Including below ground levels, the
text: White House is six stories tall,
dialog: with 132 rooms, 412 doors, 147
dialog: windows, 28 fireplaces, 8 staircases,
dialog: 3 elevators and 35 bathrooms. The
text: grounds contain a tennis court, a
text: basketball court, a putting green, a
text: jogging track, and a swimming pool.
text: They pass an open door, hearing hammering and drilling.
speaker_heading: FAT WOMAN
dialog: What's in there?
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
text: The President's home theater.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Membership has it's privileges.
text: Cale glances inside, as seven burly SOUNDTEK WORKMEN drills
text: holes into the walls of the theater...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING
text: Another part of the building. PRESIDENT SAWYER sweeps down
text: the hallway, the Chief of Staff and Bishop at his side.
text: Walking through an open door into

scene_heading: INT. OVAL OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - MORNING
text: The PRESIDENT'S ASSISTANTS sit at three desks and the door
text: to the Oval proper is guarded by a DRESS MARINE holding an M-
dialog: 16. To the Marine:
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Morning, Kenny.
speaker_heading: DRESS MARINE
dialog: Morning, sir.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: The New York Times called my treaty
dialog: a boondoggle this morning. You read
dialog: the New York Times, Kenny?
speaker_heading: DRESS MARINE
dialog: I'm more of a Daily News man, sir.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Bill, we need to talk to the Secretary
dialog: of the Navy about getting Kenny a
dialog: raise. Margaret, can you get me the
dialog: Speaker of the House please? I sense
dialog: a lecture in my future...
text: As the President steps into the Oval Office itself...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - VISITORS' FOYER - MORNING
text: Cale, Emily, and the rest of the tour exit the Colonnade
text: into the Visitor's Foyer as Donnie continues.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: Besides being a national landmark,
dialog: the White House also happens to be a
text: technological marvel. Underneath
text: the West Wing is the Situation Room,
dialog: the most sophisticated military
dialog: command center in the history of
dialog: warfare. And underneath the East
dialog: Wing is the PEOC or Presidential
dialog: Emergency Operations Center, the
dialog: single most secure room on the planet.
text: It's a vault built behind ten feet
dialog: of concrete and steel capable of
text: surviving a thermonuclear blast and
dialog: equipped so the President and his
dialog: staff could run the country from
text: inside for six months without leaving.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: So where's the bowling alley?
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: (completely serious)
text: Next to the Vault.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE GUARD HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: 26.
text: Finnerty, leaving the complex on foot. The kindly old Gate
text: Guard smiles at her as she goes.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: See you tomorrow, Carol!
text: Finnerty turns west onto Pennsylvania Avenue...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR - MORNING
text: A long hallway with dramatically vaulted arched ceilings
text: that runs length of the Residence Building.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: We're now entering the Center Hall
dialog: of the Residence. The President and
dialog: First Lady live on the second and
dialog: third floors, the Ground Floor and
dialog: State Floor are dedicated to public
dialog: rooms. To your left is the Library
dialog: and to your right is the Vermeil
text: Room, which houses the portraits of
dialog: several of the most prominent First
dialog: Lady's who have lived here. Pictures
dialog: are actually permitted, so snap away.
text: Emily goes to take pictures of the Vermeil Room.
text: how happy she is.
speaker_heading: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: Yours?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Nah, I found her sulking around
dialog: outside, thought if I brought her
dialog: it'd make me look smart.
dialog: Cale watches
text: The woman smiles. Cute. Maybe the day isn't a total loss.
text: She sees one of the paintings on the wall. One of a blackened
text: White House. Donnie comes over.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: Watercolor by George Munger. It's
dialog: to commemorate the burning of the
dialog: White House by the British in 1814.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: The White House burned down?
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: In the war of 1812. It practically
dialog: had to be rebuilt from the ground
dialog: up.
text: A tugging on Cale's arm.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I think I need to avail myself of
text: one of the 35 bathrooms in here.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
text: There's a ladies room upstairs, but
dialog: I can't take the tour up there for
dialog: another fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'll take her. Where?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I can go by myself, John. I'm nota
dialog: little girl.
text: Cale looks at her. Sighs. Deciding.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Okay, but don't touch anything, don't
dialog: wander off, and don't talk to anyone
dialog: you're not supposed to.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I make no promises.
text: She goes. Cale steps into the Vermeil Room to look around...
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: The Speaker's ASSISTANT pokes her head in.
scene_heading: SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
dialog: Mr. Speaker, I have the President
dialog: calling for you.
text: Raphelson snatches up his phone.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Mr. President! I'm impressed with
dialog: all your treaty signings you find
dialog: time for little old me!
dialog: INTERCUT with the Oval Office:
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: You do Jewish Mother's guilt very
dialog: well, Eli.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I just find it interesting that you
dialog: would announce the signing of a major
dialog: treaty with a sworn enemy of our
dialog: country before, you know, mentioning
dialog: it to anyone in Congress.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: It's the right thing to do, Eli.
dialog: We're never gonna get a better chance
dialog: at progress with Iran than right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Which would be wonderful if I didn't
dialog: just have to take your word for it...
text: We PAN out of the office and into the hall...
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING CORRIDORS - MORNING
text: ...Where we pick up the FIDGETY GUY from earlier walking
text: past. Moving with purpose. On his way to
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL DOME - MORNING
text: The corridor opens into the enormous room beneath the famed
text: CAPITOL ROTUNDA. Sunlight streams in. Various STATUES.
text: Lincoln. Martin Luther King. Tourists snap photos.
text: The Fidgety Man stops in front of one particular bronze
text: statue. Looks at the name on the base. George Washington.
text: The Fidgety Man checks his watch.
text: It is 9:17 a.m.
text: The man leans down and begins to untie his shoes. Then he
text: removes them. Places them carefully on the floor. Then his
text: socks. A GUARD notices. This guy is undressing.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: CAPITOL SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Uh, sir?
text: The Man is now unbuttoning his shirt. Muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: CAPITOL SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir, you can't do that-
text: The Guard stops. The man has unbuttoned his shirt. He is
text: wearing a VEST OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES beneath it.
text: The Guard stares at him, numb. The Fidgety Man raises his
text: hand. Detonator in it. Exhales. Their eyes meet...
text: And then the air is filled with fire.
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: A muffled WHOOMP! The whole building ROCKS. Raphelson is
text: thrown sideways against his desk, still clutching the phone.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Jesus!
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: (through phone)
dialog: Eli, are you all right?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I'm fine, I- sir, I think there may
dialog: have been an explosion here-
text: He opens his door to the outer office - CHAOS. Glass and
text: debris everywhere. Smoke pouring in from the hallway...
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, God.
scene_heading: EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - MORNING
text: Finnerty hears the explosion before she sees it. Car alarms
text: going off. In the distance - Smoke is rising from the Capitol
text: Rotunda. Finnerty begins to run towards it...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Eli?
text: Bishop getting information from his earpiece:
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Mr. President, there's been an
dialog: explosion at that Capitol, you need
text: to hang up the phone.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: (into wrist)
dialog: We are crashing the White House,
text: repeat, the White House is crashed.
text: Bishop takes the phone from Sawyer and hangs it up as the
text: door opens and THREE AGENTS with SHOTGUNS suddenly come into
text: the room. The DRESS MARINE behind him, wielding his M-16.
text: The Marine bolts the door to the Oval Office as a KLAXON
text: sounds throughout the complex...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - VERMEIL ROOM - MORNING
text: Cale looks up at the siren as a SECRET SERVICE AGENT steps
text: into the room, blocking the exit.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: Everybody please stay where you are.
dialog: We're briefly restricting movement

speaker_heading: CALE

dialog: My daughter's upstairs-
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, no one moves until

speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm an agent on the Speaker's detail-
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: Then you understand the protocol -
text: nobody moves.
text: Cale stares at him. A couple from Tennessee snaps his
dialog: picture. This is very exciting.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Raphelson hangs up the phone and looks to his Secret Service
text: Agent, who's talking on his own phone.
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Where's the Vice President?
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN
dialog: In his office, I think-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: (to his Assistant)
dialog: Get him on the phone, tell him he
dialog: needs to institute Continuity of
dialog: Government-
scene_heading: SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
dialog: What 's-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: In the event of an attack, all
dialog: principals in the line of succession
dialog: are moved to Secondary Locations and
dialog: a new communications band is put
dialog: online-
scene_heading: SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
dialog: I have the Vice President's Office,

dialog: He can't come to the phone, he was

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENTIAL THEATER - MORNING

speaker_heading: YOUNG AGENT

dialog: Picked the wrong day to come to work
dialog: here, huh?
text: The man with the shaved head, STENZ, smiles back. Not nice.
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: Guess so.
text: And he raises a NAIL GUN and buries three bolts into the
dialog: Agent's chest!
text: The others move fast, professionals. They strip the man of
text: his weapon and hand the gun to Stenz. Syncing their watches --
speaker_heading: STENZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Armory, sixty seconds, go!
text: -- And they spring out of the Theater into
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST COLONNADE - MORNING
text: Running full tilt for the East Lobby. The Security Officer
text: at the end of the Colonnade looks up.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: We're in a crash, you can't-
text: BLAM-BLAM! Stenz shoots him twice in the head! His partner
text: raises his walkie to his lips, screaming:
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 2
dialog: Shots fired! Code Black, Code-
text: BLAM! He goes down too as Stenz's right hand man HUMPHRIES
text: scoops their weapons and they KICK through the side door to

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - WOMEN'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Emily looks up at the shots...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - VERMEIL ROOM - MORNING
text: Cale automatically reaches for his hip to find his holster
text: EMPTY. The Agent with Cale's tour shouting into his wrist:
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: Repeat, please repeat!
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: He said shots fired, it's an AOP!
text: He moves for the door but the Agent draws his weapon.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - ARMORY - MORNING
text: The Armory Master pulls a SHOTGUN from the wall and racks

text: Stenz comes in low, firing three rounds into the Armory
text: Master's legs! The man crumples. Humphries hefts the ARC-

speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: Thirty seconds!
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - VERMEIL ROOM - MORNING
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: I have to wait for orders! We don't
dialog: know what's happening-

text: Checks the magazine, looking to Donnie:
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: My daughter, where'd you send her?
speaker_heading: DONNIE

speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)

text: At 9:17 a.m. an explosive device was

scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ

speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: It was.
dialog: (into speaker)
dialog: Carol Finnerty, Secret Service, sir.
dialog: We need one single command structure

scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: What we need is to send in the Army

scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: You can't do that, sir.

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What about federalizing the National

dialog: 51.
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ

scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: (getting it)
dialog: Because he's the Vice President.
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: You do not hold the power of the
dialog: Presidency, that is correct, sir.
dialog: Make no mistake, we are ina
dialog: Constitutional crisis - we have never

scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: I don't want to do anything-
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: There are some practical issues with
dialog: that, sir - The 25th would require a
dialog: majority of the Cabinet to vote that
dialog: President Sawyer was unfit to hold
dialog: office in absentia - something that
dialog: a). They may not do, and b). May
dialog: not be possible, considering we do

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: You're saying a third of the

scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: That's exactly what I'm saying, sir.
speaker_heading: WALLACE

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: There's another consideration...
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: We don't know what they want yet.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You want to negotiate with them?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I want to find out what they're after

scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: -I'm not going through these names

text: Finnerty takes a breath.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Not your concern. Clock's ticking.
text: About to hang up the phone when:
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Is the President alive?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I want proof of life.
text: Stenz raises an eyebrow at Bishop.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: One hour, or I execute him in front

text: The First Family's personal quarters. Far away from the

text: Cale steps into the room, gun up. Scanning. Tasteful
text: decorations. Thick carpet, plush furniture. And empty.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: We're clear.
text: President Sawyer enters behind him.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Right now they're getting situated,
dialog: but that won't last. They'll be
dialog: coming for us.
dialog: (checks his clip)
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: What?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: We only have three bullets. Do you
dialog: keep any weapons in here?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: There are usually two dress marines
text: with M-16's standing outside that
dialog: door, so no, I didn't see the need.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: What about knives in the kitchen?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Through there.
text: The President points to a door. Cale raises the gun.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Stay behind me.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Pristine. Pot racks and expensive ranges. Warming drawers.
text: A beautiful kitchen. Cale enters. No one there.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Clear.
text: Sawyer comes in behind him and goes for the knife block on
dialog: the island.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: How long have you been in the Secret
dialog: Service?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Six months.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Well, technically six months Tuesday.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: But you've done this before?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Oh, sure, this is like my third White
dialog: House terrorist take-over attack
dialog: this month.
dialog: 58.
text: Cale spies the phone on the wall. Goes to pick it up...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Not that I don't like our chances
text: with three bullets and a kitchen
dialog: knife, but I thought you might want
dialog: to call your good friends at Seal
dialog: Team Six and see if they wanted to
dialog: swing by and help.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: You pick up that line, anyone at the
dialog: switchboard will know we're up here.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Good point. Do you have a cell phone?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I have a better idea.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
text: The President opens up his bedside drawer and withdraws a
text: sleek SATELLITE PHONE.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Satphone with a built in alpha-
text: scrambler. No one can tap in.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Why do you have this next to your
dialog: bed?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: So I can make private calls to the
dialog: man I'm seeing.
text: Cale blinks.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: Kidding. Sheryl wanted to be able
dialog: to call her mother without the NSA
dialog: listening in. So, who do we call?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You don't know?
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I haven't placed a phone call for
dialog: myself in over two years.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: They didn't give you like a special
dialog: Presidential dial-in number in case
dialog: of emergencies?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: (dry ) .
dialog: No, they told me my Secret Service
dialog: protection would handle that.
text: Touche. Cale stares at the phone. Has an idea. Fishes out
text: a card from his pocket...
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I know who we're calling.
scene_heading: INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING
text: Cruising altitude. Shaken, Jenna sits in her seat watching

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: CALE

scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER

scene_heading: INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING
text: Jenna, about to take another sip when the phone RINGS AGAIN.
text: She spills again. Answers, about to yell at him but:

speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Jenna, don't hang up! I'm calling

dialog: the President with me!
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: That's not funny, John.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Jenna, I'm not kid-
text: Sawyer takes the phone from Cale.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Jenna, hi, this is James Sawyer,
dialog: listen, I've just spent the last ten
dialog: minutes getting shot at, so if you
dialog: could connect me to whatever command
dialog: and control structure we have left
dialog: in this country, I would really
dialog: appreciate it.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Sir! Yes, sir, I- uh, hold on!
text: She bolts from her seat...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM
text: A beat. The President looks to Cale.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER

scene_heading: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - CONFERENCE ROOM (FLYING) - MORNING
text: The Vice President, getting a quiet pep-talk from his Chief

text: Interrupted as Jenna bursts in, out of breath!
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: I told you we weren't to be disturbed-

speaker_heading: JENNA

speaker_heading: EVERETT (0.S.)

text: Bishop thinks. Into the radio:
speaker_heading: BISHOP

scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER

scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND

scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER

speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Cale?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Miss Finnerty?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: John, what are you doing in there?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Long story, sir. They've taken the
text: building and are holding hostages.
dialog: We evaded them so far, but that won't
dialog: last, so not to put too fine a point
dialog: on it, but this is the part where
dialog: you come in here and save us.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: We're working on several different
dialog: scenarios, but in the meantime, you
dialog: need to get the President out. Can
dialog: you get to the basement?
text: Cale looks to Sawyer, who nods.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Good. There's a series of tunnels
text: that lead out to the street. JFK
dialog: used them to sneak Marilyn in.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I thought those were a myth.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Actually, they're not.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Donnie's gonna be pissed...
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You get to the basement, and I'll
dialog: lead you to the tunnels.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: And when I get him out, you're gonna
dialog: come in and get the hostages, right?
text: Finnerty and Raphelson exchange a look.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: They have my daughter. Tell me you
dialog: have a plan to save her.
text: Finnerty takes a breath.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: We will get to her, but you have to
dialog: get the President to safety. This
dialog: is the most important thing you will
dialog: ever do.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You want me to leave my child?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I want you to do your sworn duty and
dialog: protect the President of the United
dialog: States!
text: DING! The Elevator ARRIVING on the Third Floor! Sawyer's
text: eyes go wide as he motions to the hallway - they're coming.
text: Cale hangs up on her.
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Cale? Cale!
text: She's just met with static.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
text: The door creaks open and CHEN and EVERETT creep into the
text: room, rifles up. They scan the room - seemingly empty.
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: Mr. President?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: We have no desire to harm you or
dialog: your companion. Please come quietly.
text: Chen points to the bed - Cale's blood spattered SHOE poking
text: out from the far side. He gives Everett a hand signal, you
dialog: go right, I go left.
speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: The sooner you come with us, the
dialog: sooner this will be over.
text: He springs around the bed weapon up to find...
text: Just the shoe sitting there. Everett blinks. A decoy. And
text: then the wardrobe door flies open behind him and
dialog: 64.
text: CALE leaps out, knife in hand, stabbing him in the back!
text: Everett screams and pulls the trigger and the room is filled
text: with GUNFIRE! Chen goes down, riddled with bullets!
text: Everett charges backwards, trying to throw Cale off! Smashing
text: him back through the door, charging across the West Sitting
dialog: Hall and into
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Everett slams Cale back against the island and rips the knife
text: out of his back, spinning to face him!
text: Cale grabs a pan and hurls it at Everett's head, who ducks
text: and slashes, catching Cale across the forearm!
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: Ranger choke-hold? You one of those
dialog: Army pussies?
text: He slashes again as Cale hurls a pot at him!
speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: We used to use faggots like you for
dialog: target practice!
text: Cale jumps up and brings the whole fucking pot rack down on
text: Everett's head! Everett reeling, Cale grabs a cutting board
text: and whacks Everett across the face!
text: Everett drops the knife and they grapple, but Everett's
dialog: getting the upper hand...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (0.S.)
dialog: Freeze!
text: They both look - in the doorway, the President of the United
text: States, holding the gun on them.
text: Everett doesn't freeze. In fact, he smiles and continues to
text: beat the ever loving shit out of Cale. Sawyer, trying to
dialog: get a clear line of sight...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: What- what do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Shoot him!
text: Sawyer's finger tightens on the trigger, but Everett gets
text: his arm around Cale's neck and hauls him in front of him,
dialog: using him like a human shield...
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait not, now! Don't shoot now!
text: Sawyer moving the gun around, trying to get a clear shot...
text: Cale rams his head back into Everett's nose - SNAP! Everett
text: screams and Cale dives clear.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now!
text: BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Sawyer shoots and Everett is blown backwards
text: off his feet! He lands in a heap, dead.
text: Cale collapses against the counter, gasping. Sawyer lowers
text: the gun. Breathing hard. Numb. They both sink to the floor.
text: Water sprays up form the sink, where a bullet struck it.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Three bullets...?
text: Sawyer looks over at him.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You had to use all three bullets?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I saved your life and you're giving
dialog: me notes?
text: Cale pulls himself to his feet.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: We have to conserve ammo...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I was trying to conserve people.
dialog: You're welcome, by the way.
text: Cale kneels down next to Everett's body, dialing the satphone.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: (into satphone)
dialog: We have two dead bad guys up here.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: Raphelson and the others look up as Cale's voice comes through
text: the speaker. Finnerty rushes to grab the phone.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Describe them.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Cale rolls Everett's body over, searching him.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Both Americans, well trained,
text: proficient with small arms, hand to
dialog: hand combat and... oh, shit.
text: He's rolled up Everett's sleeve to expose a tattoo of a
text: Screaming Eagle.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY (0.S.)
dialog: Cale?
text: But Cale HANGS UP the phone, severing the connection. Looks
text: at the President, quietly. Concerned.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Sir, this is a Special Forces tattoo.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: The army's doing this?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Maybe. They were taking orders from
dialog: your Head of Secret Service, right?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: It's a coup de'tat...
text: Cale games it out in his head...
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: No. If they wanted you dead, you'd
dialog: be dead. This is something else.
text: Sawyer nods. Looking at him.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I didn't know they had your daughter.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: (pause)
dialog: If I thought turning myself over to
dialog: them would save her, I'd do it. But
dialog: we both know that's not how these
dialog: people work.
text: Cale stops, noticing BLOOD on Sawyer's shirt. Alarmed, he
text: leans down and begins patting him down.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Are you hit?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: (searching for a wound)
dialog: Have you been shot, sir?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: (pushes him away)
dialog: No! No, it's the other guy's blood
dialog: from the bedroom- I got splattered.
text: Cale steps back, relieved. Looks at Sawyer. The President
text: of the United States, in his care.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm going to get you out of here.
text: He extends a hand to Sawyer and pulls him to his feet. Grabs
text: Everett's MP-5 and checks the load.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to get to the basement.
text: They head for the West Sitting Hall...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: Finnerty, talking to the Communications Officer.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Get him back on the line!
text: Agent Kellerman re-enters the Bunker and pulls her aside.
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN
dialog: Muriel Bishop left the country four
dialog: days ago, bought a one way ticket to
dialog: Venezuela. Non-extradition.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Pull phone records, see if the
dialog: Venezuelan government was in contact
dialog: with either of them in the last two
dialog: years. Loop in NSA, they might have
text: had a tap on Bishop's phone.
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN
dialog: There's something else.
text: He hands her a sheet of paper. Finnerty scans it, then takes
text: a deep breath. Turns to address the room and the viewscreens.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, we
dialog: have a problem.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Another one?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: The list of prisoners Bishop wants
dialog: released; they're not all in the US.
dialog: Gerry Burke is former Sein Fein and
dialog: is being held in London, Galezowski
dialog: is a Basque separatist, he's in France-
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Well, I'm sure all these countries
dialog: would cooperate if-
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
text: Samir Al-Hafra's being held in Iran.
dialog: State Department's already reached
text: out, but they won't let him go.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: What did Al-Hafra do?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Tried to assassinate their President.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: There's a lot of that going around.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: It doesn't make sense. Why these
dialog: prisoners? What do they have in
dialog: common? A Basque separatist, an
dialog: Irish revolutionary--what's Krieger?
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN
dialog: Former MOSAAD.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: None of these guys are high value
dialog: targets, we've got bigger names
text: sitting in Guantanamo right now.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: You think it's a diversion.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I think it's something.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Tell State to try again. Linked or
dialog: not, we either need to release these
dialog: people or kick in the door in the
dialog: next 43 minutes, otherwise Bishop's
dialog: going to start executing hostages on
dialog: national TV.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: If the Iranians won't give up Al-
dialog: Hafra, maybe we go get him.
text: They look to the VP's viewscreen.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND (CONT'D)
dialog: The Nimitz is in the Gulf, they have
text: a detachment of SEALS onboard.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: If we send men into Iran to get Al-
dialog: Hafra, we're committing an act of
dialog: war. Do you really want that on our
dialog: plate this morning too?
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: You don't think we're at war? Take
dialog: a look around you. Come on Eli,
dialog: Iran's our enemy, you said it yourself-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Just because I don't want to sign a
dialog: treaty with them doesn't mean I think
dialog: it's a good idea to invade! We need
dialog: to hold this together.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Colonel, I want the SEALS briefed
dialog: and prepped for an assault on the
dialog: prison if we give the word.
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: Respectfully, sir, only the President
dialog: can give that order-
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
text: The President is behind enemy lines
dialog: and compromised. I'm assembling the
text: cabinet now to invoke the 25th.
text: Raphelson stares at him, in shock.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: The President's still alive... You
dialog: won't get the votes...
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Wallace assures me I will. We've
dialog: already done the head count.
dialog: (to Colonel Janowitz)
dialog: It'll take about ten more minutes to
dialog: get everyone together. How long
dialog: till Delta Force arrives?
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: They'll be here in fifteen minutes.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: By the time they land, I'll be able
dialog: to give them the go order.

speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I'm having a firewall problem...
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You know what happens when they catch

speaker_heading: BISHOP

speaker_heading: TYLER

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Shit.

speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: It would be a lot easier if you
dialog: brought me that passcode.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: So noted. Everett, did you find
dialog: anything in the residence? Everett?
text: No response. Bishop frowns. Tyler, seeing something on his

speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I have movement. Central elevator,
dialog: coming down from the residence-
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: It's them. Can you stop it between
dialog: floors?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (typing)
dialog: Absolutely. Halted between two and
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Lock it up, then send a team to--
dialog: actually scratch that. Stenz, would
dialog: you be so kind as to bring me the
dialog: President of the United States?
dialog: 72.
text: Stenz hefts his M4 rifle with a grin and heads for the door...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE FLOOR - CENTER HALL - MORNING

speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: (into radio)

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE FLOOR - CENTER HALL - MORNING
text: Stenz hears the machinery moving and the elevator car comes
text: to a halt on their floor. Weapons up, ready to for a

text: The car is empty. Stenz keys his radio:
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: It's a decoy! They're still upstairs!
text: He books for the stairwell, his team following. As they
dialog: bound upstairs...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTRAL ELEVATOR SHAFT - MORNING
text: Grimy and disgusting. Everything covered with grease. Cale
text: and Sawyer are shimmying down a narrow service ladder to the

speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I'm surprised nobody put this on the
dialog: tour.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I'll look into it.
text: They reach the recessed bottom of the shaft. Standing among

scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: Finnerty snatches up the phone. INTERCUT:

speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CALE
text: Relatively. We're at the base of

speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You mean in the elevator?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Not so much, no.
text: Finnerty checks the blueprints.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Okay. Okay, you need to pry the
text: doors open and get across the hall
dialog: to the stairwell - that'll lead you
text: down to the catacombs.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: How are we going to open the door?
text: The President holds up a butcher knife from upstairs. Cale
text: smiles and takes it. Pries open the elevator doors a crack.
text: He STOPS. Footsteps on the hall. Someone rushing past
text: pushing a dolly loaded with wooden crates. The stamp on the
text: side says "SURFACE TO AIR"...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: That can't be good.
text: Cale waits for the sound to recede, then slides open the
text: doors the rest of the way. Climbing out into the
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: A low lit hall, filled with boxes. This is the Storage Level.
text: Cale, covered in grease. He pulls the similarly filthy

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - THIRD FLOOR - MORNING
text: Stenz and his team sprint into the Main Room. Nothing.

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: How do we open the garage door-

speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: Mr. Speaker, I'm Commander Paul

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Is this something you threw together
dialog: in the last half hour?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: No, sir, this is long standing.
dialog: We've run drills on this.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You've run drills on assaulting the

dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: Ma'am, we've run drills on everything.
dialog: Initially we thought we'd go in
dialog: through the tunnels, but you say

text: A VOICE from behind them speaks up:
speaker_heading: TED (0.S.
dialog: Yes, but I-I-I- may have a solution

speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: FINNERTY

dialog: I'm from Homeland, I come up with
dialog: different ways to blow things up.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: How do you get a job like that, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You really don't want to know. But
dialog: I think the devices in the tunnels
dialog: can be defeated.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: You think.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hypothetically, yes.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: Hypothetical doesn't cut it. Bishop's
dialog: going to start executing hostages in
dialog: 18 minutes, so we're going to go in
text: over the top.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: (points to blueprints)
dialog: We're going to land two Blackhawks
dialog: on the North and South Lawn here and
dialog: here, make them have to defend both
dialog: sides. Our guess is Command and
dialog: Control is located somewhere in the
dialog: West Wing, so we make that the choke
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What about the approach?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: Satellite shows they only have anti-
text: tank capabilities on the roof, no
dialog: surface to air missiles, nothing
dialog: that can lock on to an aircraft. We
dialog: go in fast and hard, hose down the
text: roof, then make it a ground war.
dialog: From the Communications Desk:
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: I have the President of the United

speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON
dialog: Mr. President.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: I'd first like to take a moment of

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: With all due respect, sir, we don't
text: have time for a moment of silence.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Then let me ask this; why is this
dialog: option better than scrambling a couple
text: of F-15s out of Andrews and putting
dialog: a few sidewinders up Bishop's ass?
text: Raphelson blinks.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: You want to call in an air strike on
dialog: the White House?
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: I want an option that doesn't risk

dialog: and women.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: And what about the hostages, sir?
dialog: What are they, collateral damage?
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: They're dead anyway if this fails.
text: We level the White House with an air
dialog: strike, not only will we end this,
dialog: but we will show the world that we
dialog: will go to any lengths to combat
dialog: terrorism, both foreign and domestic.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: You would be sending a very clear
dialog: message, sir...
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Alvy, please, don't do this-
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Mr. Speaker, you are addressing the

speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON

scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
dialog: Yes, Commander?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER CAMERON

text: Raphelson, Finnerty, and the others staring at the Vice

scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: (softly)
dialog: We have confirmation of ground impact.
text: Silence. Raphelson turns away. Finnerty looks for something
text: to punch. No one knows what to say.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: We're going to need to swear you in,
dialog: sir.
text: It takes Raphelson a moment to realize she's looking at him.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: No. If President Sawyer's still
dialog: alive in there-
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: It doesn't matter. Executive power
dialog: passed to the Vice President when he
dialog: was sworn in, which means... the
dialog: office now passes to you.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Jesus Christ...
text: The phone rings. Finnerty punches it through on speaker.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Did you get my message?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Name calling aside, our timetable
dialog: still stands. You have...
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Six minutes to our deadline.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: What do you want these prisoners
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Not your concern-
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Why are you doing this?
text: Raphelson puts a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: We need more time, Mr. Bishop. We
dialog: can't release all the prisoners in
dialog: six minutes, one them's in Iran, for
dialog: Chrissakes!
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Well, then you better go get him.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: It's not that simple-
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: It is exactly that simple. In fact,
dialog: let me show you how simple it is -
dialog: you're originally from Denver,
dialog: Colorado, is that right Mr. Speaker?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: If I don't have confirmation in the
dialog: next six minutes that you are
text: liberating Sadaam Al-Hafra from his
dialog: prison, in addition to executing
dialog: hostages here, I will fire a missile
dialog: on downtown Denver. Sound fair?
text: Raphelson clenching his fists so hard they're shaking...
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Six minutes, sir.
text: Bishop breaks the connection.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Interrupted as STENZ strides into the Oval, cut and bloody.
speaker_heading: STENZ
text: He's still alive.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: The tourist. He killed Mulchay and
text: Konner on the roof.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Alone?
text: Stenz nods. Bishop thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe he's not. Who comes on a tour
dialog: alone?
text: A beat. Bishop grabs the walkie.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Tyler, can you stream me video of
dialog: everyone who came in for the tour
dialog: this morning?
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: Silence. Raphelson exhales. Looks up at the others.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I know what it looks like. But I
dialog: swear to you, we're not beaten yet.
dialog: Colonel, get me the base commander
dialog: at Andrews.
text: Finnerty looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Sir?
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: General Pierce is on the line, sir.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: General, this is Eli Raphelson. The
dialog: Vice President had instructed you to
text: fuel three fully loaded F-15s with a
dialog: target package for the White House,
dialog: is that correct?
speaker_heading: GENERAL PIECRE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I want you to launch those planes,
dialog: General.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PIECRE
dialog: Roger that, sir. Tower, you are
text: clear to launch.
text: We hear him giving more orders as Finnerty looks at Raphelson,
text: stunned.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Mr. Speaker-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: We have to end this, Carol. We give
dialog: him more time, who knows how many
dialog: more weapons systems they can control?
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: And the White House?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Look what we've already been through

scene_heading: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bishop and Stenz, scrolling through security footage...
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: There.
text: Bishop stops it - the IMAGE OF CALE AND EMILY coming in,
text: Emily shrugging off Cale's embrace. Father and daughter.
speaker_heading: STENZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I know her. We have her in the
dialog: SitRoom.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Bring her here.
scene_heading: INT. SITUATION ROOM - MORNING
text: Emily sits with the Tour Guide. A small commotion near the
text: front of the room. Emily looks up to see Stenz standing in
text: the doorway. He points to her.
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: Come on pretty, we got a date.
text: The others shrink away from him.
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: What are you going to do to her?
text: Stenz ignores this. Moves for Emily. Donnie steps between
text: them, using every last bit of courage he has.
speaker_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to have to go through
dialog: me.
dialog: 116.
text: Stenz pauses. Seems to consider this for a moment. Then
text: pulls out his pistol and SHOOTS Donnie in the stomach!
text: Emily screams. Donnie falls. Stenz grabs Emily and drags
dialog: her from the room...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING
text: Deserted hallways. Stenz pulls Emily along, on their way to
dialog: the Oval Office.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You're going to go to jail for that.
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: Yeah? Who's gonna make me?
text: Emily looks at him.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Who did that to your face?
text: Pissed, Stenz pushes her along...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: Birds are in the air, sir! Time to
dialog: target is 15 minutes!
text: He sets the wall clock to count it down...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bishop's watch beeps. The deadline up. He picks up the
text: phone. INTERCUT with the Pentagon:
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Your time is up, gentlemen.
text: Finnerty slides Raphelson a note "NEED TO BUY TIME".
text: Raphelson takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: We'll give you what you want.
dialog: (to Colonel Janowitz)
dialog: Tell the SEAL Commander the Iranian
dialog: incursion is a go.
text: As he says this, he shakes his head at Janowitz - don't do
text: it. Finnerty, playing along:
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: But sir, the Peace Accord-
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: That's an order!
text: Bishop smiles.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Very good. We'll wait for
dialog: confirmation the prisoners have been
dialog: freed.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: And then?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Then you will receive further
dialog: instructions. You made the right
dialog: choice, Mr. President.
text: They hear Bishop break the connection. Pan up to the
text: airstrike countdown clock on the wall. 14 MINUTES...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: As Bishop hangs up, Stenz enters with Emily. She looks
text: around. The actual Oval Office. And a man sitting behind
text: the Resolute Desk. Not the President. He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Hi there, sweetie. Let's have a
dialog: conversation about you and your Dad...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - FLOWER SHOP - MORNING
text: The room in the basement where all of the floral arrangements
text: are put together. Deserted. Flowers lay strewn about the
text: different tables. The sound of GLASS breaking.
text: Cale slides in through a window. Cradling his machine gun.
text: Torn and bloody. He limps over to one of the tables. Finds
text: a roll of packing tape. Tries to wrap it around the bullet
text: wound in his shoulder. Stifles a scream as he does so.
text: He takes a breath. Gathering himself. Moves to the door.
text: Looks out into the hall. The stairwell down to the catacombs
text: down to the left. He moves for it...
text: The White house PUBLIC ADDRESS system crackles on:
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (0.S.)
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Cale!
text: His voice echoes throughout the complex. Cale blinks - Bishop
dialog: knows his name.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You've proved to be a quite a nuisance
dialog: this morning, so I wanted to let you
dialog: know that I'm sitting here with
dialog: someone who wants to say hello. Say
dialog: hello, Sweetie!
speaker_heading: EMILY (0.S.)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: Cale's face - Oh, Jesus, no.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (0.S.)
dialog: Would you like to tell your father
dialog: what I'm holding in my hand?
speaker_heading: EMILY (0.S.)
text: A gun.
text: Oh God. Cale begins to sprint-limp through the hallway.
text: Doesn't even know where he's going, just trying to get to
dialog: the source of the voices...
speaker_heading: BISHOP (0.S.)
dialog: Is there anything you'd like to say
dialog: to him before we do this?
speaker_heading: EMILY (0.S.)
dialog: They're holding forty of us in the
dialog: Situation Room-
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bishop claps a hand over Emily's mouth. Gives her a smile.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Not like that.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - BASEMENT HALL - MORNING
text: Cale looking at his cheap White House Map, desperately
text: scanning it for the location to the Situation Room...
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Mr. Cale, I'm going to count to three.
dialog: Wherever you are, I advise you to
dialog: start trying to signal one of my
dialog: men, because if they don't have you
dialog: in their custody by the time I reach
dialog: three, I'm going to shoot your little
dialog: girl in the stomach. One...
text: Cale can't believe it, it's all happening too fast...
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Two...
text: Cale opens his mouth to scream, but
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, over here! Here!
text: Footsteps go running towards the voice - what the hell?
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: ...Three.
text: A beat. Bishop looks Emily in the eye.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess Daddy doesn't love you after
dialog: all.
text: Stenz raises his weapon when the radio squawks:
speaker_heading: MOTTS (0.S.)
dialog: (through radio)
dialog: We have him, sir.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Cale?
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR - MORNING
speaker_heading: MOTTS
dialog: No, sir. The President.
text: Motts and another man stand with PRESIDENT SAWYER who has
text: just surrendered himself. INTERCUT:
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Well, that changes things. Get him
dialog: up here.
text: They march Sawyer up the center stairs. Cale watches from
text: around the corner. He could shoot, but what if he hit Sawyer?
text: What if that made them kill Emily? He watches them go,
text: powerless. Curses. Pulls out the satphone...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: Finnerty snatches up the phone. INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: They have the President.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Cale, you have to get out of there.
dialog: Help's not coming.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Didn't you hear what I said-
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: They killed the Vice President. An
dialog: air strike's been called in on the
dialog: White House.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: No-
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Yes. You have to go.
text: Cale takes a breath.
speaker_heading: CALE
text: They still have hostages. They still
dialog: have Emily.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Then you have 12 minutes to figure
dialog: out a way to get them out.
text: Cale doesn't respond. He's staring across the hall at the
dialog: painting of the White House in 1814...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Motts leads President Sawyer into his own Oval Office. He
text: stops in the door to see Bishop sitting behind his desk.
dialog: 121.
text: Emily sits in the corner, guarded by Stenz. Motts offers up
text: a pistol to Bishop.
speaker_heading: MOTTS
dialog: He had this on him.
text: Bishop takes the gun, tsk-tsking him.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Whatever happened to the pen is
dialog: mightier than the sword?
text: Sawyer looks at him.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: As President of the United States, I
dialog: want you to know that this comes
dialog: with the full weight, power, and
dialog: authority of my office - Fuck you.
text: Bishop smiles. President Sawyer looks to Emily.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
text: She gives him a tight nod.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: I made sure your family wasn't here
dialog: for this. So now I want you to do
dialog: something for me. Sit.
text: Sawyer doesn't move. Motts kicks him in the back of the
text: knee, driving Sawyer into a chair.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Each President is given a twelve
dialog: digit passcode, it changes every
dialog: three months. I need yours.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: It won't get you access to the weapons
dialog: systems-
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: It's not the weapons systems I'm
dialog: after, sir.
text: Sawyer stares at him. Realizing:
dialog: 122.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: You're data-farming? That's what
dialog: this is all about?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: You say that like it's some minor
dialog: goal. This building contains more
dialog: critical information onsite than any
dialog: other structure in the world. Defense
dialog: allocations, national security
dialog: protocols, troop locations and
dialog: movements in three separate ongoing
dialog: wars. Do you even comprehend what
dialog: those secrets are worth? We'll open
dialog: the bidding at 100 billion. I think
dialog: the Chinese will ultimately take it,
dialog: but the Russians will give them a
dialog: run for their money.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: What? Did you think we were here
dialog: for you? Now. The passcode.
dialog: The President can't believe it.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: You're did all this for money?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: I have a tumor in my head that's
dialog: supposed to kill me before Arbor
dialog: Day. Who's going to take care of my
dialog: family, Mr. President? You?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: And your solution is to throw away
dialog: decades of service to this country?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Maybe spending the last twenty-five
dialog: years seeing what vain petty people
dialog: you are all helped. This country's
dialog: sole operating principal for the
dialog: last two hundred years has been "Get
dialog: as much as you can for yourself and
dialog: screw the other guy." So after twenty-
dialog: five years, that's what I'm doing,
dialog: Mr. President. I'm getting mine.
dialog: The American Way.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: What about your kids? What will
dialog: they think when you're gone?
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Money's the most important thing in
dialog: this country, right? Well, they're
text: about to have a lot of it.
dialog: (levels the gun)
text: Now. The passcode.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: You know I can't.
text: Bishop sighs and points the gun at Emily.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Do we really have to do this again?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: If I give it to you, our enemies
dialog: will know everything.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Just the ones who can pay.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Our country will be over.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: There comes a day when all empires
dialog: must fall, Mr. President.
dialog: (cocks the gun)
dialog: I'm going to count to three...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: I can't give it to him, you understand-
text: WHAP! Stenz pistol-whips the President in the mouth! He
text: spits blood. Emily looks at him. Locks eyes.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: One...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Two...
text: Emily closes her eyes...
dialog: 124.
text: A KLAXON goes off. Sounding throughout the complex.
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: What the hell?
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING
text: Tyler, staring at his screen in disbelief. Into the radio:
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I have thermal alarms going off in
dialog: two- wait, no, three different
dialog: locations! Third floor kitchen,
dialog: second floor hall, second floor East
dialog: Bedroom-
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (to President Sawyer)
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: It means your father just set fire
dialog: to the White House.
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Send teams to put them out, we can't
dialog: let the building go up yet-
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: We don't have teams anymore, sir!
speaker_heading: BISHOP
text: Then peel men off the Situation Room,
dialog: this building's a two hundred year
dialog: old tinderbox!
text: A new alarm wails.
speaker_heading: TYLER (0.S.)
dialog: (through radio)
dialog: Fourth Alarm! Fire in the Lincoln
dialog: Bedroom!
text: As if on cue, the SPRINKLERS go off above them! Drenching
text: everyone in the Oval Office.
text: Bishop, furious, tosses Stenz and M4 rifle.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Kill him.
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: With pleasure.
text: He turns and bolts for the room. Bishop, into the walkie:
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Shut those off!
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: Colonel Janowitz, in contact with the F-15's...
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: Six minutes to target, sir!
scene_heading: AGENT KELLERMAN
dialog: Sir, you need to see this...
text: He turns the sound up on CNN - which now shows smoke pouring
text: out of the Second and Third floor of the White House!
speaker_heading: CNN NEWSCASTER
text: Smoke began pouring from the structure
dialog: minutes ago, leading us to believe
dialog: that the upper floors of the White

text: Finnerty looks to Raphelson.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: It's Cale.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - BASEMENT CORRIDORS - MORNING
text: The door to the Situation Room opens and TWO MEN barrel out
text: of it, running to the stairs, turning the corner to find
text: Cale, who opens up with the machine gun! The men fall!
text: Cale races towards the Sit Room door. Humphries steps out
text: FIRING, and Cale dives to the ground, spraying back!
text: A waterford crystal vase explodes in the hallway as Cale
text: rolls sideways, strafing the door! Humphries goes down
text: screaming, bullets punching through his legs! Cale is up
dialog: and runs into
scene_heading: INT. SITUATION ROOM - MORNING
text: He pushes through the hostages, finding the wounded Tour
text: Guide being tended to on the floor.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Where is she?
scene_heading: DONNIE THE GUIDE
dialog: They took her to the Oval Office!
text: Cale looks around to the others.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: There's an air strike coming! Get
dialog: everyone out of here now!
text: Total panic now. People screaming, pushing through doors!
text: Cale running with them...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
text: Raphelson, eyes glued to the television.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Something's happening in there! We

scene_heading: EXT. VIRGINIA SKIES - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - BASEMENT CORRIDORS - MORNING
text: As people pour out of the SitRoom, Cale runs for the West
text: stairs, bounding up them, to the First Floor. Rounding a
dialog: corner into
text: WHAM! A bloody fist to the face again!
text: Stenz. Cale's gun goes sprawling. Stenz sends another rib-
text: cracking punch to his gut, sending him hurtling back into
dialog: the Press Room!
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: I'm gonna enjoy this...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bishop raises his gun and BLAM! SHOOTS the President in the
text: leg! Sawyer screams, doubling over!
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: That's the femoral artery. Unless I
dialog: stop it, you're going to bleed out
dialog: in that chair. What's the code?
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: ON CNN - The hostages now STREAMING out of the building across

scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: Three minutes, sir!

dialog: (to Raphelson)
dialog: Give the man a chance!
scene_heading: EXT. WEST COLONNADE - MORNING
text: SMASH! Cale is HURLED through the double glass doors by the

text: heap. Stenz, advancing on him...
speaker_heading: STENZ
dialog: Your daughter says you're going to
dialog: take me to jail. So are you?
text: Stenz KICKS HIM. Cale grunts as the force of it propels him
text: into a column. Stenz pulls a knife.
speaker_heading: STENZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna carve my fucking name into
dialog: your chest.
text: He leans down as Cale rolls and smashes both feet into Stenz's
text: left knee! The knee BUCKLES and Stenz screams, falling!
text: Cale yanks something from his satchel and slams it into
text: Stenz's chest. Stenz looks - it's the BOMB from the tunnels.
text: His eyes lock with Cale.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: No jail for you.
text: He pulls all six green wires and RUNS. Stenz screams a second
text: before he BLOWS APART...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
text: ON CNN - the ENTIRE WEST COLONNADE EXPLODES! Chunks of pillar
text: and roof are blasted out as far as the street!
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: CNN NEWSCASTER

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bishop, Sawyer, and Emily are thrown to the ground as the

scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER

dialog: raises it to kill --
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: No! Wait! I'1l give you the code!
text: Motts looks at Bishop, who goes to his laptop.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Now, or she dies.

scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: 7. 3. 5. 4...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - FIRST FLOOR - MORNING
text: Cale stares at the twisted flaming destruction between him
dialog: and the West Wing - no way to get to Emily now. All he's
text: got left is his pistol. Pops the clip. Looks.
speaker_heading: CALE
text: Three bullets.
text: Snaps it back. Mind racing.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Think, goddammit, think!
text: His eyes fall onto a very particular doorway that he went
dialog: through once before in the film...
dialog: 129.
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: For the love of God, sir, you have

speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What if it's a trick?
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: 3. 9. 4...
text: He doubles over as a coughing fit overtakes him. Spitting
dialog: up more blood.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: What's the last number! Tell me!
text: The President tries to speak, but all that comes out is a
text: wheeze. Bishop curses and runs over to him. Kneeling down
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: The last number. Now.
text: Sawyer mumbling something...
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: He leans down, putting his ear to the President's mouth...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: I said, I'm sticking with the pen.
text: And he pulls the treaty signing PEN from his coat and STABS
dialog: BISHOP in the neck with it!
text: Bishop screams, rearing back against the Resolute Desk clawing
text: at his neck. As Motts levels his gun to kill Emily and the

dialog: time to see
text: A BLACK SUV - Ripping through the Rose Garden, coming straight
text: for them. Cale at the wheel.
text: We barely has time to process what's about to happen before
dialog: 130.
text: The SUV smashes THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW and INTO THE OVAL
text: OFFICE! Bishop diving out of the way, the desk obliterated

dialog: crushing him!
text: Water gushes from burst pipes and sparks shoot from sockets!

scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Bishop tears the pen from his neck and swings his arms out
text: wildly, grabbing Emily up as Cale collapses out of the vehicle
dialog: into the ruined office of the Chief Executive!
text: Bishop presses the gun to Emily's head, as Cale brings his
dialog: own pistol up, training it on him!
text: Silence. Mexican stand-off. Neither man moving. In the
text: distance, the roar of jet engines approaching...
text: Bishop opens his mouth.
speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: I'm going to count to-
text: BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Cale pulls the trigger. Bishop pitches
text: back over, holes in his chest.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Three.
text: Cale falls to his knees as Emily runs to him. Wrapping her
text: arms around him.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Daddy!
dialog: 131.
text: Cale hugs her tight right back...
scene_heading: EXT. F-15'S (FLYING) - MORNING
text: Roaring over the Potomac, coming up on the White House...
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: 10 seconds, go/no go!
text: Raphelson closes his eyes. God forgive him.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Go.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Cale turns to the hole in the wall to see the jets
text: approaching. Shoving Emily towards it. Too weak to follow.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Run, honey!
text: She looks back at him.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go, I'm right behind you!
text: Emily looks up at the jets, and suddenly knows what's about
text: to happen. She scoops up the fallen American Flag on the
text: office floor and RUNS.
text: Cale collapses to the floor. Watching her go. At least
dialog: she'll be safe...
scene_heading: INT. F-15 COCKPIT (FLYING) - MORNING
text: The PILOT arming the weapons systems, finger moving to the
dialog: trigger...
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Dropping in 5, 4, 3...
text: He squints as he sees
text: A LITTLE GIRL on the White House lawn. Twirling, doing a
text: flag girl routine. Red, white, and blue fluttering in the
dialog: breeze.
speaker_heading: PILOT (CONT'D)
dialog: Abort, abort, abort!
dialog: 132.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
text: The F-15's break formation, screaming over the structure!
text: Weapons intact.
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: We have negative impact, repeat, no
text: weapons released on target.
text: Raphelson opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What?
text: Janowitz listening to the phone, then:
scene_heading: COLONEL JANOWITZ
dialog: Sir, we are getting multiple reports
dialog: in now that the hostages have reached
text: the police barricades and are saying
dialog: that Castle has been retaken. I...
dialog: (pause; listens)
text: The White House is secure.
text: The entire room BURSTS INTO CHEERS! Hugs and tears!
text: Raphelson, stunned. Finnerty squeezes his hand. It's over.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Emily steps back into the wreckage of the Oval to find her
text: father propped up against the remains of the desk. He smiles
text: at her. She shrugs, a little self conscious.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You wanted to see my flag twirling...
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You were beautiful, baby. You saved
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You came back for me.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Always.
text: She hugs him again. Coughing from the other side of the
text: room. They look. Sawyer, watching them. Smiling. Coughs.
dialog: 133.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Did you drive a car through my office?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: We have doors, you know.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: A lot more now.
text: The President laughs.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Gonna take awhile to fix this place
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You can come stay with us.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah.
text: He hugs her close. Outside on the lawn, various emergency
text: vehicles gather and choppers land.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Medic! We need a medic in here!
text: A MEDICAL TEAM rushes in. Cale and Emily step back as they
text: swarm the President. Tasking his vitals, starting an IV...
text: Cale takes an offered blanket and wraps it around Emily's
text: shoulders and they step out onto
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ROSE GARDEN - MORNING
text: Fire helicopters hover, dousing the top two floors of the
text: White House with fire-retardent foam. Dozens of news choppers
text: circle. Marines set a perimeter around the building.
text: Cale and Emily walk through the fray, almost forgotten.
dialog: Until
speaker_heading: FINNERTY (0.S.)
dialog: Cale!
dialog: 134.
text: Cale turns to see Finnerty step off a helicopter. Their
text: eyes meet. So different than they were a few hours ago.
text: Smiling as she approaches.
text: For a moment they don't even know what to say. Then Finnerty
text: steps forward and hugs him. Places a small kiss on his cheek.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So, does he have the job?
text: Finnerty looks over to the gurney carrying the President out
text: of the Oval, then smiles.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: That depends. Does he have any
dialog: references?
text: Behind her, Cale sees Raphelson step off a chopper. Flanked
text: by MILITARY AIDES, he marches grim faced towards the White
dialog: House.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: He could have turned back the air
dialog: strike and didn't. He's taking it
dialog: hard. And...
text: She hesitates.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: We just found out the fifty million
dialog: in Bishop's account came from an
dialog: Iranian cut-out. This was state
dialog: sponsored terrorism.
text: Cale watches Raphelson step through the ruined facade into
text: what's left of the Oval Office.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: What's he going to do?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Retaliate.
dialog: 135.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING
text: Raphelson marches through the ruined halls. Stepping through
text: glass and debris, over fallen bodies.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Somebody clean those up.
dialog: Headed for...
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY
text: Empty, now that the terrorists are gone. Raphelson steps
text: over Humphries body as he enters. Exhales.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: God forgive us for what we are about
dialog: to do.
text: He looks to the NAVAL AIDE carrying the Nuclear Football.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Open it.
speaker_heading: NAVAL AIDE
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Our country has been attacked by a
dialog: rogue nuclear state, I have discussed
dialog: it with my advisors and this is going
dialog: to be our course of response; my
dialog: Presidential Authorization Code is
text: 9983452776301, now open the football.
text: The Naval Aide programs the code into the keypad lock. The
text: tumblers click. Opens. Inside the Nuclear Football, a
text: manilla envelope, a phone handset with a red light, and a
text: small thumb-pad.
speaker_heading: NAVAL AIDE
dialog: Place your finger on the pad, sir.
text: Raphelson does. A pin-prick draws a drop of blood.
speaker_heading: NAVAL AIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: DNA verification, shouldn't take
text: more than a few seconds.
text: The light on the handset turns green. The Naval Aide picks
text: up the phone and hands it to Raphelson.
dialog: 136.
speaker_heading: NAVAL AIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a direct line to CentCom -
dialog: would you please read the target
dialog: package into the phone, sir?
text: The Aide opens the manilla folder for him and Raphelson reads.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: This is the President. Target package
dialog: is as follows - the cities of Tehran,
dialog: Mashhad, Isfahan, and Tabriz.
dialog: From the football:
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Target package is confirmed, sir.
dialog: The release of nuclear weapons falls
dialog: under the two man rule - the Secretary
dialog: of Defense must confirm your orders
dialog: in order to launch.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: The Secretary of Defense went down
dialog: on Air Force One. I am here with
dialog: the Assistant Secretary who was held
text: hostage in the White House. Mr.
dialog: Secretary?
text: He offers the phone to a SHORT BALDING MAN who looks
text: terrified. A beat. The Assistant Secretary takes it.
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Secretary, do you confirm the
dialog: President's orders?
scene_heading: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: I do, sir.
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Will you please read me your
dialog: corresponding launch codes
dialog: alphanumerically?
text: Raphelson cracks open a plastic laminated card - "The Biscuit"
text: which contains the launch codes. Reading.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Bravo Victor Tango Seven Niner Zulu
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Secretary?
dialog: 137.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: Bravo Victor Tango Seven Niner Zulu
dialog: Charlie. I concur, sir.
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. President, you are authorizing
dialog: the release of strategic thermonuclear
dialog: weapons on the country of Iran. Do
dialog: you so confirm these orders?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Missiles are being spun up. We will
dialog: need final launch confirmation in
dialog: two minutes-
speaker_heading: six? CALE (0.S.)
dialog: ir?
text: This voice from the door. John Cale. Raphelson blinks.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: John. Jesus. Ladies and Gentleman,
dialog: this is John Cale, the hero of the
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I need a moment alone with the
dialog: Speaker.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Can it wait?
dialog: (gestures to the
dialog: football)
dialog: We're a little busy here-
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Bishop had help, sir. Someone on
dialog: the outside.
text: Raphelson looks at him.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Give us the room.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Sir-
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: He's my Secret Service, for
dialog: Chrissakes.
text: Fair enough. The others file out. Leaving the two men alone.
text: Nuclear football on the table between them.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Emily okay?
text: Cale eyes the blinking football.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Nuclear holocaust in the Middle East?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: You think it makes me happy? They
dialog: tried to destroy our country today.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Did they?
text: He slowly moves around the table.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: See the whole board, isn't that what
dialog: you told me?
text: On Raphelson. Doesn't like his tone.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: John, I'm going to have to ask you
dialog: to come to the point-
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: How do you assassinate a President
dialog: without making it look like an
dialog: assassination?
text: Raphelson stares at him.
speaker_heading: CALE (CONT'D)
dialog: You pay a man who's got nothing to
dialog: lose. You send in a team of
dialog: terrorists with ridiculous demands,
dialog: you shoot down Air Force One, you
dialog: make it about everything but
dialog: assassination, so when the smoke
dialog: clears, no one realizes that you've
dialog: cleared the line of succession and
dialog: ascended to throne.
dialog: 139.
text: Raphelson has gone very still.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: That's quite a story.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Do me a favor and don't deny it.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What about Iran?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You never wanted the Peace Accord.
dialog: You paid Bishop, you told him this
dialog: was about data-farming. You made it
dialog: look like the money came from Iran.
dialog: You framed him to get your war.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: This war was coming no matter what.
dialog: This way we save 10 years in the
dialog: desert and thousands of American
dialog: lives. We end it with one shot.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You committed treason.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: You think I hurt this country?
text: Raphelson picks up the TV remote and clicks it on. CNN shows
text: people gathering all over the country. Candlelight vigils.
text: People coming together, comforting one another.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
dialog: This unified them. One nation,
text: indivisible once more. United behind
dialog: a common goal. Today made us stronger
dialog: than ever.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Under you, right? Let me guess, the
dialog: President's going to mysteriously
text: succumb to his wounds at Bethesda.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: You're looking at the President,
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: You're under arrest.
dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: The Football squawks:
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Sir, we need final codeword
dialog: conformation for launch.
text: Raphelson reaches for the handset. Cale draws his gun.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: What are you gonna do? Shoot the
dialog: President? There are a thousand
text: Marines outside that door and no one
dialog: will believe you.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: Because you're nobody. Despite your
dialog: heroics today, in the end you're
dialog: just a shell shocked little shit and
dialog: I'm the President of the United
dialog: States!
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (0.S.)
dialog: No, you're not.
text: Raphelson turns to see Finnerty wheeling a very much awake
text: Sawyer in a wheelchair. He looks at Cale in disbelief.
text: President Sawyer picks up the handset for the football.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: This is President Sawyer, cancel all
dialog: launch preparations and return us to
speaker_heading: DEFCON 2.
speaker_heading: CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
dialog: Roger that, sir.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: But- but, you can't! I'm the
dialog: President now!
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Then consider this a coup de'tat.
dialog: Take him onto custody.
dialog: 141.
text: Finnerty moves to him when Raphelson screams, pulling the
text: gun she gave him from his pocket, levelling it at the
dialog: President...
text: BLAM! Cale fires once. The bullet rips through Raphelson's
text: left thigh. He goes down screaming.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurts, doesn't it?
text: The doors fly open as everyone else rushes in at the sound
text: of the shot. Sawyer nods to Raphelson.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: Please place the Speaker of the House
text: under arrest.
speaker_heading: RAPHELSON
dialog: (moaning)
dialog: I need a hospital...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Prisons have hospitals, don't they?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: All right, then. Take him away.
dialog: (to Cale)
dialog: And you. Isn't this your day off?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: Then what are you still doing here?
dialog: Go take your daughter to lunch.
text: Cale smiles.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: He turns to the door. We depart with him, leaving the
dialog: President giving orders, back in charge:
scene_heading: PRESIDENT SAWYER
dialog: General, get me the President of
dialog: Iran on the phone...
dialog: 142.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
text: Cale and Finnerty step out through the ruined Oval Office
text: and walk across the wreckage strewn South Lawn with Emily.
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: I've been thinking.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: You're the worst Secret Service Agent
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: How do you figure?
speaker_heading: FINNERTY
dialog: The President was shot once in your
dialog: care, you just shot another President
dialog: in the leg, and although I can't
dialog: prove it conclusively, I'm pretty
dialog: sure you set fire to the White House.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Well when you say it all out loud
dialog: like that...
text: Finnerty laughs. The three of them walk on.
text: All of Washington DC laid out in front of them. Smoke rising,
text: but already a sense of community. People pulling together,
text: a city rebuilding. Emily grasps her father's hand.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Let's go home.
text: We begin to pull up and back. The building behind them looks
text: different. Battered, missing some pieces.
dialog: But it's still the White House.
text: A pair of F-15s ROAR OVERHEAD, flying Combat Air Patrol over
dialog: Our Nation's Capital. Safe once more.
