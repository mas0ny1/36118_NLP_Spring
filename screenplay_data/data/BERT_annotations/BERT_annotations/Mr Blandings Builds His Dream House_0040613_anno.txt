speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I suppose you're wondering what all
dialog: this has to do with Mr. Blandings
dialog: and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell
dialog: you. Jim Blandings is part of the
dialog: fabric of this town. Born and raised
dialog: right here, he's as typical a New
dialog: Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet.
dialog: At least he was.
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: And if you want to know the real
dialog: story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's
dialog: my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer
dialog: and quote, best friend, unquote.

scene_heading: EXT. A LARGE NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window:
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: For fourteen years Jim and Muriel
dialog: had been living in their apartment
text: over on East Seventy-fourth Street.
dialog: It was just another of those wonderful
dialog: crisp September mornings and the
text: Blandings were still asleep. Just
dialog: like millions of other people in
dialog: good old Manhattan -- New York City --
dialog: U.S.A.
text: The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:
scene_heading: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY
text: Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep
dialog: in twin beds.
text: The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression
text: of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds,
text: oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge
text: take up an inordinate amount of space.
text: SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself
text: into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for
text: the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing
text: his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous
text: path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails
text: going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously
text: pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping
text: over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the
text: chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the
text: alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get
text: the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking
dialog: morning of his life.
text: Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes
text: with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them,
text: however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward
text: the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is
text: sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and
text: shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and
text: starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.
dialog: We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of
text: the Blandings' daily routine.
text: Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe,
text: can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens
text: the door.
scene_heading: INT. THE CLOSET
dialog: This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended
dialog: to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel
text: Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms,
text: it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns,
text: slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit
text: or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf
text: above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an
text: orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance.
text: Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one
text: out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small
text: for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put
text: it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between
text: two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down
text: and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled
text: under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it,
text: leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at
text: Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom
text: and into the narrow hall.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL
text: A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off
text: it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room
text: and the foyer.
text: Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom
text: door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.
speaker_heading: BETSY'S VOICE
dialog: Okay, dad.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Mm.
text: Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the
text: children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM
text: A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements
text: of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of
text: the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off
text: Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Okay, dad.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Mm.
text: As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits
text: into the hall.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room,
text: on through the very small combination dining and breakfast
text: nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the
text: colored cook, greets him heartily.
speaker_heading: GUSSIE
dialog: 'Morning, Mr. Blandings!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a feeble attempt at
dialog: a smile)
dialog: Mm.
text: Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon,
text: stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight
text: face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black
text: coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL
text: Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the
text: door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he
text: pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe,
text: towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She
text: disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down
text: the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to
text: the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the
text: way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and
text: shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud.
text: Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM
text: Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters, walks over, nudges
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Muriel.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Mm?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Coffee.
text: Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up,
text: takes the cup.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Thank you, dear.
text: They kiss briefly. Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim
text: goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of
text: small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles
text: through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of
text: underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look
text: through the other drawers.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Looking for something, dear?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (briefly)
dialog: My socks.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Why don't you look in your sock
dialog: drawer?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with restraint)
dialog: That's where I found my underwear.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Well, try your underwear drawer.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: I'm in my underwear drawer.
text: He reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sipping coffee)
dialog: Well, they must be somewhere.
dialog: (attempt at morning
dialog: cheeriness)
dialog: Socks just don't get up and walk
text: away by themselves.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (strained patience)
dialog: Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a-
dialog: half drawers were to be mine! I wish
dialog: you'd tell Gussie --
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: The closet! That's where they are.
dialog: We put them in the closet.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Socks? In the closet?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Well, there didn't seem to be any
dialog: room in the drawers...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And there's so much of it in the
dialog: closet!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: ...so Gussie and I decided that from
dialog: now on we'll keep them in a basket
text: on the shelf.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, thanks a lot!
text: He strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up
text: for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so,
text: all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket
text: from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to
text: explode, he looks at Muriel.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort
dialog: to be a little less clumsy.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (barely containing
dialog: himself)
dialog: I'll try, dear.
text: Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts
text: the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where
text: they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes
text: the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks
text: and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is
text: a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a
text: look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his
text: mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs,
text: takes another sip of coffee.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL
text: Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He
text: quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment
text: later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe
text: around her.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Father, just one morning I wish you'd
dialog: knock!
speaker_heading: JIM
text: (to her back as she
dialog: walks away)
dialog: 'Morning, dear.
text: Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHROOM
text: Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe,
text: yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head.
text: He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down,
text: scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines
dialog: the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc.
text: Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about
text: to use, frowns.
scene_heading: WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE
text: WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in
text: the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE
text: CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls
text: up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small
text: amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously
text: to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free
text: hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he
text: opens.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET
text: CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with
dialog: medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JIM
text: CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top
text: shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate
text: one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the
text: iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops
text: out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle
text: of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it
text: back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it,
text: contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He
text: finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and
text: steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts,
text: scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full
text: cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries
text: the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet
text: hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray
text: Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He
text: starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "Home
dialog: On The Range."
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face.
text: Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is
text: singing a lusty chorus of "Home On The Range." Jim picks up
text: his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance,
text: as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary
text: resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror.
text: As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he
text: gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs
text: freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that
text: the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation
text: toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach
text: for a towel, start to dry herself.
text: The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During
text: this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes
text: into scene.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (reaching for
dialog: toothbrush)
dialog: Excuse...
text: She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get
text: the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to
text: squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he
text: continues shaving.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL
text: CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet
text: and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to
text: her brush.
speaker_heading: JIM AND MURIEL
text: Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel
text: closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his
text: original position as he follows the mirror.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Excuse...
text: Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They
text: both hum "Home On The Range". Her mouth full, Muriel taps
text: Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves
text: to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her
text: face in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: If you don't mind, dear.
text: As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to
text: look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides
dialog: she needs a little skin lotion.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
text: (as she steps in front
dialog: of him)
dialog: Sorry.
text: She again opens the cabinet. Jim once more follows the mirror
text: around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded.
text: Muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Moment, dear.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Take your time. I can spare the blood.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Oh... cut yourself?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I cut myself every morning. I kind
dialog: of look forward to it.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Why don't you get an electric razor?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (trying to shave)
dialog: Don't like them. No close shave.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Ridiculous! Bill Cole's been using
dialog: one for years.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: He doesn't have my beard!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That's silly. Bill's beard is just
dialog: as tough and coarse and --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: I'm not interested in discussing the
dialog: grain and texture of Bill Cole's
dialog: hair follicles before I've had my
dialog: orange juice.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You don't have to carry on so. I
dialog: only said, why don't you get an
dialog: electric razor?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Because I prefer the cool, clean
text: sweep of the tempered steel as it
dialog: glides smoothly --
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Stop writing advertising copy! Hurry
dialog: up, dear, you'll be late for
dialog: breakfast.
text: Muriel exits. Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a
text: few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the
text: water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed
text: in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously
text: smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens
text: the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf.
text: The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies
text: his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts
text: slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he
text: slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly
text: slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. He reacts
text: masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for
text: the door. As he reaches it, there is the SOUND of the cabinet
text: opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the
text: washstand. As Jim winces,
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
text: Narrow and small. The four Blandings are at breakfast, Jim
text: and Muriel each reading his section of the morning paper,
text: Betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook, Joan engrossed in
text: a magazine of popular science. As we come in, Gussie, taking
text: off the orange juice, is squeezing by Jim who accordingly
text: and automatically ducks his head as she passes. Jim
text: uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page, folds it,
text: reacts with pained but controlled exasperation.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...Who did this?
text: INSERT NEWSPAPER, a section of which has been cut out.
text: BACK TO SCENE.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (very matter-of-factly)
dialog: I did.
text: She holds out her hand to Joan, who, automatically, and
text: without looking up hands her the salt.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I have repeatedly told you --
dialog: (ducking as Gussie
dialog: comes back with coffee)
dialog: -- don't cut up the morning paper
dialog: until I've had a chance to look at
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I'm sorry, father. It's necessary
dialog: research.
text: She hands the salt back to Joan who automatically passes it
dialog: to Muriel.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with some sarcasm)
dialog: I suppose this is another of Miss
dialog: Stellwagon's so-called Progressive
dialog: Projects?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (using salt and handing
dialog: it to Jim)
dialog: Now dear, there just isn't any point
dialog: in sending your children to an
dialog: expensive school if you're going to
dialog: undermine the teacher's authority in
dialog: your own dining room.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm not undermining anything. I happen
dialog: to be in the advertising business
dialog: and keeping abreast of the times is
dialog: important to me.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: And so is your children's education.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's not the point.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: It certainly is.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It certainly is not!
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (without looking up
dialog: from her magazine)
text: Bicker, bicker, bicker.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You eat your cornflakes!
text: Jim ducks as Gussie passes back on her way to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (handing Joan toast)
dialog: Joan, every time your father and I
dialog: have a lively discussion we aren't
text: necessarily bickering.
dialog: (to Betsy; solicitously)
dialog: What is it, dear, another English
dialog: composition?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (taking toast from
dialog: Joan)
dialog: Miss Stellwagon has assigned each of
dialog: us to take a want ad and write a
dialog: human interest theme about it.
dialog: (to Jim; passing toast
dialog: to him)
dialog: I found one typical of the
dialog: disintegration of our present society.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (taking toast, not
text: looking up from his
dialog: paper)
dialog: I wasn't aware of the fact that our
text: society was disintegrating.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I didn't expect you to be, father.
dialog: Miss Stellwagon says that middle-
dialog: class people like us are all too
dialog: prone to overlook the pressures and
dialog: tensions which befall the less
dialog: fortunate members of our community.
text: Jim puts down the paper, turns to Muriel.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with great restraint)
dialog: Muriel, I know it's asking a lot,
dialog: but just one morning I would like to
dialog: sit down and have breakfast without
dialog: social significance!
text: Picks up his paper.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Jim, you really might take a little
dialog: more interest in your children's
dialog: education.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: You can't squeeze blood from a turnip.
text: Jim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts
text: down the paper, turns slowly to Betsy.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All right. All right. I'll listen.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (picking up her
dialog: scrapbook)
dialog: It's just twenty-four words. But in
dialog: simple eloquence it mirrors a minor
dialog: tragedy of our times.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Well?...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak
dialog: grove, apple orchard, trout stream,
text: hay fields, four barns, seclusion,
dialog: superb view, original beams, paved
dialog: highway, acreage...
dialog: (with emotion)
dialog: Will sacrifice..."
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (simply)
dialog: That's all.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's all?!
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You don't see it, do you, father?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No. Fellow wants to sell a house so
text: he puts an ad in the paper. What did
dialog: you expect him to do, take it to the
dialog: United Nations!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: There must be more to it than that.
dialog: (to Betsy)
dialog: Isn't there, dear?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Certainly, mother. What some people
dialog: don't see is the whole sordid picture.
text: A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the
dialog: wall by hardship, soil erosion,
dialog: mortgages, everybody gobbling,
text: gobbling, gobbling, until finally,
text: in desperation, he is "forced to
dialog: sell," and stoops to the crass
dialog: commercialism of newspaper
dialog: advertising.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Oh, indeed... crass commercialism...
dialog: advertising...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (nose in her magazine)
dialog: Miss Stellwagon says advertising is
text: a basically parasitic profession.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with extreme control)
dialog: Oh, she does?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Miss Stellwagon says that advertising
dialog: makes people who can't afford it buy
dialog: things they don't want with money
dialog: they haven't got.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (elaborate sarcasm)
dialog: Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right.
dialog: Perhaps I ought to get out of this
dialog: "basically parasitic profession,"
dialog: which at the moment is paying for
dialog: her very fancy tuition, those extra
dialog: French lessons, her progressive summer
dialog: camp and for that matter, the very
dialog: braces on your teeth!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I wish you wouldn't discuss money in
text: front of the children.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Why not, they spend enough of it!
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: Bicker, bicker, bicker.
text: As Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the
text: downstairs buzzer rings. Gussie enters, squeezes by Jim who
text: automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g.
speaker_heading: GUSSIE
dialog: Hello. Who?
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Miss Blandings, there's a Mr.
dialog: Funkhauser wants to see you.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Funkhauser?
dialog: (remembers)
dialog: Oh, Mr. Funkhauser!
speaker_heading: GUSSIE
dialog: That's what he says.
text: Muriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied, reading
text: his paper. Then she turns back to Gussie.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Uh -- better ask him to come up.
speaker_heading: GUSSIE

dialog: Says to come up.
text: Gussie hangs up, squeezes by Jim, exits into the kitchen.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: ...Who?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that
dialog: clever young interior decorator we
dialog: met at the Collins' cocktail party?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (distastefully)
dialog: What's he doing here?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Well, I imagine he's brought the --
dialog: uh -- estimates.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: ...Estimates?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (rapidly; to conceal
dialog: a feeling of guilt)
dialog: Darling, you know how long we've
dialog: said we've got to do something about
dialog: this apartment, and, well, he called
dialog: last week, and I had him come over,
dialog: and he's got some simply wonderful
dialog: ideas!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: There couldn't be two Bunny
dialog: Funkhausers, could there?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Why, no, dear.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Then this is the same clever young
dialog: man who's responsible for that zebra-
text: striped monstrosity in the Collins'
dialog: living room?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That couch is terribly functional.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Phil Collins told me what he paid
dialog: for all that function!
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: If you think I'm going to --
text: SOUND of doorbell ringing.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Darling, please!
dialog: (changing subject)
dialog: Children, you'll be late to school.
dialog: Run along and --
text: The children rise, pick up their school paraphernalia.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Miss Stellwagon says that
dialog: functionalism in modern furniture --
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Never mind, dear.
text: She hustles Betsy and Joan toward the foyer as Jim rises.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER
text: Gussie has just admitted Mr. Funkhauser. He is a tall,
text: slender, effete-looking, young man. He is loaded down with
text: sketches, samples of wallpaper, bolts of material. Betsy and
text: Joan brush by him on their way out.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: THE GIRLS
dialog: (with a sharp
dialog: appraising look)
dialog: Hi.
text: As they rush out and the door closes, Jim and Muriel enter
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You
dialog: remember Mr. Blandings?
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: But of course.
text: He sweeps by them into the living room, taking over
dialog: completely.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: You'll have to pardon my bursting in
dialog: at this dreary hour --
text: (puts a sketch on a
dialog: chair)
dialog: -- practically the middle of the
dialog: night --
dialog: (puts wallpaper against
dialog: mantel)
dialog: -- but I did so want to catch you
dialog: in. I've been at it hammer and tongs
dialog: all week and I'm just a mess --
text: (drapes bolt of chintz
dialog: over high-backed
dialog: chair)
dialog: -- but then Muriel and I thought we
dialog: ought to talk it over with you before
dialog: we take the plunge...
text: Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to
text: display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for
text: Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds
text: flowing down in front. As Jim reacts:
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: (smoothing out folds
dialog: on the chintz)
dialog: After all, it's your home, too, and
dialog: it should reflect you. You know,
dialog: Man's Castle, all that sort of thing.
text: Jim looks down at the chintz.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (ominously)
dialog: Muriel!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Jim, just wait till you hear. He's
dialog: got some wonderful ideas for the
dialog: foyer.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the
dialog: whole thing! I just couldn't live
dialog: with it! I said to myself, "Bunny,
dialog: what are the Blandings? How shall we
dialog: do them?" And the answer was perfectly
dialog: obvious. Very American, very grass
dialog: roots, very blueberry pie -- that
dialog: sort of thing.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (dark look at Muriel)
dialog: Mm.
text: Funkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully
text: removes his hand.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Now first, let's dig into this living
dialog: room of yours, it's really a dreary.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (quickly; to Jim)
dialog: We want this room to be very gay,
text: dear. Something in bright reds,
text: yellows and greens.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: Red, yellow and green?!
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not
dialog: run away from color.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Not running away --
dialog: (a lame joke)
dialog: -- just backing off a little.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Uh -- yes.
dialog: (brightly)
text: Now as I see our room, it's definitely
dialog: Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench,
dialog: breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp,
dialog: hooked rug. But everything in good
dialog: taste. It must not jump out at you
dialog: and scream: "Look -- see how antique
dialog: I am!"
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Heaven forbid.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Of course, these things take
dialog: imagination. You've simply got to be
dialog: able to visualize.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (politely, removing
dialog: chintz)
dialog: If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser,
dialog: what I'd like to visualize -- at
dialog: this dreary hour -- is how much is
dialog: this all going to cost?
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Well, really, I hesitate to say.
dialog: After all --
dialog: (indicates)
dialog: -- by the time this wall is out we
dialog: may find --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: This wall is -- what?
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
text: Out. Source of light is from the
dialog: east. Obviously if our room is to
dialog: have any function at all --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You're going to tear out the wall?!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Dear, it's a wonderful notion.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
text: Visualize three feet of leaded panes,
dialog: the rest --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Can you give me a figure?
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Well! Costs aren't what they used to
dialog: be, you know, and --
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Just a figure.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Materials are impossible, labor has
dialog: just run wild --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just an overall figure.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Well!... I shouldn't like to be tied
dialog: down. But I suppose if you must have
dialog: a figure, I'd say -- mm --
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: -- somewhere in the neighborhood of
dialog: seven.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Mm... Seven.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That would be seven... thousand?
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Mm.
text: Jim looks at Muriel, considers.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (soberly)
dialog: We-ll. That seems fair.
dialog: (gathering up materials)
dialog: After all, we're not running away
dialog: from color --
dialog: (picks up wallpaper)
dialog: -- and we are tearing out walls --
dialog: (picks up sketches)
dialog: Mr. Funkhauser, do you have a card?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Jim, we haven't even discussed the
text: rest of the house.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We will, dear.
dialog: (leads the whole batch
dialog: on Funkhauser)
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: (huffy)
dialog: Well, really, I --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (deftly steering him
dialog: toward the door)
dialog: We'll talk it all out and then we'll
dialog: get in touch with Bunny.
text: CAMERA TRUCKS with them to the door.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: Well, really, I mean, I was under
dialog: the impression we'd come to some
dialog: decision today.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm sure we will.
speaker_heading: FUNKHAUSER
dialog: We-ll!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: So nice of you to come.
dialog: (puts Funkhauser's
dialog: hat on his head)
dialog: Good day.
text: And Funkhauser is gone. Jim closes the door, turns ominously.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (apprehensively)
dialog: Now darling, you -- you just don't
dialog: go to a man like Funkhauser and ask
dialog: how much it's going to cost before
dialog: you even know what he's going to do!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No, that would be too logical! Seven
dialog: thousand dollars! Blueberry pie! I
dialog: wouldn't put seventy-five cents into
dialog: this broken-down rat trap!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sentimentally)
dialog: It's our home, Jim. Betsy was
dialog: practically born in this apartment.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That does not make it a national
dialog: shrine!
dialog: (vehemently)
dialog: Seven thousand dollars and not one
text: word about closets.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Closets! You wouldn't even let him
dialog: get to the bathroom!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I haven't got that kind of money!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: The way you talk, Jim Blandings,
dialog: you'd think I was some kind of
dialog: congenital idiot!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sometimes I'm beginning to wonder!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You can just get out of here!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's not a bad idea!
text: He angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat
text: down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a
text: tennis racket tumbling down on his head. Jim jams his hat
text: onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming
text: the door. Muriel walks over to the closet, is about to bend
text: down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent-up emotions
text: explode. She kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the
text: door, starts to cry.

scene_heading: INT. JIM'S OFFICE - DAY
text: On the wall are various framed copies of Jim's handiwork.
text: Most prominent are advertisements for a meat product called
text: "Wham!" "A Whale of a Ham!" There is ample evidence of the
dialog: fact that Jim's most successful slogan is: "When you've got
dialog: the Whim - say 'Wham!'"
text: Jim enters, goes to his desk, sits down, still emotionally
text: upset. He glances at a photograph of Muriel, looks guiltily
text: away, then back.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (to photograph)
dialog: Sorry.
text: His secretary enters.
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You wanted to see the color copy

scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY - (PROCESS)

dialog: I guess the corsage did it.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY
text: Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - They are driving through a
text: beautiful Connecticut countryside. Mr. Smith, a local real
dialog: estate dealer, is of that shrewd Yankee breed which

dialog: salesmanship.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
text: There they are, two little fish from
text: New York -- out in the deep deep
dialog: waters of Connecticut real estate.
dialog: That's Smith, the real estate
text: salesman. Mighty shrewd cookie in a
dialog: quiet sort of way. Never thought
dialog: he'd get a bite this quick.
text: Smith looks speculatively at the Blandings.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
text: Now he's sizing up the catch. "Mm.
dialog: Let's see. Convertible -- orchids --
dialog: must be pretty well fixed. Wonder if
dialog: they're lookers or buyers?"
text: Jim takes a deep breath, looks at Muriel as if to say, "Get
text: that air!" Muriel smiles with approval. Jim pats her hand
text: affectionately. Smith reacts.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: They're buyers.
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: Yes, sir, Smith, looks like you're
text: finally going to unload the old
dialog: Hackett place. Now first thing is
dialog: get 'em a little anxious.
text: Jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque-
text: looking old Connecticut farmhouse. He and Muriel react with
text: approval, look questioningly at Smith. Smith shakes his head,
dialog: "no," as though to say, "Not nearly good enough for you."

speaker_heading: SMITH

text: The Blandings look off, react with interest and approval.
text: WHAT THEY SEE -- BURROWED INTO THE UPWARD SLOPE
text: What they see -- Burrowed into the upward slope of the land
text: is the old Hackett farmhouse. If the roof seems to sway a
text: little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the
text: overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady,
dialog: charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy
dialog: years come next April. However, the overall effect is
text: definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. In the back are

speaker_heading: SMITH'S VOICE
dialog: Fifty mighty pretty little acres...

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (involuntarily)
dialog: It's simply charming!
text: Jim's look cautions against her over-enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That is, for an old house.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Of course, you understand, Mr. Smith,
dialog: we're just window shopping, so to
dialog: speak. Nothing really definite in
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Perfectly all right.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (studies house; with
dialog: assumed indifference)
dialog: Mm. Not a bad-looking place, but
dialog: it's certainly a lot older than
dialog: anything we had in mind.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: She's no spring chicken --
dialog: (sagely)
dialog: -- but that's just what makes her
dialog: such a buy.
text: They look at him curiously. Smith's attitude is matter-of-
text: fact, almost without enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: This isn't just old timber, or a
text: virgin stand oak grove other side of
dialog: the trout stream, or a couple of
dialog: fruit orchards... You're buying a
dialog: piece of American history.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (interested in spite
dialog: of himself)
dialog: You don't say! How's that?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: First year she was built, General
dialog: Gates stopped right here to water

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Oh! Old General Gates -- Civil War.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Revolutionary War.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh. Oh, that General Gates. Hear
dialog: that, honey, General Gates!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (with concern)
dialog: Wouldn't that make the house over a
dialog: hundred years old?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: Hundred and seventy come next April.
text: The Blandings exchange a doubtful look which Smith catches.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Now I'm not trying to sell you
dialog: anything -- all I'm saying is that
dialog: one of these days someone with a
dialog: little vision and imagination's goin'
dialog: to come along, and just steal this
dialog: place --
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: and I mean steal it.
text: The Blandings, as one, turn to the house with renewed
text: interest. This is not lost on Smith.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Mr. Blandings, I know you can look
dialog: at that house and just about picture
dialog: what a couple of coats of paint and
dialog: a little pointing up here and there
dialog: can do to it.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Mm.

speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: THREE SHOT
speaker_heading: THREE SHOT
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Yes, sir, you've certainly got to
dialog: visualize.
text: CAMERA MOVES to a HEAD CLOSEUP of Smith as he, too, begins

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (a little too casual)
dialog: Well -- I -- suppose as long as we're
dialog: here...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (same)
dialog: I guess it doesn't hurt to take a
dialog: look.
text: As Smith precedes them up the path toward the house:
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: It does have possibilities. Do you

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (same)

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Well, you don't say.
text: Eph Hackett gets out of the car, saunters over. Hackett is a

dialog: from New York City.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: Howdy.
speaker_heading: THE BLANDINGS
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You certainly have a lovely place

speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: (briefly)
dialog: Ye-ap.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: Mr. Hackett, we've just been talking
dialog: to Smith here about -- uh -- taking

text: Hackett exchanges the briefest of looks with Smith who almost

speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Ain't for sale!
text: As the Blandings react with dismay:
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: Why don't you folks just go out in
dialog: back and take a look at the orchard?
text: He gives them a wink which says, "Just leave it to me." The

speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: How'm I doin', George?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Nice timin', Eph. Think we got

speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: They the same people you showed it

speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: If they got five thousand dollars on

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: They already offered ten.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: (mildly)
dialog: Y'don't say... What's my asking price?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Fifteen...
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: A mite stiff...
speaker_heading: SMITH

dialog: eleven thousand.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: Make it eleven thousand five hundred

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Muriel, for once in my life I'm going

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: It seems very peculiar that when

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: BETSY

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Miss Stellwagon says the current

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with great restraint)
dialog: Did it ever occur to you two that
dialog: there may be some remote, intangible
dialog: subjects upon which your Miss Irma
dialog: Stellwagon is not the final authority?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why don't we buy a Solaxion house?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...You know it's just barely
dialog: conceivable -- What kind of a house?
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: Solaxion. It's built on a mast like

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Children, you haven't even seen this

speaker_heading: BETSY

speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: "Dear Mr. Smith: You may inform Mr.

text: As a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first

text: The Special Effect concludes with the house finally and firmly
text: at rest on the preordained $11,550. As the antagonists on

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: First time around you offered ten

dialog: right?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What of it?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's two hundred dollars an acre.
dialog: I know that part of Connecticut and
dialog: one hundred dollars an acre is
dialog: standard top-gouge price to city
dialog: slickers. When the natives sell to

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Forty dollars an acre!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The man's entitled to a fair profit.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not two hundred and eighty-four
dialog: percent.
dialog: (indicates papers)
dialog: And besides, you're not getting fifty
dialog: acres, you're only getting thirty-
dialog: five, more or less.
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (on the defensive)
dialog: All right, so it's thirty-five! What's
dialog: the difference? Do you know how many

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're not spending eleven thousand

dialog: courts!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's not the point!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (very businesslike)
dialog: That's precisely the point. We're

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (rising emotion)
dialog: We'll do no such thing! I'm not going

speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: Now wait a minute! You can't measure

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Like what, for instance?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Like antique value, for instance! It

dialog: stopped right there, at that very
dialog: house, to water his horses.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I don't care if General Grant dropped
dialog: in for a scotch and soda -- you're

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That was a different war!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I think Bill's absolutely right.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (struggling to contain

dialog: Let me explain something. To both of

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Bill -- Muriel and I have found what

dialog: You look at it and you say, "It's

text: He turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an
text: interested eyebrow. Then, to Simms:
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Just... what sort of thing do you
dialog: have in mind?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Well, I imagine the type of house
dialog: you'd want would be something in
dialog: quiet good taste, two story, frame
dialog: and brick veneer construction --
dialog: modern, but of course fitting in
dialog: with the architectural traditions of
dialog: the countryside.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I think it sounds fine.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to see a basic
dialog: floor plan --
dialog: (reaches into file
dialog: behind him)
dialog: -- something like this.
text: Simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him,
text: the Blandings moving around, flanking him. They examine the
dialog: plan with interest.
text: WHAT THEY SEE -- THE PLAN.
text: What they see -- the plan. A simple master plan of a two
text: story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. As he
text: talks, we see Simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the
dialog: various rooms
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: First floor. Living room, study,
dialog: dining room, kitchen, service porch,
dialog: maid's room -- upstairs three family
text: bedrooms with two adjoining baths.
text: THREE SHOT. THE BLANDINGS PRAISE THE PLAN
text: THREE SHOT. The Blandings praise the plan with the
text: uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen
dialog: such a plan before in their lives.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh --
dialog: well -- doesn't it seem just a little
dialog: bit conventional?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes, Simms, if we were going to build
dialog: a house we want it -- well, you know --
dialog: just a little bit different.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (he's heard all this
dialog: before)
dialog: Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Now, for instance --
dialog: (takes Simms' pencil)
text: THE DRAWING BOARD.
text: THE DRAWING BOARD. Jim's pencil traces as he talks.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: -- here in the study if we could
dialog: just push out this wall a little --
dialog: and put in a built-in bar we could --
speaker_heading: MURIEL'S VOICE
dialog: Excuse me, dear --
text: Her hand takes the pencil from his, starts to trace as she
text: talks. Jim's fingers drum with the beginnings of impatience.
speaker_heading: MURIEL'S VOICE
dialog: These bedrooms. They do seem rather
dialog: small. And, of course we'd have to
dialog: have a little dressing room -- and --
text: As she draws it in, Jim's hand takes the pencil. Muriel's
text: fingers drum nervously.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: And closets, Simms, lots of closets.
dialog: (traces them in)
dialog: If there's one thing this family
dialog: needs, it's closets.
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
text: (as his hand reaches
dialog: for the pencil)
dialog: If I might make a suggestion --
text: But Muriel's hand reaches the pencil first.
speaker_heading: MURIEL'S VOICE
dialog: (as she draws them in)
dialog: And bathrooms, Mr. Simms. Each bedroom
dialog: must have at least one bathroom.
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
dialog: But that would be four bathrooms,
dialog: Mrs. Blandings --
text: (his hand reaches for
dialog: the pencil)
dialog: I think I'd better point out to you --
text: Jim's hand reaches the pencil before Simms. Now Simms' fingers
text: and Muriel's drum in unison.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: Just a minute. Do you think --
dialog: (tracing)
dialog: we might manage a little playroom in
dialog: the basement, nothing tremendous,
dialog: you know, something like this --
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
text: (as his hand reaches
dialog: for the pencil;
dialog: cautiously)
dialog: Well, it's always possible, but at
dialog: the moment our fundamental problem --
text: But Muriel's hand has the pencil.
speaker_heading: MURIEL'S VOICE
dialog: (as she traces)
dialog: And I've always wanted a little sewing
dialog: room upstairs --
dialog: (Jim's and Simms'
dialog: fingers drum
dialog: impatiently)
dialog: You know, a little utility room where
dialog: I can be alone, and sew, or sulk, or
dialog: on a rainy afternoon...
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
text: (as his hand takes
dialog: pencil)
dialog: Pardon me, dear. On that playroom,
dialog: Simms, not too small. You know, plenty
dialog: of room for ping-pong, darts, nice
dialog: big poker table...
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
text: (as his hand reaches
dialog: for another pencil)
dialog: If you don't mind, I --
text: But Muriel has reached the pencil first. As she and Jim sketch
text: simultaneously and the scene begins to DISSOLVE, we hear:
speaker_heading: MURIEL'S VOICE
dialog: ...And off the kitchen, I'd like a
dialog: little flower sink just to putter
dialog: around in...
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
text: ...And a terrace off the study, with
dialog: an owning and little outdoor
dialog: fireplace...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: THE DRAWING BOARD - THE ORIGINAL PLANS
text: THE DRAWING BOARD - The original plans are lost in a maze of
text: the Blandings' extensions, alterations and additions.
scene_heading: THREE SHOT - THE THREE ARE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED
text: THREE SHOT - The three are somewhat exhausted, silently
text: looking at the plans. Simms wearily runs his hand through
text: his hair.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (delicately)
dialog: We-ll... let's just see what we have
dialog: here. In the first place --
scene_heading: THE DRAWING BOARD - SIMMS'
text: THE DRAWING BOARD - Simms' pencil indicates as he talks.
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
dialog: -- I'm afraid you've got the upstairs
text: about twice as big as the downstairs.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: It's all those bathrooms.
speaker_heading: MURIEL'S VOICE
dialog: It is not, it's all those closets.
scene_heading: THREE SHOT.
scene_heading: THREE SHOT.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: By extending this breakfast room
dialog: you've eliminated the possibility of
text: any stairs going to the second floor.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh, you can just shove those stairs
dialog: in anywhere.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (patiently; almost
dialog: paternally)
dialog: And, Mrs. Blandings, on that sewing
dialog: room, the way you have it now, the
dialog: chimney stack would come up right
text: through the middle of the room,
dialog: leaving you with something in the
text: shape of a square doughnut.
dialog: (tactfully)
dialog: Which, of course, might be very warm
dialog: in winter, but otherwise of doubtful
dialog: utility.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You could always move the chimney
dialog: somewhere else, couldn't you?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: We-ll...
dialog: (rising; resigned to
dialog: his fate but tactful)
dialog: Look, I think I know just about what
dialog: you two have in mind. Why don't I go
dialog: ahead with some preliminary plans
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (hearty)
dialog: You do that, Simms, but remember,
dialog: we've got to hold it down to ten
dialog: thousand.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (candid)
dialog: That, I can tell you right now, is
dialog: impossible. Even with a considerable
dialog: trimming of the things you've
dialog: indicated, I don't see how we can
dialog: bring it in for less than twelve or
dialog: twelve-five.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Twelve-five!
dialog: (looks at Muriel;
dialog: then)
dialog: Well, I guess we're not going to
dialog: quibble about a few pennies one way
dialog: or the other.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (can't resist)
dialog: No, you'll find Mr. Blandings never
text: quibbles about pennies.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: And -- uh -- have you any notions
dialog: about how you'd like the old place
dialog: taken down?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a rueful joke)
dialog: Why don't we just blow on it?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (wry smile)
dialog: There's a good local house wrecker.
dialog: I'll have him contact you.
text: Jim expansively puts his arm around Simms' shoulders.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Fine. You just shoot ahead with those
dialog: plans, and remember, try to keep it
text: down to ten, ten-five.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (doubtfully)
dialog: Well -- we'll try.
text: As the Blandings walk to the door:
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: There's one good thing about getting
dialog: that old relic down. Those original
dialog: beams and everything -- this time
dialog: somebody pays us.
text: As they go out the door:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR OLD HACKETT HOUSE - DAY - WINTER - (PROCESS
speaker_heading: MATTE SHOT)
text: Old Hackett house matted to show winter sky, bare trees. In
text: the f.g. bare ground with patches of snow.
text: Eph Hackett is standing with one of the wreckers. In the
text: b.g. we see the frame of the old house, firmly intact, the
text: chimney still standing within it. There are mountains of
text: shingles, splintered boards and other rubbish, piled about.
text: The piles are reasonably neat and sorted.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: Them beams is worth money. You payin'
dialog: him, or he payin' you?
speaker_heading: WRECKER
dialog: He's payin' me.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: WRECKER
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: A thousand.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: A thousand!
speaker_heading: WRECKER
text: He squawked, but he paid.
speaker_heading: HACKETT
dialog: (drily)
dialog: Hmm. I guess maybe I got a little
dialog: somethin' comin' too.

scene_heading: EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - PROCESS OF

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: Well, so far it's cost us thirteen
dialog: thousand, three hundred and twenty-
dialog: nine dollars and forty-five cents.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: But we've got the nicest vacant lot
dialog: in the state of Connecticut.

speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE

dialog: that I know.
text: The CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose:
scene_heading: INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jim, Muriel and Simms are going over the preliminary plans.
text: Betsy and Joan are present, Betsy reading the Lansdale Blade
text: and Joan reading a science book.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: It's impossible. I don't see how we
dialog: can cut another inch.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Honey, you heard Simms. As the house
dialog: stands now it's over fifteen thousand
dialog: dollars!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Well, it just doesn't seem possible --
dialog: (afterthought)
dialog: for a house with such small rooms.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: Mrs. Blandings, I've already
dialog: explained. It's not only the size of
dialog: the rooms so much as it is the number.
dialog: You see, our primary problem is one
dialog: of cubage --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's right, dear, cubage.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh --
dialog: (sorry he got into it)
text: just a figure of speech.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: But what does it mean?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a little irritably)
dialog: Cubage. It's just the number of cubic
dialog: feet that --
dialog: (lost, lamely)
dialog: -- go into a cubic foot. Go on, Simms.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (consulting plans)
dialog: Now is it absolutely essential for
dialog: each of your daughters to have her
dialog: own room with two closets and a
dialog: separate bath?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a look at the girls;
dialog: clearing his throat)
dialog: Yes. You see, er, my daughters are,
dialog: er, approaching womanhood, and, er --
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (brief look at the
dialog: girls)
dialog: I hadn't realized they were
text: approaching it quite so fast.
dialog: (to Jim)
dialog: Perhaps what you need is not so much
text: a house as a series of little
text: bungalows.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hmmm.
dialog: (examining plans)
dialog: What about that silly flower sink?
dialog: We could eliminate that.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I beg your pardon.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Or that sewing room upstairs, that's
dialog: certainly a waste.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: If we're going to eliminate anything,
dialog: we'll lose that ridiculous play room
dialog: in the basement with that great big
dialog: poker table.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Honey, I've got to have some
dialog: relaxation.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: We've got thirty-one and a half acres.
dialog: Go out in the back and do a little
dialog: gardening.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sure, and get poison ivy!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (with dogged patience)
dialog: If I may interrupt, I'd like to
dialog: suggest that none of these are really
dialog: major eliminations. Now if we could
dialog: do with one less bathroom on the
dialog: second floor --
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'm sorry. We couldn't possibly.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: Mrs. Blandings, a simple bathroom,
dialog: eight by ten by eight with grade A
dialog: fixtures will cost around thirteen
dialog: hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I refuse to endanger the health of
dialog: my children in a house with less
text: than four bathrooms.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: For thirteen hundred dollars they
dialog: can live in a house with three
dialog: bathrooms and rough it!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Look, perhaps the most practical
dialog: thing would be --
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Oh, look, we're in the Lansdale paper!
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Historical Society Blasts Vandalism!"
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Muriel, Simms explained to you. We've
dialog: just got to cut, cut --
dialog: (reacts)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Censure Vote Passed re Destruction
dialog: of Famed Hackett Edifice."
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, isn't that just too bad! Let
dialog: me see that.
text: He takes the paper, scans it, suddenly bursts into laughter.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What's so funny.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Prutty. Mrs. Bildad Prutty. Get a
dialog: load of this!

dialog: "The semi-monthly meeting of the

speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: Twenty-six hundred dollars!
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
dialog: (comfortingly)
dialog: I wouldn't be too concerned about

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (briefly)
dialog: Hello, Muriel.
text: (he strides past her
text: waving a telegram;
dialog: to Jim)
dialog: Well, you've done it again'. Once,
dialog: just once, why don't you come to me
dialog: and find out if it's all right, if
dialog: it's legal, before you go barging
dialog: off and run yourself smack into
dialog: another jam!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's eating you?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (ignoring him; to
dialog: Simms)
dialog: And I must say, Simms, I hold you
dialog: equally responsible!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What? What happened?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I'm afraid I don't understand.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Simms; indicating
dialog: Jim)
dialog: Did you let this idiot tear down
dialog: that house?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What if he did? What of it?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: Reconstruction was unsound and totally
dialog: impractical.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I quite agree. But you're dealing
text: with a man who doesn't think before
text: he acts, who goes off half-cocked!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What is it? What did I do?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (ignoring him; to
dialog: Simms)
dialog: You're an architect! You must have
dialog: been aware of the legality involved.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What? What legality?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Simms)
dialog: You knew there was a mortgage on
dialog: that house.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I assumed as much.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What happened? What are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (ignoring him; to
dialog: Simms)
dialog: And you know the requirements in
dialog: regard to a mortgage where there's
dialog: demolition intended!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Certainly. But since you were his
dialog: lawyer, I naturally assumed --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: With a man like this you can't assume
dialog: anything!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Just one minute! I am entitled to
dialog: know what I did! This is America! A
dialog: man's guilty until he's proven
dialog: innocent --
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: It's the other way around, father.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You go to bed!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Girls!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Bill, I've had a very trying day.
dialog: Would you mind telling me in clear,
dialog: concise English just what crime I've
dialog: committed -- and why?!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (with weary resignation)
dialog: In clear, concise English, you tore
text: down a house on which another man
dialog: holds a mortgage without first getting
dialog: his written permission.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, I -- I did?!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And in such case, the mortgagee can
dialog: demand the full payment of said
dialog: mortgage upon demand --
dialog: (waves telegram)
dialog: and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands!
dialog: Six thousand clams! And he wants
dialog: them now!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: Now?!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You've got ten days.
text: Jim gulps. Pause.
speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: MURIEL

text: to bed without another word.
speaker_heading: BETSY

speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: SIMMS

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: No, Simms, I'll work this out. You

dialog: let's see some estimates.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: And we'll just forget about that

speaker_heading: SIMMS

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (coming into scene)
dialog: Now, Jim, you can't do that.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What if something should happen? You
dialog: can't leave the children unprotected.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (somewhat irritably)
dialog: I'm not dead yet! And if I die,

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Not if you cash in your policies.
text: As Jim reacts with painful resignation:
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll

dialog: collateral. If necessary, I'll sign
dialog: a personal note.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: Thanks, Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (paternally)
dialog: And Jim, do me a little favor. The
dialog: next time you're going to do anything,
dialog: or say anything, or buy anything,
dialog: think it over very carefully, and
dialog: when you're sure you're right --
dialog: forget the whole thing. Good night,
dialog: Muriel.
text: He goes to Muriel and kisses her on the cheek. Jim sees it,

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Good night, Bill.

speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (darkly)
dialog: What's with this kissing all of a
dialog: sudden?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just because a man is helpful in a
dialog: business way, it doesn't give him
dialog: extra-curricular privileges with my
dialog: wife!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That's a fine thing to say about a
dialog: friend of fifteen years!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (testy)
dialog: Well, I don't like it. Every time he
dialog: goes out of this house, he shakes my
dialog: hand and he kisses you.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Would you prefer it the other way
dialog: around?!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: Well, I don't like it, that's all!
dialog: Why is he always hanging around? Why
dialog: doesn't he ever get married -- or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (assumed innocence)
dialog: Because he can't find another girl
text: as sweet and pretty and wholesome as
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well -- it -- it doesn't look right.
dialog: There are limits to friendship and --
text: Muriel comes over, puts a sympathetic arm around him.
speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Twenty-one thousand!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: And with some judicious cutting, I
dialog: think we can pare that down to
dialog: eighteen.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: We've only asked for the barest
dialog: necessities --
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Frankly, with all the extras you two
dialog: have --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Never mind.
dialog: (hands estimates to
dialog: Simms)
dialog: If you'll just send us a bill for

dialog: Now, if you'll excuse us.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I am going out to get my head
dialog: examined! Then, if I don't jump off
dialog: the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to
dialog: find the owner of our building and

text: As they are about to exit, they pause as their eyes are caught
text: by a drawing on an adjacent drawing board.
text: WHAT THEY SEE - A BEAUTIFUL PENCIL AND CHARCOAL DRAWING
text: What they see - a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of
text: their completed prospective house. Under it, in neat letters
dialog: is printed:
scene_heading: RESIDENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JAMES H. BLANDINGS
text: JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS.
text: Jim, Muriel, and Simms. They look at the drawing, then at
text: each other. Jim's face softens. Muriel looks at him
text: appealingly.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What's the name of that contractor?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
text: INSERT JIM'S COST CHART. The house rests on the diagonal
text: line at the figure of $13,500. As the miniscule Jim and Muriel
text: watch with apprehension, the small figures of Smith and

scene_heading: EXCAVATION - LOCATION #2 - EARLY SPRING - DAY
text: A sign on a sawhorse - it reads:
scene_heading: JOHN W. RETCH AND SON
text: Over scene is the thunderous dissonance of the various SOUNDS
text: that go into preliminary construction. A steam shovel in
text: action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently
text: the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig.
text: As the CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see the machines and workmen at
text: their various tasks. The scene has all the rustic peace of
dialog: the invasion of Hollandia.
text: The ANGLE CHANGES, and we see Jim, Muriel, and Bill drive up
text: the improvised driveway very close to the scene of activity.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY
text: Jim and Muriel look at their property with unconcealed pride.
dialog: Bill is interested but would like it better if there were
dialog: less noise.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (shouting over noise)
dialog: Well, things are certainly humming.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (same)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (same)
dialog: I said, humming.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh.
text: As they get out of the car, there is an unusually loud crash
text: from the well-digger's rig.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (loud)
dialog: What's going on over there?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (same)
dialog: That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging
dialog: our well.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (same)
dialog: Well? What happened to the trout
dialog: stream, with that pure, clear, cold
dialog: mountain water?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (same)
dialog: I decided against it --
text: There is a sudden cessation of the steam shovel and complete
text: silence. Jim, unaware of it, continues to shout.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The trout stream --
dialog: (reacts; quietly)
dialog: didn't seem practical.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: It wasn't exactly a decision, dear.
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: We discovered the trout stream dries
dialog: up in August and the rest of the
dialog: year it's polluted.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (defensively; groping)
dialog: Well, anyway, I'd rather have artesian
dialog: water. It's healthier. Calcium --
dialog: vitamins -- artesian --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: What's wrong with that steam shovel?
text: They look off.
text: WHAT THEY SEE. A CLUSTER OF WORKMEN
text: WHAT THEY SEE. A cluster of workmen have gathered around Mr.
text: Zucca, the driver of the steam shovel, who is swearing in
text: voluble but undistinguishable Italian.
text: JIM, MURIEL AND BILL.
text: Jim, Muriel and Bill.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Better take a look.
text: He starts off for the steam shovel, nimbly jumping over a
text: drainage trench. Muriel starts to follow, pauses, unable to
dialog: negotiate the trench.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Jim!
text: Jim turns in time to see Bill pick Muriel up and carry her
text: across the trench. As he sets her down:
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sarcastic; to Jim)
dialog: Thank you, dear.
text: Jim frowns, annoyed. They approach the group around the
dialog: shovel.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's the matter, Mr. Zucca?
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: How do you lika that? Broka my bucket.
dialog: Two times this week I broka my bucket?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What did you do, strike a boulder?
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: (darkly)
dialog: Atsa no boulder, atsa ledge.
speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: ZUCCA

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Blast?
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: Blast. Witha dynamite.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What do you mean, dynamite?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (a little annoyed)
dialog: What do you mean, "What do you mean?"
dialog: Mr. Zucca just explained. He's going

text: gets rid of the rock.
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: Atsa no rock, atsa ledge.

speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: Ledge. Lika bigga stone, only a-

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Like a boulder?
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: No, like ledge.
text: Jim looks at Muriel and Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: ...Like a ledge.
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: But you don't gotta worry. Only cost
dialog: twenty-four cents a cubic foot, plussa
dialog: dynamite an'a fuse.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But how far will you have to blast?
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: Harda tell. Might be a lilla baby

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: At twenty-four cents a foot? Do you
dialog: realize what that means?!
speaker_heading: ZUCCA
dialog: (simply)
dialog: Meansa we gotta blast.
text: Zucca walks off.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with quiet resignation)
dialog: Well, anyway, our house will never

speaker_heading: MURIEL

text: There is a crash from the well-digging rig.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: "Come to peaceful Connecticut --

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I don't know.

text: Three weeks now at four dollars and

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (asserting his

dialog: I think I'd better have a little
dialog: talk with Mr. Tesander.
text: He starts off. Muriel and Bill, curious, follow.
scene_heading: EXT. AT THE WELL RIG
text: Tesander, a stolid New England well-digger, the soul of
text: industry and candor, attacks the earth. Jim, followed by
text: Muriel and Bill, walks into scene, stands by, watching him.
dialog: After a moment:
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh -- Mr. Tesander --
text: The motor is making too much noise.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Mr. Tesander!
text: Tesander looks up, shuts off his motor.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Yep?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: How's it coming?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: (considers a moment;
dialog: then:)
dialog: It's comin'.
text: With a nod he turns on his motor, resumes work. Jim exchanges
text: a look with Muriel and Bill.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No -- no -- I mean --
text: But he's drowned out by the motor.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Mr. Tesander!
text: Tesander patiently stops his motor, looks up.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Yep?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What I meant was -- how far down are
dialog: you?
text: Tesander looks at his equipment, considers.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Oh -- 'bout a hundred and ninety
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well -- isn't that pretty deep?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: (thinks it over; he's
dialog: not one for snap
dialog: judgments; then:)
dialog: Yep.
text: He's about to turn on his motor, but Jim detains him.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Do you think maybe you'd better try
dialog: another spot?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Up to you.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I mean -- well, have you hit anything
dialog: yet at all?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: (thinks it over)
dialog: Hit some limestone yesterday.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: That's bad.
text: Jim looks at Bill who shakes his head with mock commiseration.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: And right now it looks like we're
text: coming into some shale.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's bad?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh...
text: Jim looks at Muriel for comfort which isn't forthcoming.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: 'Course it might turn out to be
dialog: sandstone.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's bad?
text: Tesander shakes his head, "No."
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's good?
text: Tesander shakes his head, "No."
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Can't tell. Might be good. Might be
dialog: bad. One thing you know -- you got
text: plenty of shale, sandstone and
dialog: limestone.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...I see.
text: He turns a little helplessly to Muriel and Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: On a hot day there's nothing like a
dialog: nice cool limestone shower.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Mr. Tesander, just for the record,
dialog: of course, what ever happened to
dialog: water?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Oh, it's there, all right.
text: (he smiles, nods,
dialog: tips his hat to Muriel)
dialog: Just got to be patient.
text: He turns on his motor, goes back to work. Jim, Muriel and
text: Bill start to move off.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: If you ask me, this project's getting
text: a little out of hand.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Nothing's getting out of hand at
dialog: all. I've made a chart of the whole
dialog: operation, and --
dialog: (indicates Tesander)
dialog: with a few minor deviations, I know
dialog: exactly what every penny's going to
dialog: cost.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
text: Two pennies.

dialog: And just what does that mean?
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, he didn't say in so many words

speaker_heading: CARPENTER
dialog: Okay, you're the doctor.

text: After the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails
text: brutally withdrawn from timber, a loud splintering of wood
text: and then something of the appearance of entrails comes
text: hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at Jim's
text: feet. The carpenter exits. Muriel gives Jim an accusing look.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: It sounded less... expensive to say
dialog: no.
text: There is another loud screech and more "entrails" come

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Stop it! Stop it!

dialog: of two-by-four.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Stand back, Muriel.
text: Jim raises the plank, takes a stance.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Roger.
text: Jim swings; the window shatters. Almost simultaneously there
text: is a click and the door to the closet swings open. As Jim
text: turns with a sense of accomplishment, his face falls as he
text: and the others see that the erratic door has opened.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: In case of emergency -- break glass.
dialog: Come on, Bill.
text: As Muriel and Bill precede Jim out of the closet and down
text: the stairs, Jim pauses, speculatively toying with the lock.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Funny... always worked before. Huh.
dialog: I wonder...
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - STAIRWAY
text: Muriel and Bill walking down the stairs. From upstairs comes
text: a steady sullen pounding from the interior of the closet.
text: Without a word, they stop, look at each other, turn and walk

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

dialog: through it)
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Dad, do you suppose I could have a
dialog: chemistry lab in the basement?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (preoccupied with
dialog: mail)
dialog: Sure, why not?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I think it's awful. Smelling up the
dialog: house with those horrible chemicals.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Never mind, Betsy.
dialog: (to Jim)
dialog: Dear, I'm going up to the place this
text: afternoon to see about landscaping.
dialog: Bill's driving me.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (preoccupied)
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: (looking up; darkly)
dialog: What do you mean, Bill's driving
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (a little annoyed)
dialog: Why do you always say, "what do you
dialog: mean," when you know perfectly well
dialog: what I mean and what you mean?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I mean that every time I turn my
dialog: back Bill Cole's driving you some
dialog: place or something.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: He's only being helpful.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (annoyed; tears open
dialog: a letter)
dialog: I thought he was a lawyer! Why isn't
dialog: he out suing somebody?
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: Bicker, bicker, bicker.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (to Joan)
dialog: Another word and you don't get your
dialog: laboratory.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Well, that's something!
text: Jim suddenly explodes, crumpling a letter he has just read.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We'll just see about that!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: What is it, dear?
text: Ignoring her, he reaches for the phone, starts to dial.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Jim, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (into phone; sharply)
dialog: Mr. William Cole, please.
dialog: (pause; then with
dialog: rising emotion)
dialog: Hello, Bill? I want you to fight
dialog: this thing! I know my rights as a
dialog: citizen! They can't get away with
dialog: it!... What do you mean, what am I
dialog: talking about? The letter, of course.
dialog: From the owner of this building.
dialog: They want us to move! It's a thirty
dialog: day notice!
dialog: (listens a moment)
dialog: But that's ridiculous. How can I
dialog: move into a house that isn't even
dialog: finished?! No windows, no plaster --
dialog: or paint, or -- or plumbing!
dialog: (listens a moment;
dialog: then with rising
dialog: emotion)
dialog: Now you listen to me! I have no
dialog: intention of moving in thirty days!
dialog: This is not legal! I'm going to fight
dialog: this thing! And I don't care if it
dialog: takes every penny I've got!
dialog: (listens)

dialog: (hangs up)
speaker_heading: MURIEL

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD AND COVERED BRIDGE - DAY
text: Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is
text: the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the
text: children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause,
dialog: over this, we hear:
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: So-came thirty days -- and they moved.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BRIDGE.
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT - Entrance to bridge. As the cavalcade passes
text: through we see in the rear of the trailer, jammed among the
text: household effects, Gussie and a very uncomfortable Mr. Bill
dialog: Cole.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: I mean -- we moved.
scene_heading: OTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK
text: The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn.
text: Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he
text: impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite
dialog: direction. Over this:
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: (as Jim would say it)
dialog: That's the wrong road! Any fool knows
dialog: that!
text: Jim starts his car up leading the way.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD AT THE HOUSE - DAY
text: The moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops
text: his car and they all look off at the house, react with
dialog: pleasant surprise.
text: WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING
scene_heading: COMPLETION.
text: WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - The house is rapidly nearing
text: completion. A half dozen men are finishing the exterior
text: painting, planing down doors, etc. In front, a couple of men
text: from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the
dialog: first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as
text: a clean, bright and very attractive new house.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
text: Well, there she is, bright and shining --
dialog: and just about complete -- the
dialog: residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H.
dialog: Blandings.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY
text: MOVING SHOT - Jim and Muriel are visibly affected by the
text: sight of their Dream House. They exchange a warm intimate
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Not bad at that.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT. The car pulls up, stops.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: (efficient scoutmaster)
dialog: All right! -- Everybody out.
text: Everybody piles out of the car. As Jim and Muriel walk toward
text: the house away from us and Bill, Muriel sentimentally reaches
text: out, takes Jim's hand.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Guess you can't blame them for feeling
dialog: just a little bit proud.
text: At the door, Jim stops, indicates that he'd like to carry
text: Muriel across the threshold.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: (sentimentally)
dialog: Look -- he wants to carry his wife
dialog: across the threshold. Romantic, isn't
dialog: it?
scene_heading: JOAN AND BETSY.
text: Joan and Betsy. They look on with distinct adolescent
dialog: disapproval.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Ooops! I guess I meant "corny."
scene_heading: GROUP SHOT. OVER MURIEL'S PLAYFUL PROTEST
text: GROUP SHOT. Over Muriel's playful protest, Jim starts to
dialog: pick her up.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen
dialog: years since you've done this sort of
dialog: thing.
text: Jim manages to lift Muriel.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's
dialog: see if you can make it into the hall.
text: Jim carries Muriel over the threshold and into the foyer.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: That's right. Go right in. Don't pay
text: any attention to the sign.
text: The CAMERA PANS TO a LOW SHOT of a sign on the floor of the
text: foyer. It reads:
speaker_heading: WET VARNISH
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - FOYER.
text: FULL SHOT - foyer. In the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the
text: floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly
text: varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim
text: stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises,
text: throws down his brush, says something caustic.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: (imitating painter)
dialog: Don't mind me, buddy, I just got
text: through varnishing that floor.
text: Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish
text: practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Whose bright idea was this?
text: The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly
text: and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of
dialog: guilt.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: She just wanted everything to be
dialog: nice and shiny on the day they moved
dialog: in.
text: Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Stop painting that floor and put
dialog: some planks down in here, or some
dialog: thing!
text: The painter shouts back.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Okay, mister, but take it easy. The
dialog: Republicans ain't in yet, you know.
text: Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately
text: trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps.
text: Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE - DAY
text: As Jim appears, still carrying Muriel, Betsy and Joan catch
text: his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is
text: complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, fine! A house without windows!
dialog: We'll just see about that!
text: Abruptly handing Muriel to Bill he starts off. Ahead of him
text: and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE
dialog: Look out for those papers!
text: But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet.
text: After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of
text: them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly
text: disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers
text: flapping behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
text: Jim flaps his way up to a workman who is staring at a pile
text: of window casements.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where's Simms?
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
text: Around back trying to figure out
dialog: what to do about them windows.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's the problem? You put windows
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Not these. They don't fit.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (angrily; control
dialog: going)
dialog: Oh, they don't, don't they?
text: He continues on toward the back of the house, the newspapers
text: flapping beneath him.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY
text: Simms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against
text: the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim
text: Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having
text: picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch
text: hands Jim a sheaf of papers.
speaker_heading: RETCH
dialog: Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look
dialog: these over.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's this about the windows?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: I'm afraid there's a little slip-up.
text: These windows seem to belong to a
text: Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York.
dialog: I talked to Mr. Landings this morning.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, has he got mine?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: No, he seems to have some windows
dialog: that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of
dialog: Peekskill.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where are my windows?!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: As near as we can figure out they've
dialog: either been sent to a Mr. Benton in
dialog: Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger
dialog: of Phoenix, Arizona.
text: Bill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What are we supposed to do -- live
dialog: the rest of our lives in a house
dialog: without windows?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: It'll just be a matter of a few days.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's a "Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R"?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: How should I know?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: You've got one.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (reading from bill)
dialog: "Furnishing and installing one Zuz-
dialog: Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and
dialog: eighty dollars!"
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: I will not have any such piece of
dialog: equipment in my house!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr.
dialog: Blandings -- to save your boiler and
dialog: water pipes.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: From what?!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Rust. The plumbing man assures us
dialog: the water from your well is the most
dialog: corrosive in his entire experience
dialog: in the trade.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Another first!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (pursing his lips)
dialog: Mm.
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: Well, if it's necessary, put it in!
dialog: We're moving in today, you know and --
speaker_heading: RETCH
dialog: It's in.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (a final show of
dialog: authority; sharply)
dialog: Then get me the bill for it!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (indicating bill)
dialog: You've got it.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All right then.

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The moving vans are driving away.
scene_heading: INT. THE FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen
text: carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel,
text: list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to
text: Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss
text: painter. In the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is
text: PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Now I want the living room to be a
text: soft green.
dialog: (PeDelford nods)
text: Not quite as bluish as a robin's
text: egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil
text: buds.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (handing him a sample)
dialog: The best sample I could get is a
dialog: little too yellow, but don't let
dialog: whoever mixes it go to the other
dialog: extreme and get it too blue. It should
dialog: just be sort of a grayish yellow
dialog: green.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: (making a note)
dialog: Mm-hmm.
text: They turn to the dining room.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Now the dining room I'd like yellow.
text: Not just yellow, a very gay yellow.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
text: Something bright and sunshiny.
dialog: (sudden inspiration)
dialog: I tell you, Mr. PeDelford, if you'll
dialog: just send one of your workmen to the
dialog: A&amp;P for a pound of their best butter
dialog: and match it exactly, you can't go
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: (making a note)
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: This is the paper we're going to use
text: here in the foyer.
dialog: (hands sample to him)
dialog: It's flowered but I don't want the
dialog: ceiling to match any of the colors
dialog: of the flowers. There are some little
text: dots in the background, and it's
dialog: these dots I want you to match. Not
text: the little greenish dots near the
text: hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish
text: dot between the rosebud and the
dialog: delphinium blossom. Is that clear?
text: PeDelford looks carefully at the sample, then:
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: (making note)
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: The kitchen's to be white. Not a
dialog: cold, antiseptic hospital white -- a
dialog: little warmer but not to suggest any
text: other color but white.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: (note)
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Now for the powder room, I want you
dialog: to match this thread.
dialog: (hands him thread)
dialog: You can see it's practically an apple
text: red. Somewhere between a healthy
text: Winesap and an unripened Jonathan.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: (making note)
dialog: Mm.
text: There is a crash from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Will you excuse me?
text: Muriel hastily exits toward the kitchen. PeDelford turns to
dialog: his assistant.
speaker_heading: PEDELFORD
dialog: Got it, Charlie?

speaker_heading: QUICK DISSOLVE
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS LANDING

speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: BILL

scene_heading: INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: It is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children

text: pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects.
text: Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in
text: the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the
text: room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into
text: the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which
text: contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime
text: accumulation of sentimental trinkets.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Now look what you've done!
text: Betsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle.
text: The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts
dialog: to clear.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Father, the first principle of
dialog: lighting a fire is to see if the

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: out for a three-year-old child!
dialog: (indicates trinkets)
dialog: Get that stuff cleaned up and go in

text: Jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving. After a few
text: moments Muriel, in her nightgown and overcoat, enters the
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Excuse...
text: She takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet, Jim
text: automatically moving around back of it in their previously
text: established pattern. As Muriel puts the paste on her brush,
text: replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her
text: teeth, Jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Excuse...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Muriel, do you have to do that now?!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: There's no need to be so irritable
dialog: just because you have to shave at
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm not irritable!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Well, you're certainly something!
dialog: You haven't said a civil word all
dialog: evening.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sometimes a man doesn't feel like
dialog: talking.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (solicitously)
dialog: What is it, dear? Something down at
dialog: the office?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Have you got the new slogan for
dialog: "Wham"?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's not due yet!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Well, it's something. You're certainly
dialog: upset about something. I can always
dialog: tell.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm not upset.
dialog: (going back to shaving;
dialog: with studied unconcern)
dialog: It's just that I don't happen to
dialog: approve of falsehood and deception.
dialog: Particularly in my own wife.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (same)
dialog: Oh, nothing. It's just that I
dialog: distinctly remember your telling me
dialog: you gave back Bill's fraternity pin
dialog: fifteen years ago.
text: Muriel looks at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, did you or didn't you?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Did I, or didn't I what?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Give it back to him.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Of course I did. If I said I did, I
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (suddenly Sam Spade)
dialog: Then perhaps you'd have the goodness
dialog: to explain how this happened to fall
dialog: out of your jewel box?
text: He takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her. Muriel
text: takes the pin, looks at it sentimentally. Suddenly she looks
text: at Jim and bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You! You're jealous! You're standing
dialog: there with your face full of soap
dialog: and you're jealous.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: If you were so crazy about the guy,
dialog: why didn't you marry him?!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (beginning to be a
dialog: little angry)
dialog: Because I wasn't in love with him!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (vindictively)
dialog: That's not what you said in your
dialog: diary!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (now really angry)
dialog: Oh, now you've been reading my diary!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a little guilty)
dialog: Well -- it happened to fall open
dialog: and... I... happened to look at it.
dialog: It... just happened.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'll just bet!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's all over the book so why don't
dialog: you admit it? You were in love with
dialog: Bill Cole!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Don't be absurd! Of course I was in
dialog: love with Bill. In those days I was
text: in love with a new man every week.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Then why did you marry me?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'm beginning to wonder!
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Maybe it was those big cow eyes of
dialog: yours or that ridiculous hole in
dialog: your chin! Maybe I knew that some
dialog: day you'd bring me out to this thirty-
dialog: eight thousand dollar icebox with a
text: dried-up trout stream and no windows!
dialog: Or maybe I just happened to fall in
dialog: love with you -- but for heaven's
dialog: sake, don't ask me why!
text: Muriel stalks out of the bathroom. Jim looks after her,
text: thoughtfully starts to dry his face.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM
text: Jim enters. Muriel stands with her back to him angrily winding
text: the clock. Jim noisily clears his throat. No reaction.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: ...Muriel?
dialog: No reaction.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...Honey?
dialog: No reaction.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Would it do any good to say I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I don't know.
text: Jim gently turns her around facing him.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy
dialog: and I'm sorry.
text: Muriel looks at Jim. Finally she smiles.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Oh, Jim!
text: She goes into his arms and they kiss intimately. As their
dialog: lips part:
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Why don't you take the soap out of
dialog: your ears?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (same)
dialog: Why do I love you so much?
text: Jim again kisses her tenderly, warmly.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Darling, it's awfully late.
text: Jim kisses her again, a little more ardently.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (same)
dialog: Maybe you ought to go down and lock
text: the doors.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (kissing her ear)
dialog: What for? The windows are all open
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
text: (as he starts to kiss
dialog: her again)
dialog: Jim, you have to get up at six
dialog: o'clock.
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I rather got the impression it had

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (raised eyebrow)
dialog: Oh.
text: He picks up a pencil, nibbles on it thoughtfully. The silence
text: in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the

text: around in his chair and stares soberly out the window.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (ruminatively, almost
dialog: to himself)
dialog: Funny how you look forward to the
dialog: little things. Rain, for instance.

text: comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one
text: Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers,
text: pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole.
text: Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes

text: sharp RINGING of the front doorbell.
speaker_heading: MURIEL

dialog: Thank heavens! The children.

text: He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an
dialog: explanation is necessary.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: Friend of the family. Wet clothes.

text: looks skeptically at Bill.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'm Mrs. Blandings.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: How do. Mrs. Williams just called.
dialog: Says your phone's out of order. Wanted
dialog: me to tell you the water's rising
dialog: and they've got the bridge roped
dialog: off. Girls'll spend the night over
text: at her place.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Thank you. I was beginning to get

speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: No, thanks. Better be gettin' back

scene_heading: INT. JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING
text: The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger
text: impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses
text: that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired,
text: disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt
text: from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty
text: he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently
text: stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the
text: window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods
text: the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully
text: out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his
text: fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting
text: on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (selling; a note of
dialog: desperation in his
dialog: voice)
dialog: "Compare the price, compare the slice,
dialog: Take our advice -- Buy Wham!"
text: Mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. Jim
text: wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with
text: his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose,
text: throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he
text: reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: "If you'd buy better ham. You'd better
dialog: buy Wham!"
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's Boyle Petroleum. "If you'd buy
dialog: better oil, You'd better buy Boyle."
text: Her eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping
text: over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece
text: of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it,
text: kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers.
text: Mary looks up.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: "This little pig went to market As
text: meek and as mild as a lamb. He smiled
dialog: in his tracks When they slipped him
dialog: the axe He knew he'd turn out to be
dialog: Wham!"
text: A long silent look passes between them.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: "...knew he'd turn out to be Wham!"
text: He suddenly and angrily gathers all his papers, slams them
text: into the wastebasket.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (rising panic)
dialog: It's gone! I've lost my touch! Maybe
dialog: I never had a touch! Maybe "Whim Say
dialog: Wham" was an accident! Who knows? I
dialog: can't think any more! All I've got
dialog: on my mind is a house with an eighteen
dialog: thousand dollar mortgage, and bills,
dialog: and extras, and antiques, and -- and --
dialog: (dejected)
dialog: I don't know... I don't know.
text: Mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what
text: to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally
text: distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his
text: desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it
text: with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with
text: determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Home, to get some sleep -- and I'd
dialog: advise you to do the same.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But -- but you haven't --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Suppose I haven't! This isn't the

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Just dropped by to check the

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (arms still around

dialog: Really. What are they?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Well, let's see.
dialog: (thumbing through
dialog: sheets)
dialog: Few little things here, all right, I
dialog: guess. "Mortising five butts -- a
dialog: dollar sixty-eight."
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Let's not quibble about that. A man's
dialog: entitled to mortise a few butts now
dialog: and then.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (next sheet)
dialog: Extra nails and screws -- three
dialog: dollars, eighty-nine cents.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Petty larceny, but let him get away

speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Now there's one here I frankly don't
dialog: understand. Ah, here we are.
dialog: (reads)
dialog: "Changes in closet, twelve hundred
dialog: and forty-seven dollars." Did you
dialog: authorize that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, we probably told him to --
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Twelve hundred and what?!
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: Forty-seven dollars. Changes in
dialog: closet.

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: Who does he think we are!

dialog: What's this notation: "Refer to Detail
dialog: Sheet Number one thirty-five?"
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (indicating blueprints)
dialog: Far as I remember, that would be
text: something in the back of the house.
dialog: Let's just take a look.
text: As he unrolls the blueprints, Jim looks suspiciously at
text: Muriel. She seems a little nervous.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Ah, here we are. It isn't a closet
dialog: at all. It's off the back pantry...
text: Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh... Mrs. Blandings' little flower
dialog: sink.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (to Muriel)
dialog: You didn't authorize any changes,
dialog: did you?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Well... they certainly weren't
dialog: changes.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What -- have -- you -- done?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (speaking rapidly a
dialog: little confused)
dialog: I haven't done anything! And what I
dialog: did was... just nothing at all.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What -- have -- you -- done?!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Well --
dialog: (rattling off)
dialog: All I did was one day I saw four
text: pieces of flagstone left over from
dialog: the porch that were just going to be
dialog: thrown away because nobody wanted
dialog: them and I asked Mr. Retch if he
dialog: wouldn't just put them down on the
text: floor of the flower sink and poke a
text: little cement between the cracks and
dialog: give me a nice stone floor where it
text: might be wet with flowers and things.
dialog: That was absolutely all I did.
text: During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his
text: head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't
dialog: lost on Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's all you did?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Absolutely. Just four little pieces
text: of flagstone.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (to Muriel; wearily)
dialog: Did you by any chance authorize a
dialog: drain?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (verge of tears)
dialog: Of course I didn't. All I said was I
dialog: wanted a nice stone floor and Mr.
dialog: Retch was just as nice as could be
dialog: and said, "You're the doctor," and
dialog: that's all anybody ever said to
dialog: anybody about anything.
text: Jim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...Well?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (sigh; plunging in)
dialog: All right, I think I can tell you
dialog: what happened. First, the carpenters
text: had to rip up the flooring that was
text: already laid. Those planks run under
dialog: the whole width of the pantry, so
dialog: Retch had to knock the bottom out of
text: the pantry wall to get at them.
speaker_heading: JIM AND MURIEL
text: Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were
text: premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over
dialog: this:
speaker_heading: SIMMS' VOICE
text: Then he had to chop out the tops of
text: the joists under the flower sink
dialog: space to make room for a cradle. I
dialog: guess he bought some iron straps and
dialog: fastened them to a big pan to give
text: him something to hold the cement.
dialog: What with that added load on the
dialog: weakened joists, I'll bet he had to
dialog: put a lally column down there for
dialog: support, too.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: It was just four little pieces of
dialog: flagstone, and I only ---
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Quiet!
scene_heading: GROUP SHOT - DURING THE FOLLOWING SPEECH
text: GROUP SHOT - During the following speech we see Bill Cole,
text: in Jim's pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the
text: room. Jim and Muriel are not aware of his presence.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: Well, the main soil pipe runs under
dialog: there on wall brackets, so Retch had
dialog: to get his plumbing man back to take
dialog: out a section so he could get that
dialog: cradle set. I guess that meant he
dialog: had to change the pitch of the soil
text: pipe from one end of the house to
dialog: the other.
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: 'Morning, Mr. Cole.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: 'Morning. Hello, Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Hello, Bill.
text: Jim turns away, reacts, suddenly turns back to Bill, taking
text: in the pajamas and robe. A little shocked but unwilling to
text: believe the implication of what he sees, he looks to Muriel
dialog: for an explanation.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (lamely)
text: The bridge was roped off and Bill
dialog: had to stay last night.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...Oh.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (cheerily)
text: Slept like a rock.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm delighted.
text: Jim looks at Bill, then back at Muriel.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (clearing his throat)
dialog: And then, of course, there are hot
dialog: and cold water pipes hooked to the
text: joists right under that pantry. They
dialog: go up to the wing bathroom on the
dialog: second floor, and I'll bet my bottom
dialog: dollar he had to relocate them.
scene_heading: THREE SHOT - JIM, MURIEL AND BILL.
text: THREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel and Bill. Jim turns to listen but
text: finds himself looking speculatively at Muriel and Bill.

speaker_heading: GUSSIE

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Where were we?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We were at the two hundred twenty
text: volt cable that goes to the stove.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just a minute.
text: (looks at Bill, then
dialog: at Muriel)
dialog: You mean the children weren't here
dialog: last night either?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: How could they be, dear? The bridge
dialog: was closed.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I just came across it.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Well, it was closed last night.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: It's open now!
text: Embarrassed pause.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (attempt at breeziness)
dialog: If you'll all excuse me -- I -- I
dialog: think I'll just go up and slip into
text: something a little more comfortable.
text: Bill exits. Another pause. Simms, aware of the tension, wants
dialog: to get out of there.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (rapidly)
dialog: Well, that's about the size of it --
text: Through Simms' speech, Jim looks darkly at Muriel.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: -- except that Retch had to repair
dialog: the pantry wall and that meant getting
dialog: a plasterer back. And of course, he
dialog: couldn't have broken through that
dialog: wall --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All right, Simms, all right. We'll
dialog: take care of it.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (preparing to exit)
dialog: I'll admit it's a little steep. But
dialog: I'll try to get Retch to knock a
dialog: hundred dollars off the bill. If I
dialog: can't get that, I'll certainly try
dialog: for seventy-five.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: If he doesn't go for seventy-five,
dialog: I'll take a stab at fifty.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You do that.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (at the door)
dialog: Anyway, I'm almost sure we can get
dialog: twenty-five.
text: There is no answer.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (lamely)
dialog: Well. Good day.
text: He leaves. There is a deadly pause.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Now dear, you're upset, you've got a
dialog: lot of things on your mind --
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with dangerous calm)
dialog: Muriel, there's only one thing on my
dialog: mind -- This house -- and how fast
dialog: we can get rid of it!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That's not what you're thinking.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm thinking I
dialog: was once a happy man!
dialog: (the martyr)
dialog: I didn't have a closet, I didn't
dialog: have three bathrooms, but I did have
dialog: my sanity, a few dollars in the bank,
dialog: two children who loved me and a wife
dialog: I could trust!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That's a fine thing to say!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I also had a job at Danton and
dialog: Bascomb, something I don't happen to
dialog: have at the moment!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Jim!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's right, I've resigned! We're
dialog: starting all over again! From scratch!
dialog: And without this house!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (near tears)
dialog: You love this house!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I hate it!
text: In the b.g. Mr. Tesander enters, cap in hand, stands there,
text: nervous and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You don't mean that.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Every word of it! Anybody who builds
dialog: a house today is crazy! The minute
dialog: you start, they put you on the list.
dialog: The All-American Sucker list!
dialog: Everywhere you turn they've got a
dialog: hand in your pocket. If you take out
dialog: their hands, they find more pockets!
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a
dialog: conspiracy against every man and
dialog: woman who want a home of their own!
dialog: Against every boy and girl who were
dialog: ever in love!
text: Tesander clears his throat. Jim turns.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: What do you want?!
text: A slight embarrassed pause. Then:
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: (shyly)
dialog: Well, Mr. Blandings, there's a matter
dialog: of twelve dollars and eighty-six
dialog: cents.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with a wild gleam)
dialog: Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents!
dialog: Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander?
dialog: (emptying pockets)
dialog: Take everything I've got! Spread it
dialog: out among your pals!
dialog: (advancing toward the
dialog: bewildered Tesander)
dialog: Wouldn't Retch like a little
dialog: something? Maybe Zucca could use my
dialog: new dinner jacket? It's open house,
dialog: Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this
dialog: isn't enough I'll come over to your
dialog: place and do some odd chores. Maybe
dialog: I can mow your lawn or scratch your
dialog: back!
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: (simply)
dialog: You don't understand, Mr. Blandings.
dialog: This twelve dollars and eighty-six
dialog: cents -- you don't owe me, I owe
dialog: you.
text: There is a momentary pause.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: ...W-what was that?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: (taking out money)
dialog: Found I overcharged you. Almost three
dialog: feet.
text: He hands the money to Jim, who stares at it blankly.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Better count it. I think it's all
dialog: there.
text: Jim looks haplessly at Muriel, sheepish, guilty.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Well, I guess I'd better be gettin'
dialog: along.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Sure got a pretty place here.
dialog: (at door; pauses;
dialog: looks back)
dialog: I'll tell Mr. Zucca about the dinner
dialog: jacket.
text: Jim and Muriel look at each other a little sheepishly.
scene_heading: INT. THE FOYER
text: As Tesander is about to exit, Bill, dressed, starts down the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh, Mr. Tesander -- could you give
dialog: me a lift to town?
speaker_heading: TESANDER
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Be right with you.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: What did you mean before about losing
dialog: your job? Will we really have to
dialog: sell the house?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (miserable)
dialog: I don't know, dear... I don't know.
text: Bill enters.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: In case anyone's interested, I'm
text: leaving for town.
dialog: (for Jim's benefit)
dialog: If you want to count the silverware,
dialog: I'll wait.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Bill, be patient with me. Maybe one
dialog: of these days I'll grow up.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Muriel)
dialog: What happened to him?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Mind if I say something?
text: Jim and Muriel look at him curiously.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You know, I've kind of been the voice
dialog: of doom about this whole project.
dialog: Every step of the way I was firmly
dialog: convinced you were getting fleeced,
text: bilked, rooked, flimflammed and
dialog: generally taken to the cleaners. And
dialog: maybe you were. Maybe it cost you a
dialog: whole lot more than you thought it
dialog: would. Maybe there were times when
dialog: you wished you'd never started the
dialog: whole thing. But when I look around
dialog: and see what you two have here -- I
dialog: don't know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Maybe there are some things you should
dialog: buy with your heart and not with
dialog: your head. Maybe those are the things
dialog: that really count... See you around.
text: As Bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening
text: and the kids appear. There is an exchange of "Hi's" as they
dialog: pass.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: 'Morning, everybody!
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Hi, Dad! How come you're not at the
dialog: office?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a look at Muriel)
dialog: I'm on a... kind of a vacation.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You mean you got fired?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, not exactly, I --
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: We'll discuss it later.
text: Gussie's head appears from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: GUSSIE
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Come and get it! Breakfast everybody.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Good! I'm starving! What are we
dialog: having, Gussie?
speaker_heading: GUSSIE
dialog: Orange juice, scrambled eggs and you-
dialog: know-what.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (making a face)
dialog: Ham?
speaker_heading: GUSSIE
dialog: Not ham -- Wham!
dialog: (cheerily)
dialog: If you ain't eatin' Wham, you ain't
dialog: eatin' ham!
text: Gussie's head disappears.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JIM.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What did she say?
text: He reacts with the sudden exhilaration of Balboa first seeing
text: the Pacific. He snaps his fingers.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Darling, give Gussie a ten dollar
dialog: raise!
text: His eyes light up as he begins to visualize.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INSERT ADVERTISEMENT IN MAGAZINE - It is a picture of Gussie,
text: smiling, holding a platter with an enormous ham. Under it,
dialog: the simple caption:
text: "IF YOU AIN'T EATIN' WHAM, YOU AIN'T EATIN' HAM!"
text: THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO DISCLOSE MR. JAMES BLANDINGS
text: THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Mr. James Blandings
text: reclining in a hammock on the patio of his Dream House. In
text: the b.g. Muriel is working at her garden, Joan and Betsy
text: assisting her. Jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he
text: sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and
text: picks up a book which he has been reading. As the CAMERA
text: COMES IN for an EXTREME CLOSE SHOT of Jim we see the title
text: of the book on the jacket cover. It reads:
text: "MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE"
text: Jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the
text: camera and winks.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (with simple sincerity)
dialog: Drop in and see us sometime.
text: As the CAMERA PULLS AWAY to a LONG SHOT tableau of the
dialog: Blandings and their Dream House, we:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
