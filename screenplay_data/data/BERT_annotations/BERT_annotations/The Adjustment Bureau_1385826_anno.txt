speaker_heading: PUNDIT #1

speaker_heading: PUNDIT #2
dialog: That's bad for any candidate but
dialog: it's fatal if you're running for
dialog: Senate at the age of 33, your

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Well, everything happens for a

text: She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why not? I have to think up some

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Why the hell would you do that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Apparently, even if I hadn't been

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN

scene_heading: EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING
text: Harry spots the bus passing on Park. He jams his fedora on
text: his head and stretches his arm out--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Now.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
text: David's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he
text: fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of
text: coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, Jesus...
speaker_heading: (FIGHTING LAUGHTER)
dialog: I'm sorry.
scene_heading: EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH -- MORNING
text: Harry's face.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shit!
text: He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse

scene_heading: INT.'BUS -- MORNING
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll pay for the damage.

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: God, that is smooth. Spill coffee

text: She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip,
text: then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Just let me spill some on you and
dialog: we'll be even.
text: She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's my first day at the office!
speaker_heading: WOMAN

dialog: It's New York; he'll understand.

speaker_heading: WOMAN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: He's not here!
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who was that?

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What is this, third grade?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 22.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You forgot what that was like,
dialog: didn't you? How fun it was...
text: That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh my God! How do you stand it?
text: She drops the phone into the coffee.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: There. We're even.
text: He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows
dialog: what would come next if they were in private...
text: The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Sturdy little fucker, isn't it?
text: She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her
text: scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail.
text: Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: By the way, I'm Elise.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY
text: Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching
text: her. She turns back to look at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The morning after .I lost I woke up
dialog: thinking about you .
text: That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
text: Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise
text: walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him

scene_heading: EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING
text: Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus.

scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
text: David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper.
text: He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes
dialog: the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life--
scene_heading: EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING
text: Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his
text: Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus--
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
text: Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the
dialog: cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all
text: over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dammit!
text: Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus--
text: HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him.
text: TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--
scene_heading: INT. RSR CAPITAL -- CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING
text: A big corner office. The phone rings. Charlie picks up.
speaker_heading: DAVID (TEL. V.O.)
dialog: Guess who I just sat down next to

text: INTERCUTTING WITH CHARLIE
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 24.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (TEL. V.O.)
dialog: The one you kissed?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She kissed me. I just didn't
dialog: fight it.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING
text: Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for
text: something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front
dialog: tire.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (O.S.)
dialog: You're shitting me. Just randomly
dialog: you sit down next to--
text: He's cut off mid-word.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Charlie?
text: David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David
text: hits redial. Gets a fast busy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ' (to himself).
dialog: This is ridiculous.
text: He pockets his phone.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH MORNING
text: The taxi driver is with Harry now.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
dialog: for something.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm fine-- Will you hand me that?
text: Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
text: feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 25.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you sure you're okay?
text: The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
dialog: page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
text: Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
text: symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
dialog: language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
dialog: And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
text: lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh...shit...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING
text: David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office
text: tower. He enters through the revolving door--
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S OFFICE BUILDING'-- GROUND FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING
text: Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other
text: end of the lobby. David gets into an empty elevator.
scene_heading: INT. 41ST FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING
text: David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He
text: waves as-he:passes by. No wade back. She must not see him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay...
text: Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.
scene_heading: INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING
text: David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul
text: in sight. Not a single secretary is here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (loud, playful)
dialog: Doesn't anybody bother getting in
dialog: before eight at this place?
text: David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a
text: large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
text: marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 26.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (EXUBERANT)
dialog: Susan! How are you today?
dialog: (when she doesn't move)
dialog: Susan?
text: David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Susan?
text: He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
text: still. David rushes through Charlie's door:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Call 911! Something's wrong with
dialog: Susan!
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING
text: --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with
text: the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum.
text: He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver
dialog: protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
text: One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached
text: to the left side.of Charlie's skull.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus!
text: Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see
dialog: David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the
text: "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.
speaker_heading: DAVID (,.CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
text: Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Grab him!
text: David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--
scene_heading: INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING
text: David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he
text: gets there. He grabs it. It's locked.
text: He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges
text: from a door in the middle of the hallway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 27.
text: David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that
dialog: Richardson could have gotten there that fast.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: You can't get away, David.
text: David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down
text: an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
text: five steps and hits the floor hard.
text: As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
text: frozen solid.
text: David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find
text: Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.
dialog: Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast--
text: David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a
text: chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT...
text: FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of
text: the large corner offices on the 40th floor.
text: The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid."
text: Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,
speaker_heading: INSIDE --
text: Except when they walk through the door they're not in an
text: office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a
dialog: large warehouse...
dialog: Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: Silence. Then voices come up slowly:
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I
dialog: understand that, sir. Absolutely.
dialog: I'll do that, sir.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What a goddamm mess.
speaker_heading: MCCRADY (O.S.)
dialog: Was that Donaldson?
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (O.S.)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MCCRADY (O.S.)
dialog: What do you want to do?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 28.
text: FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse
text: David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out.
text: A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver
text: Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men
text: from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (O.S.)
dialog: Can you reset him?
speaker_heading: MCCRADY (O.S.)
dialog: I don't think we have the authority
dialog: in a situation like this.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (O.S.)
speaker_heading: CALL LEGAL-
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY (0.S.).
dialog: Legal just arrived.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit,
text: carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson.
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY
dialog: Re-setting's off the table. This
dialog: is our fault:...
text: Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself
text: off to the side, clearly disgraced.
text: David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson,
text: cranes around to see who's talking.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey.
text: The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to
text: talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: What are my options?
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY
speaker_heading: (IGNORING DAVID)
dialog: You could bullshit him but you'll
dialog: never be completely successful.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Can somebody tell me what's going
dialog: on?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 29.
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY
dialog: (still ignoring him)
dialog: The questions will burn in him till
dialog: the day he dies. You'll have to
dialog: monitor him constantly...
speaker_heading: ON DAVID
text: He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE)
dialog: .to make sure he doesn't talk...
dialog: the endless ripple effects...
text: REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.
speaker_heading: ON THE SUITS
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY
dialog: If it were me, I'd level with him.
speaker_heading: RIC:HARDSON
dialog: Completely?
speaker_heading: BURDENSKY
dialog: That's the only way to extinguish
dialog: his curiosity.
text: Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
text: An uncomfortable pause.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who are you guys?
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: We're the people v ho make sure
dialog: things happen according to Plan.
text: David stares back at him for a moment.
text: then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He
text: sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.
text: Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR
text: It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as
text: David's foot comes down on it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 30.
dialog: BACK TO WIDE SHOT
dialog: David trips and goes flying--
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
text: back in his chair in front of Richardson.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Did you really think I couldn't see
dialog: that coming?
text: David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I can read your mind!
text: David stares back.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, really...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Choose a color.
dialog: (barely a beat)
dialog: Blue. Choose a number.
dialog: (even less time)
dialog: Seventeen.
text: David's jaw drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Now,. why are you still deciding
dialog: whether or not to run?
text: David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic
text: response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from
text: spilling out into view.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: You saw the futility of that back
text: at the office.
text: David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
text: point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all
dialog: this based in the world he's known to date...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the hell is happening to me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 31.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: You just saw behind a curtain you
dialog: weren't even supposed to know was
text: there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring.
dialog: I'm sure.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just... came to work...
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: It wasn't your fault. Your Path
dialog: through the world this morning was
dialog: supposed to be adjusted.
dialog: (glancing bitterly at
dialog: Harry, in the corner)
dialog: Your coffee was supposed to.spill
dialog: onto your shirt as you left
dialog: Starbucks near your apartment.
dialog: You would have gone up to change
dialog: and arrived at work ten minutes
dialog: later than you did. By then we
dialog: would have left.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: People call it "chance" when their
dialog: coffee spills or their internet
dialog: goes down or they misplace their
dialog: keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes
dialog: it's:us...nudging you back on Plan.
text: David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whatever you were doing to Charlie
dialog: back there... it wasn't misplacing
dialog: his keys.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Sometimes. when nudging a person
dialog: back on Plan isn't enough we
dialog: intervene directly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why Charlie? What did you do to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: You need to worry about getting
dialog: back on your Plan, David, not worry
dialog: about us putting him back on his.
text: David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Only a handful of human beings know
dialog: what you now know, David. We're
dialog: determined to keep it that way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 32.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
dialog: So before I let you go, you need to
dialog: understand something: If you ever
dialog: reveal our existence we will erase
dialog: your brain. Your memories, your
dialog: emotions, your entire personality
dialog: will be expunged. Your friends and
dialog: family will think you've gone
dialog: crazy. You won't "think" anything
dialog: because a blank slate can't
dialog: "think."
dialog: Davidstares back.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Do you understand what I just said?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Not a word. Not one word about us.
dialog: (long beat as he studies
speaker_heading: DAVID'S FACE)
dialog: okay ... . you're free to go.
text: David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson
text: points at the door. David walks toward it.
text: Just then another man comes up to Richardson.
scene_heading: NEW MAN IN SUIT
dialog: There's awoman.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: There's always &amp; Woman...
text: Richardson motions;to his men.
speaker_heading: At.-THE DOOR
text: Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He said I could go.
speaker_heading: CENTER OF ROOM
scene_heading: NEW MAN IN SUIT
dialog: You won't believe who she is.
text: He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 33.
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: How is that possible? Why didn't
dialog: we get an alert?
scene_heading: NEW MAN IN SUIT
dialog: He wasn't supposed to be on that
dialog: bus. He was supposed to be
text: changing his shirt in his
dialog: apartment... It was a controlled
dialog: situation. It was supposed to be.
text: The new man looks at Harry.
speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR
text: David looks back at Richardson.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You said I could go.
text: Richardson walks over to him.
speaker_heading: RIC,HARDSON
dialog: You ran into a woman named Elise on
dialog: the bus this morning?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (:going very still)
dialog: Why does it'matter?
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: You weren't ever supposed to see
dialog: her again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why do you care.?
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Because, David, you can't be with
dialog: her. And we didn't want to have to
dialog: resort to this--
text: Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
text: prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches
text: into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the hell-- What are you--
text: Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
dialog: number on from David's wallet--
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: NO--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 34.
text: Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then
text: pulls out a lighter--
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
text: loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
dialog: men. But he can't get free.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: What is wrong with you people?!
text: Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.
dialog: ON David's reaction CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
text: He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
text: walking to the corner to orient himself.
text: Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
text: the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON
text: David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You're David Norris, right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ice water.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: That's it?
text: David nods. Harry arrives.
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
text: Harry can see that David is still very shaken.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: The world's exactly the same as
dialog: it's always been. You just
dialog: understand it more completely now.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hang on to what mattered before you
dialog: knew any of this and you'll be

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on. You can't be serious.
dialog: (off David's look)
dialog: You're serious... Oh, man...dude.
dialog: I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...
scene_heading: EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY
text: David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks

scene_heading: EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY
text: The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
text: there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands
text: looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A lot of people just collapse when
dialog: they see what you've s'een. Their
dialog: personal choices suddenly seem
dialog: meaningless to them. Life starts
dialog: to feel pointless.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was` raised to believe there's
dialog: something behind the curtain. I
dialog: just never pictured it quite like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Most people don't.
text: Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
text: colleagues. He's far from relaxed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You should know. You can read my
dialog: mind, right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 38.
text: Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David,
dialog: how far to go with this. Finally:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Richardson was just trying to scare
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He knew what color I was thinking.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Because he set it up as a choice.
dialog: "Choose a color. Choose a number"
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So?
text: Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
dialog: himself out there:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We can't read your mind or hear
dialog: your thoughts. But before you make
dialog: a choice your brain weighs options,
dialog: and we percpite that. We know if
dialog: you're going to go off Plan "or not
dialog: because, as long as we're close
dialog: enough, we cansense it when it's
text: about to happen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Seventh, actually.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did they do too Charlie?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Made some small change in the way
dialog: he assesses risk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What type of risk?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (this is beside the point)
dialog: I don't know. Something arcane.
dialog: Something to do with mortgage-
dialog: backed securities.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's all?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 39
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What would your colleagues do to
dialog: you if they knew what you were
dialog: telling me?
text: This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's why we're meeting out here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're not following me?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We don't have the manpower to
dialog: follow everybody all the time.
dialog: They're checking in on you. Just
dialog: not here. Not right now.
text: ON David's face considering this.
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER DECK DAY
text: Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
dialog: tourists up here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why are you helping me?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I have my reasons.
text: David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into
speaker_heading: THEM:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why do they care if I'm with Elise?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Your entire reality gets shattered
dialog: this morning and you want to know
dialog: about a woman?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why do they care?
text: Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
dialog: seems to care.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 40.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You have no idea?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All I know is, given the amount of
dialog: resources they've used, keeping you
dialog: from her is pretty important to
dialog: them.
dialog: (off David's silence)
dialog: You're going to look for her aren't
dialog: you?
text: Again, David is silent.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: There are twelve million people in
dialog: this city. On a slow day. You're
dialog: not going to find her, you do
dialog: realize that, don't yore-?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Even if a hypnotist pulled her
dialog: number out of the recesses of your
dialog: brain, no matter how many times you
dialog: called it, you,'d never get
dialog: through...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (his face hardening)
dialog: They send you here to tell me that?
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You want my advice? Forget about
dialog: her. Accept that you'`&gt;ll never see
dialog: her again. Move on with your life.
text: ON David as Harry's words sink in.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
text: Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
text: David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING
text: An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's
text: already awake, staring at the ceiling...
text: After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
text: off. But then just lies there...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 41.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
text: It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead
text: of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six
text: windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to
text: his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.
dialog: No files on the table, like there were the last time we were
text: here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: How are you feeling about the
dialog: speech?
text: David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
text: subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm ready... I changed a few
dialog: things last night.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Tell me at breakfast.
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
text: David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
text: a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
text: moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
text: David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
dialog: park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
dialog: ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MORNING
text: David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
text: reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
text: out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING
text: David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
text: a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
text: window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
text: DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 42.
text: David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
text: now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
text: eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
text: to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Stop the bus.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: The next stop--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now.
scene_heading: EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING
text: The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Elise!
text: The woman turns around.
dialog: And it's her...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Wow... How areyou.
text: Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (from the heart)
dialog: I rode the Ml to work every day for
dialog: the last three years hoping one day
dialog: I'd run into you again.
text: She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Calling would have been easier.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I couldn't.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Girlfriend wouldn't let you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 43.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No girlfriend.
text: She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
text: expression is dead serious.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we go somewhere and talk?
text: She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
dialog: herself for that, but it's the truth.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (re: his suit)
dialog: Don't you have to get to work?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just got sick.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: "I haven't seen you in three years -
dialog: - You make me sick" is not an
dialog: ideal come-on. For the record.
text: David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
text: vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: One second.
speaker_heading: (PICKING UP)
dialog: CharlieT can't make breakfast.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And...I might have to push the
dialog: speech.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: What? Are you crazy?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just ran into Elise.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You just hung up on your best

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've known each other since we
dialog: were kids. We have a shorthand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2/12/09 44.
dialog: He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-
dialog: of-fact. Serious.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What speech?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk.
text: His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
text: reeled in again.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Somewhere far. We have a lot to
dialog: talk about.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I don't think you should cancel
dialog: your speech. What if I don't like
dialog: you at the end of our walk?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll take my chances.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Seri6us1y, my number hasn't
dialog: changed:. Just call me like you
dialog: didn't last time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My-speech will always be there, you

speaker_heading: ELISE
speaker_heading: (AMUSED/INDIGNANT)
dialog: I was there, David. You didn't

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Walk with me and I'll explain that.

speaker_heading: EL ;E
dialog: Would it-Matter?
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (TRAPPED)
dialog: Uh...yeah...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: So all the stuff about me being in
dialog: your mind constantly for the last
dialog: three years was just talk... The
dialog: truth is you don't have any real
dialog: conviction.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It wouldn't matter.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: So you don't care about being a
dialog: home-wrecker?
dialog:

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay... if you were married it would

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: ELISE

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: ELISE
speaker_heading: (DUH)
dialog: Um, you had a girlfriend and you

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: ELISE

speaker_heading: DONALDSON

speaker_heading: DONALDSON
dialog: Something important. They went

dialog: cost. Most people go through life

dialog: to the stimuli I apply. They
dialog: accept the path they find
dialog: themselves on. And perform
dialog: accordingly. But every once in a
dialog: while someone comes along who

dialog: someone who understands that Free
dialog: Will is a gift most people are too
dialog: afraid to use.

dialog: better. Because that's the other
dialog: part.
text: David and Elise take it in...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And all the misery, all the pain...
speaker_heading: THE CHAIRMAN
text: I sit up there and I watch it and
dialog: it hurts me... . but if you could see
dialog: the incredible courage people show,
dialog: the random acts of kindness, the
dialog: love... If you could see huitan
dialog: beings choosing every moment
dialog: every day to be better thAn'' I made
dialog: them, you would know it's all
dialog: worthwhile.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Good luck, David. And good luck to
dialog: you, Elise. You're a-beautiful
dialog: dancer. And so much more...
