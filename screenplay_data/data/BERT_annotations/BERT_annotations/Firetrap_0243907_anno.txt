scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN QUICEO - NIGHT
text: Detroit's skyscrapers shoot up on the horizon. Quicho’s ten
text: miles from Detroit, but it might as well be a hundred.
dialog: Quicho's got it all: freezing weather, a closed down steel
text: mill, and a diner that advertises a burnt cup of Maxwell
dialog: House as "The World's Greatest Coffee." If Dr. Kevorkian
dialog: took towns as patients, Quicho would be at the top of h
dialog: list.
dialog: 
text: A police truck stops in front of the bank. Chief MARTY WALSH
text: hops out of the truck and walks over to the bank. Checks to
dialog: make sure that the doors are locked.
dialog: Marty's in his mid 30's. He'd be a good-looking guy if he
dialog: followed through on his perennial New Year resolutions to
dialog: switch to light beer and eat less red meat.
text: He walks across the street to the Post Office. Checks the
text: doors. Locked up tight.
text: Marty climbs back into his truck. Si
scene_heading: EXT. QUICHO COUNTRY STORE - NIGHT
text: Marty walks up to the front door. The store's closed. He
text: pulls out a large key-ring, shuffles through the keys.
text: Finds the one he wants. Opens up the store. Walks in.
scene_heading: INT. QUICHO COUNTRY STORE - CONTINUOUS
text: Marty walks through the dark store. He grabs a six-pack of
text: Bud out of a cooler. Walks over to the cash register. Does
text: a double-take at the porn magazines. Picks up a "Playboy."
text: Flips through the pages for a quick beat.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (off centerfold)
dialog: Nineteen eighty-one? Jesus, I'm
dialog: getting old.
text: Marty tosses it back on the rack. Then he throws a $5 bill
text: and a note that reads, "6er of Bud -- Marty" on the cash
dialog: register.
scene_heading: INT. QUICHO POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: The station is small. It's made up of a large bullpen area,
text: Quicho's single jail cell, and Marty's office, which looks
text: out on the bullpen.
text: Marty lays on the cot in the cell, watching "Sportscenter" on
text: TV as he sips a Bud.
dialog: 
text: phene rings. Marty pulls himself up, reaches between
text: bars and answers it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Chief Walsh.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.; ON PHONE)
dialog: Chief, it's Ann Harrison.
dialog: Somebody broke into my house.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I'll be right over.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Marty walks up the walkway to a small house. Before he gets
text: there, the door opens. ANN HARRISON stands in the doorway,
text: wearing just an oversized t-shirt.
dialog: Ann is beautiful -- especially by Quicho's standards. She's
dialog: Marty's age, but even if he kept up his New Years's
dialog: resolutions she'd probably be out of his league. If Ann's
dialog: face couldn't launch a thousand ships, it could get at least
text: a couple hundred out of the harbor.
text: Marty takes a long, less than professional, look at Ann as he
text: walks into the house.
scene_heading: INT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: A modest house. A lot of things are still boxed up. Can't
text: tell whether Ann is moving in or moving out.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Did you get a look at him, Ann?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Yeah. He's about your height,
dialog: your weight. Come to think of it,
dialog: he kinda looked like you.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: So he was good looking.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: No. :
text: Marty stares at her for a beat. She stares right back. A
text: smile escapes from her full lips.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Sorry. Just not my type.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Well, bony dyed blondes aren't my
dialog: type.
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: {out loud)
dialog: So -- this ugly man -- do you know
dialog: how he got in the house?
speaker_heading: ANN
text: The bedroom window.
text: Marty follows her into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Marty checks the windows. They're all locked now.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Why don't you tell me what
dialog: happened? .
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Okay...
text: Ann jumps in bed, pretends to be asleep.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I was asleep. But then I woke
dialog: up, 'cause I felt the cold. I saw
text: the window was open. Then I saw
text: him. He was standing right where
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Right here?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: Then what'd he do?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: He came toward me...
text: Marty comes closer to her.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Like this?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Uh-huh. Then he grabbed me.
text: Marty grabs her arms. Pins her to the bed.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Like this?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: But he was much stronger than you.
dialog: (beat)
text: Then he forced himself on top of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Like this?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (nods)
text: Uh-huh. And his breath reeked.
dialog: Kinda like yours.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Then what happened?
speaker_heading: — ANN
dialog: He kissed me.
text: Marty kisses her.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Then he stripped me naked.
text: Marty starts to pull Ann's shirt over her head as he
text: continues to kiss her. Ann starts to moan.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm sorry, I was confused. He
dialog: ripped my shirt off.
text: Marty rips her shirt down the middle, exposing her breasts.
text: He licks at her breasts, teasing them with his tongue. Ann
text: moans in pleasure.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You didn't put up much of a fight.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh, really?
text: Ann flips Marty over so that she's on top of him. She
text: fumbles with his belt, kicks his pants off of him. She rips
text: open his shirt -- the buttons fly off. In seconds, they're
text: both naked.
text: Ann straddles Marty.... grinds her hips into him... She
text: arches her back, pushes her breasts into his face... He pulls
text: her closer to him... Pushes deeper inside of her...
text: The bed starts to shake. The springs squeak. Sweat begins
text: to pour off of them as they claw at each other.
dialog: ut
text: They groan leuder, both racing toward climax. As they move
dialog: together in perfect rhythm we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: Marty and Ann lay in bed, both spent and wearing expressions
dialog: of contentment.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Did I tell you how glad I am that
dialog: you moved back here?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Well, that makes one of us.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Come on, Quicho's not that bad.
text: She gives him a look as if to say, "who you kidding?"
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Alright, it's awful. But it's a
dialog: lot better with you here.
text: Marty's cell phone rings. He starts to get out of bed, but
text: is jerked back -- his right hand is handcuffed to the
text: headboard.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Can you get that, babe?
text: Ann hops out of the bed and looks around Marty's discarded
text: clothes until she finds the cell phone. She tosses it to
dialog: Marty.
speaker_heading: MARTY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Chief Walsh.
text: Marty listens for a long beat.
speaker_heading: MARTY (INTO PHONE}
dialog: I'm on my way.
text: Marty hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (to Ann)
dialog: Jay Guiney just tore up the
dialog: Crowbar again. I gotta put him in
dialog: the tank.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I don't think you're going anywhere.
dialog: Oy
text: She smiles and holds up the keys to the handcuffs.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN QUICHO - DAY
text: Marty, in his button-less police shirt, walks down the
text: street, waving and talking to people. e stops ata
text: newspaper machine. Puts his quarter and grabs a paper.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - DAY
text: Marty is parked along a country highway, a radar gun sticking
text: out his window. Marty is reading the newspaper that he
text: bought. The lead story reads: "Sarcetti Found Guilty." A
text: picture of Marty testifying in court is tucked under the
dialog: headline.
text: A Ford Escort whips past Marty. The gun reads 70 MPH. Marty
text: starts up the truck, hits the sirens. Pulls out after the
dialog: Escort.
text: The Escort pulls over. Marty stops his truck. Jumps out.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Marty walks up to the Escort. The DRIVER flashes a cocky
text: smile at Marty. It's clear that there is no love lost
dialog: between these two.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Problem, Chief?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You were speeding.
text: The driver is CHRIS HARRISON, Quicho's 1985 Homecoming King.
text: Chris is built like a brick shit-house, still waiting for
text: that day when they let 35 year old has-beens suit up for
text: their high school football team.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (DRIVER)
dialog: C'mon. You're not gonna write me
dialog: a ticket for that.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Chris, see, since you left town,
dialog: things have changed a little. We
dialog: actually made a new law -- now
dialog: speed limits apply to former high
dialog: school quarterbacks as well as
dialog: everybody else.
text: The unseen passenger laughs. And we recognize that laugh...
text: it's Ann. But instead of Marty flipping out at seeing his
text: lover in another man's car, Marty barely even looks at Ann.
dialog: 
dialog: C'mon, we're late for Ann's
dialog: doctor's appointment.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (real concern)
dialog: Everything all right?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (leans forward)
dialog: I'm fine, Marty.
text: Chris pats Ann’s knee. Ann moves her leg so that Chris’ hand
text: falls off. Marty rips up the ticket.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I'm gonna let you off with a
dialog: warning. Consider it your welcome
text: home present, Chris.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: MARTY —
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I said, "thanks."
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You should put your seatbelt on,
dialog: Ann.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Chris, you can keep yours off.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Marty tips his hat and walks back toward his car. As Marty
text: walks back to his truck, he lowers his mask. It kills him
dialog: that Ann is married to Chris.
text: In the b.g. Chris peels back onto the highway. By the time
text: he's out of sight, he's going faster than when Marty pulled
text: him over.
scene_heading: EXT. QUICHO'S POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Marty pulls up. A beat-up Mazda RX-7 is parked in Marty's
text: clearly marked parking spot. Marty turns into another space,
text: but makes sure that he leaves a nice dent on the Mazda's back
dialog: bumper.
dialog: eo
scene_heading: INT. QUICHO'S POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Marty walks in, carrying the radar gun.
text: TONY DALTEN, Marty's second in command (and Quicho's only
text: other. full time cop), sits at his desk. Tony's at the age
text: where he's more concerned about fighting acne than fighting
dialog: crime.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Hey, T. Chae here?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Bathroom.
text: Dr. CHAE YI walks out of the bathroom, a newspaper tucked
text: under his arm. He's the county coroner and Marty's best
dialog: friend. -
text: Chae is an Asian man who could be anywhere from 30 to 60.
dialog: His steady diet of nicotine and alcohol have virtually
dialog: guaranteed that he'll be on the receiving end of an autopsy
dialog: in the next couple of years.
text: He walks over to Marty, wipes his wet hands on Marty's shirt.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: You need paper towels.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (gestures to parking lot)
dialog: Maybe I'll buy ‘em with the money
dialog: I get from your parking ticket.
text: Marty walks into his office, Chae on his heels.
text: Chae holds up the newspaper with Marty's picture on it.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: I thought the camera only added
dialog: ten pounds.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I was wondering how long it was
dialog: going to take you to bring that up.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: Maybe now is a good time to
dialog: revisit my offer to invest the
dialog: money --~-
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: "Investing?" I always thought it
dialog: was called "misappropriation of
dialog: funds."
dialog: w
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: Seven hundred grand in a stock
dialog: fund, figure ten percent return
dialog: over a year. Dean could set it up.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You mean Dean could launder it.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: You say "to-mato", I say "tom-ato."
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Let's call the whole thing off.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: This could be our seed money.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You two still going to Costa Rica
dialog: to open that fishing business?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (taps his watch)
dialog: T, it's almost two-thirty.
text: Tony nods glumly as he grabs a crossing guard sash anda
text: handheld stop sign off the wall. He checks his gun to make
dialog: sure it's loaded.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Make sure you shoot to kill out
dialog: there.
text: Tony leaves.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: I spoke to my buddy who runs the
dialog: charter business there--
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: "Buddy?" You met him in a chat
dialog: room.
text: Marty goes to a wall-size safe. Marty dials the combo, then
text: unlocks it with a key. He opens the safe, walks in. Chae
text: follows behind him. The safe is the evidence locker.
speaker_heading: EVIDENCE LOCKER
text: The evidence locker is sparsely filled with a collection of
text: guns, knives, and other odd pieces of evidence. But Chae is
text: not interested in any of that. He is looking at a large
text: evidence bag of $100 bills. The bag is marked, "Sarcetti
dialog: case - No. 23432."
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: You know it's very tough to
dialog: extradite from Costa Rica.
text: Marty ignores him, puts the radar gun on a shelf.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: What the hell they gonna do with
dialog: the money anyway? Print up some
dialog: "Just Say No" bumper stickers.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: f£ they do, I'll make sure you get
dialog: a whole bunch.
text: Marty pushes Chae out of the evidence safe. Locks it.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: Ten years we've been talking about
dialog: this. About getting out of here.
text: Chae's cell phone rings. He answers it, listens for a beat,
text: then hangs up.
speaker_heading: CHAE,
dialog: Shit. What kind of prick dies
dialog: this late on a Friday afternoon
dialog: before a three day weekend?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: The nerve of some people.
text: Chae walks out of the station. Marty sits down at his desk.
text: Chae walks back in.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: Hey.
text: Marty looks up to see Chae giving him the finger.
speaker_heading: CHAE
dialog: Thanks for the dent, asshole.
scene_heading: INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Marty sits on a tired couch, talking on the phone and looking
text: at his Palm VII.
speaker_heading: MARTY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey, T. It's me. How's
dialog: everything at the office?
speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.; ON PHONE)
dialog: Uh, good, good.
speaker_heading: MARTY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Great, great. Then I just have
dialog: one question for you? Why the
dialog: hell are you at the god damn diner!
scene_heading: MARTY!'S PALM: The GPS (Global Positioning System) module is
text: activated. He's looking at a map of Quicho. Tony is
text: represented by a blinking blip on the screen.
speaker_heading: TONY (0.S.; ON PHONE)
dialog: Shit!
text: Knock-knock. Marty looks up. Ann walks in.
speaker_heading: MARTY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Get your ass back there, T.
text: Marty hangs up, then walks over to Ann. She looks troubled.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Can you take a ride with me?
scene_heading: INT. ANN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Marty and Ann drive into Detroit. The skyscrapers tower
text: around them. They drive in silence. Marty starts to say
text: something, but stops himself. They pull into a hospital
text: parking lot.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Annie. What's going on?
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT / DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Marty and Ann walk toward the hospital.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Can you walk a little behind me?
dialog: This is Chris's hospital.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: He's working now?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: No, I'm just worried about his
dialog: friends.
text: Ann walks into the hospital. Marty waits a beat and then
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. DETROIT MERCY - DAY
text: Ann talks to a nurse. Marty hangs back. He noticés a sign
text: above the nurses' station: Oncology Department.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Shit.
text: Ann comes back out. Marty follows Ann downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY
text: It's almost empty. Ann and Marty walk into...
scene_heading: DR. FRIELAND'S OFFICE
text: A small, cramped office. Furniture and files are scattered
text: everywhere. ivy League diplomas dominate the walls. DR.
text: FRIELAND looks up when they enter the room. Frieland is in
text: his mid 30s. And he seems very nervous. He plays with a
text: bronze letter opener, turning it in his fingers.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: Ann.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Hi, Bob.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (re: office)
dialog: Who'd you piss off?
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: (forces a laugh)
dialog: They've got me down here in the
dialog: dungeon while they fix up my
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: {re: Marty)
dialog: This is my brother Marty.
text: Marty and Dr. Frieland shake hands.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: Bob Frieland.
dialog: (gestures to seats)
dialog: Please.
text: Ann and Marty sit down. Frieland pulls a file off his desk,
text: studies it. Starts to say something and then stops. Goes
text: back to the file.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: Ann. I'm afraid, well, ah...
dialog: there's been a bit of a setback...
text: Marty looks at Ann. But she doesn't meet his eyes. She
text: steels herself. Whatever Frieland is about to say, she's
dialog: been expecting it.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: So this visit isn't just to pad
dialog: your bill?
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: (weak smile)
dialog: I'm, uh, afraid not.
dialog: (beat / refers to charts)
text: The cancer's not in remission. In
dialog: fact, it's come back very
dialog: aggressively. It's attacked your
dialog: liver and lungs...
text: Marty looks worse than Ann. He's devastated. Watching as
text: his world comes crashing down.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: How long?
scene_heading: DR. FRIELAND <<
dialog: Well, that's difficult--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Come on, Bob. What'd we agree to
dialog: when I first came to you?
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No bullshit.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: So...
text: A long, tortured beat of silence. Dr. Frieland spins the
text: letter opener in his fingers.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: (pains him)
dialog: Six months...
text: Ann shakes her head, refuses to believe it.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: But I feel fine--
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: And you will... for a little while
dialog: longer.
text: Ann reaches out, grabs Marty's hand.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (trying to smile}
dialog: Next time, give me the bullshit,
dialog: Doc.
text: Frieland goes over to her, puts a hand on her arm.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: Ann, there's a counselor here at
dialog: the hospital I'd like you to see.
dialog: She's, uh, she's... very good.
text: But Ann's no longer listening. She stares out the window.
text: Marty tries to console her, but she doesn't respond.
text: After a beat, Ann stands up, extends her hand to Dr. Frieland.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Thanks for staying so late to see
dialog: me, Bob.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: Ann... This is not--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I appreciate everything you've
dialog: done for me. I really do.
dialog: {turns to Marty)
dialog: Can we go now?
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: Ann, please--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (to Marty)
dialog: I'd like to go.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Wait a second.
text: Ann turns and leaves. Marty turns to Frieland.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: There's gotta be something--
text: Frieland shakes his head slowly -- this is the toughest part
dialog: of his job.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What about different doctors?
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: She's been to New York, to the
dialog: Mayo Clinic--
dialog: us
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What about experimental
dialog: treatments? You know, that stuff
dialog: you see on "60 Minutes?"...
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: DR. FRIELAND
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: Marty stands there, absorbing it. He drops his chin to his
text: chest, takes a deep breath. Dr. Frieland puts his arm on
text: Marty's shoulder.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Thanks, Doctor.
text: Marty stumbles out of the door.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT / DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Ann leans against her car. Her tough facade has crumbled.
text: She's bawling. Marty runs up to her. He's crying, too. He
text: buries her head in his chest as she cries even louder.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (after a beat)
text: I locked the keys in the car.
text: After a beat, they both start laughing their tears.
scene_heading: INT. ANN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Marty drives in silence. Ann stares out the window. Marty
text: keeps stealing glances at her. His heart is breaking. She
text: catches him looking at her. She takes his hand.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Why didn't you tell me, Annie?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Because when I was with you, I
dialog: forgot about it. For a couple of
dialog: hours, I didn't think about dying.
dialog: I just, I... You made me feel good.
text: She squeezes his hand. They pass a sign that reads,
dialog: "Entering Quicho."
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: This why you came back?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: No. We came back because we lost
dialog: our house.
dialog: ov
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Chris's gambling?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: And since I couldn't sell my mom's
dialog: house, I figured we might as well
dialog: live in it. So, I was born in
dialog: this shitty town and now I'm gonna
dialog: die in this shitty town.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Don't say that.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What? This place is shitty.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: It doesn't matter if I say it or
dialog: not.
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: I'm dying.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: We'll go to other doctors--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I've been to ten doctors in three
dialog: states, Marty. And the only thing
dialog: that changes is the magazines in
dialog: the waiting rooms.
text: She stares out the window. He reaches over and grabs her
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: INT. MARTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: They lie in bed, both lost in their own thoughts. After a
text: beat, Marty leans over and kisses Ann's forehead. Pulls her
text: closer to him. She kisses his chest.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Let's leave.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You said you didn't want to die
dialog: here. Well, let's leave.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: And go where?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Wherever you want. The Caribbean,
dialog: Europe...
text: Ann kisses him softly. She's touched by the gesture, but
dialog: knows that it's not realistic.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Should we take your millions or
dialog: mine?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: We'll figure out the money.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Well, it won't take us long to
dialog: figure it out since your ex-wife
dialog: gets most of your money and Chris
dialog: bet all ours on losing football
dialog: teams.
text: Ann pulls his face to hers. Kisses him.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Marty, I can't leave with you. I
dialog: mean, this, this is great, but
dialog: it's not real.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Not real? Ann, I've been in love
dialog: with you since we were in first
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Mrs. Green's class, right?
text: Ann pulls herself up in bed, clutching the sheet to her. She
text: grabs her panties and pulls them on. Stands up and starts to
dialog: get dressed.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I don’t think we should do this
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: It wasn't right for me to drag you
dialog: into this.
text: Marty swings out of bed, grabs her arms.
dialog: o
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: "Drag me into this?" Are you
dialog: kidding? This past month has been
dialog: the best month of my life. Hell,
dialog: this month has been better than
dialog: most of my years.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Marty, I'm dying...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I don't care if you have six
dialog: months or six minutes left. I
dialog: just wanna be there for all of
dialog: them.
text: She gently takes his hands off her arm. Kisses him. Looks
text: into his eyes.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: You know when you take off a band-
dialog: aid.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: It's always better to pull it off

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm the one wearing the band-aid.
text: She turns, heads for the door. Fights every urge to turn

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Oooh... nice. Lemme see.

scene_heading: INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Marty flips through his high school yearbook. They might as
dialog: well have subtitled it, “A photo history of Ann & Chris's
dialog: senior year." They're in nearly every photo. Football
dialog: captain... Head Cheerleader... Homecoming King and Queen.
text: Marty flips to Ann's senior photo.
text: ANN'S SENIOR PHOTO: She's radiant. Under, "Plans for the

speaker_heading: ANN _
dialog: I think he combined the "Death do

text: INSURANCE POLICY: Scanning over all the legal mumbo-jumbo.
text: Certain things jump out at us... INSURED: Ann Harrison...
scene_heading: BENEFICIARY: Chris Harrison.
dialog: But it's the amount that causes the record to SCREECH to a

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I just found it. It was locked in

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You didn't know about this?
speaker_heading: ANN

dialog: but he told me it was about health

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I don't know why I'm even telling

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That I was crazy. She said she

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Maybe the garbage was full.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (laughs)

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: "Little pussy?"
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: Sure, he scurried out the back
dialog: door the second he heard my voice.
dialog: I mean, I could almost respect a
dialog: guy who had the balls to confront
dialog: me, to tell me, “Yeah, I'm fucking
dialog: your wife." Right?
dialog: (Marty shrugs)
dialog: Like that guy who was fucking Amy.
dialog: I mean, shit, that had to kill
dialog: you, that your wife's fucking some
dialog: guy. But still, I mean, you gotta
dialog: respect that guy a little, right?
text: @ Chris smiles at Marty.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Maybe Ann is fucking somebody.
dialog: Except, that unlike my ex-wife,
dialog: & your wife won't let this guy tell
dialog: you that you're a shitty husband
dialog: and you don't deserve Ann. Maybe
dialog: there's nothing he'd rather do
dialog: than walk up to you, look you in
dialog: your eyes--
text: (Marty stares into Chris‘
dialog: eyes)
dialog: And say, "Chris, I'm fucking your
dialog: wife." Is that what you'd want?
text: Chris LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'd respect him at least. And if

text: They stare at each other for a long beat.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I think you're telling the wrong
dialog: @ guy here, Chris.
text: A beat, then Marty taps his gun.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Because as a cop, I can't let you
dialog: go around making threats on
dialog: people's lives. If I thought you
dialog: were serious, I'd be obligated to
dialog: do something.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Lucky for both of us, I don't
dialog: think we'll have to find out how
dialog: serious I am. I think Ann

speaker_heading: ROBERT (0.S.)
dialog: These are just some of the
dialog: people we've helped.
text: Robert turns on the lights. And here's the pitch...
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Ann, a viatical settlement is all
dialog: about opportunity. About giving
dialog: you the opportunity to do things
dialog: that you've only dreamed of,
dialog: whether that be walking along a
dialog: deserted beach in Hawaii or
dialog: running with the Bulls in Pompeii--
speaker_heading: — ANN
text: Pamplona. The buils run in
text: Pamplona. The volcano erupted in
dialog: Pompeii.
text: Robert LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: My point was -- before the
dialog: geography lesson -- the only limit
dialog: is your imagination.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: And by how much money you offer
dialog: me, right?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Someone's done their homework.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Okay, let me make sure I've got
dialog: this straight. I name you the
dialog: beneficiary on my life insurance
dialog: policy--
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Well, not me personally. You name
dialog: the Living Gift as your
dialog: beneficiary. After, of course, we
dialog: purchase your policy from you.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: And you-- I mean, the Living Gift--
dialog: collects on the policy when I die.
dialog: nw
dialog: wo
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (nods)
dialog: As the beneficiary, we collect on
dialog: 6 the policy after you've passed on,
dialog: yes.
dialog: However, I want to take this
dialog: opportunity to assure you, at the
dialog: Living Gift maximizing profits is
dialog: not our objective. Last year our
dialog: return on investment fell below
dialog: that of the average mutual fund.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: How much do I get?
text: Robert smiles, waits a beat. Knows he's got her.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: We determine the buyout after your
dialog: consultation with our medical
dialog: staff.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: And the amount depends on how long
dialog: your medical staff says I have to
dialog: live, right?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: & (laughs)
dialog: It's dependent on a variety of
dialog: factors. But yes, life expectancy
dialog: is one of the many factors we
dialog: consider.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: How about a ballpark figure?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Now don't quote me on this. But
dialog: people who are generally in your
dialog: category--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: My category?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Those whose life expectancy falls
dialog: below, ah, your ah, expectancy,
dialog: ah, six months... the standard
dialog: payout for this category.is
dialog: between seventy five and eighty
dialog: percent of the policy.
text: @ It doesn't take long for Ann to do the math in her head.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Seven hundred and fifty thousand?
text: Robert nods slowly. Ann's trying to temper her enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Now, if this is something you're
dialog: interested in, we just have to
dialog: move quickly.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is that quick enough?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You can sleep on it--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I don't need to. I -~.I mean my
dialog: husband and I -- want to do this.

dialog: I can't go anywhere else. There's

dialog: locked.
text: Something catches his eye on the ground: an electronic hotel

text: The house is completely burned down.
text: Quicho's rag-tag volunteer fire department finishes watching
text: the house burn. The fire hasn't spread to their neighbor's
dialog: house.
text: Marty jumps out of his truck, runs up to the smoldering
text: house. He grabs the FIRE CHIEF (Paulie).
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Paulie... where?
text: The Fire Chief leads Marty over to the debris. They stomp

scene_heading: EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DAY (7:24 AM)

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF

dialog: I just woke up Jack. He said

text: Marty waves him off.
text: A van labeled "County Arson Investigation" pulls up to the
text: site. A police car with "Cole County Sheriff's Department"
text: painted across it pulls up right behind the arson van.
text: Detective ALEX COLE (early 30s) steps out of the passenger
text: side. Chae stares at her as she makes her way toward them.
text: His attentiveness is easy to understand. Even Alex's off-the-
text: rack pants suit can't hide the fact that she could be making
text: three times a detective's salary dancing at one of the local
dialog: gentlemen's clubs.
text: But the people who can't get past the Playboy figure are
dialog: usually the worse for it. Especially if they've committed

text: Alex does a double-take when she sees Marty. He recognizes
dialog: her as well.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's the kind of greeting I get?
text: She offers her hand. He shakes it limply.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: By the way, you owe me fifty bucks
dialog: for that room service bill.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Looks like somebody forgot to
dialog: listen to Smokey, huh?
text: Marty doesn't respond. She turns back to him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Smokey the bear. You know --
dialog: "Only you can prevent forest

text: Marty still doesn't respond. Alex waves her hand in front of
text: his face.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Bear. Could talk. Anyway...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Excuse me for a sec.

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What?!
scene_heading: EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DAY (9:50 AM)
text: It's buzzing with activity. And at the center is Alex,

speaker_heading: ALEX (INTO PHONE)
dialog: That's bullshit! I caught

dialog: And if I run this thing out of my

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Good, I'll have some of my men set

scene_heading: INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - DAY (10:02 AM)
text: Marty stares out the window, preoccupied. Alex watches him.
text: She notices his Palm on the dashboard. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (off Palm)
dialog: Yep, here's my number. Right
dialog: where I wrote it.
text: Marty doesn't answer. Alex continues to play with the Palm.
text: Opens the GPS application.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh, you've got the GPS thing on

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: Tony your gay lover?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: He works for me.
dialog: (takes the Palm)
dialog: This thing allows me to track
dialog: wherever he is.
text: Marty tosses the Palm on the dashboard.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Pretty useless. But Tony's
dialog: brother sells 'em and he gave us
dialog: a bunch of 'em so he could use us
text: in the advertising.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (imitating advertising)
dialog: Local hicks -- I mean hayseeds --
dialog: swear by our GPS tracking system.
text: Alex looks at Marty, expecting a laugh. But he doesn't say
text: anything. His mind is back on Ann's death. Alex notices how
text: despondent and distracted Marty looks.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You seem pretty shaken up by this.
dialog: You know ‘em well?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: Went to high school with them.
dialog: They had just moved back here a
dialog: couple months ago.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: So, any idea who did it?
text: Marty shakes his head -- he truly is at a loss.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: No idea.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: They have any enemies?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: No, nothing like that.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Money troubles?
speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Either of them fucking around on

text: There's already three sheriff's cars here.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (10:18 AM)
text: Alex is huddled with Deputy BASTE, her second in command.
dialog: Baste (40s) is the kind of guy who is actually thankful he

text: cop, Baste is at home cleaning his guns and watching "Cops."
text: Other DEPUTIES are taking over the office: talking on
text: phones, carrying in evidence.
speaker_heading: MARTY'S OFFICE
text: Marty is oblivious te the activity. He's staring at a photo
text: of he and Ann. It still hasn't quite sunk in.
speaker_heading: ALEX (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, lazy bones.
text: Marty hides the photo, spins around in his chair.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm gonna go by their dentist's

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: She told you she was having an
dialog: affair?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Nah, she wasn't too talkative with
dialog: me. I mean, we'd talk about
dialog: stuff, you know like what was
dialog: happening on our stories and
dialog: stuff. But I just got that
dialog: feeling you know, like sometimes
dialog: when she was on the phone she
dialog: would...
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Talk real quiet and stuff--
text: Marty jumps in, not liking where this is going.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: ("skeptical")
dialog: C'mon. She was whispering?

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Any idea who it was?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Nah...
dialog: (snaps her fingers)
dialog: But he was classy. A couple weeks

dialog: of flowers. Remember, Bruce?
text: Dr. Snyder nods. Nikki continues, emboldened.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: And, I, uh, dated Chris back in

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Well, how 'bout dropping me off
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What? You don't like hanging

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It just doesn't make any sense --

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (another weary laugh)
dialog: Yeah, you could say that.
text: Alex reaches over, takes Marty's hand. She thinks his weary

text: hand on top of his. Can't help thinking of the last woman

text: sees something he never saw in Ann's -- genuine affection.
