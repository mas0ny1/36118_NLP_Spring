scene_heading: EXT. TYRE, LEBANON - DAY
text: A coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were
text: Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the
text: sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX (V.O.)
dialog: We're online for exactly two minutes.
speaker_heading: A SATELLITE VIEW
text: Of the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some
text: distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are:
speaker_heading: HERD OF SHEEP
text: As seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In
text: the distance, the MERCEDES approaches.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)
text: U.S. Army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through
text: the rubble of a collapsed barracks.
speaker_heading: CNN REPORTS (V.O.)
dialog: "...the single worst casualty in the
dialog: history of American military --"
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
text: The Mercedes barrels down the road, doing at least 80 mph.
scene_heading: THE SATELLITE VIEW
text: Shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the
text: herd of sheep are about to cross the road.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)
text: Amidst the rubble, the dead are zipped into body bags.
speaker_heading: CNN REPORTS (V.O.)
dialog: "-- the truck, carrying high
dialog: explosives is believed to have hit
dialog: the barracks --
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
text: The driver of the Mercedes hits his horn but doesn't slow
text: down. In addition to the driver and a bodyguard, an OLD MAN
text: WITH A HENNAED BEARD, a turban, and sunglasses sits in back.
scene_heading: THE SATELLITE VIEW
text: As the Mercedes closes with the sheep:
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX (V.O.)
dialog: Slow down.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
text: As if on command, the Mercedes finally slows as the sheep
text: move lazily across the road.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)
text: President Clinton addresses reporters in the White House.
scene_heading: PRESIDENT CLINTON
dialog: "To any lengths, anywhere in the
dialog: world, to bring these people to
dialog: justice."
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
text: Inside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and
text: the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver
text: rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at:
scene_heading: THE POOR SHEPHERD
text: Who hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer
text: that we see the silenced muzzle of:
speaker_heading: COLT COMMANDO RIFLE
text: Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then:
text: THE HERD OF SHEEP
text: Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a
text: moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as
dialog: they clear frame, we can see that:
speaker_heading: THE MERCEDES
text: Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered
text: and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the
text: bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance:
scene_heading: WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY
text: One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while
text: the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd
text: activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes
text: while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON
text: self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to
text: the Sheik's harness.
scene_heading: AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT
text: Its "Whiskers" in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable
text: without slowing and roars off, the Sheik dangling unconscious
text: beneath -- just as the satchel charges EXPLODE the Mercedes.
scene_heading: THE SATELLITE VIEW
text: Records impassively for a moment, then breaks up into static.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Gotcha.
scene_heading: IN A SAFE HOUSE -- SOMETIME LATER
text: A pale, diminished Sheik sits at a steelcase table. A STEEL
text: COT and a STEEL TOILET. Closed-circuit cameras in the corner.
text: Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: GENERAL
text: WILLIAM DEVEREAUX -- and though he wears a civilian suit,
text: his bearing betrays his pedigree. His considerable charm and
text: habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline
text: as his close-order drill.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Nobody knows you're here. Not your
dialog: people. Not even my President. You'll
dialog: die here alone and be buried unknown --
dialog: barring some miracle.
text: The SHEIK speaks a few words in Arabic.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: -- God? GOD?
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: What you eat. Whether you eat. Sleep.
text: Pain. Absence of pain. I decide. I
dialog: make the day and the night. Even the
dialog: way you got here -- a hand that
dialog: reached down from the sky?
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: God? I am your new God.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOSQUE - DAWN
text: A MUEZZIN climbs a spiral staircase, enters a turret-like
text: room, CLICKS ON a microphone and CHANTS the call to prayer.
speaker_heading: MUEZZIN
dialog: Allahuh Akbar...
text: HUNDREDS OF BELIEVERS prostrate themselves on prayer rugs.
text: At the door, hundreds of SHOES are lined up, work boots,
text: expensive loafers, a range of social classes represented.
text: ON THE STREET
text: Shopkeepers pause to kneel and pray. In Arab homes, parents
dialog: and children do the same. And as we PULL BACK from:
speaker_heading: THE MINARET
dialog: Of the Mosque, we DISCOVER not an Arab city, but instead the
text: unmistakable skyline of:
scene_heading: DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN
text: The World Trade Ctr, Wall Street, The Federal building.
scene_heading: IN THE FBI SITUATION ROOM
text: Two AGENTS hurry through the bullpen. TINA OSU, 32, sharp,
text: and FRANK HADDAD, Lebanese with an insouciant grin.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Brooklyn South issued a code blue
dialog: less than two minutes ago. They think
text: hostages are involved.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Black-and-whites on the scene?
speaker_heading: TINA
text: Setting up a perimeter now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Residence or business?
speaker_heading: TINA
text: A bus.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: THE 99 BUS -- SEEN FROM ABOVE
text: Surrounded by a phalanx of Black-and-Whites.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
text: They have been joined by Anthony Hubbard, the ASAC.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: SWAT?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: On the way.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Negotiator?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Rolling.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Bomb squad?
speaker_heading: THE 99 BUS
text: The BOMB SQUAD approaches. We SEE terrified PASSENGERS inside.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, EXITING THE FEDERAL BUILDING
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How soon can we get there --?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In this traffic, maybe tomorrow.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS
text: As a police TECHIE inserts a dentist's mirror through a
text: drilled hole in the bus's door, the L.E.D. begins to BLINK
text: and the passengers SCREAM and dive for cover. An EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR
text: Frank is listening to a cell phone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, fuck. It just blew.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS
text: The doors hang off their hinges. As the PASSENGERS tumble
text: off, we SEE they are covered in BLUE PAINT.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- What?!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- That's what they're telling me.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- And nobody's hurt?
text: Frank nods. Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Thank God.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE JOINT FBI/NYPD TERRORISM TASK FORCE - FEDERAL BLDG
text: They're listening to a tape-recording, altered by a VO-CORDER:
speaker_heading: TAPED VOICE
dialog: -- our first and last warning.
text: As the MESSAGE continues, we PAN the faces: MIKE JOHANNSON,
text: squad supervisor, and DANNY SUSSMAN, representing NYPD.
speaker_heading: TAPED VOICE
dialog: We expect our demand to be met. There
dialog: will be no negotiation. That is all.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Demand for what? You hear any demand?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You sure this is all they got?
speaker_heading: SUSSMAN
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe it's performance art.
text: Sussman shoots him a look. Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his
text: buttons. Finally, Hub stands up.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Okay. Blue paint. Voice-altering
dialog: technology --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- available from The Sharper Image
dialog: catalogue.
speaker_heading: SUSSMAN
dialog: Last I looked they weren't offering
text: exploding paint bombs.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Still, the rhetoric sounds political.
dialog: Militia?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Not their style.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank --?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jihad isn't known for their sense of
dialog: humor, and Hamas is raising so much
dialog: money here, why queer their deal?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Anyway, isn't Green the color of
dialog: Islam, not blue?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- And, excuse me, but why do we
dialog: immediately assume they're Arabs?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I want a composite of the suspects
dialog: in circulation by the end of business
dialog: today. Tina, you cross-check it
dialog: against the mainframe. Mike, have
dialog: you got the lab analysis on the paint?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not yet...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- See if any was sold in quantity
dialog: the last month. Danny --
text: Tina's phone buzzes. She picks it up as Hub keeps going:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- find out what stop these guys got
text: on the bus, maybe there's a witness.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hub... I think we're all eager to
dialog: give up our weekends on this. It
dialog: just occurs to me, has anybody even
dialog: committed a crime here? I mean,
dialog: assault with a deadly color?
text: Hub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Here's what I don't like. They know
dialog: explosives. They know our response
text: time. They put in a call and walk.
text: A young agent, FRED DARIUS, hands Hub a piece of paper:
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Excuse me, sir. I think you should
dialog: see this. Came in on the Fax.
text: Only two words are written: "RELEASE HIM."
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Release him? Him who? Who are we
dialog: holding?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Marv Albert?
speaker_heading: SUSSMAN
dialog: McVeigh? Sheik what's-his-name from
dialog: the Trade Center.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- Omar Abdel Rahman... asshole.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: The Hamas guy got released in April.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Under protest.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (looks at the fax)
dialog: Why be coy about it?
speaker_heading: SUSSMAN
dialog: You think it's phony?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (covering the phone)
dialog: Hub, somebody's flashing a government
text: badge over at the warehouse where
dialog: they're working on the bus. Our tech
dialog: guys want to know if we're cooperating
dialog: with any other agencies on this thing.
dialog: Off Hub's look, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN OLD WAREHOUSE IN BROOKLYN - DUSK
text: Hub and Haddad join AGENT FLOYD ROSE, a tall Black man.
speaker_heading: AGENT ROSE
dialog: -- She's looking for wiring signatures
dialog: on the device and asking for copies
dialog: of any latent prints we've managed
dialog: to lift.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Agency?
speaker_heading: AGENT ROSE
dialog: Smells like it. Turns out she's also
dialog: been talking to some of the
dialog: passengers.
scene_heading: THEY OPEN THE DOOR
text: In the klieg lights -- THE BUS. Men in white coats dust every
text: inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed UFO.
text: In their midst, a young WOMAN, midwestern pretty in a serious
text: suit. She looks up as Hub enters.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hi, there.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Special Agent Anthony Hubbard. FBI.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh, shit, I've been trying to liaise
dialog: with you all day. My name is Elise
dialog: Kraft, National Security Council.
text: She offers her hand. Hub doesn't take it yet.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- And you've been trying to "liaise"
dialog: with me all day? Did you think of
dialog: trying the phone book, Elise? We
dialog: have fourteen lines, that's not
dialog: counting the unlisted ones.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (still holds out hand)
dialog: Hi, I'm Elise Kraft, National Security
dialog: Council.
text: Finally, he takes her hand. And doesn't let go.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: And I'm Colin Powell. What exactly
dialog: do you people want with my bus.
text: She tries to take her hand away, but he tightens his grip.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: We're all on the same team here,
dialog: Agent Hubbard.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Who exactly is "we" on this particular
dialog: team, Elise?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It's never the question that's
text: indiscreet, only the answer.
text: He smiles. She smiles back. Convinced she's charmed him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tell you what, you send me an official
dialog: inter-agency request for cooperation
dialog: on this and I'll give you copies of
dialog: everything we come up with. Otherwise,
dialog: get your ass on out of here before
dialog: you contaminate my crime scene any
dialog: more than you already have.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: There's no reason to be nasty.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You think this is nasty?
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: In case you haven't heard. The CIA
dialog: has no charter to operate
dialog: domestically. Which puts you in
dialog: violation of federal law.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Not according to the Cooperation
dialog: Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- I
dialog: suggest you reread the paragraph on
dialog: sharing information. I happen to be
dialog: well within my authority.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Special Order 12333 refers to domestic
dialog: terrorism. You got something you
dialog: want to "share" with me?
dialog: (he waits... but no
dialog: answer is forthcoming)
dialog: Us being teammates and all?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (holds up a clipboard)
dialog: Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon
dialog: as I do, I'll --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- get back to me, yeah, I know.
dialog: (takes the clipboard
dialog: from her hands)
dialog: Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna
dialog: have a couple my "teammates" here
dialog: escort you back to wherever you came
dialog: from. And then I'm gonna go back to
dialog: the office and wait for that official
dialog: cooperation request. Okay by you?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Swell.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Nice meeting you, Elise. Is that
dialog: Elise with an "E" or an "A"?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent
dialog: Hubbard.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE
text: Hub watches as Elise is led away by two AGENTS. Agent Rose
text: stands nearby.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tail her.
scene_heading: NICE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: In Frank Haddad's home. The Haddad's are celebrating the day
text: FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran.
speaker_heading: FRANK JR (O.S.)
dialog: (in Arabic)
dialog: "In the Name of Allah, the beneficent,
dialog: the merciful. Say: I seek refuge in
dialog: the Lord of Men, the King of Men."
text: Frank's TEACHER offers the final benediction. Those who are
text: Muslim cover their face with their palms.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: (in Arabic)
dialog: "Make me know that which I have become
dialog: ignorant of; and make me recite it
dialog: in the hours of the night and the
dialog: day; and make it an argument for me
dialog: O Thou Sustainer of all the worlds!"
dialog: Ameen!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Ameen.
dialog: Later --
text: The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: ...Nice, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: You ever gonna stop by, pick up your
dialog: things?
text: Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: -- He doing her?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Some detective you are. They stopped.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Really? I wonder if she likes white
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I wonder if she likes bald guys.
text: Hub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You must be so proud...
speaker_heading: NAJIBA
dialog: Small children, small worries. Big
dialog: children --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- big orthodontia bills. Someday,
dialog: you'll understand.
text: And then Frank notices Hub's DRIVER standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where we going?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You're staying with your family. I'm
dialog: back in the morning.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: Sequence omitted from original script. (ALREADY SHOT)
scene_heading: INT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING
text: Hub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You sleep here?
dialog: (Hub smiles, but
dialog: doesn't look up)
dialog: Immigration called.
scene_heading: A SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR
text: Hub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a
text: uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false-
text: bottomed suitcase stuffed with money.
speaker_heading: INS OFFICIAL
dialog: -- all in small bills. So we figure,
dialog: smurf, right? Then I think,
dialog: considering the gentleman's
dialog: nationality, plus where he's been
dialog: recently, we better call Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- who's trying to score points with
dialog: his boss, bigtime.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Has he broken any laws?
speaker_heading: INS OFFICIAL
dialog: No, sir. He's twenty bucks under the
dialog: $10,000 limit.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (pulls out a $20 bill)
dialog: Not anymore.
speaker_heading: IN THE ROOM
text: The official hopes volume breaks the language barrier.
scene_heading: UNIFORMED OFFICIAL
dialog: ...so, Kahlil, you're saying this is
text: an INHERITANCE? Somebody DIED and
dialog: you're bringing them the MONEY?
text: The dark-skinned man is trying to keep up:
speaker_heading: KAHLIL
dialog: No, no... dhouri.
scene_heading: BEHIND THE MIRROR
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...He means, "dowry."
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Check out his neck.
text: Small puckered SCARS. The INS guy looks confused.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The tabac.
dialog: (mimics putting out a
dialog: cigarette on his arm)
dialog: Sssssss... The territories.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (thinks a moment)
text: Put him in play.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY
text: Hub and Frank in a rental CONTOUR, tail Khalil, in a cab:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: -- on the Van Wyck... No, not yet.
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: -- What are we in?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A '97 Contour. On my Visa.
dialog: (watches Khalil)
dialog: Back home, the security services'd
dialog: be up this guy's ass with a poker,
dialog: but what do we do, we let him go.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (still on the phone)
text: ...Six teams on the ground, at
dialog: least... well, pull 'em off the UN...
dialog: (to Haddad)
dialog: Stay back...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not my first date, Hub.
speaker_heading: (the TAXI changes
dialog: lanes)
text: He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's
dialog: Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (still on the phone)
dialog: I want husbands and wives, I want
dialog: baby carriages, and no Brooks
dialog: Brothers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're micro-managing.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (still on the phone)
dialog: -- And find me a judge I can work
dialog: with. We want sound on this guy...
dialog: damn'... I'm losing you...
dialog: (raises his voice)
dialog: And bring us a radio.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I get reimbursed for this, right?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ATLANTIC AVENUE - BROOKLYN
text: The Third World. Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut
text: meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow. Hand-written shop signs in Arabic
text: and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest
dialog: neo-Palestinian techno-rock.
text: KHALIL pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot. Hub's
text: CONTOUR pulls over a safe distance behind and waits. An AGENT
text: passes by and slips a WALKIE-TALKIE through the open window.
scene_heading: MAN CARRYING GROCERIES
text: Falls in behind Khalil, who ducks into a storefront, where
text: WE CAN SEE him buying a Coca Cola and a Baby Ruth bar.
speaker_heading: IN THE CONTOUR
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (notes the purchase)
text: Twelve bucks in Gaza.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: America's the place to be if you're
dialog: a terrorist.
dialog: (on the walkie-talkie)
text: Fred's hovering. Patsy, take over...
text: A WOMAN WITH A STROLLER replaces the man carrying groceries.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: ...Tell her to watch out for
dialog: reflections.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (hands him the phone)
dialog: I got the Judge.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: ...Good morning, Sir. How're things
dialog: in the Second Circuit this morning...?
dialog: ...I hear you... Listen, Judge, we're
dialog: in a kind of situation here...
text: KHALIL is on the move again.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Hold on, will ya, Judge?
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: Is he talking to somebody, who's he
dialog: talking to? Are we getting film?
scene_heading: FROM A GREAT DISTANCE
text: An AGENT with a TELEPHOTO snaps a picture of Khalil, who has
text: paused to chat with a PALESTINIAN of patrician good-looks.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (covering the phone)
dialog: -- Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't know him. If we were allowed
dialog: to get sound on them, we'd know him.
text: The walkie-talkie CRACKLES TO LIFE, confirming the photos.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (covering the radio)
dialog: ...What's that? No, Judge, not yet
dialog: we're not... but we have reason to
dialog: believe he may be involved with --
dialog: (covers the phone
dialog: again; keys the radio)
dialog: Damnit Tommy!
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: He's overacting! Tell him --
dialog: (back to the phone)
dialog: Sorry, Judge... No... I just --
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's --
text: Khalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank.
text: All of a sudden, he BREAKS INTO A RUN.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (keys radio)
dialog: Go, go, go!!! All units --
text: He slams the car into gear and PEELS OUT into traffic.
scene_heading: SIX SURVEILLANCE TEAMS
text: In various guises, break cover and SPRINT after Khalil, who
text: shifts into overdrive. Cars SCREECH to avoid flattening him.
text: Hub's CONTOUR pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked
text: by a narrow passage between double-parked cars. He goes for
text: it, SCRAPING his way between them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Christ!
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Judge, I'm gonna have to call you
dialog: back...
speaker_heading: KHALIL SPRINTS
text: Into an open-air MARKET, KNOCKING DOWN veiled WOMEN with
text: bags of fruit and vegetables. He VAULTS over stalls.
text: The CONTOUR scrapes PARKED CARS as it swerves into an alley,
text: desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shit --! I didn't take the insurance.
text: A SOCCER BALL bounces into Hub's peripheral vision, followed
speaker_heading: by TWO BOYS.
text: HUB SLAMS THE CONTOUR INTO THE WALL
text: To avoid killing the two boys. Hub gets out of the car and
text: continues the pursuit on foot. He's gaining on Khalil, when:
speaker_heading: A VAN
text: Bears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as TWO PAIRS OF
text: HANDS reach out and ANOTHER MAN appears out of nowhere and
text: BODYCHECKS Khalil into the van and jumps in after him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What the --?
text: The van BURNS RUBBER and DISAPPEARS into traffic.
scene_heading: MINUTES LATER --
text: An impromptu huddle in the alley. AGENTS gather in a circle
text: as RADIOS SQUELCH and HELICOPTERS circle above.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: They just found the van. Doesn't
dialog: look like they're gonna find any
dialog: prints.
text: The Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type
text: PHOTO from a digital printer in his car. Hub looks at the
text: picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Run him down, bring him in.
text: Fred hands a cell phone to Hub.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Floyd Rose.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Go, Floyd.
text: As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN ORDINARY HOUSE
text: In an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR.
text: Agent Rose climbs into the front seat.
speaker_heading: AGENT ROSE
dialog: I've got two in the Plymouth, at
dialog: least three inside, and see that guy
dialog: walking his dog...? He did his
dialog: business about an hour ago and they're
text: still walking.
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER CAR --
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I had a dog like that once.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're
dialog: spies.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The dog works for the CIA?
text: Their radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub.
speaker_heading: HUB (V.O.)
dialog: (over the radio)
text: All units report in turn.
text: We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock."
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Let's roll.
text: THE MAN WALKING THE DOG
text: Is suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS.
scene_heading: AGENT - MIKE
dialog: Federal Agents. Hands behind your
dialog: back --
text: A third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog.
speaker_heading: TWO UNMARKED CARS
text: Fishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as
text: an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump

dialog: thank you very much.
text: THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE
text: Is BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating
text: take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill.
text: Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A
text: stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down,
text: muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees:
speaker_heading: KHALIL
text: Sitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS
text: from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger:
text: ELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished
text: basement is a palpable feeling of menace.
text: As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock
text: .9 at his head. Hub just stares him down.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Ralph, spare us.
text: The freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose
text: face is badly bruised.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I never touched him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Really? I'm taking him into custody
dialog: just the same.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What are you going to charge him
dialog: with? Jaywalking?
dialog: (Hub stares at her)
dialog: I don't suppose we could just have a
dialog: little chat with him here first?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Not in this lifetime.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You know, Hub... may I call you Hub?
dialog: If you guys hadn't blown the
dialog: surveillance, we'd have been able to
dialog: follow the money. What do you think,
dialog: Khalil, you would have led us right
dialog: to your friends, wouldn't you?
text: Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What friends --? What have you got
dialog: for me, Elise?... Enlighten me.
dialog: (she stonewalls)
dialog: Tell me now or tell me downtown.
text: Still nothing. Hub calls out to his agents.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Get this guy out of here and book
dialog: him.
text: As the other agents approach Khalil:
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: One phone call and he's mine again.
dialog: You know the number. I have --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You have "the right to remain silent,"
dialog: you have "the right to an attorney.
dialog: Anything you say can and will be
dialog: held against you in a court of law --
dialog: "
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (overlapping him)
dialog: Oh, come on... Do you have any idea
dialog: what you're starting here, the kind
dialog: of shitstorm you're about to --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (overiding her)
dialog: -- Kidnapping. Obstruction of Justice.
dialog: Assault.
text: As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Cuff her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HUB'S UNMARKED CAR
text: Elise sits, handcuffed, alone in the back seat. Up front,
text: Frank is driving with Hub beside him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So, Elise... You okay back there,
dialog: you don't get carsick or anything?
dialog: Those handcuffs too tight --?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or
dialog: Sunni?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wow. You're really good.
dialog: (to Hub)
dialog: She's really good.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You ready to tell us what's going on
dialog: here, Elise --? Was the paintbomb a
dialog: warning?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (to Haddad)
dialog: American University of Beirut? I was
dialog: there from '79 to 82.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a look to Hub)
dialog: No shit?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: My father taught Economics. Henry
dialog: Kraft?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Is there a terrorist cell operating
dialog: in this city that we are unaware of?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (ignoring him; to
dialog: Haddad)
dialog: Such a tragedy. Growing up in that
dialog: city was... paradise. Like an exotic
dialog: Paris, wasn't it, Frank --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You ever been in Rikers, Elise? You
dialog: know what happens in there?
text: Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...Yum.
text: Frank's BEEPER goes off. As they look at one another, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ABOUT A MILLION COP CARS
text: Red lights flashing, have sealed off a Brooklyn Street. On
text: the rooftops SWAT teams are already deploying.
text: SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the
text: surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS.
speaker_heading: THE 87 BUS
text: Stands alone in the middle of the street. Through a Marksman's
text: SCOPE we SEE the terrified passengers forced to stand, catch
text: glimpses of the TERRORISTS, obscured by the hostages.
text: Hub confers with the NYPD officer-in-charge.
speaker_heading: NYPD OFFICER
dialog: -- definitely Arab-types, only this
dialog: time they're still in there...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Any communication at all?
speaker_heading: NYPD OFFICER
dialog: Nope. It's weird they're just in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Get the frequency of the driver's
dialog: radio and patch it through to this
dialog: number. We need two lines. Frank,
dialog: get a negotiator out here.
speaker_heading: NYPD OFFICER #2
dialog: Sir, they've got kids in there. We
dialog: count six.
text: This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: That gives us something to work with.
text: BACK AT THE CAR
text: Elise leans forward as Hub opens the driver's door.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What's happening out there...
text: Hub takes off his jacket, folds it carefully on the seat.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They've taken another bus, haven't
dialog: they? Talk to me...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Oh, now you want to talk. You want
dialog: to be my friend, is that it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Listen, these guys are the real deal.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How do you know?
text: She just looks at him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Is there a terrorist cell operating
dialog: in Brooklyn?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (a long moment)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Was the blue paint a warning?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll
dialog: blow the bus.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: If they wanted to blow the bus then
dialog: why haven't they blown the bus --?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I... don't know.
text: He starts away.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: A COMMAND POST
text: Has been hastily improvised behind a SWAT van.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: The driver's name is Larry Kaiser.
dialog: He says they've got explosives
text: strapped to their chests, they got
dialog: automatic weapons, and they're
dialog: speaking Arabic.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Where the hell's the negotiator?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tunnel's got twenty minute delays
text: and they're working on both bridges.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to the cop)
dialog: What else did he say about the device?
dialog: Did he describe it at all? Anything
dialog: about a button, or a cord, or...
text: THE FIRST ENG TRUCK
text: Pulls up and raises its satellite dish.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (almost involuntary)
dialog: Oh, God.
text: Frank turns to look at her. She is suddenly pale.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (as it dawns on her)
dialog: ...They're not here to negotiate.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: They were waiting for the cameras.
text: Hub is deep in conversation with the cops. Frank interrupts.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- Hub...
text: Hub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They're want the newsies here. They
dialog: want everybody watching.
text: Hub and Frank look at each other. Can this be true?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You've got the shooters in place?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- So?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Use 'em.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Kill 'em now.
text: They just look at her.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It's lose-lose any way you play it...
dialog: Do you want to lose little or lose
dialog: big?
text: The NYPD officer has been listening:
speaker_heading: NYPD OFFICER
dialog: I got the marksmen on the com --
dialog: They're looking for a clean shot.
text: As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more
text: NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town:
text: reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports.
text: Hub and Elise stare at one another.
speaker_heading: NYPD OFFICER
dialog: Shooter says they've got the
text: passengers all standing in the aisles.
dialog: He says, no go.
text: Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tick
text: away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to the cops)
dialog: We have rules of engagement we're
dialog: gonna follow here, folks, so put the
dialog: safeties back on your weapons.
dialog: (looks at Elise)
dialog: Nobody's killing anybody until we
dialog: see what's what.
text: He grabs the phone.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the
dialog: FBI, I'll be negotiating our way out
dialog: of this. Let me talk to one of them...
dialog: I know... I know. You just hang in
dialog: there, Larry... No, don't worry,
dialog: I've got somebody here who can
dialog: translate.
text: He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard.
dialog: I don't have any authority to make
dialog: deals, or respond to demands. I just
dialog: want to find out if you need anything
dialog: in there? If any of the passengers
dialog: are in need of medical attention?
text: He waits as Frank translates. Hub covers the mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know if they understand.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Sir, is there anything you want to
dialog: say to me? That I can tell my people
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: The guy's just breathing into the
dialog: phone, maybe they're not even Arabs.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: I get the feeling you don't want to
dialog: talk, but will you listen --?
dialog: ...Whatever grievance you have,
dialog: whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't
dialog: involve these children --
text: Still no response.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: So I'm gonna ask you to... please...
dialog: let... the... children go.
text: No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN
text: And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the
text: doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the
text: cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children
text: cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE
text: breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, here we go...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Thank you, sir. I appreciate that
dialog: gesture, I really do. The best way
dialog: to get what you want in these
dialog: situations is to show yourself to be
dialog: reasonable. As you've just done.
dialog: (Haddad translates)
dialog: Now we've got some more to talk
dialog: about...
text: Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: I am unarmed, as you can see. So I
dialog: propose... You let the rest of the
dialog: passengers go, and I take their
dialog: place... That way, there's no pizza
dialog: deliveries or bathroom breaks to
dialog: worry about -- and all these --
dialog: (indicates SWAT teams)
dialog: -- people... will disappear.
text: Frank shakes his head, don't do this. Hub's look says
text: translate it. Frank does it. They all wait.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: I'm gonna take your silence to mean
dialog: you're considering my offer --
text: Elise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his bravery.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How about we just start with a few
dialog: of the elderly people you got on
dialog: there. It's got to be hard for the
dialog: older folks to be standing all this
dialog: time.
text: Hub looks back at Frank. Still no response.
text: AND THEN THE BUS DOORS HISS OPEN AGAIN. A few elderly
text: PASSENGERS start down the steps.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Thank you, sir. Now let's just let
dialog: these --
scene_heading: THE EXPLOSION OF THE BUS
dialog: Hurls Hub backwards as:
scene_heading: ALL SOUND FADES OUT
text: To be replaced by a high-end, almost electronic WHITE NOISE.
speaker_heading: SHRAPNEL
text: Imbeds itself into car doors, bus benches, doorways as every
text: WINDOW in a three-block radius is SHATTERED...
speaker_heading: RED BLOOD
text: Replaces blue paint in a horrific shower.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Fights for consciousness.
speaker_heading: AGENTS
text: Rush to his side to see if he is alright -- but WE CANNOT
text: HEAR them. Though their mouths move it is only the WHITE
text: NOISE that overwhelms us -- as we realize that Hub has been
text: momentarily DEAFENED by the blast.
text: When at last Hub manages to speak, his words are MUFFLED and
text: INDISTINCT -- as if the playback heads of a tape recorder
dialog: needed to be cleaned.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I'm... alright. I'm --
text: Frank Haddad bends down close and we can lip-read him saying,
dialog: "Just hang in there, buddy. . ."
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- okay... Just let me --
text: And then he leans over to VOMIT in the street.
text: THE SOUND OF SIRENS
text: Slowly bleeds in through the white noise -- mercifully for
text: us, and for Hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing
text: that his HEARING is coming back. He reaches for Frank's
text: outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Is anybody --
text: But the look in Frank's eyes says it all.
speaker_heading: THE DEVASTATION
dialog: Is numbing. IMAGES we associate with other countries. And
text: then he sees Elise. Her face is cut and bleeding, but as
text: their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: MORE THAN A HUNDRED AGENTS
text: Crowded into the now-overflowing BULLPEN. In absolute denial
text: of his physical condition, Hub paces like a caged animal.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- every trap, every hole. I want to
dialog: rumble every mosque, every community
dialog: center, every student organization
dialog: that's ever said an unkind word. I
dialog: want the heat turned up under all
dialog: our assets, all our informers, every
text: snitch gets twisted inside out. And
dialog: put some money out on the street --
dialog: Arab community hates these people as
dialog: much as we do. They'll help.
dialog: (turns to Mike)
dialog: Have you got positive ID on --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hub, we don't have positive ID on
dialog: anybody.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We need more hands. Fred --
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'm on it.
text: He picks up a phone and begins requesting Agent transfers.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I want to talk to Khalil.
speaker_heading: TINA
text: He's down the hall.
text: Now she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Conferences with DC at 9:00, 12:00,
dialog: 4:00 and 9:00. Call your families,
text: find a sleeping bag, nobody leaves
dialog: this office until we have a strand
dialog: to pull. Oklahoma City, people. The
dialog: first twenty-four hours are the only
dialog: twenty-four hours.. And I don't want
dialog: to see anybody walking.
scene_heading: TEN MINUTES LATER - OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL
text: Hub and Frank watch Khalil through a VIDEO MONITOR. The
text: bruises on Khalil's face have deepened.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Doctor seen him?
speaker_heading: TINA
text: He's on his way up.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Got a cigarette --?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You don't smoke.
text: Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into:
speaker_heading: THE CELL
text: Frank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns
text: it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Ten thousand dollars.
text: Frank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Khalil. I want to talk about the
dialog: money.
text: Again Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Okay...
text: Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack
text: of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At
text: the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on
text: Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette --
text: drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously
text: RECOILS in his chair.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to Frank, re: Khalil)
dialog: Doesn't like second hand smoke.
text: Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his
text: cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You ready to talk about money?
text: Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins
text: SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (translating)
dialog: ...He says he loves America and only
dialog: wanted to get away from the security
dialog: services at home.
text: Tears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (still translating)
dialog: ...He says he's sorry but he didn't
dialog: know he was doing something bad. His
dialog: cousin introduced him to a man who
dialog: promised him two hundred dollars for
dialog: his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase
text: to an address in Brooklyn.
dialog: (to Hub)
dialog: He's a cut-out.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER
text: Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Nasty habit.
dialog: (to Danny)
text: 3830 Flatbush Avenue.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM
text: Bursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine
text: continuously sending the message: "RELEASE HIM."
scene_heading: BACK TO -- HUB
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We want every rental agreement from
dialog: every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels,
dialog: motels, flophouses...
dialog: (to the other agents)
dialog: It's cash, guys. They're the only
dialog: ones in America using cash.
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
text: The room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: This is a spectograph of the semtex
dialog: used in the bomb. Look at the benzene
dialog: spike. This is the genuine article.
dialog: (another slide)
dialog: Now... this one's from the barracks
dialog: in Dhahran. As you can see, the
dialog: signature is identical.
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
scene_heading: A COMPUTER TECHIE (WHITNEY) is cross-referencing data. DIGITAL
text: PICTURES of suspected terrorists scroll past. A surveillance
text: PHOTO of Ahmed bin Talal. The ruined army barracks.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- ask it if they've ever hit buses?
text: The techie types in a few commands: IMAGES of destroyed BUSES
dialog: file past. Tel Aviv. Jerusalem. Beirut. None a match.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: -- not according to the mainframe.
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
text: The BOMB SCENE now resembles an archeological dig. Floodlights
text: on stanchions. Forensic EXPERTS, on their hands and knees,
text: use BLACK LIGHT and brushes to search for latent prints.
text: Different color STRING divides the site into a grid.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: -- with a Q-tip. Bone shards, hair,
dialog: fingernails --
text: Nearby, Danny and Mike observe Hub's intensity.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: -- He's way over his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shut the fuck up and go give somebody
dialog: a parking ticket.
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
text: In THE LAB. A FINGERPRINT EXPERT sifts through a plastic bag
text: of fingertips and teeth. Scans each into a computer.
scene_heading: FINGERPRINT EXPERT
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
text: Hub is STARING AT THE TV SETS which are all REPLAYING the
text: terrible incident, over and over again.
speaker_heading: TV SOUND BITE
dialog: "-- Today; Tel Aviv has come to
dialog: Brooklyn. The question... is why."
text: Finally, he turns away so no one will see. His eyes are hot
text: with the emotion.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: You okay?
text: The Fingerprint techie races in, sparing Hub a response.
scene_heading: FINGERPRINT EXPERT
dialog: Got one!
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
text: Hub and Tina address twenty agents.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, meet the late
dialog: Ali Waziri.
text: He projects a PHOTO of the dead Terrorist onto the wall.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tina talked to the Israelis and traced
dialog: this sucker to a group operating out
dialog: of Ramallah. That's the West Bank,
dialog: not the West Side for those of you
dialog: just joining us from Nebraska.
text: A few appreciative CHUCKLES. They're all exhausted. This is
dialog: the first good news in a bitch of a day.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Okay, we've pulled his landing card
dialog: and his I-94. So now we know he came
dialog: in three days ago, out of Frankfurt --
text: She points to where: A TIME-LINE has been created out of
text: colored strips beneath a bank of silent TV monitors.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What we need now is to fill in the
dialog: time between his arrival and the
dialog: incident. All known associations,
dialog: and most of all, we need an address.
scene_heading: TWO HOURS LATER --
text: The TIME-LINE is progressing. PHONE TECHNICIANS add tie-lines,
dialog: dedicated fax lines, wats lines and scrambled lines. Cable
text: everywhere. Danny and Frank pore over Ali Waziri's I-94.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: IAP66. What's IAP66?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hold on, hold on, I'm looking it up --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- Today, Danny...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Wait, wait -- Here we go. Student
dialog: Visa, J-1.
text: Hub has been pacing, nearby.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Where's the original --?
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: In his passport.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Which is... vaporized.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Where's the copy?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: At the point of issuance. Could be
dialog: the American Consulate in Tel Aviv.
dialog: The American Consulate in Amman,
dialog: Cairo, Alexandria, Riyadh -- all an
dialog: easy drive from the West Bank --
text: Hub suddenly had to fight off a wave of nausea and dizziness.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What time is it --?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Three-fifteen. P.M.
dialog: (off Hub's blank look)
dialog: When's the last time you ate?
text: Fred Darius, the young agent, appears.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Sir. They want you in the lab.
scene_heading: THROUGH A POWERFUL ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
text: Hub peers through the eyepiece at a MAGNIFIED STRAND of fiber.
speaker_heading: FIBER EXPERT (V.O.)
text: Pure, unadulterated, Egyptian cotton.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You're saying they're Egyptian?
speaker_heading: FIBER EXPERT
dialog: No. No... I'm just saying -- See...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- It's what they use for funerals.
text: The guy was wearing a shroud.
text: He looks at Frank. It's just as Elise said. The real deal.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Let's see if she's ready to talk.
speaker_heading: A HOLDING CELL
text: Elise sits quietly with the stillness of those who have been
text: there before. Hub enters.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I thought one phone call and you
dialog: were out of here.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I didn't make the call.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Why not?
text: She just looks at him, entirely neutral.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Are you alright --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Just some tinnitus in my left ear --
text: They look across the professional chasm that divides them.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I need to know what I don't know.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Life's too short.
text: But there's a hint of some thawing in her tone.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You hungry?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: We ordering in --?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: IN A DOWNTOWN DELI
text: Hub and Elise sit, eating corned beef sandwiches.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- The funeral shroud is the final
dialog: step in the ritual of self-
dialog: purification. First a fast, then --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- the washing of the body, then the
dialog: shroud. I saw it on Sixty Minutes.
dialog: Tell me something I don't know.
text: She pauses, always gauging how much to reveal. And when.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...Last March in Iraq, we identified
dialog: the man we believe responsible for
dialog: bombing the army barracks last year.
dialog: In August, he went to Lebanon. Where
dialog: he was... extracted.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Extracted? Extracted by whom?
text: (she just looks at
dialog: him)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal.
dialog: He's Iraqi. And something of a
dialog: religious leader.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: With something of a devoted following?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: ...Okay, I can understand why we
dialog: might not want to publicize the fact
dialog: that our government's in the
dialog: kidnapping business, but why not
dialog: tell us?
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: He's still being... debriefed. They're
text: not ready to go public with charges.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What else you got on his followers.
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: Clearly, they're committed.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: In this game, the most committed
dialog: wins.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So they'll just keep coming until we
dialog: release him.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Unless we match their commitment
dialog: with our own.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What about talking to this sheik?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You don't think they've got guys
dialog: talking to the sheik? Except the
text: sheik isn't talking.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So who's giving the orders? How do
dialog: they coordinate, pick their targets?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Believe me, we've put every resource
dialog: we've got onto that very question.
dialog: (puts down her fork)
dialog: Otherwise... we wait.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We wait.

speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: If there's anybody on earth who knows
dialog: how you feel, it's me. But you've
dialog: got to let it go. Those people were
dialog: dead the minute they got on the bus.
text: Frank Haddad appears, making his way toward their table.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sorry, boss. Hello, Elise. Mmmm, is
dialog: that pastrami?
dialog: (tastes it; then with
dialog: his mouth full)
dialog: Oh, yeah, we made the guy in the
dialog: picture.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A CAFE
text: Where Students sit inside and SMOKE, then SMOKE some more.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: My people. The last of the
text: unambivalent smokers.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Monsters. The toughest motherfucker
text: in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to
dialog: some of these guys.
text: They watch as SAMIR gets his bill from the waiter.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: His name's Samir Nazhde. Teaches
dialog: Arab Studies at Brooklyn College. He
dialog: sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa.
dialog: And dig this -- his brother blew up
text: a movie theatre in Tel Aviv.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You might consider leaving him alone.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Why would I consider doing that --?
text: In the cafe, Samir counts cash to leave on the table.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Play him like a cop and haul him in
dialog: now and get your arrest, or tag him
dialog: and let him lead you to the really
dialog: big fish.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (an arabic curse)
dialog: You're fishing and he's getting visas
dialog: for bombers.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You ever heard of catch and release?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Yes, and he's on the next plane for
dialog: Tunis.
text: Hub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Take him down.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (keys his radio)
dialog: Go.
text: THREE AGENTS brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him
text: to their car. Samir slides into the back seat next to Elise.
text: In the REARVIEW MIRROR, Hub watches as a look seems to pass
dialog: between them. Then again, it may not have happened.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Samir Nazhde, my name is Frank Haddad,
dialog: I'm a Federal Agent. We have reason
dialog: to believe you are an accessory to
dialog: the bombing of Bus 87.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Are you crazy --?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You are an associate of Ali Waziri.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Who? I know no one by that name.
text: Elise is looking out the window, seemingly oblivious.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You got him a student visa.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I sign these applications as a matter
dialog: of course, hundreds of them. Everyone
dialog: wants to come to the land of
dialog: opportunity and Baywatch.
text: Elise tries to keep a smile off her face. Hub clocks this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You spent two years in Israeli jails
dialog: during the Intifada.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: The only ones who didn't were women
dialog: like you.
text: Frank BACKHANDS him across the mouth. Samir says something
text: in Arabic to Frank, who responds in kind.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sorry. Family matter.
dialog: (to Samir)
dialog: You're going downtown, my friend.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You cannot hold me. I know my rights.
dialog: I watch American television.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Defrauding the INS is a Federal
dialog: Offense.
dialog: (hands Samir to waiting
dialog: agents)
dialog: Reservation for one, please.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CTF HEADQUARTERS - LATER
text: They enter the BULLPEN. It's well past midnight. People are
text: sacked-out in sleeping bags while others continue working.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Club Fed.
text: Frank leans over Danny Sussman, who has fallen asleep, face
text: down on his desk, and sings in a lovely brogue:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Oh, Danny-boy, the perps, the perps,
dialog: are call-ing...
dialog: (as he awakens)
dialog: We need a search warrant on Samir...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank, c'mere a sec. I want to show
dialog: you something.
text: He leads Frank into another CUBICLE. Perched on nearby desk,
text: Elise is dialing a phone, she stops to watch them:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Frank, you ever hit a prisoner again
dialog: I'll have your badge.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- Someday I will tell you what those
dialog: people did to my village in '71.
text: Hub waits for him to calm down.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (touches his arm)
dialog: Okay. But right now, act as if I'm
dialog: capable of saying something funny...
dialog: Now, let's go see about that warrant.
text: As they walk back, Hub says to Danny:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Find me a Judge who'll play ball
dialog: this time. And set up a polygraph
dialog: for Samir.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I still don't understand why we're
dialog: tipping our hand with him --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's there to tip?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You're just trying to protect your
dialog: asset.
dialog: (to Elise, pointedly:)
dialog: Aren't you, Elise --? He's your Joe,
dialog: your asset. He's working for you,
dialog: you're his case officer -- right?
dialog: How should she respond? How thin should she slice it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...Sometimes... in addition to being
dialog: a nationality, being a Palestinian
dialog: is also a... profession. A lucrative
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Meaning, he's your Joe.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Mine. Yours. The Israelis. The Saudis.
dialog: At one time or another, everybody in
dialog: the Middle East has slept with
dialog: everybody else.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So you're saying... you sleep around?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Only professionally.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So we share him.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: -- Call INS, find out his status and
dialog: start deportation proceedings.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I can't let you do that.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Oh, you can't let me do that. What
dialog: precisely is your involvement with
dialog: these people.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (sighs, then:)
dialog: Samir's been a very important...
dialog: project of mine for some time... I'm
dialog: the only one he'll deal with. He's
dialog: very well-connected -- and extremely
text: high-strung.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: ...Call the judge.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (looks at Frank)
dialog: How easy is it to get inside, Frank?
dialog: How good are your sources in the
dialog: mosques? How many people you got in
dialog: Hamas --?
text: Franks shakes his head, ruefully. She's right.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No surveillance. I've seen your deft
dialog: touch.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Daily reports. We tap his phone.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: And I get to see the transcripts.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Fair enough.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: And I run him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We share him.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: He can't know we're talking.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Then don't tell him.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: Let him fly.
dialog: (back to her)
dialog: But we better start seeing product.
text: She nods. A deal. For now.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Any more surprises for me?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Not tonight.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Then I'm going home to get some
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'll have somebody drive you.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I'll grab a cab.
text: And he's gone. Frank turns to Elise:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Elise. I'm really high strung, too.
text: She just smiles and walks away.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Not many people around. Hub stands on the corner. A TAXI
text: cruises up. On duty. Available. He slows long enough to see
text: that Hub is black and passes right by.
text: AT A RED LIGHT
text: The taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his
text: SHIELD on the windshield.
speaker_heading: IN THE TAXI
text: Hub sits in back, hurtling into the night. The driver's ID
text: identifies him as ABDUL HASSAM. Hub shakes his head.
speaker_heading: IN THE SHOWER
text: As the hot SPRAY hits him, he runs his hands through his
text: hair and feels the BITS OF SHATTERED GLASS. Dried blood runs
text: off in rivulets from his hands. Not his own. He leans against
text: the shower wall, closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ELISE -- BRUTALLY SLAPPED ACROSS THE FACE
text: We are in her apartment. Samir looms over her.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You let him HIT ME --!! You cannot
dialog: care about me and let such things
dialog: happen!
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Next time don't be such a smart ass --
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Sometimes I hate you just because
dialog: you are so American. It makes me
dialog: want to hurt you. I think about
dialog: fucking you and hurting you.
text: Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price
text: she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- You want to fuck me? Then work
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Don't tell me what I have to do.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No? Do we really want to have this
dialog: conversation again? Do we --?
text: Something quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes.
text: And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I need you to help me. I need you to
dialog: be strong. As you have always been
dialog: strong. For both of us. -- Samir?
dialog: Look at me...
text: BACK TO HUB -- WHO AWAKENS IN THE DARKNESS
text: He's fallen asleep in a chair. In his lap is a pile of visa
text: applications. His BEEPER goes off. He rouses himself.
scene_heading: BACK TO ELISE -- ROUGHLY TURNED OVER IN BED BY SAMIR
text: Sex without any shred of tenderness. As Samir kisses the
text: back of her neck, we SEE in her eyes the thousand-yard stare.
text: BACK TO HUB -- ON THE STREET
text: In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a
text: styrofoam cup of coffee. It's a ritual between them.
text: BACK TO ELISE -- LYING IN BED AS SAMIR SMOKES
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: -- Some people just cannot live in
dialog: the camps. For my brother, it was
text: already like dying. The only thing
dialog: he lives for is movies.
text: He sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: -- And then some sheik tells him
dialog: that, to die for Allah is beautiful.
dialog: If he does this thing, our parents
dialog: will be taken care of, and he will
dialog: live on in Paradise with seventy
dialog: virgins. Seventy.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: And my brother, he needs to believe
dialog: it very much, so he straps ten sticks
text: of dynamite to his chest and goes to
dialog: the movies...
dialog: (a rueful laugh)
dialog: And I become a VIP. It is very
dialog: confusing.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- So who are you afraid of betraying?
dialog: You know these people. They bomb,
dialog: they maim. Do they represent the
dialog: Palestine you want to build?
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: They're using you.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You are using me, too! Everybody
dialog: uses the Palestinians! We are the
dialog: whores of the Middle East!
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: You make reports about our little
dialog: talks --? What about fucking me?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I had to get special permission for
dialog: that.
text: As he stands up, naked, and goes to the window, we SEE:
speaker_heading: THE SAME IMAGE
text: Seen again, FROM MUCH FARTHER AWAY by Hub who stands on a
text: ROOFTOP across the way, watching through 10×50 BINOCULARS.
text: Frank stands beside him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Beats cable.

scene_heading: THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- NEXT MORNING
text: Hub heads for his office, his SECRETARY nods inside. Someone
text: is waiting. It's Devereaux, in a civilian suit.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Hi. I understand they call you Hub.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I know who you are, General.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: (offering his hand)
dialog: Bill Devereaux.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I served in the --
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: 82nd Airborne, I know. Same time I
dialog: was running the --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- 173rd. Put me through school.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: God. Duty. Honor. Country. Where on
dialog: Capitol Hill, Wall Street, or
dialog: Hollywood would you find one man
dialog: who's even paused over one of those
dialog: words in the last ten years?
text: Hub is unsure why he's audience to such a command performance.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What, uh, brings you here, General?...
dialog: Can I get you some coffee?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: You want me to get to the point. The
dialog: President's concerned. He's worried
dialog: that -- have you met him by any
dialog: chance?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: No, sir, I haven't. I know -- reading
dialog: the papers -- terrorism's a real
dialog: concern for him. And your job is to --
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: -- With all the affection for the
dialog: man I can tell you he doesn't know
dialog: fuckall about terrorism, or the
dialog: Mideast, that I don't put on his cue
dialog: cards. What he's expert in is his
dialog: own survival. You get my meaning?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I didn't guess you came all this way
dialog: for a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Agent Hubbard -- you look like you
dialog: think I'm here to take your baby
dialog: away!
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: With all respect for your expertise,
dialog: sir. We're on track here.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Which is what I said to the President --
dialog: the Army is not some big green police
dialog: department. Stick with the man on
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I appreciate your support.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: You're sure you're not chasing your
dialog: own tail, though?
text: Hub considers for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What do you know about Sheik Ahmed
dialog: Bin Talal?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Old news.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Maybe not. We've received two
dialog: communications -- from the bombers
dialog: to "Release Him."
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: We can't release him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I know our stated policy is not to
dialog: negotiate with terrorists, but --
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Hub, we can't release him because we
dialog: don't have him. We never had him.
dialog: And besides that, he's dead.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: The CIA says --
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: The CIA? The CIA couldn't predict
dialog: the fall of the Berlin Wall until
text: bricks were hitting them in the head.
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: The Libyans snatched the Sheik --
dialog: some sectarian Muslim thing -- I'll
dialog: explain it next time you have a free
dialog: week. They killed him. Qaddafi put
dialog: out disinformation that it was us...
dialog: Who was your source on this?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Elise Kraft.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: ...A woman will never know the Middle
dialog: East. You're talking about a culture
dialog: that keeps its women slipcovered.
dialog: Elise Kraft can't tell a Sheik from
dialog: the prophylactic of the same name.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I appreciate the heads up.
text: Devereaux rises, offers his hand. As they shake, Elise sticks
text: her head in the door without knocking.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Hub, we've got Judge Frankel in --
dialog: (as Devereaux turns
dialog: around)
dialog: Oh. Hello, General.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Please, don't let me --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (to Hub)
dialog: Sorry. That tip on the landlord looks
dialog: solid. The judge will see us right
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Sounds like I should get out of your
dialog: way. We're there if you need us.
dialog: (at the door; to Elise)
dialog: Your father well, Elise?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: As can be expected. How's Maggie?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
text: Top of her game.
dialog: (heads out)
dialog: Well, go get 'em.
text: And he's gone. Elise turns to Hub.
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: Making new friends.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How's your lip --?
text: She looks at Hub -- and now she knows that he knows. She
dialog: brazens it out:
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: So... you like to watch --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: No. Just learning about commitment.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It's a full contact sport.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: JUDGE'S CHAMBERS -- DOWNTOWN
text: Judge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: -- You're telling me that just because
dialog: some Brooklyn landlord tips you off
dialog: that he's been paid in cash, you
dialog: have the right to call in the cavalry --
dialog: ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash
dialog: is not yet a crime in this country.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You're not hearing me. This Khalil
dialog: was carrying cash for --
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: -- You've observed him giving cash
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: ... No, but --
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: -- But you have hard evidence linking
dialog: this apartment to the people that
dialog: blew up bus 87 --?
text: Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I know we'll turn up trace elements
dialog: of semtex, chemicals... something.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: And when you do, you'll get your
dialog: warrant.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What about as a feasibility study?
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: HUB
text: We enter first, take a look, then
dialog: fill out the warrant.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: Tell me the difference between that
dialog: and breaking-and-entering?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We're the good guys.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: Not good enough.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What is good enough, Judge? Another
dialog: bus? A school, maybe. These things
dialog: come in waves.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FRANKEL
dialog: Waves mean nothing to me; there's
dialog: been a wave of violent crime committed
dialog: by black people in this city for the
dialog: past twenty years, but if you came
dialog: to me with a plan to put all black
dialog: people behind bars as a preventative
dialog: measure I'd send you packing. There's
dialog: a price to be paid for living in a
dialog: free society --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- and not in cash I guarantee it.
text: Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here."
text: THE STAIRCASE OF A TENEMENT
text: Elise and Hub climb seemingly endless FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- Not two Judges from now, not two
text: HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from
dialog: now. These guys could split any SECOND
dialog: and you've lost your best shot at --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank's working another warrant --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You don't understand, they're pros!
dialog: From the age of twelve they've been
dialog: dodging people like you, people better
dialog: than you.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You mean people like you?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- no matter how sparkling your record
dialog: is, no matter how terrified you are
dialog: to fail --
text: Finally he stops, turns on her:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: It's... against... the... law.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- Just because you went to night
dialog: school, or filled out the back of a
dialog: matchbook or whatever you did to get
dialog: a law degree doesn't make you Sir
dialog: Thomas More.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Just because you talk the talk doesn't
dialog: make you an expert. And just because
dialog: you read my file doesn't make you an
dialog: expert on me.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You're gonna lose them and they're
dialog: gonna do another horrible --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- You think I want to lose them.
dialog: Where do you get off talking that
dialog: shit.
dialog: (controls himself...)
dialog: If I don't take 'em down properly
dialog: they'll be on the street two hours
dialog: from now. I could find dynamite,
text: semtex, plutonium and a book of
dialog: matches in there and unless I've got
dialog: the right warrant it's all
dialog: inadmissible
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They've also got a warrant. A warrant
dialog: from God. They're ready to die! And
dialog: your quaint laws don't mean shit to
dialog: these people.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: My quaint laws? Last I checked you
dialog: were an American citizen. And these
dialog: happen to be the only laws we got.
dialog: (turns on her)
dialog: Look, I'm just a cop, okay, and I'm
dialog: real sorry the cold war's over, and
dialog: you Masters of the Universe got
dialog: nothing going on over there in
dialog: Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever --
dialog: but you're just not in the Middle
dialog: East anymore...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Oh, really...?
text: They reach the top of the stairs where Frank is waiting. He
text: dangles a piece of paper -- the warrant -- and grins.
scene_heading: IN THE SAME SQUALID APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER
text: Hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an
text: apartment across the street -- paper shades drawn. Wearing a
text: set of HEADPHONES, Elise listens intently to the Arabic
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They're discussing how hard it is to
dialog: find a decent cup of coffee over
dialog: here.
dialog: (hands headset to
dialog: Frank)
dialog: I make out three voices. What do you
dialog: have on the infrared?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Three sounds right. If we had
dialog: microwave we'd know for sure. The
dialog: CIA's got microwave, how come we
dialog: don't have microwave.
text: Hub, meanwhile is question a Syrian Landlord.
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: -- three of them. All day long they
dialog: watch tv. And eat pizza. Nothing but
dialog: pizza, pizza, pizza...

scene_heading: DARK HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Mike Johannson, carrying two PIZZAS, knocks on a door.
text: IN THE SHADOWS BELOW
text: Hub, Frank, and a small army of AGENTS lock and load.
speaker_heading: A YOUNG ARAB
text: Opens the door to the length of a chain and hands Mike a
dialog: twenty-dollar bill.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You want change, right --?
speaker_heading: YOUNG ARAB
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You gonna open the door, or what --?
text: The Arab motions, leave them on the ground.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Jesus, didn't ya hear crime's down
dialog: seven-percent...
text: Muttering, he sets the pizza down and heads downstairs. After
text: a moment we HEAR the chain pulled and the door open.
scene_heading: IN THE APARTMENT
text: The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate. Two other
text: YOUNG ARABS in the next room barely take their eyes off the
text: rerun of "Hunter." But as the young Arab opens the box:
speaker_heading: A STUN GRENADE
text: Hidden within, EXPLODES with a blinding FLASH, knocking him
text: to the ground.
scene_heading: THE APARTMENT DOOR
text: Is blown in as armed AGENTS rush in, Hub leading the way.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENTS
dialog: (English and Arabic)
dialog: FBI --! Lie down on the floor with
dialog: your hands behind your back --!
scene_heading: THE TWO OTHER YOUNG ARABS, HOWEVER --
dialog: Have not been affected. Not only were they in the next room,
text: but also their eyes were averted from the FLASH.
text: THEY COME UP FIRING
text: But only get off half a clip each before they are CUT DOWN
text: by a fusillade of FBI return-fire.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: The Young Arab, momentarily disoriented, stumbles to his
text: feet, only to be confronted by six armed agents -- all aiming
text: at his chest.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Drop your weapon!
text: The terrorist puts his gun to his mouth and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
speaker_heading: A STILLNESS
text: As the CORDITE drifts lazily toward the ceiling, Hub calls
text: out from behind the table:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What about the others? See if we can
dialog: get a pulse --
text: Other Agents scurry in to hover over the inert BODIES.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Terminal.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Same here.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Gone.
text: Hub picks himself up in time to see Elise, kneeling beside
text: the body of the Young Arab, her hand on his boyish chest.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We got semtex, we got detcord, same
dialog: stuff as the bus, the whole
dialog: enchilada...
text: A few WHOOPS and high-fives as the adrenaline rush of the
text: firefight abates. Frank opens the remaining box.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Anybody like anchovies --?
text: Then from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous-
text: looking DEVICE. A claymore mine.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What --?
speaker_heading: HUB
text: It didn't fire. They had it rigged
text: to the door and it didn't fire.
text: Frank stares at the lethal booby-trap. Hub shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We're too old to be lucky, Frank.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DOWNTOWN BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Where Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off. Around them,
text: other AGENTS from the takedown laugh and drink.
text: AT A NEARBY TABLE
text: Hub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (sips her drink)
dialog: My first boyfriend was Palestinian.
dialog: My father liked to say, they seduce
dialog: you with their suffering.
text: A WAITRESS brings her another drink.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You ever been over there --?
text: (he shakes his head,
dialog: no)
dialog: ...The courtesy with which they
dialog: welcome you into their homes. And
dialog: the people, these incredibly... warm
dialog: people in this... austere land.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: But you work against them.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Only the crazies. I tend to be
dialog: suspicious of all true believers.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: Present company included.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So I'm a fanatic.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Let's just say you don't seem the
dialog: ambivalent type.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: So why're are you a fed?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: That's what my nephew keeps asking
dialog: me. "Why you with The Man, Unc?"
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...Well? What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You read my file. You tell me.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Let's see... Catholic school. Captain
dialog: of this, president of that. Hard
dialog: work, fair play, make a difference,
dialog: change the system from within. Rah.
dialog: Rah. Rah.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: That was in my file?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...Tell me I'm wrong.
text: He studies her for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...What --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You believe in anything, Elise --?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Like what, for instance?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How about right and wrong?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It's easy to choose between right
dialog: and wrong. What's hard is choosing
dialog: the wrong that's more right. I just
dialog: want to make it all... a little...
dialog: better.
dialog: (finishes her drink)
dialog: Ignore me. I'm shitfaced.
text: Frank appears to lean over their table.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us
dialog: about being a spook? Ever meet Aldrich
dialog: Ames? Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You were in charge of Waco, right --
dialog: ? Or was that Ruby Ridge?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The Shah of Iran, Noriega, I love
dialog: the way you guys predicted the
dialog: collapse of the Soviet Union.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar
dialog: Hoover wore a dress.
text: She laughs and stands up to dance:
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What do you say, Hub...? Peace?
text: But as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on. They stand
text: there awkwardly. Finally, he takes her into his arms.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: This feels like high school.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- only my prom date wasn't packing
text: a gun.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours?
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Two inches. From the ground.
dialog: (laughing, they dance
dialog: closer)
dialog: So what's the latest from Samir. I
dialog: want a list of every visa he
dialog: sponsored.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Not sure he'll do it.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I once knew this undercover guy,
dialog: started to care so much about his
dialog: source --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- Samir's a source. Period.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Have you considered that he might
dialog: also be in bed with the other side?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Samir in bed with them? That would
dialog: too much to wish for.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You're so confident.
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: Only in bed.
text: Tina watches them. She rolls her eyes at Frank. And then:
text: THE GROUND SHAKES
text: A low RUMBLE as the light FLICKERS and the chandelier sways.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whoa... What do they put in these
dialog: drinks --?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: They got earthquakes in Manhattan?
text: But Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. Hub
text: joins her. Already, in the distance, the WAILING OF SIRENS.
scene_heading: IN THE TOWN CAR -- SPEEDING UPTOWN ON MADISON AVE
text: Blue light FLASHING. Hub, Elise and Frank sit grimly silent.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC
text: Is snarled and gridlocked at 40th. Finally, they can take it
text: no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS.
text: THEY BEGIN TO RUN
text: Past the frustrated drivers. Turning the corner at 41st where:
scene_heading: SMOKE BILLOWS
text: From the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking
dialog: place.
scene_heading: GIRL IN A PRADA GOWN
text: Walks toward CAMERA. She's stunning. From the jeweled
dialog: clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect,
dialog: except:
text: HER RIGHT ARM IS MISSING
dialog: And now we SEE:
scene_heading: THE BLACK-AND-WHITES
text: Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS
text: already unspooling their hoses. Cops, Firemen, EMT's.
text: Everybody's SCREAMING. Hub and Elise race past.
scene_heading: MAN IN BLACK TIE
text: Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.
scene_heading: THE FEW SURVIVORS
text: Their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented.
text: As Hub and Elise continue toward a SOUND we have never heard
text: before in this country. A kind of keening.
text: A NYPD SERGEANT is the senior OFFICER on the scene. Hub shows
text: his shield to the man who appears a bit shell-shocked.
speaker_heading: NYPD SERGEANT
dialog: -- fucking bastards waited 'til
text: intermission. Everybody standing
dialog: around... Oh, Jesus...
text: GLASS crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly
text: disfigured BODIES are carried out. A NEWS REPORTER shoves a
text: microphone in Hub's face.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: Is it true the governor was attending
dialog: tonight's benefit --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: Who it is I'm speaking to --?
text: Hub ignores the reporter. He sees that Elise is already
text: tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a SOCIETY MATRON.
text: He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DARKENED AIRPLANE
text: Hub sits alone.
speaker_heading: PILOT (O.S.)
dialog: Folks, as you can probably tell, we
dialog: have begun our descent into
dialog: Washington's National airport.
text: THE HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND IS HEARD AGAIN
text: Hub reaches up to his DAMAGED EARS. As anyone who's ever
text: flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: -- You alright?
text: But we can only LIP-READ her question. He's sweating now.
dialog: Over this, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: ARMY GENERAL (V.O.)
dialog: Either we answer this threat quickly
dialog: and convincingly or next week there'll
dialog: be a hundred more all over the world.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: ON CAPITOL HILL -- LATER THAT DAY
text: As Hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate
dialog: continues within:
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.)
dialog: Sounds great, General, except why
dialog: can't we find out who's behind it --
dialog: ?
scene_heading: IN THE ROTUNDA LIBRARY
text: A strategy session chaired by General Devereaux. Sleeves
text: rolled up, silver coffee service. Staff members abound.
speaker_heading: FBI DIRECTOR
dialog: These sects are organized so you
dialog: need a kill to your credit to get
dialog: inside. It makes undercover operations
dialog: impossible. What that leaves us is...
dialog: we're working on it.
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: How about who's behind who's behind
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: CIA DIRECTOR
text: Libya. Iraq. Iran. Possibly Syria.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Ask a question. Get an atlas.
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: All I know is that we must respond.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Respond, sure. But how?
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: Find out who it is and bomb the shit
text: out of them.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: And if we can't find out --?
text: The question hangs in the air.
scene_heading: CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
dialog: Look it keeps escalating. First a
dialog: bus, then the theatre. What's next?
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: Anything but leadership.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: With all respect, Senator, why don't
dialog: we just stipulate that the President
dialog: is a dumb son of a bitch so we can
dialog: all get down to business.
text: An icebreaker. Everyone laughs.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.)
dialog: What about sending in the Guard?
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL (V.O.)
dialog: The National Guard are trained for
dialog: riot control not counter-terrorism.
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: The Army then. I've seen the
dialog: contingency plans.
scene_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: It's settled legal doctrine, posse
dialog: comitatus, that the Army not be turned
dialog: against our own people.
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: Even if that's what our own people
dialog: are asking for, three to one?
scene_heading: SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
dialog: If the President is willing to declare
dialog: a State of Emergency --
speaker_heading: SENATOR WRIGHT
dialog: President Lincoln declared martial
dialog: law in 1862. He suspended --
scene_heading: ATTORNEY GENERAL
dialog: -- which the Supreme Court later
dialog: found un-constitutional. Ex parte
dialog: Milligan.
scene_heading: CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
dialog: And I've got an election in November.
dialog: Ex-United States Congressman.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Guys, guys, the President lost a lot
dialog: of friends last night --
scene_heading: CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
dialog: Not to mention six points in the
dialog: polls.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
text: -- And his plane lands in two hours.
dialog: We owe it to him to have a consensus.
scene_heading: SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
dialog: You don't fight a junkyard dog with
dialog: ASPCA rules. What you do is take the
dialog: leash off your own, bigger, meaner
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: ...General?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: The Army is a broadsword not a
dialog: scalpel. You do not want us in an
dialog: American city.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: But hypothetically... how long would
dialog: it take you to --
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: We only go if the President invokes
dialog: the War Powers Act.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: I understand that, General. Let us
dialog: imagine, though, for a moment, that
dialog: the order has been given.
text: CLOSE on Devereaux. As he weighs his remarks, we FLASHCUT,
dialog: almost imperceptibly to:
scene_heading: AN ANONYMOUS ROOM
text: As WATER is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized
text: manner. O.S. we HEAR the SOUND of chanting.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM -- SAME TIME
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: ...Twelve hours after the President
dialog: gives the word we can be on the
dialog: ground. One light infantry division
dialog: of ten thousand seven hundred men.
dialog: Elements of the Rapid Deployment
dialog: Force combined with Special Forces --
text: Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters.
dialog: And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1
text: assault rifle, a humble weapon until
text: you see a man carrying one outside
dialog: your local bowling alley or Seven-
dialog: Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be
dialog: scary and it will not be mistaken
text: for a VFW parade.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS ROOM
text: Where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. We watch
text: in SLOW-MOTION as it drifts down a shoulder.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
text: That means civilian casualties. At a
text: minimum it's a drunk private joyriding
text: in a Hummer who runs down an old
dialog: lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Make no mistake. We will hunt the
dialog: enemy. We will find the enemy. And
dialog: we will kill the enemy.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS HANDS
text: Turning the key in an ignition. An engine rumbles to life.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: (looks at them)
dialog: And no card-carrying member of the
text: ACLU is more deadset against it...
dialog: than I am. Which is why I urge you...
dialog: no, I implore you not to consider
dialog: this option.
text: A long beat. The Chief of Staff sighs.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: I know what the President will say.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: That's exactly why you're the only
dialog: man for the job.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- A VAN
text: Emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
text: The Army General speaks up.
speaker_heading: ARMY GENERAL
dialog: I remind you General Devereaux does
dialog: not speak for official Army policy.
text: A police function has become accepted
dialog: as our role in Haiti, in Somalia --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Could I interrupt?
text: Everyone looks over at Hub. Devereaux smiles.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: That's Anthony Hubbard, FBI. He's
text: the ASAC on the ground up there.
dialog: They took out the first cell less
dialog: than 36 hours after bus 87. I suggest
dialog: we hear what he has to say --
text: He nods to Hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: There is something you probably
dialog: haven't thought about doing?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: And that is --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Nothing. Don't over-react.
dialog: (off their incredulity)
dialog: With all respect, gentlemen, I'm
dialog: just a cop. To you these people may
dialog: be martyrs, but to me they're
dialog: criminals. And a criminal is no more
dialog: than somebody who thinks he's better
dialog: than everyone else. And he's not
dialog: better. He only has to be wrong once.
dialog: And that's where we come in. We run
dialog: down a tip from a landlord, or we
text: pick up a latent print from a bus.
text: Our phones are ringing off the hook
dialog: with people from the Arab community
dialog: wanting to help.
text: He measures his words carefully. Unaccustomed to these kind
text: of august circumstances.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: They love this country and they hate
dialog: that these criminals are giving them
text: a bad name. With their help and some
dialog: old-fashioned shoe leather, we'll
dialog: nail these guys.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: -- Amen to that.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Thank you, Agent Hubbard. I, too,
dialog: think we should proceed cautiously.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Now we've got an Agency briefing
dialog: prepared... Some of you may not know
dialog: Sharon Bridger. Sharon was posted in
dialog: Iraq as part of our covert operations
dialog: during the Gulf War. -- Sharon...
text: CLOSE ON -- HUB as, from behind him, comes a familiar VOICE:
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: We all know the traditional model of
dialog: a terrorist network. One cell
dialog: controlling all others. Cut off the
text: head and the body will wither.
text: Hub looks to the back of the room at Elise, who's no longer
text: Elise. She looks blithely at Hub as if nothing is amiss.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Unfortunately the old wisdom no longer
dialog: applies. The new paradigm is like
dialog: the myth of the Hydra. Each cell
dialog: exists independent of the other. Cut
text: off one head and another rises up in
dialog: its place.
scene_heading: ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN
text: Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, keeping well below the speed
text: limit. In the distance, the glass towers of Manhattan.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Bus 87 was the work of Cell #1. Its
dialog: elimination only activated the work
text: of Cell #2 -- the theatre gala.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT -- THE VAN
text: Turns up Wall Street. Frank Haddad and Danny exit THE FEDERAL
text: BUILDING. They pass Mike and Fred, heading back in. Something
text: about the van causes Frank to take notice.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: And Cell #3? How do we find Cell #3?
text: Everyone looks to Sharon/Elise. Hub looks at her, too.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON -- SHARON/ELISE
text: The question hangs in the air. She's thinking about something.
dialog: What?
scene_heading: ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN
text: JUMPS THE CURB and heads across the plaza on A COLLISION
text: COURSE with the glass lobby of the FEDERAL BUILDING. Frank
text: and Danny are rooted to the ground.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM
text: Close on Sharon/Elise. As time elongates. She knows.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: We don't know.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: WHITE SCREEN (ALL SOUND OUT)
text: Puffy clouds in a blue sky. As we TILT DOWN into:
scene_heading: THE GUTTED RUIN
text: Of what was once the Federal Building. RESCUE WORKERS hunt
text: for SURVIVORS as others carry BODY BAGS toward waiting
text: AMBULANCES. Hub stands sentinel to the grisly process as
text: indeed he has stood there all night. Frank is beside him.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Are they confirmed?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fred, Whitney, we're waiting on who
dialog: else...
text: A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Sharon.
text: Their silence speaks volumes. With Sharon is an OFFICER.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: This is Colonel Hardwick. Army
dialog: Intelligence.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (shaking hands)
dialog: Anthony Hubbard. Average intelligence.
dialog: (clocking him)
dialog: But 'til I hear otherwise this is
dialog: still my show.
scene_heading: COL. HARDWICK
dialog: I'm here as an advisor only. I intend
dialog: to keep a low profile.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I appreciate that, Colonel.
scene_heading: COL. HARDWICK
dialog: I don't mean to be insensitive, but
dialog: what, exactly, are your capabilities
dialog: at this point? Your... infrastructure --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You're standing on our infrastructure.
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Hub walks back toward the rubble. Sharon watches him go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HUB'S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT
text: Sofas have been pushed against the wall. Hub's apartment now
text: serves as a temporary command post. Agents huddle together --
text: poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files.
speaker_heading: FLOYD
dialog: -- They managed to get a partial
text: VIN# off the van. DMV says it was
dialog: reported stolen the day before in --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Fiber thinks they've come up with a
text: piece of the shroud. Egyptian cotton.
text: Frank joins them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (grim)
dialog: We just got a confirmation on Mike.
text: He was with Fred in the lobby.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How many does that make it --?
text: A KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the
text: agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I'm... very sorry... about your
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (giving her nothing)
dialog: Frank. This is Sharon.
dialog: (to her)
dialog: -- I didn't catch the last name.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Been better.
text: She nods. Takes from her purse a folder, labeled in Hebrew.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: The agency has come up with another
dialog: list of probables.
text: She takes out photos. Neither Hub nor Frank react. She puts
text: them on the coffee table. No one reaches for them.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I think we should circulate them.
dialog: (they stonewall her:)
dialog: Hey, this stuff may be good.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Why was there no warning from Samir?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Because he didn't know anything.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Says Samir.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Says me.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Maybe I'll ask him.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Over my dead body.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Over six hundred dead bodies.
text: They stare at one another. Both are tired and raw.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Look, he's one of the good guys.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How the fuck can you be so sure?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Because he helped me recruit the
dialog: network in Iraq. OKAY?
text: He just stares at her.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: We were part of the operation to
dialog: destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing
dialog: up fake dinars, arming the Kurds --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- and financing the Sheik.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: He's Iraqi. He was going to be our
dialog: Ayatollah Khomeini --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- And help bring down Saddam.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I ran the network. Samir was the go-
dialog: between. He risked his life for us
dialog: over there.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So who are they? Give me names, Give
dialog: me pictures. Not some history lesson.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I can't give you pictures because I
dialog: don't know what they look like. We
dialog: did everything at arm's length.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So you got nothing.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I've got Samir.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Has he had any contact with them?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Minimal.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How does he do it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: He can't. They initiate.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: And otherwise...
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: He's waiting.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: He's waiting? What's he waiting for?
dialog: More bodies? We got lots more
dialog: buildings in midtown, maybe he's
dialog: waiting to see how many they can
dialog: blow up.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Look, I know how you must feel --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT HOW I FEEL -- MY
text: FRIENDS ARE DEAD. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
text: ARE DEAD.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They'll make contact soon.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How?... Why soon?
text: She looks at him, refusing to divulge anything more. Suddenly,
text: Hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into:
speaker_heading: THE BATHROOM
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (viciously)
dialog: What's the tradecraft, Sharon?
dialog: Ironsites, visuals? I love all that
dialog: spy shit.
dialog: (still, she says
dialog: nothing)
dialog: I'm gonna haul your boy downtown,
text: strap his ass to a polygraph and ask
dialog: him all about you. Then I'm gonna
dialog: send the transcripts to a friend of
dialog: mine at the Times who just loves to
dialog: write about the latest CIA link to
dialog: some political horror show.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You burn him, you lose any chance
dialog: you ever had.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: It's lose-lose from here on in, who
dialog: said that?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I'm not fucking with you.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How can you possibly remember who
dialog: you're fucking?
text: She slaps him, hard. Without hesitation he slaps her back.
text: She claws at his face, but he grabs her wrist and bends her
text: arm behind her back.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I need... more time. Please. You're
dialog: hurting me. Please...
text: Something in the violence of the moment is more than a little
dialog: charged.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: My department WHAT, ASSHOLE...?
text: Sharon stands at the back, meets Hub's eye, and waves.
scene_heading: DISTRICT ATTORNEY
dialog: Guys... GUYS...
text: EVERYBODY'S talking at once. In frustration, Hub covers a
text: microphone with his hand. The FEEDBACK silences the room.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Sorry. From now on, we will raise
dialog: our hands and wait to be called on --
text: An appreciative chuckle. Hub points to A MAN IN A SUIT.
speaker_heading: INS OFFICIAL
dialog: Howard Kaplan. INS. So we've pulled
dialog: every ethnic visa in the city and
dialog: traced them to source. Who wants em?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Danny --?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We bring 'me in, have a talk.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP (V.O.)
dialog: What about translators --?
speaker_heading: DISTRICT ATTORNEY (V.O.)
dialog: How many people we talking about
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: INS OFFICIAL
dialog: Sixteen hundred, maybe more.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Where the hell we gonna put sixteen
dialog: hundred people?
text: Everyone again begins speaking at once. Hub takes control.
speaker_heading: MAN IN SUIT
dialog: What about a military presence at
dialog: JFK and LaGuardia --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I don't think we're there yet. It's
dialog: also not going to stop these people.
speaker_heading: MAYORAL AA
dialog: What about protecting the Arab
dialog: population? There's a lot of anger --
speaker_heading: ARAB SPOKESMAN (V.O.)
dialog: I represent the American-Arab Anti-
dialog: Discrimination Committee. Whatever
dialog: injustices my people may be suffering
dialog: at this difficult moment, we will
dialog: continue to show our patriotism and
dialog: our commitment to this country.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Thank you, sir. And to everyone else
dialog: for their patience today. These are
dialog: extremely difficult times -- London,
dialog: Paris, we're not the first city to
dialog: have to deal with this.
text: He pauses a moment, searching for the words.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew
dialog: up the market, the market was full.
dialog: (looks out at them)
dialog: This is New York. We can take it.
text: And then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone
text: looks at one another. Dear God, what now...
scene_heading: A GRAINY BLACK &amp; WHITE VIDEO IMAGE
text: Kids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of
dialog: what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in:
scene_heading: AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: Hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast-
text: barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: -- one of the moms was carrying a
text: piece, wounds the guy as he's planting
text: the device. He kills her and locks
dialog: them all in.
dialog: (points at video)
dialog: Up there in the corner... by the
dialog: clock.
text: The probe is a hot-head, "arthroscopic" video camera.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: -- It's got a timer on it only we
dialog: don't know how much time is left.
text: As Hub stares at the horrifying image, the WHITE-NOISE returns
text: and begins to GROW in his head.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Closer on the timer.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I'm trying but the angle's wrong...
text: The NOISE in Hub's head continues to grow. And then suddenly
text: it is compounded by the SOUND of an APPROACHING CHOPPER --
text: as an NYPD SWAT HELICOPTER lowers itself into view.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the fuck is the NYPD doing here?!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't know. Somebody must have --
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: -- WE'VE RUN DRILLS ON THIS
scene_heading: JURISDICTION BULLSHIT SINCE --
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I KNOW --! YOU THINK I --
speaker_heading: HUB
text: QUIT BICKERING AND FIX IT!
text: In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.
speaker_heading: THE WHITE NOISE
text: Is screaming now in Hub's head. Unimaginable. Unbearable.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (on his radio)
dialog: NYPD SWAT, this is the FBI. Get that
dialog: bird the fuck out of there!
text: The SOUND of the CHOPPER and the WHITE NOISE drown him out.
scene_heading: ON THE VIDEO MONITOR
text: Children are SCREAMING without sound. Even the chopper is
text: drowned out by the WHITE NOISE.
scene_heading: IN THE CHOPPER
text: The MARKSMAN takes careful aim --
scene_heading: IN THE CLASSROOM
text: The TERRORIST grabs a child as a human shield. Hub closes
text: his eyes to the imminent nightmare, and then:
scene_heading: SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING --
text: He takes off, barreling down the hall, toward the locked
text: door of the classroom.
scene_heading: THE DOOR SPLINTERS
text: He flies through it, firing, hitting the TERRORIST twice.
speaker_heading: AN EXPLOSION
text: Much like the first one on Bus 99. Hub throws himself over
text: several SCREAMING CHILDREN. And for a moment we don't know
dialog: if they'll live or die, until:
text: BLUE PAINT covers them all. Agents pour in, followed by
text: Sharon. There, on the floor, holding as many weeping children
dialog: as he can:
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more,
text: is also weeping now. Weeping for the victims of the bombings,
text: weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself.
text: And for a moment, everyone just... stands there, vaguely
text: embarrassed, and more than a little moved.
scene_heading: INT. HUB'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT
text: Hub sits in his boxers, toweling blue paint from his hair,
text: listening to the CNN report of the school attack. A KNOCK at
text: the door. He pulls on his pants. It's Sharon.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: This just came in.
text: She hands Hub another fax: "Last Warning. Release Him." He
text: looks at it and hands it back to her without a word.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: My neck's a little stiff, that's
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (a long look)
dialog: That's not what I meant.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I know.
text: They stand awkwardly in the doorway for a moment.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You want a drink?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Sure.
text: He walks over and opens a bottle of scotch.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: That was a pretty crazy thing you
dialog: did today.
text: He doesn't respond. Hands her the drink.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Better days.
text: She takes a drink. Then another.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel
dialog: like... being alone... tonight.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Where's Samir?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I could call him. Maybe he'd join
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You'd like that.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I might. Or I could call Tina.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: 555-6354.
text: They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy
dialog: recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but
dialog: I did what I had to do.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: You know as well as I do, running an
dialog: agent can be very... complicated.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How about running an FBI agent?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You think I'm trying to run you?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: ...Why else are you here?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (staring right back)
dialog: ...You know why I'm here.
text: It's a charged moment. They're two sad and lonely people.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Tell me to leave.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Leave.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No.
text: When they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something
text: more than comfort and less than love.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: The Chief of Staff is working late in a cardigan sweater.
text: Devereaux, in his impeccable suit, stands opposite him. Even
text: at ease he is smartly erect.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: The FBI received another fax.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under
dialog: the impression that we have him.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Do we? Have him?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: To refresh your memory, as I told
dialog: you last time, it was the Libyans
dialog: who --
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: I remember perfectly well what you
dialog: said last time.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: Do we?
text: Devereaux frosts him with a look.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Let me give you some free advice,
dialog: son. Don't get between me and the
dialog: President. You might break a nail.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: I am speaking for the President.
text: He and Devereaux look at each other. It is the moment of
dialog: plausible deniability.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: As far as the President is
dialog: concerned... No, we do not.
text: The Chief of Staff accepts the answer because it serves him,
text: for now. And because he has a more pressing agenda.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: General, do you know that after
dialog: yesterday's attack, half the parents
dialog: in this country kept their children
dialog: out of school --?
dialog: (Devereaux nods)
dialog: ...They're attacking our way of life.
dialog: It's got to stop. And the President
dialog: cannot afford to be weak.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: (reading the subtext)
dialog: Are you saying the President is
dialog: prepared to take the necessary
dialog: steps...?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: I'm saying, the President is prepared
dialog: to be... Presidential.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HUB'S APARTMENT - DAWN
text: A ringing phone. Hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. He looks
text: around and realizes he is alone. Did last night even happen?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down,
dialog: slow down --
text: He reaches for the remote control, turns on the TV.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A GRINDING OF TREADS ON ASPHALT -- DAWN
text: as THE FIRST APC enters Brooklyn. Followed by another. And
text: another. And in a sound bite: General Devereaux, IN FATIGUES
text: FOR THE FIRST TIME, and looking like grim death.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Today, with the invocation of the
dialog: War Powers Act by the President, I
dialog: am declaring a state of martial law
dialog: in this city.
text: THE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN HAS BEGUN
text: Road blocks set up at select intersections. Random stop-and-
text: frisk. Patrols of young soldiers in the streets. GANG KIDS,
text: same age, same color, eye them warily.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: To the best of our knowledge, we are
dialog: opposed by no more than twenty of
text: the enemy. He is hiding among a
dialog: population of roughly two million.
scene_heading: THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE
text: Is closed. SOLDIERS in full battle-dress stop cars, check
text: trunks, handbags, briefcases, and id's. THE LINE OF HONKING,
text: ANGRY MOTORISTS stretches as far as the eye can see.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Intelligence tells us he is most
dialog: likely Arab-speaking, between the
text: age of fourteen and thirty. Narrowing
dialog: the target to fifteen thousand
dialog: suspects.
text: A SWARTHY TEENAGER is pulled from A CAR by a SERGEANT and
text: led away to a CAMOUFLAGED TENT set up on the bridge.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: We can further reduce that number
dialog: down to those who have been in this
dialog: country less than six months. Now
dialog: you have twenty hiding among two
dialog: thousand.
text: A CAR TRUNK is inspected. Two women waved through.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: If you are one of these twenty young
dialog: men, you can hide among a population
dialog: of similar ethnic background.
dialog: Unfortunately for you, you can only
dialog: hide there. And that population, in
dialog: the classic immigration pattern, is
dialog: concentrated. Right here in Brooklyn.
text: Hub and Sharon stare at the Orwellian tableau.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: We intend to seal off this borough.
dialog: And then we intend to squeeze it.
dialog: This is the land of opportunity,
dialog: gentlemen. The opportunity to turn
dialog: yourselves in. After sundown tonight
dialog: any young man fitting the profile I
dialog: described who has not cooperated
dialog: will be arrested and detained.
text: Hub and Sharon show their ID's to an MP.
speaker_heading: MP
dialog: Would you follow me, please. The
dialog: General is expecting you.
text: He leads him to A CAMOUFLAGED TENT on the service roadway.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: There is historically nothing more
text: corrosive to the morale of an army
dialog: than policing its own citizens.
scene_heading: IN THE TENT
text: The swarthy teenager is being interrogated by COL. HARDWICK.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: But the enemy would be sadly mistaken
dialog: if they were to doubt our resolve.
text: They are now face to face with the
text: most fearsome killing machine in the
dialog: history of man. And I intend to use
dialog: it. And be back on base in time for
dialog: the play-offs... That is all.
text: Devereaux sees Hub and strides over to him:
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Hub. Good to see you again.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I can't say the same, sir. Not in
dialog: that uniform. I thought you were
dialog: against this.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: I am against it. It wasn't my call.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: "I'm only following orders" didn't
dialog: work at Nuremberg. It may not be
dialog: your policy but they're your tactics.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Your operation had its chance, Hub,
dialog: and you couldn't get it done. You're
dialog: down three touchdowns. Time to bring
text: in the first string.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Against our own team?
text: Devereaux suddenly goes ice cold.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Are you questioning my patriotism?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I'm questioning your judgement, yes,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Hub, I want you to take a moment and
dialog: reflect on my life as a soldier. I
dialog: have a dozen tropical diseases I'll
dialog: never entirely get rid of. I set off
text: metal detectors with the shrapnel in
dialog: my ass. I have watched men die and I
dialog: have killed. Now I am serving my
dialog: President and quite possibly not the
dialog: best interests of my country, but my
dialog: profession doesn't afford me the
dialog: luxury of that distinction. I won't
dialog: question your patriotism but don't
dialog: you ever again question my command.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I'm not under your command, General.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Take a good look around, my friend,
dialog: and tell me that's still true.
dialog: (softening his tone)
dialog: But we're not shutting you out. In
dialog: fact, I can't do it without you,
dialog: Hub. I need men like you. Men willing
dialog: to put it on the line like you did
dialog: in that schoolroom.
dialog: (gestures to his
dialog: uniform)
dialog: These stars mean I have been putting
dialog: it on the line for thirty years...
dialog: and never made a mistake worth
dialog: remembering. Don't tell me I made a
dialog: mistake about you.
scene_heading: ON THE BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Hub and Sharon exit the command tent.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: They're not shutting us out. They
dialog: need men like me.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick.
dialog: You ever met anybody so in love with
dialog: the sound of his own voice?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We're putting Samir in play.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Now? With all this going on? He's
dialog: freaked.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Oh, right, he's high-strung. Only
dialog: you can manage him. You and the CIA
dialog: and the DIA and God-knows-who-else
dialog: you're really working for --!
dialog: (seething)
dialog: Get back in there, Sharon, Elise,
dialog: whatever the fuck your name is --
dialog: They'll probably make you a Colonel...
dialog: if you're not one already.
text: She gestures at the military leviathan.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: All this... is no more in our interest
dialog: than it is in yours, Hub.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What, exactly, are your interests,
dialog: Sharon? You protect Samir, you protect
dialog: the agency. You're interested in
dialog: protecting everything but your
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You have no idea what I do for my
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: No, and I don't want to know. With
dialog: you or without you we're putting
text: Samir in play. Now.
text: She looks at him for a long moment. Considering:
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: One more lamb to the slaughter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A HALF-OPENED DOOR OF AN APARTMENT
text: Samir looks and sees Hub, standing beside Sharon.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Oh, my God. Oh, my God...
text: He tries to SLAM the door, but they force it open. He grabs
text: A FAT JOINT from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to Sharon)
dialog: Does he understand the difference
dialog: between the FBI and the DEA?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Samir... It's fine, he's cool.
text: OUTSIDE, the sound of gunfire. Samir reappears, wild-eyed.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Listen to that --! Are you listening?
dialog: They're killing Arabs out there!
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You can stop it all right now.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What are you talking about --? The
dialog: army is here. They're setting up
text: interrogation centers right now.
text: They're torturing people in cellars.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Let's just calm down for a second...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: -- I've got to get out of here. You
dialog: have to help me --
text: He goes over and peers out the drawn curtains.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (gentling a horse)
dialog: We'll take care of you... don't worry.
dialog: You just have to calm down --
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Money... I must have more money...
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- You got a student visa for Ali
dialog: Waziri. Because... somebody asked
dialog: you to -- Didn't they --?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I... got it myself.
text: Sharon CRACKS him across the face.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Liar --!
text: Now it's Samir's turn to taste the blood in his mouth.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You... tell him... what he wants to
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to Sharon)
dialog: Hey, that's enough.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: He knows. He fucking knows.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She's crazy. They're ghosts. Jinn.
dialog: They'd never trust someone like me.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Stop simpering.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I've got a picture of the two of us,
dialog: do you remember that picture, Samir?
dialog: (the mask coming off:)
dialog: I'm going to post that picture in
dialog: every mosque in Brooklyn. And then
dialog: I'm gonna send copies to some friends
dialog: of mine on the West Bank. You've got
dialog: family there, don't you --?
text: Hub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Let go of me --
text: He gives her the BUM'S RUSH out of the apartment, shuts the
text: door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Now... Nobody's going to burn you,
dialog: nobody's going to call anybody --
dialog: (sits beside him)
dialog: -- Who asked you to get that visa?
text: Samir is trembling. Tears roll down his cheeks.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Don't be afraid. I can protect you.
dialog: There's nothing to be afraid of.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I'm afraid of going to hell.
text: Hub just sits there. He knows he's got him. Finally:
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: His name is Tariq Husseini. He runs
text: an auto shop.
dialog: (Hub waits for more --)
dialog: ...on Commerce Street in Red Hook.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (hands him a card)
dialog: My beeper number. Anybody messes
dialog: with you, I'm there in twenty minutes.
text: He gets up and walks into:
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: Where Sharon waits. As they head for the stairs we HEAR:
speaker_heading: ELISE (V.O.)
dialog: You're good.
speaker_heading: HUB (V.O.)
dialog: You're not so bad yourself.
dialog: But we are HEARING IT along with:
scene_heading: COL. HARDWICK
text: In a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest
dialog: microwave technology (the kind the FBI don't yet have), he
text: has OVERHEARD the entire conversation.
speaker_heading: ON A NOTEPAD
text: In his lap, the name, "Tariq Husseini."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: OUTSIDE SAMIR'S APARTMENT
text: They are in a housing project. Hub dials his cell phone.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You calling Devereaux.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Didn't get his number. Darn.
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Floyd, Hub. We need to put something
dialog: together in a big-ass hurry... Where's
dialog: Frank --?... Give him a 911.
text: A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up beside them and armed soldiers
text: hop out. Sharon watches them as Hub continues:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: -- and find some kind of beat-up
dialog: car... Well, beat it up yourself if
dialog: you have to... 896 Commerce St...
dialog: it's a garage in Red Hook... but
dialog: remember --
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: -- they're pros.
text: A PSY-OPS VAN passes by, broadcasting through a P.A.
speaker_heading: VAN LOUDSPEAKER
dialog: -- all persons without proper
dialog: authorization must be off the street
dialog: until seven a.m. Failure to comply
dialog: will result in immediate arrest.
text: The announcement is then repeated in Arabic.
scene_heading: ROUNDING A CORNER
text: They come upon several more YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES. From within
text: the various apartments the SHRILL PROTESTS of mothers and
text: sisters as YOUNG MEN fitting the "terrorist profile" are
text: hustled into the BUSES.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Tariq will go to ground.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: We can hit him in less than an hour.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (turns to leave)
text: Hit him hard.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I've got to stash Samir someplace
dialog: safe.
dialog: (as she goes)
dialog: Go with God.
text: Hub hurries on toward his car, passing TEENAGE GIRLS,
text: defiantly wearing Keffiyahs, who mill about, taunting soldiers
text: with obscenities in English and Arabic.
text: AN APC drives past, further inflaming their passions.
text: Suddenly, A volley ROCKS AND BOTTLES come hurtling out of
text: nowhere, smashing harmlessly against the armor. The teenagers
dialog: laugh.
text: And then, the sudden CONCUSSION of a small BLAST from UP THE
text: STREET. The teenagers SCREAM and scatter. Hub SPRINTS toward
text: A SMOKING CAR, pulling his weapon from his hip.
text: A SOLDIER IS ROLLING ON THE GROUND, SCREAMING beside a PARKED
text: CAR. His leg is shredded. ARMORED JEEPS come squealing around
text: a corner. M-16's are locked, loaded and leveled at Hub.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: FBI --! FBI --!
text: For a moment, it's touch-and-go as the the terrified RECRUITS,
text: just weeks out of basic training, decide whether to SHOOT.
text: On the ground, the injured soldier keeps SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Now... I'm gonna... reach... into my
dialog: jacket... and show you... my shield.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: Drop your weapon --!
text: Hub drops the gun and shows his credentials. The young soldier
text: approaches warily as MEDICS attend to the wounded man.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SOLDIER
dialog: Sorry, Sir. Somebody's booby-trapping
dialog: cars... We're all a little spooked.
text: The RATTLE of small-arms fire is HEARD from up the street.
text: In the distance, a running FIGURE is chased by three SOLDIERS.
text: The transformation is complete: Brooklyn as Gaza.
scene_heading: REACHING HIS CAR
text: Hub climbs in. On a nearby pock-marked wall, a single word,
dialog: "Intifada."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- LATER
text: Hub, who sits in a beat-up old car, a baseball cap worn
text: backwards on his head. He keys his radio.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: All Units, report in turn. If talking
dialog: will reveal your position, just key
dialog: your walkie...
scene_heading: AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- RED HOOK
text: Inside, an AUTO GARAGE. Hoists, compression cylinders,
text: archwelders. Outside, two WINOS share a bottle by the curb.
text: A BEAT-UP DODGE drives up. In it, two scruffy-looking Black
text: MEN. Upon close inspection we realize that one is Hub. The
dialog: other is Floyd.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (to a mechanic)
dialog: Yo...
text: The mechanic looks out from under a car. He's Hispanic.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Que Pasa?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tariq around?
text: The mechanic gestures to a partitioned-office in the back.
text: As Hub heads toward it, he checks out the other workers: a
text: teenager doing a compression check, another fixes a tire.
speaker_heading: IN THE OFFICE
text: Tariq is on the phone talking in Arabic as Hub enters.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tariq?
text: Tariq holds up a finger, hold on. Hub sits opposite him.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: How can I help you.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You're Tariq Husseini?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: He's out.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Damn. Do you think you could give
dialog: him a message?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tell him the FBI is after him.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Very... slowly... put your hands on
text: top of the table.
text: Tariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the
text: table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an
text: audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: That wouldn't be a racist epithet,
dialog: now would it? Stand up.
text: As Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs,
text: pats him down, and cuffs him.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE
text: The two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding
text: FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Where are the others?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: What others?
text: But before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard.
speaker_heading: PSY-OPS (V.O.)
dialog: Tariq Husseini, this is the United
dialog: States Army. You are surrounded.
text: Hub is as surprised as Tariq.
speaker_heading: PSY-OPS
dialog: You have thirty seconds to throw out
dialog: any weapons and exit the premises
dialog: with your hands on top of your head.
text: One of the agents with the shotgun calls out.
speaker_heading: SHOTGUN AGENT
dialog: -- Sir?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Do as he says.
text: As Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to
text: hustle the workers out of door, when:
scene_heading: THE YOUNG MECHANIC
text: Reaches into his overalls.
speaker_heading: SHOTGUN AGENT
speaker_heading: FREEZE--!
text: But when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls,
text: all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE.
speaker_heading: THE EXPLOSION
text: Kills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws
text: Tariq to the ground.
text: FROM AN UPPER WINDOW
text: An AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence.
scene_heading: HIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER
text: Devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Code blue.
text: His order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE
text: Hub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are
text: SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and
text: gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely
text: hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE
text: bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT:
speaker_heading: AN M-60 TANK (SILENT)
text: Races in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET-
text: PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Code Red.
scene_heading: TWO APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS (SILENT)
text: Appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. As
text: they dive into their attack trajectory --
speaker_heading: HUB (SILENT)
text: Crawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as:
speaker_heading: THE CHAIN GUN (SILENT)
text: Of the Attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute --
text: virtually UNZIPPING the warehouse -- softening it for THE
text: TWO HYDRA ROCKETS that reduce it instantly to a huge FIREBALL.
scene_heading: IN THE CHOPPER -- DEVEREAUX
text: Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE -- TWO SHADOWY FIGURES
text: Stagger, blinded, out of the inferno. Hub drags a half-
text: conscious Tariq, where they are pounced on by commandos.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE STADIUM -- NIGHT
text: Pac's and Tanks ring the stadium. An anti-terrorist perimeter
text: has been established -- concrete obstacles, sandbags and
text: razor-wire. Musco-lights cast their pitiless glow.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER
text: A mob of frightened parents, girlfriends, and furious fathers.
text: A LAWYER for the ACLU confronts a young Lieutenant.
speaker_heading: ACLU LAWYER

scene_heading: YOUNG LIEUTENANT

speaker_heading: JOURNALISTS

dialog: ...the first FUCKING AMENDMENT!
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT #2
dialog: There will be a pool briefing for
dialog: all accredited journalists at 0700
dialog: hours.
text: Hub shows his ID. Is allowed to enter into:
scene_heading: THE DARK STADIUM TUNNEL
text: A MUFFLED CRY that might or might not have come from someone
text: in pain. His footsteps ECHO as he walks out to where:
speaker_heading: 2,000 DETAINEES
dialog: All young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are
text: milling about. Squatting, smoking, pacing, some laughing,
text: most looking terrified. All spread across:
scene_heading: THE HALOGEN-LIT FOOTBALL FIELD
text: Armed GUARDS backlit in the upper tiers. Enlisted men passing
text: out blankets and soup. Nearby, Hub sees Tina, standing quite
text: still -- Finally, she is able to speak.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: 1942, my father was put into the
dialog: camps at Manzanar. Until the end of
dialog: the war. Two years. Now he roots for
dialog: the Dodgers and swears it could never
dialog: happen again.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER -- ON THE FIELD
text: Hub asks for Devereaux, is directed across the field, through
text: an aisle in the wire cages. FRANK HADDAD looms out of the
text: shadows. He looks terrible, drawn. Furious.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They got Frankie. My kid's here
dialog: someplace --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank, slow down --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (fighting back tears
dialog: of rage)
dialog: He's only thirteen, for Chrissake --
text: Nearby, the "Allahuh Akbar," call, to evening PRAYER.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I'll get him out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They came into my house. My wife
dialog: told them who I was --
dialog: (swallows hard)
dialog: How many times did I put it on the
dialog: line, Hub --? How many times --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're American citizens, twenty years.
dialog: Ten years in the bureau -- They
dialog: knocked her down... and took him.
dialog: Out of my own house.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: It's wrong, Frank. What can I say to
dialog: you, but it's... all... terribly...
dialog: horribly... wrong.
dialog: (takes his arm)
dialog: Now, come with me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: NO! I've got to find him. Besides,
dialog: this is where I belong.
text: (takes out his wallet,
text: hands over his badge)
dialog: Here. I'm not their sand nigger
dialog: anymore.
text: Hub watches as he he walks away. A MUEZZIN chants the call
text: to evening prayer. Frank drops to his knees and joins the
text: rest of the prisoners.
scene_heading: THE LOCKER ROOM
text: Has been transformed in a COMMAND POST.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: -- And his name is Haddad?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Frank... Haddad. Junior.
scene_heading: COL. HARDWICK
dialog: His father's a Shiite. We're checking
dialog: him out.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Check this out, pal. His father's a
dialog: federal agent for ten years.
scene_heading: COL. HARDWICK
dialog: Don't get in my face, Hubbard. I
dialog: might decide you're an Ethiopian.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: And you're just stupid enough to
dialog: think that's an insult.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: If a mistake's been made we'll fix
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: There is no "if". I'm vouching for
dialog: this kid. I want him out.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: And I said we will look into it.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You mean, like you're looking into
dialog: me? Surveilling me? Breaking up my
dialog: operations? If I'd known I was going
dialog: to have to do your job for you I
dialog: would never have left the army.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: There's an FBI office in Anchorage,
dialog: Agent Hubbard. Fuck with me and you'll
dialog: be learning a hundred and fifty new
dialog: words for snow.
text: The two men stare at each other.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Tariq Husseini is my prisoner. I
dialog: want to see him.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
text: The prisoner is being interrogated.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I want to see him.
text: Devereaux just looks at him as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE TILED SHOWER ROOM
text: Tariq is strapped, NAKED, into a folding metal chair. His
text: head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. On a nearby
text: table, an empty syringe. Two MP'S stand guard.
text: Sharon is speaking softly to him in Arabic. Suddenly, Tarak
text: SPITS in her face. She wipes it off as if it is nothing.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: How long have you been at it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Not long enough, apparently.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: How much longer, do you think, before
dialog: he gives up the other cells --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: He can't give up the other cells if
dialog: he doesn't know about them.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: He knows.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (gestures to Sharon)
dialog: What about her briefing? The strategy
dialog: session -- she said the cells don't
dialog: know about each other, that they --
text: Devereaux ignores him. Turns to Sharon.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: How long before he breaks?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: At this rate. Too long. The theatre
dialog: was hit nine hours after we took
text: down the first cell.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: So -- what other models do we have --
dialog: ?
text: No one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Shaking.
text: Nobody answers.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: What about it, Sharon?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- Won't work.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Works for the Israelis.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Only in conjunction with sleep
dialog: deprivation. Needs at least thirty-
dialog: six hours.
text: Hub stares at Sharon -- as the dark side of her professional
text: life is revealed.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: We don't have thirty-six hours.
text: Another silence. They're teetering on the edge of the abyss.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Electric shock?
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: The neurotransmitters just shut down.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Water?
scene_heading: COL. HARDWICK
dialog: Palestinian authority is producing
dialog: good intel using water.
text: Hub finally can't take another second. Even in theory.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Are you people insane --?
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: The time has come for one man to
dialog: suffer in order to save the lives of
dialog: hundreds
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How about two men? How about three?
dialog: How about public executions, that
dialog: might work.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: You're welcome to wait outside.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: General... you've lost men, I've
dialog: lost men... but what you're doing...
dialog: It doesn't work in Belfast. It doesn't
dialog: work in Gaza. And it won't work here.
dialog: (it comes slowly at
dialog: first, then in a
dialog: rush:)
dialog: -- What if... they don't want their
dialog: leader back at all? You said yourself,
dialog: we don't even have him. Maybe what
dialog: they really want -- is that we herd
dialog: our children into stadiums. Put
dialog: soldiers into our streets. Radicalize
dialog: people who want to think of themselves
dialog: as Americans. Bend the law, shred
dialog: the constitution.
dialog: (searches for the
dialog: kind of words that
dialog: come so hard to him:)
dialog: Because if we torture him -- and
dialog: let's call it what it is... You...
dialog: and I... then the country men like
dialog: us have sworn to defend. And bled to
dialog: defend. And died to defend... is
dialog: gone.
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: And they've won.
text: Gen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub. And then:
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: (to Col. Hardwick)
dialog: I think we have to soundproof the
dialog: room before we begin.
text: Hub looks at Sharon, who looks away.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
text: Escort him out.
text: The two MPs lead Hub out of the room.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Let's get this over with.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- HOURS LATER
text: Sharon emerges from the shower room. She is shattered. The
text: blood drained from her face. As if carrying with her all the
text: sin that was committed in the next room.
text: FROM INSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM
text: The sound of a GUNSHOT. The door opens and Devereaux emerges,
text: in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: He knew nothing.
text: Devereaux turns and walks off down the corridor.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL
text: Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night. A symbol of
text: all that is good and free and just. Hub drives a rental car,
text: staring out at the monuments.
scene_heading: IN GEORGETOWN
text: Hub pulls up to a lovely TOWNHOUSE. Parked on the street, an
text: UNMARKED CAR from the Secret Service.
speaker_heading: THE CHIEF OF STAFF
text: Opens the door, wearing a Dartmouth lacrosse team t-shirt.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: C'mon in, we're still trying to get
dialog: the last one down.
text: In the background, we HEAR a three-year-old crying.
scene_heading: IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Tasteful antiques, rag rugs and kids' toys.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: ...The President wants this shit
dialog: over with. There's only one way to
dialog: do that.
dialog: (looks at Hub)
dialog: Let the Sheik go.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: So we do have the Sheik?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: You think our government operates as
dialog: a single coherent entity? Devereaux
dialog: just... pushed the agenda.
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Of course the President was completely
text: unaware of it.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (return of serve)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Now we can't just let him go. America
dialog: has to stand tall in the world yadda
dialog: yadda yadda. So what we do is...
dialog: (the punch line)
dialog: We let the American justice system
dialog: do its work.
text: His wife appears, holding a squalling baby, looking defeated.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: -- Honey...?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: I'll be right up, darling.
text: She grits her teeth and goes upstairs.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: You have kids? They're great.
dialog: Sometimes you just want to... drug
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: What do you mean, let the justice
dialog: system do its work.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: We don't release him. A judge releases
dialog: him. You're an FBI man. That's what
dialog: judges are good at, right?
dialog: (off Hub's look)
dialog: It's not like we've gone after him
text: in proper prosectorial fashion.
text: Kidnaping him. Holding him in
dialog: isolation. "Fruit of the poisoned
dialog: tree" -- remember that one from law
dialog: school? Oh, we'll have a big trial.
dialog: Everybody'll get their rocks off...
dialog: But the fact is --
dialog: (the punch line)
dialog: -- the sheik will walk.
text: He looks at Hub, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: ...And this whole episode becomes
dialog: nothing more than the news cycle
text: before the next news cycle.
text: He hands Hub an ACCORDION FILE.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Documentary evidence of Devereaux's
dialog: whole operation.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Because you'll know what to do with
dialog: it.
text: Hub looks at the file in his hands. Considering.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: And what about her?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You know who. How much is she
dialog: complicit in all this?
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF STAFF
dialog: Ask her.
text: Hub looks up. Sharon emerges from the hallway.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: ON THE STREETS OF GEORGETOWN -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Hub and Sharon sit in silence in Hub's rental car:
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I ran an Iraqi network for two years.
dialog: Samir recruited them from among the
dialog: Sheik's followers. I trained them in
dialog: the North. Then we played them back
dialog: into Baghdad, two, three at a time,
dialog: hiding them in the mosques...
text: Her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It was gonna be beautiful.
dialog: (looks away)
dialog: -- And then there was a policy shift --
dialog: She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an
text: enormous well of untapped feeling. She fights it back:
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- The new doctrine was: Iran will
dialog: be too powerful if Iraq falls apart.
dialog: (her voice trembles)
dialog: And it's not like... we sold them
dialog: out. Exactly. We just... stopped...
dialog: helping them. And I wasn't allowed
dialog: to tell them what was coming down. I
dialog: was ordered not to tell them.
dialog: (fighting back tears)
dialog: -- And they got slaughtered.
text: She turns away.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You've got to understand -- these
dialog: people... believe. Paradise. Bliss.
dialog: To us they're just words. But to
dialog: them... It's very beautiful, actually.
dialog: And when you look at their lives,
dialog: the heartbreak... And what do we do?
dialog: We think, aha, we can take advantage
dialog: of that.
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: So I quit. I came home. I just
dialog: can't... do it... anymore.
text: She doesn't want to reveal herself this way. Doesn't want to
text: be vulnerable. Doesn't want to cling to him. For a moment He
text: puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful,
dialog: dangerous predator.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- But first, you helped them.
text: She senses the hardness in his tone. Looks up at him, and
text: through tears, puts her game face back on.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What do you mean --?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: They were being slaughtered. They
dialog: needed to get out. But they were on
dialog: the watch list. So you got them visas.
dialog: You and Samir.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I promised we would take care of
dialog: them. They were working... for us.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Doing what, exactly?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I don't know what you mean.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You said you trained them. Tradecraft.
dialog: Subversion. That's what you said,
dialog: right?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: Only you left something out, didn't
dialog: you... Didn't you, Sharon?
dialog: (she can't bring
dialog: herself to look at
dialog: him)
dialog: You taught them how to make bombs.
text: The tears are streaming down her face now. Finally, she nods.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- And now they're here, doing what
dialog: you taught 'em.
text: The streetlight catches Sharon's face. Her eyes are haunted.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: And I'm going to have to live with
dialog: the hell of that for the rest of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- (TO ESTABLISH) -- NEXT MORNING

speaker_heading: MARCH ORGANIZER
dialog: (handing out leaflets)
dialog: March on city hall. Today. No fear.
text: Hub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite
text: sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening
dialog: within.
text: Sharon sits inside with Samir. She uses a SCALPEL to make
text: the slightest INCISION under Samir's arm. The RADIO plays.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Ahhhhhh...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: In case you decide to go on walkabout.
text: Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: How did you make contact?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: He is Afghani. Ahhhh. He got word to
dialog: my uncle at the bath-house. You never
dialog: met him.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: But you're sure he'll show up.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: Sharon, they are all dead but the
dialog: last cell and they are crazy with
dialog: fear. Just tell me the message and I
dialog: will pass it on.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I need to deliver it in person.
dialog: Believe me, they'll want to hear
dialog: what I have to say.
text: She turns off the radio.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE CAR
text: Hub and Frank glance inconspicuously around.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You watch the game?
text: On a piece of paper he has scribbled, "Hit Hardwick. Safe
dialog: House. 11:00."
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (nods yes, then:)
text: Kannell was really on.
text: Hub then writes. "Bath-house. 12:00."
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (nods again)
dialog: Think they'll make the play-offs?
text: Hub looks at him. There's been little time for sentiment.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: How's your boy?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's alright. Thanks for getting him
dialog: out.
text: Sharon steps out of the car. In her hands is a device
text: resembling a PORTABLE OSCILLOSCOPE. A green dot appears.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: That's Samir.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (looks in at Samir)
dialog: Green is about right.
text: He slips Sharon the scribbled notes. As she looks at them:
speaker_heading: ELISE
text: He's terrified. Then again, so am I.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You sure he'll go through with it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: If he doesn't he knows I'll give him
dialog: to Devereaux.
dialog: (She mouths, "They
dialog: out there?" Hub nods)
dialog: How's it feel to be on the other end
dialog: of it?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I like watching better.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: This is the endgame, you understand
dialog: that? If this goes wrong --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Nothing's going wrong.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: We're the CIA, something always goes
dialog: wrong.
text: The car door opens and Samir steps out, buttoning his shirt.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I don't suppose there's any way you
dialog: would trust me to do this on my own?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I thought not. Well, in case it gets
dialog: hairy, remember... the most committed
dialog: wins.
text: Hub watches as she and Samir walk away.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I trust her about as far as I can
dialog: throw her.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: That far?
scene_heading: SHARON AND SAMIR -- CONTINUOUS
text: They hurry through the park. Samir is extremely agitated,
text: eyes constantly darting from right to left.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: This is not the way to the bath-house.
dialog: You said to get a key from my uncle
dialog: so that we --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Shhhhhh... If you'd stop whining
dialog: you'd feel the surveillance.
scene_heading: IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

speaker_heading: SAMIR (V.O.)
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: Sharon, please, I beg you. Do not
dialog: make me do this. If they even dream
dialog: we are being followed they will kill

text: The light turns RED, they race across a crowded street.
scene_heading: THROUGH AN ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD
text: Where women in chadors carry mesh bags with tonight's meal.
scene_heading: INTO A CLEAN APARTMENT
text: Nothing but a single bed with a dirty white sheet. Sharon

speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Sit.
text: (takes out a pocket-
dialog: knife)
dialog: Raise your arm.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She cuts the stitches under his armpit and begins to dig out
text: the transponder.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They cannot even dream we are being
dialog: followed, isn't that what you said?
text: Sharon very deliberately wipes her BLOODY HANDS on the WHITE

dialog: bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir.
text: Sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal THE HIDDEN COURTYARD
text: of a neighboring building. She and Samir hurry through a
text: back alley and out into an adjacent street.
speaker_heading: BOROUGH HALL (WAS SHOT AS 194)
text: Where several APC's suddenly roar up and BLOCK off the square.
text: Devereaux stands nearby, watching as:
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT #2
dialog: (though a bullhorn)
dialog: This is an unlawful gathering. You
dialog: must disperse. I repeat --
text: Soldiers in full RIOT GEAR emerge to form a battle line:
dialog: images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993.
speaker_heading: PROTEST SPEAKER
dialog: Join together! Join hands!
scene_heading: THE MARCHERS LINK ARMS
dialog: Arab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and
text: Hispanic gang members -- all continue to CHANT, "No fear!"
scene_heading: THE YOUNG SOLDIERS
text: Nervously look at one another as the
text: marchers begin to move.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT #2
dialog: (through a bullhorn)
text: These soldiers carry live ammunition.
dialog: This is your final warning.
text: "No Fear... No Fear..." Devereaux watches in dread as the
text: marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers
dialog: is this why he became a soldier?
text: A YOUNG GIRL unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier.
text: Looks into his eyes. Smiles. And walks past. Another marcher
text: walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her.
text: Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line.
text: DEVEREAUX watches, as something is revealed to him, something
dialog: about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten.
scene_heading: IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN
text: Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at
dialog: Christmas. But something is wrong. Where once there were TWO
text: GHOSTLY IMAGES of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now
text: there is NOTHING.
speaker_heading: ON HUB'S OSCILLOSCOPE
text: The RADIO-SIGNAL of Samir's transmitter still registers as
text: an unmoving, steadily blinking light. Hub is watching the
text: building. Frank steps out the van, his face pale.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We've got a problem.
speaker_heading: HUB AND FRANK
text: Pound up the stairs of the building.
scene_heading: THE DOOR TO THE CLEAN APARTMENT
text: Bursts open. Hub comes in low and fast. Frank comes in hard
text: on his heels.
text: In the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet,
text: SMEARED IN BLOOD, is draped over a chair.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the --
text: Hub stares in dread fascination.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: It's a shroud.
text: And he's out the door in a heartbeat.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: BACK IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN
text: Frank and Hub listen to a playback of Sharon's conversation
text: with Samir on the digital recorders.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: "...sweating too much while they
dialog: wait."
text: Frank looks up at Hub.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: First she turns off the tv, then she
dialog: says it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She knew we were listening.
text: It hits them both at the same time.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: The hammam.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN
text: Hub and Frank hit the street at a dead run.
scene_heading: BENEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE
text: Samir opens a padlocked door with a key. He and Sharon
dialog: disappear within.
speaker_heading: A HAMMAM
text: An Arab bath-house. Rays of sunlight play off the steaming
text: waters. Their footsteps ECHO off the tiled mosaic walls.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: IN THE BATHOUSE
text: Samir kneels to touch the steaming water.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: How soon are they coming?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: They'll be here.
text: He starts taking off his clothes.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What are you doing --?
text: He finishes disrobing.
speaker_heading: NAKED
text: He steps into the bath. With a sponge he washes his body.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What message do you have for them,
dialog: Sharon?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I'll tell them when they're here.
text: The DISTANT SOUND of the approaching MARCH echoes off the
text: tiled walls as Samir steps out of the purifying waters and
text: takes a towel from a hamper.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Nobody else is coming, is there?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: That's right.
text: From the hamper he takes a Sig-Sauer .9 automatic.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You're the last cell.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: There will never be a last cell.
dialog: (racks the slide of
dialog: the .9)
dialog: You should listen to the young men
text: in that stadium. It is just beginning.
text: Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white
text: egyptian-cotton FUNERAL SHROUD and drops it over his head.
speaker_heading: THE MARCHERS
text: Are streaming down the street.
text: Hub and Frank desperately fight their way through a wild,
text: almost "carnival" feel.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- THE BATHS
text: Reflected in the purifying waters, Samir is putting civilian
text: clothes on over the shroud -- still holding the .9 on Sharon.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: How could I have missed the play --
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (a forgiving gesture)
dialog: It was the money. You believe money
dialog: is power. Belief is power.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- Just tell me we didn't finance
dialog: your operation...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (a sad smile)
dialog: The world is a wheel. So... what
dialog: message do you have for me, Sharon?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: They're going to release him.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Praise God. When will he be free --?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: A few months at most. First, they
dialog: have to bring him to trial, but --
text: He turns away from her, opening the hamper.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (not looking at her)
dialog: -- No.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: -- But... that's what you want, isn't
dialog: it? Why you've done all this --
scene_heading: BELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES
text: Comes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: No. It's not.
text: He comes to stand beside her.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I want you to bleed... as we have
dialog: bled.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Samir, the Koran preaches --
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Do not speak to me of the Koran,
dialog: woman.
dialog: (fighting his emotion)
dialog: You take our leader. A holy man. You
dialog: put him in prison for preaching the
dialog: word of God. You must learn the
dialog: consequences of trying to tell the
dialog: world how to live.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (with rising terror)
dialog: But it's over, your point's been
dialog: made, why spill any more blood? Those
text: poor people out there in the street,
dialog: they're fucking marching for your
dialog: cause...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (fastens the last
text: strap on his semtex
dialog: harness)
dialog: And they, too, will become its
dialog: martyrs.
text: A VOICE from the top of the stairs:
speaker_heading: HUB (V.O.)
dialog: Let her go and you'll live.
text: Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between
text: them, blocking his shot.
text: From outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING,
text: "No Fear...! No Fear...!" Samir HEARS it, too.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Move away from the door.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: NO --!!!
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Let her go and you'll live --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: DON'T --!!!!
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (screaming, panicked)
dialog: GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!!
speaker_heading: HUB
speaker_heading: SAMIR --!
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: YOU WANT TO DIE --!!
text: They're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching
text: toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: No way you're going out there.
text: Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: MOVE AWAY --!
text: Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: SHUT UP...
text: Samir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's
text: eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: SHOOT ME --!!!
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I... CAN'T --!
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: YOU HAVE TO.
dialog: (weeping now)
dialog: You... promised...
text: Hub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost
text: imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: No --!!!
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: It is God's will.
text: His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the
dialog: explosive device.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: If there is a God, he weeps at the
dialog: crimes we commit in his name.
speaker_heading: HIS FIRST SHOT
text: Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards.
speaker_heading: HIS SECOND SHOT
text: Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord.
scene_heading: THE THIRD SHOT
text: Is a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths.
speaker_heading: CLOUD OF BLOOD
text: Blooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows.
text: THE ECHO OF THE SHOTS
text: Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (on radio)
text: Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --!
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Is... he... dead?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: ...Shhhhhhh...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: ...no... regrets...
text: Hub cradles her head.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: You... knew.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: (the saddest smile)
dialog: I... wondered.
speaker_heading: FRANK HADDAD
text: Appears at the top of the steps. Behind him, two PARAMEDICS
text: race down to kneel beside Sharon. Hub is pushed aside as
text: they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly,
text: she begins to convulse.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Sharon... SHARON --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: ... Emma... My name... is Emma.
text: And then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and
text: then more clearly. We realize she's speaking Arabic.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: -- what are you? I don't...
text: And then Frank is standing above them. Tears in his eyes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (translating)
dialog: "I... seek refuge... king of kings..."
text: And Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own
text: death. He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of
text: her two native tongues. Until, at last:
speaker_heading: SHARON/EMMA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Allah Ahkbar. God is great --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Allah Ahkbar --
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Amen.
text: And she's gone.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER
text: A block away, we can see the Marchers pass by. The chant of
text: "No Fear..." fades into the distance. But Hub has already
text: turned his back and is hurrying away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Hub hurries toward the Courthouse.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER - IN THE COURTHOUSE
text: JUDGE FRANKEL opens the door. He is taken aback by the blood
text: on Hub's clothes.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I want to talk about a free society.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: THE STADIUM COMMAND POST
text: Where Devereaux is watching coverage of the march.
speaker_heading: TV SOUND BITE (V.O.)
dialog: -- "a very moving moment in which
dialog: the people of a city step forward to
dialog: declare their courage and solidarity --
text: He looks up to see Hub. He's carrying the ACCORDION FILE
dialog: that the Chief of Staff gave him.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell
dialog: me exactly what you mean detaining
dialog: Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID
dialog: staff. Because that strikes me as a
dialog: very peculiar idea of interagency
dialog: liaison.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: The last cell has been taken down.
dialog: It was Samir. I took him out.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: What makes you so sure he was the
dialog: last cell?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Sharon.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Sharon is not trustworthy.
speaker_heading: HUB
text: Sharon is dead. She gave her life.
dialog: (takes a piece of
dialog: paper from his pocket)
dialog: This is a writ from the US District
dialog: Court releasing all those being held
dialog: here without habeus corpus.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: My authority supersedes the civilian
dialog: judiciary under the decree of martial
dialog: law.
dialog: (a rueful smile)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Your authority ends now. It's all
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: What's over.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: They're going to release him.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Release him?
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: The Sheik.
dialog: (holds up the Chief
dialog: of Staff's' file)
dialog: Clear violation of international
dialog: law, Congressional oversight statutes,
dialog: a couple of treaties, the Federal
dialog: perjury statute, and my favorite,
dialog: the Logan Act, for conducting your
dialog: own personal foreign policy.
dialog: (simply)
dialog: I know the whole story, General.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: You don't know shit. Poor suffering
text: Sharon and her poor suffering people.
dialog: It's called "going native" -- the
dialog: most elementary error of an
dialog: intelligence operative and she made
dialog: it. She had all of you working for
dialog: her and she was working for them
dialog: without even knowing it. And now
dialog: they're getting exactly what they
dialog: want, which is the Sheik will be
text: back in the mix. But ten times as
dialog: strong, because now he's the big man
dialog: who stood up to the Americans.
dialog: (looks at Hub)
dialog: I did what was necessary. I make no
dialog: apologies. If you think you're going
dialog: to be able to use that file against
dialog: me, you know even less about politics
dialog: than I imagined.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: General. I'm not in politics. You
dialog: can have this back. I won't use it.
text: Hub hands him the file. Devereaux takes it.
speaker_heading: DEVEREAUX
dialog: Because you don't have the balls.
dialog: (off Hub's look)
dialog: Did you expect me to get all weepy
dialog: with gratitude? You serve your
dialog: country.
dialog: (dismissively)
dialog: Is there anything else?
dialog: Hub would love to just... clock him. Instead:
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: I said I wasn't in politics. I'm
dialog: not. I'm in law enforcement.
text: He takes his gun from its shoulder holster.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: William Devereaux, you are under
dialog: arrest for the torture and murder of
dialog: Tariq Husseini under color of
dialog: authority, United States Code Title
scene_heading: 42, Chapter 21, Subchapter 1, Sections
dialog: 1983.
dialog: (takes out his gun)
dialog: Surrender your weapon.
text: Behind them, a COMMOTION as Frank and several agents force
text: their way into the room, followed by REPORTERS, who shout
text: questions as STROBES and VIDEOTAPE record the arrest.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE STADIUM
text: An NYPD car -- Devereaux within, pulls away, lights flashing.
text: HUNDREDS OF YOUNG ARAB BOYS
text: Emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers,
text: the tearful smiles of their wives and children. Hub and Frank
text: stand there, watching the reunions.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Did we win or did we lose --?
text: Hub has no answer. No one has the answer.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
