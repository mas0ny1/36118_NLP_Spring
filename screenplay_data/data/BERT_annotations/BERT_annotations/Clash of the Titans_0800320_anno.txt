text: The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
text: BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was

text: The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the

scene_heading: INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT
text: Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are
text: disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
text: pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --
text: KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome
text: face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands

text: Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at

dialog: fear.
text: ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,
text: arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --

text: and THE KING'S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN
scene_heading: MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
text: And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
text: The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and

speaker_heading: THOTH

speaker_heading: KEPHEUS
dialog: Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
dialog: father to give his daughter to a
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: THOTH
dialog: No. Such a union would be

speaker_heading: AMOUN

dialog: Have you not noticed?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS

speaker_heading: (SCOFFS)
dialog: Purpose! Looking for purpose is

speaker_heading: QUIETLY --
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: You always say that my abilities

dialog: they were not enough to save him.
speaker_heading: SPYROS

speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: How is that greater than other

speaker_heading: SPYROS

speaker_heading: WILTING GIRL
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: For what?
text: Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry

speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping

speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: When I could hear her, she spoke

speaker_heading: WILTING GIRL
dialog: Look at your arms, Perseus.

speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: A Chthonian?
speaker_heading: WILTING GIRL

speaker_heading: (OFF PERSEUS'
speaker_heading: CONFUSION)
dialog: The Gods have a caste system just

speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: WILTING GIRL
dialog: Zeus, God of Gods, has proposed a

dialog: center is the marriage of a mortal
text: with a demigod.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Who, me?
speaker_heading: WILTING GIRL
dialog: Zeus himself has chosen you. A
dialog: demigod may be less than a God,
dialog: but he's more than a Man. One
dialog: foot in Humanity, the other in
dialog: Divinity. Your marriage will be a
dialog: symbol of accord between our
dialog: races.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: WILTING GIRL

speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Will you please give me some
speaker_heading: PEACE --
text: The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: I said, 'Very beautiful.'
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Do you think just anyone can make
dialog: intimate judgements on the royal
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: I meant the sunset.
text: She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Do you always start a seduction
dialog: with an insult?
text: Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
text: at the sea.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS

speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: I've come to see my future wife.

scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT
text: Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
text: close, attracted to him.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: It's not personal. You're not a

dialog: (as Perseus laughs)
dialog: I'm too young. I don't want to be
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Me either.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Then why are you doing it?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: No one asked me. And now that
dialog: I've met you, I don't know if I
dialog: can go through with it.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: It's not personal. Seeing you
dialog: makes it real. I think a man
dialog: should make his own decisions. I
dialog: won't be the pawn of a King or a
dialog: God.
text: She looks at him with new interest.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA

speaker_heading: PERSEUS

speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: That doesn't mean we can't be
dialog: friends. Get to know each other.
dialog: I want to show you something.
text: She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT
text: Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly

dialog: her excitement.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: I'm already lost.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: I'll take care of you.
text: They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
text: sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
dialog: could be mistaken for a bed.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: This is my special place. No one
dialog: can see or hear or even find us

speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: (looks around the
speaker_heading: CHAMBER)
dialog: I don't suppose I could escape
dialog: without your aid.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Do you want to?
text: When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
text: gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
text: it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
text: down, holding her at bay.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA

speaker_heading: PERSEUS

speaker_heading: PURR --
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Is it true you're a demigod?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: (makes a face)
dialog: It seems what everyone wants to

speaker_heading: SEXY --
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: I don't see it.
dialog: (as Perseus laughs)
dialog: But let's find out for sure...
text: She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of
text: foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
text: into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their

text: only a moment, her voice husky --

speaker_heading: CASSIOPEIA
dialog: I won't be long-winded. You all

speaker_heading: CASSIOPEIA
speaker_heading: (WITH EDGE)
dialog: This is not a celebration of a

speaker_heading: CASSIOPEIA
dialog: This union represents new hope for

speaker_heading: CASSIOPEIA
dialog: To my beautiful daughter... more

speaker_heading: CASSIOPEIA
dialog: I've gone on too long --

dialog: religious ecstasy and outright lust.
text: The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't.
text: She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes
dialog: her frame --
speaker_heading: TIAMAT
dialog: Look upon the sublime and know
dialog: your error. You'll not blink.
dialog: Tell me now, mortal, how bright
dialog: your preening urchin shines?
text: No one dare look long at the Goddess. No one but

speaker_heading: TIAMAT
dialog: People of Joppa, hear me. For the
dialog: sacrilege of this arrogant
dialog: creature, I will loose Leviathan

speaker_heading: TIAMAT
dialog: I'm not finished. Hold your gaze.

speaker_heading: KEPHEUS
dialog: I thought this boy's father was a

speaker_heading: HOOK.

speaker_heading: VIDALIA
speaker_heading: (TO DRACO)

dialog: look: "You're the one that I want."

text: Perseus rolls out of the way.
text: Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster

text: Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.
text: Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
text: sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a

dialog: spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their Goddess
text: is gone.
text: THE TIDE TURNS IN THE BATTLE as the Joppans and their
text: steel allies, the Automata, wade into the ranks of
dialog: creatures.
text: Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
text: the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
text: weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
text: bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
text: mud, exhausted.

scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY
text: The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
text: Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
text: CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,
scene_heading: GASPING FOR AIR.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY
text: The onlookers rejoice.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY
text: BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her
text: lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as
dialog: he did with Anteros the fisherman??
text: Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a
text: short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
text: arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!
text: Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
text: too, breathes again, relieved.
text: For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
text: find themselves alone, holding each other.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Hello.
text: (as she smiles,
speaker_heading: RELIEVED)
dialog: Are you all right?
text: She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: I think I am.
text: He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to
text: oblivion.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Are you ready to become a king?
text: His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She
text: accepts that, rueful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Are you ready to become a queen?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
dialog: confidence.
speaker_heading: ANDROMEDA
dialog: Yes. Yes, I am.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Then you're ready to go home.
text: Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD
text: BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
text: Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully
text: alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
text: then climbs on behind her.
text: Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost
dialog: from sight.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE SKY AND WHITE CLOUDS - DAY
text: Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SACRED GROUND - DAY
text: The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above
dialog: the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for
dialog: Olympos.
text: TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the
text: thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to
dialog: the afterlife.
text: MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find
text: the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal
dialog: dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
text: The ceremony and the heavenly setting.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
text: Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
text: Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --

dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
text: quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus
dialog: looks in that direction, to find --
text: ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
dialog: He couldn't look more imposing.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Am I to understand you do not
dialog: intend to make this union with the
dialog: Queen Andromeda?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Despite my will and intention that
dialog: you do so?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Would you choose to condemn Men,
dialog: your own people, to suffer more of
dialog: this devastating War?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: I have no people. You have
dialog: stranded me between realms,
dialog: neither man nor God.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
speaker_heading: (STERNLY)
dialog: Do you reproach Zeus?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: No. I thank you... Father.
text: Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
text: softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: You have freed me. I will not be
dialog: a pawn for Men or Gods.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Does that absolve you suddenly of
dialog: your responsibilities?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: You've made me understand that my
dialog: responsibility is to myself. So
dialog: it is with us all.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
speaker_heading: (INTIMATELY)
dialog: You've put me to a great test. In
dialog: the midst of it, I found the
dialog: courage in my heart to defy Gods.
dialog: I do not know how much of that
dialog: comes from you, Father... and how
dialog: much from my Mother, who I never
dialog: knew.
text: Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: It matters not. Whatever the
dialog: source, I are only grateful.
text: He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
dialog: throng.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: This war will end the moment you
dialog: choose for it to end... and Men
dialog: agree. I think, perhaps, that is
dialog: the free will that all realms
dialog: share.
text: Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
dialog: offspring, what a creation!
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: What will you do, Man of free
dialog: will?
text: Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
dialog: I'm going to find Vidalia.
speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: So... my Son, you will be a pawn
dialog: for love?
speaker_heading: PERSEUS
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Yes, Father, gladly.
text: Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
text: soars away.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
