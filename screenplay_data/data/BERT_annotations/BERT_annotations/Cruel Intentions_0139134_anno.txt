scene_heading: 2 INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY 2
text: A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at

text: A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front

text: The therapist continues to write notes.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Jesus. We've been at this for six
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: And you haven't made an ounce of
dialog: progress.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know.
text: Sebastian takes out a cigarette.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: There's no smoking in my office.
text: Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
text: Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
text: her head.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What do you want me to say? That I'm
dialog: supposed to feel remorse because I act
dialog: the way I do? The truth is I don't.
text: Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Look, I'm not like all the other kids
dialog: in high school. I don't care about book
dialog: reports and extra-credit. Teachers
dialog: are idiots anyway. The only challenge
dialog: out there for me is women. You see a
dialog: girl you like. You pursue them. You
dialog: conquer. You move on. It's exciting.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: But you said you have the worst
dialog: reputation.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I do.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Don't you want to change that?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Let me tell you something, doctor.
dialog: Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
dialog: They say they don't, but they don't
dialog: mean it. They all think that they're
dialog: the ones that are going to "save me."
dialog: The trick is to let them think it's
dialog: true.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: I think that's all the time we have
dialog: for today.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Same time next week?
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: No. This is going to be our last
dialog: session.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why? I like spending time with you.
dialog: You know, you're quite attractive for
dialog: a woman your age. You have killer legs.
dialog: Killer.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
dialog: lot of money to send you here. I'm
dialog: trying to help you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
dialog: help.
text: Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: He was a coke addict, you know.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: You think you can come in here with that
dialog: cute little smirk on your face and try
dialog: and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
dialog: Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It works a little.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: No it doesn't. I see right through you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You do?
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: I hope for your sake you grow out of
dialog: this immature phase. It's going to get
dialog: you into trouble.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Well, you don't have to get nasty about
dialog: it.
text: Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: My daughter, Rachel.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yummy.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
dialog: exceptionally well rounded young
text: woman, who happens to be attending
dialog: Princeton this fall. She's way too
dialog: smart to fall for your line of b.s.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Really? Care to make a wager on that?
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Good luck, Sebastian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What, nervous I'm going to win?
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Would you please leave.
text: Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.
speaker_heading: DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
dialog: Asshole.
text: The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
text: desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
text: Benson &amp; Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo

scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Who told you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL

text: She continues to cry.
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Nudie pictures, what do you think?
scene_heading: DR. GREENBAUM
dialog: Jesus Christ, how can you be so
dialog: stupid?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't know. He was just so charming.
dialog: All he did was talk about how I had
dialog: killer legs and how we wanted to
dialog: photograph them. Things just got out
text: of hand from there.

dialog: Mom? Are you there? Mom?

speaker_heading: DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
dialog: You're gonna pay for this you little

text: BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite

text: with a Koala Bear on it.
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: I can't tell you how happy we are that
dialog: Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
dialog: this fall. You've always been an
dialog: inspiration to Beau and I on raising
dialog: her. We just hope she can rise to the

dialog: her.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'll do my best.

scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
text: Kathryn is a straight A student at

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: (in French)
dialog: You're too kind.
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
text: that goes on in high school. Where
dialog: do you get your strength?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I know this sounds corny, but whenever
dialog: I feel temptations of peer pressure,
dialog: I...
text: (takes out her crucifix)
dialog: turn to God and he helps me through the
dialog: problem. Call me an anachronism, but
dialog: it works.
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: That's beautiful.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: What are the boys like?
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: Cecile, is that the best you can do?
dialog: (to Kathryn)
dialog: You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
dialog: been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
text: Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
dialog: are very upstanding gentleman, however
dialog: there are the occasional bad apples.
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
dialog: believe they didn't expel him after what he
dialog: did to the school nurse.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
dialog: I hear she's recovering quite well.
text: Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the

dialog: Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: You remember my daughter, Cecile.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: My, what an adorable shirt you're
dialog: wearing.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
text: Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Outstanding.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: What year are you in?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: But I thought high school is only four years.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
text: He winks at Cecile.
scene_heading: MRS. CALDWELL
dialog: I think we'll be going now.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
text: Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
text: her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
text: bottom part a small vial of coke.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: The parental units called while you were out.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
dialog: mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
dialog: inheritance per usual?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Hopefully, though she suspects that your
text: decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
dialog: maid.
text: Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
dialog: bump.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
dialog: going well?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It was fine.
text: He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
dialog: Manhattan Debutantes.
text: He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Nothing shocks them anymore.
text: He scratches the nude's pubic area.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
dialog: touch.
text: He kisses it.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have

scene_heading: 10 INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 10
text: Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
dialog: the ways.
text: Sebastian stares her down.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Alright he dumped me.
text: He smiles, then swallows the sushi.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT 11
text: A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final

speaker_heading: KATMRYN (V.O.)
dialog: I went to great lengths to please Court.
dialog: Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
dialog: keep him happy.
text: Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
dialog: Swallow?
text: She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)

scene_heading: 12 INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 12
speaker_heading: KATHRYN

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You don't mean?
scene_heading: 13 EXT. PARK - DAY 13

scene_heading: 14 INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 14
text: Sebastian snickers.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I don't find this very funny,
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So that's what this is all about.
dialog: (imitating Kathryn)
dialog: We'll get together and plan your
dialog: curriculum.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Keep your friends close and your
dialog: enemies closer. When I get through
dialog: with her, she'll be the premier Blow
dialog: Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
dialog: poor little Court's heart will be
text: shattered.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why go through Cecile? Why not just
dialog: attack Court?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Because if there's an attack made on
dialog: Court it could be traced back to me.
dialog: I can't allow that to happen.
dialog: Everybody loves me and I intend to
dialog: keep it that way.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I see your point... though why should
dialog: I care?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
dialog: Introduce her to your world of
text: decadence and debauchery.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sounds intriguing.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: She's quite cute you know. Young
text: supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
text: an uncharted pootie.
text: Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
dialog: lips.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
dialog: Boldly go where no man has gone
dialog: before.
text: Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
text: to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I can't.
text: Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
dialog: "But I thought high school was only
dialog: four years." I mean, please. She knows
dialog: nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
dialog: have her under the table at Au Bar
dialog: sucking me off before the appetizer
dialog: arrived. Go get one of those moron
dialog: friends of yours to do it. I have a
dialog: reputation to uphold.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Oh but diddling the therapist's
dialog: daughter is a challenge?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That was just simple revenge. What I
dialog: have planned requires sheer genius.
text: He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
text: picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'm not interested in the latest dating
dialog: tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Shut up and turn to page 64.
scene_heading: She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Jesus Christ, is she for real?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
dialog: This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
text: angel. A paradigm of chastity and
dialog: virtue.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
dialog: Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It just so happens we're not in Kansas
dialog: anymore. Our little angel's father has
dialog: accepted the new headmaster position at
dialog: Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
dialog: in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
dialog: house. Can you imagine what this would
dialog: do for my reputation? Screwing the new
dialog: headmaster's virginal daughter before
dialog: school starts? It will be my greatest
dialog: victory.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: You don't stand a chance. Even this is
dialog: out of your league.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Care to make a wager on that?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'll think about it...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
dialog: chapter to my work of art.
text: He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
dialog: of yours.
text: He stops.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Count me in.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What are the terms?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
dialog: of yours is mine.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: And if I win?
text: She approaches him.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'll give you something you've been
dialog: jerking off about ever since our parents
dialog: got married.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Be more specific.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: In English.
dialog: (whispers in his ear)
dialog: I'll fuck your brains out.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What makes you think I'd go for that
dialog: bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Because I'm the only person you can't
dialog: control and it kills you.
text: Sebastian sneers at her.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Do we have a deal?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No way, that car means everything to
dialog: me.
text: She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You can put it anywhere.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Even there?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN

scene_heading: 18 INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY 18
text: Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So what year are you going into?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Junior.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Got a boyfriend back home?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I don't know. Relationships seem too
dialog: distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
dialog: my studies.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You a lesbo?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: No.
text: She bends over to pick up the saddle.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Nice.
text: She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Are you often this offensive on a first
dialog: encounter?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I was just being honest. You happen to
dialog: have a nice ass. Sorry.
text: She shakes her head and continues with her chore.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I read your teen beat manifesto.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I must say I found it rather appalling.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: That's a first. Most people praised me
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Most people are morons. I mean who are
dialog: you to knock what you've never experienced?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
dialog: belief that people shouldn't actually
dialog: experience the act of love until they are
dialog: in love and that people our age are too
dialog: immature to be in touch with those
dialog: emotions.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Take yourself. You've slept with several
dialog: women. Are you happier because of it?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: How do you know I've been with several
dialog: women?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: A friend wrote me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Well maybe you should get to know the
dialog: person before you judge them instead of
dialog: listening to some bullshit gossip.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
dialog: but you still didn't answer the question.
text: An uncomfortable silence falls between them,
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Who the hell is taking the time to write
dialog: letters, spreading this shit about me?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: It's not really important.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
dialog: not going to be friends.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Why are you being so dramatic?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
text: trying to deal with them and the last
dialog: thing I need is people spreading shit
dialog: about me.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Alright, I said I was sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can we start over again? I think we've
text: gotten off on the wrong foot.
text: She approaches him and they shake.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE (cont'd)
dialog: Annette Harrison.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sebastian Valmont.
text: She smiles, but before he releases her hand:
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
dialog: you've never had sex do you touch
dialog: yourself?
text: She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: What did I say?
scene_heading: 19 INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY 19
text: CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.
speaker_heading: RONALD (O.S.)
dialog: That's good, that's good.
speaker_heading: WE PULL BACK
text: Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
text: CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
text: American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
dialog: music lesson.
speaker_heading: RONALD (cont'd)
dialog: Now let's try the A minor scale.
text: Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.
text: Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.
speaker_heading: RONALD (cont'd)
dialog: Once more, and remember the third note
text: is flat.
text: Cecile tries again and once again screws up.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Oh, I suck. I suck.
speaker_heading: RONALD
dialog: Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
text: Cecile takes a deep breath
speaker_heading: RONALD (cont'd)
dialog: You're concentrating too much on your
text: bowing. Let it flow.
text: He stands and sits behind her.
speaker_heading: RONALD (cont'd)
dialog: Here, let me help you.
text: He places his hand over hers.
speaker_heading: RONALD (cont'd)
dialog: Now close your eyes and let's try again.
text: She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
text: much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
text: face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.
text: ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
text: her face.
text: Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
text: Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
text: his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
text: her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.
text: ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
text: which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.
text: Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
dialog: Your playing was beautiful.
text: Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
dialog: giving me music lessons over the
dialog: summer.
text: Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.
speaker_heading: RONALD
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Likewise I'm sure.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Ronald is one of the few high school
dialog: students attending Juliard. He's
dialog: composing his first opera.
speaker_heading: RONALD
dialog: It's based on the life of Doctor
dialog: Martin Luther King.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Doctor King is my favorite.
text: Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
text: and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: RONALD
dialog: I guess our hour's up. Same time

scene_heading: 21 INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 21

text: BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
text: open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
text: from his stash.
text: Sebastian paces behind him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: - none taken -
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
dialog: shit about me.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Any ideas who it could be?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
dialog: wouldn't be alive right now.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Where did you say she's from?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
speaker_heading: BLAINE
text: Greg McConnell.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: The football stud?
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
dialog: surprised if he was your rat.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
dialog: I fingered his girlfriend at the game
dialog: last year.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: I don't think that bothered him.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
text: ends on and off the field.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Are you shitting me?
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
dialog: in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
dialog: go at it for a while, then as soon as
dialog: he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
dialog: know -
dialog: (imitating Greg)
dialog: "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
dialog: I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
dialog: gay, deal with it. The only reason why
dialog: I let him continue with his charade is
dialog: because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Not anymore. Football team started
dialog: practice last week. He's already called
dialog: me to hook up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Really. You think you could arrange a
dialog: little get together with him tonight on
dialog: my behalf?
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
text: Spartacus on television tonight.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Outstanding.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Don't think it's not going to cost you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No problem. Just make sure your front
dialog: door is unlocked. Shall we say the
dialog: "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
text: Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.
scene_heading: 22 EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 22
text: Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies

text: a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
text: Cecile and braids her hair.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: So, rumor has it that you went on a date
dialog: with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
dialog: nice.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: He's alright.
dialog: (giggles)
dialog: He kept talking about this bulimic
text: headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Really? Bulimic headcase.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: What a loser she must be.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
dialog: for Labor Day Weekend.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: That's great.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
dialog: just scared.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: What are you scared of?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
dialog: first base with a guy. What do I do?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Haven't you ever practiced with one of
dialog: your girlfriends?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Eww. No. That's gross.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: It's not gross. How else do you think
dialog: girls learn? Here turn around and
dialog: face me.
text: Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Now close your eyes and wet your lips.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Are you for real?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Do you want to learn or not?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I guess. It still sounds gross.
text: Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
text: her on the mouth.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: See that wasn't so bad.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: It was nothing.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Let's try it again, only this time I'm
dialog: going to stick my tongue in your
dialog: mouth. When I do that I want you to
dialog: massage my tongue with yours. That's
dialog: what first base is.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: (reluctant)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
text: Eyes closed.
text: Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
text: again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
text: then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
text: as instructed and they start to make out.
text: Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
text: are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
text: continues her seduction.
text: She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
text: her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.
text: Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
dialog: and smile.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: That was cool.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Maybe you should try it on your friend
dialog: Ronald sometime.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Is it that obvious?
text: Kathryn nods.
speaker_heading: CECILE (cont'd)
dialog: He sends me letters you know. Love
dialog: letters.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: That's so romantic. Have you
dialog: responded?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Well do you like him?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Cecile, we just made out in the middle
dialog: of Central Park. You can trust me.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I do like him. I can't stop thinking
dialog: about him.
text: Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.
speaker_heading: CECILE (cont'd)
dialog: What am I going to do? If my mother
dialog: found out about Ronald she would kill
dialog: me.
text: Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Listen to me. Your mother must never
dialog: know. Never.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Did you hide the letters?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Yes. They're in this antique doll house
dialog: in my room.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I want you to make me copies of his
dialog: letters and bring them to me.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
dialog: at it's love letters. With my help,
dialog: he'll be eating out of the palm of
dialog: your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
dialog: little get together for the two of you
dialog: at my house.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: You'd do that for me?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Of course I would. We're friends,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Best friends.
text: Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Excuse me. Excuse me!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You talking to me?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Look, I know this is your house and all,
dialog: but do you think you couid keep it down?
dialog: I'm trying to read.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What'cha reading?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: The Fountainhead.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Great book.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: You've read The Fountainhead?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
dialog: you know. When Howard Roark makes love
dialog: to Dominique Francon... most romantic
dialog: scene in all of literature.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
text: Romantic? He rapes her.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That's a matter of opinion.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: You need help.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why don't you come join me for a swim
dialog: and we'll discuss it.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: At this hour? I don't think so.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh come on. Quit acting like a
text: geriatric and get in the pool.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Gee, with an invitation like that how
dialog: could a girl refuse.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: 25 INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 25
text: Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
text: tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Fuck her yet?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm working on it.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Loser.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Blow me.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Call me later.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay.
text: She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
text: jabs her toe.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.
speaker_heading: SOOK-HEE
dialog: Sorry.
text: Kathryn kicks some water in her face.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN

text: pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: (holding out the letter)
dialog: You know it amazes me that someone as
dialog: bright as you can be so horrible.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What? Another letter from your friend?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: This is my favorite part.
dialog: (reading the letter)
dialog: Even more treacherous and dangerous than
dialog: he is charming and fascinating. He has
dialog: never taken a single step or spoken a
dialog: single word without some dishonorable
dialog: or criminal intention. Every young girl
dialog: he has successfully pursued has
dialog: regretted it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You know you could at least have the
dialog: decency of telling me who's badmouthing
dialog: me so I might have the opportunity to
dialog: confront them face to face. How do you
dialog: know it's not some girl who's pissed
dialog: off at me for breaking up with her?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I sincerely doubt it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Give me the fucking letter.
text: Annette smiles and tears the letter up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Why did you do that?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: The last thing I need is you going into
dialog: my room searching for this while I'm
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Is that the last thing you need? My
dialog: your clever.
text: She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
text: then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
text: bathing suit underneath.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: How's the water?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Refreshing.
text: She dives in the pool and surfaces.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: You're right you know.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: About what you said today in the stable.
dialog: I'm not a happy person.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I never said that.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You implied it.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
dialog: with all your morals and values and
dialog: well, YOU seem to be happy in your
dialog: choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: (caught off guard)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Seriously, you're amazing. You have
dialog: everything going for you.
dialog: (counts with his fingers)
dialog: You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
dialog: determined. You're everything I want
text: in a girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
dialog: could never work.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Because you act like a pig.
text: He swims towards her.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Do you deny that there's an attraction
dialog: between us?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I don't... I don't want to answer that...
dialog: look we're friends.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You don't find me cute? Come on, look
dialog: at these muscles.
text: He flexes for her. She laughs.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
dialog: that.
text: He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
text: him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: You're naked.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It's my house.
text: She pushes him off her.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: That's repulsive.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What's the big deal? We're friends.
dialog: Haven't you ever seen your friends
dialog: naked before?
text: Annette climbs out of the pool.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Get some manners.
text: She walks into the house.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.
text: She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (from under the covers)
dialog: Get out of here.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Whoa!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I told you to lock the door.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: I thought I did.
speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

dialog: -- really drunk and blah blah blah
dialog: blah blah.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Please don't tell anyone. This could

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Your career? What about your family?
dialog: Can you imagine the humiliation your

dialog: packer.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
dialog: not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (to Sebastian)
dialog: Please. I'm begging you. I'll do

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
dialog: there. It's too good to pass up.
text: Greg starts to cry.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: After all, it is you who's bad-

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Annette Harrison? I don't know what

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Come on Greg. You're the only one who

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: I swear on my life, I never said a

speaker_heading: BLAINE

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes, well unfortunately I can't just

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I... I don't think you want to know.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Cecile, you have to tell me.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: It involves your brother. He... took
dialog: advantage of me.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Does your mother know?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: If she knew, she'd kill me. It
dialog: happened at your house last night.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Why didn't you do something?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: So, let me get this straight. You
dialog: came over to our house late last night
dialog: and he forced intercourse on you.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Well... not exactly.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: He made you give him a blow job.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Well what then?
text: Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: He ate you out?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: If that's what you call it.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Cecile, I think you're going to have
dialog: a hard time crying rape if that's all
dialog: he did.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: What do I do then?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Well did you like it?
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Well... I don't know - it was weird.
dialog: At first it felt icky, then it felt
dialog: kind of okay. Then, I started getting
dialog: really hot and then I started shaking
dialog: and then like, I don't t know... it
dialog: felt like an explosion, but a good one.
text: Kathryn laughs.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Cecile, you had an orgasm.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I did?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I am?
text: Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Now listen. Now that you're on your
dialog: way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
dialog: Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
dialog: instruct you.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: I don't love him. I love Ronald.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
dialog: happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
dialog: Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
dialog: many people as possible.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: But that would make me a slut.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
dialog: that nobody talks about it.
text: Cecile takes the information in.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: It's like a secret society.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: That's one way of looking at it.
speaker_heading: CECILE
dialog: Cool.

dialog: (beat)
dialog: She made me laugh.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: And that's why you're losing your bet?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
dialog: for a ride?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

text: Sebastian stands.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry about that.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I am too.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You know what? I don't take it back.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Because I'm in love with you.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I thought you said we were going to be
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I can't handle it. I can't keep my
dialog: feelings bottled up like you. Can you
dialog: honestly tell me that you feel nothing

speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I have feelings for you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN

text: Annette's eyes well up with tears.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: How am I a hypocrite?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh please Annette. You spend all your

dialog: Well here it is. Right in front of you,
dialog: but you're going to turn your back on
dialog: it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
dialog: where we can get married. If we were,
dialog: I'd propose, but that's not going to
dialog: happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
dialog: I'll move on, but you... you're going
dialog: to have to live with yourself knowing

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: You're telling me you had the chance to

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Bad time?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Kind of.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Well, you obviously wanted me to
dialog: witness your little adventure or else
dialog: you wouldn't have invited me in.
text: Sebastian walks toward the closet.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Who is our little friend so
dialog: inexperienced that you have to resort
dialog: to the alphabet game?
text: He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Tell me all the details.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It was... Fantastic.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Oh come on. For her first time?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know. That's the amazing part of
dialog: it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
dialog: Soleil acrobatics, just standard
dialog: missionary stuff, but it was... ah
dialog: forget it. I'm going to sound like a
dialog: Hallmark card.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: No, tell me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It was... it was like the emotional
dialog: part outweighed the physical part.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
text: the birds chirping.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
text: Mock, mock, mock.

text: Sebastian stands.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Some other time.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm not in the mood.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: And that's why you're leaving?

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What's wrong with you? Why are you
dialog: acting this way?
text: Kathryn starts to cry.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
dialog: in love with her. You don't love me
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
dialog: contest.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: At first it was, but now it's become
dialog: something bigger.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
dialog: always loved you.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I can't believe you're reacting this
dialog: way. You're just saying this because
dialog: you lost the bet.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Is that what you think?
text: He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
text: underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
text: aside, spreading her legs.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Alright, come on, let's get it over
dialog: with. But mark my words, this is the
dialog: only time it'll happen.
text: She picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
dialog: me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
dialog: make some phone calls.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That's not fair. You're taking all the
dialog: fun out of it.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
dialog: If not for me, then do it for you.
dialog: Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
dialog: turned you into jelly. What do you want
dialog: to be, one of those losers who walk
text: down the halls holding hands and
dialog: smiling. People used to respect you.
dialog: They feared you and now you're going to
dialog: throw that all away.
text: Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
dialog: now he's just another love-struck

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I've never done this before.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: How have you dumped girls in the past?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Screening calls. Any suggestions?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I knew this guy last summer in the
text: Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
dialog: time were madly in love with each
dialog: other. But she had this huge weight
dialog: problem. His friends taunted him
dialog: mercilessly about it. You know, "How
dialog: do you breathe when she sits on your
dialog: face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
dialog: be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
dialog: take it anymore and decided to dump
text: her. She flipped and he went on the
dialog: defensive. I distinctly remember him
dialog: saying the same thing over and over
dialog: again. "I'm completely fucked up."
dialog: "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
dialog: completely fucked up."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Poor fatty never had a chance.

speaker_heading: ANNETTE

speaker_heading: ANNETTE (cont'd)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
dialog: fucked up.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why aren't you understanding?
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know. I wish I felt the same.
dialog: Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
dialog: it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
dialog: completely fucked up.
text: Annette bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Why are you trying to hurt me?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
dialog: see what you were like in bed.
text: She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
text: He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
dialog: would appreciate you acting like a
dialog: total psychopath.
text: She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: You don't know how to love.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You don't even know me. The fact of the
dialog: matter is there is some one I love.
dialog: She's smarter, prettier... you don't
dialog: even compare to her. The only reason I
dialog: am here is because she wants us to be
dialog: exclusive.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: But you knew this was important to me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What, your virginity? Well that's over
dialog: now.
text: Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
text: towards her.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: Please go.
text: He opens the door.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.
text: He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Jesus.
text: Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
text: journal in hand.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: A little melodramatic, don't you think.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I have a flair for drama.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You wanted an answer to your question.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Annette?
text: He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
text: crying.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
dialog: she'll ever trust a man again.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Well done.
text: He holds up a bottle of champagne.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I thought we should celebrate.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Ronald?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Not that it's any of your business but
dialog: yes.
text: Sebastian holds up a letter.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: From Ronald.
text: Kathryn takes the letter.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I haven't had a chance to read it, but
dialog: I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
dialog: yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
dialog: Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
dialog: friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
dialog: You see, I expected your sort of
dialog: bullshit so I took the liberty of
text: phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
dialog: they're having a little get together
dialog: in my love shack at the Grand Central
dialog: Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
dialog: over you, but I promised him I would
dialog: see you through your crisis.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Well done.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Thank you. Now, where were we?
text: POP goes the champagne cork.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Oh yeah, the celebration.
text: He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
text: and hands one to Kathryn.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: What shall we toast to?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: To my triumph, of course.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Not my choice of toast, but it's your
dialog: call. To your triumph over Annette.
text: Kathryn giggles.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
dialog: It's over you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: You were very much in love with her and
dialog: you're still in love with her. But it
dialog: amused me to make you ashamed of it.
dialog: You gave up on the first person you
dialog: ever loved because I called you names.
dialog: Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
dialog: you chose me over her, but please
dialog: understand, I never loved you,
dialog: Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
dialog: toy I play with. And now you've
dialog: completely blown it with her. I think
dialog: that's the saddest thing I've ever
dialog: heard.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Cheers.
text: She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
text: drink. He looks ill.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: In any event, you still owe me my
dialog: reward.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
dialog: fuck losers.
text: Sebastian slaps her across the face.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: You motherfucker!
text: She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
text: fall to the ground.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN (cont'd)
dialog: Nobody hits me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Calm down.
text: He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Get off me!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Will you calm down?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Fine! Get off me!
text: He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
dialog: breaths.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I accept. Now get out.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Get out? We had an arrangement.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Didn't you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I don't care what you said, we had an
dialog: agreement. You've slept with half of
dialog: the borough so don't tell me you're
dialog: being choosy.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Get out!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'm giving you to the count of three to
dialog: plop your ass down on the bed.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: And if I don't?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Then I will consider it a declaration
dialog: of war. One. Two... three.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I think you have your answer.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: War it is.
