text: OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON.
scene_heading: SLOWLY FADE IN TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT
text: The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts
text: off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple. The loon
text: continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,
text: the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely
text: call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,
text: silenced forever. A lone feather surfaces and floats as:
text: Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing "I CAN
scene_heading: SEE CLEARLY NOW." Then--
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (O.S.)
dialog: And they pay you for this? To tag
dialog: beaver?
speaker_heading: WALT (O.S.)
dialog: Imagine.
text: As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater. It is
text: the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from
text: a boat.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Next to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an
text: untipped waiter.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Ask me, what an animal does in the
dialog: wild is his own business so long as
dialog: he doesn't do it to man. I think
dialog: Mark Twain said that.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: (dry)
dialog: I think he didn't. But since
dialog: you've said it, I guess we're
dialog: covered.
text: Keough holds a stare. Walt drops overboard. Keough pulls a
text: Twinkie from his pocket. Begins to unwrap.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - DAY
text: FIND KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties,
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: Kevin, hey.
text: She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Hi. Listen. Could I steal you a
dialog: second?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (great idea)
dialog: Absolutely.
scene_heading: INT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: They enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I had a great time last night.
dialog: Again.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Me too.
text: Reading his look, she suddenly smells it. Her face drops.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (deducing)
dialog: That's not what you came to say.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You work for me. I'm not
dialog: comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
text: She's a little crushed.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was working for you when "us"
dialog: started, what's--
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I know and I thought I could handle
dialog: it but work and pleasure along with
dialog: somebody else, it's a dangerous
dialog: mix.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Kevin, as long as we...
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: What was that last part?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: The somebody else part?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah, that part. There's...
dialog: somebody who's um...
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (feels terrible)
dialog: Else.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (covering)
dialog: Oh. Oh. That's okay. Well. This
dialog: uh... this probably wasn't meant to
dialog: be, y'know. I mean, I'm... God, I
dialog: gotta be ten years younger and you,
dialog: you... you're y'know...
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (reading her mind)
text: A jerk.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (you have no idea)
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (then)
dialog: No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm
dialog: just thrown, I'm...
dialog: (checks her watch)
dialog: I actually have an early lunch,
dialog: so...
speaker_heading: KEVIN
text: It's ten after nine.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes, well...
dialog: (smiling)
text: famished.
text: And she rushes out of the room. OFF Kevin, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: Walt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or
text: dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
text: Keough unwraps the second Twinkie.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Walt continues to swim.
speaker_heading: HIS P.O.V.
text: Not much to look at. Then suddenly... no, just a snapping
text: turtle swimming away. Walt descends a little deeper. He loves
text: it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere
text: else. Next best thing to meditation. Suddenly, he stops
text: kicking.
speaker_heading: HIS EYES FOCUS
text: A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look. The snake
text: seems unimpressed. Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,
text: misses. Shit. Walt's look says "what the fuck?" A beat. Then
text: the snake swims off. Walt relaxes. A beat. But then... he
text: looks around, uneasy. He gets this feeling he's not alone down
text: there. Looks about, nothing but murky water. But he's not
dialog: alone, we can feel he's not alone.
text: He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,
text: looking back at him. What's with these snakes? Walt decides
text: he'll go back to the boat. Then... BOOM. Something hits him...
dialog: and it's no snake.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS
text: Keough. Oblivious. Waiting. Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting
text: up with a scream!
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Sheriff!!
text: And Walt is promptly yanked back under.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Hey!
text: Upon which Walt surfaces. He swims frantically for a beat
text: before he's suddenly yanked under again. Then he surfaces,
text: thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat. He takes hold of
text: him and pulls him on board. Actually... what's left of him.
text: There's nothing below the waist. Walt is just a bleeding torso,
text: though still conscious.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: (going into shock)
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND
text: clenching around Keough's arm.
speaker_heading: ANGLE WALT'S FACE
text: He knows he's done. OFF Keough's continued horror, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: BLACK AND WHITE
text: A DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
text: We're watching an old classic creature feature. FIND Kelly
text: alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.
text: As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the
text: popcorn bag and her mouth.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE SCREEN
text: The monster pursues its human victim.
speaker_heading: ANGLE KELLY
text: fear on her face.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE SCREEN
text: The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.
speaker_heading: ANGLE KELLY
text: as she screams with fear and delight. Her scream is only
text: partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.
text: After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again. Wearing
text: gullibility, vulnerability all over her face. Then from behind
text: a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with
text: the most blood-curdling scream of all.
text: All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE:
speaker_heading: MYRA OKUBO
text: Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you expect, mugging me from
dialog: behind?
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: I tapped you.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well you shouldn't have. How did
dialog: you even know where I was.
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Wild guess.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't like to be scared, Myra, I
dialog: have a thing about fright, don't
dialog: ever scare me.
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: Kevin told me you were upset.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Really? I never realized he was so
dialog: psychic, how could he detect that,
dialog: did he tell you there's somebody
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: Well... he didn't have to tell me
dialog: that part.
text: Kelly freezes. Stares at her. Then:
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: It started before you, Kelly, I
dialog: never would've--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: It was just a quick thing which we
dialog: thought was over, and and...
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You and Kevin.
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: It wasn't suppose to happen, I
dialog: don't know what to say...
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You don't know what to say, lucky
dialog: for you action speaks louder than
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: Kelly--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not upset, Myra, okay. I just
dialog: never thought of you as a y'know...
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: Backstabber?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (don't be silly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: Liar?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (c'mon)
dialog: Myra.
speaker_heading: OKUBO
dialog: Shitbutt?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I really... I should get back.
text: And Kelly peels off to go on her way. Bumps into a Pedestrian.
text: She then gives him an angry shove, under--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the pedestrian)
dialog: Don't fuck with me!
text: And off she goes. The Pedestrian and Okubo exchange a look.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Coroner's ambulance. Walt's covered body is being loaded, as
text: JACK WELLS, Fish and Game, thirty, emerges from his truck. He
text: approaches the body. Lifts up the sheet. Stares a beat in
text: disbelief. Turns to Keough.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What did this?
dialog: OFF Keough, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - DAY
text: Kelly's in her office, working at her desk. Kevin enters.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Kevin. How's it going, what's
dialog: happenin', family good, great, nice
dialog: to catch up, get out.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: This is business.
dialog: (then)
dialog: There was an accident in Maine,
dialog: some guy got killed by something in
text: a lake. Probably a bear, but...
dialog: they found a tooth.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: A tooth?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: A tooth they say couldn't have come
dialog: from any bear. They say it looks
dialog: prehistoric. Like maybe a
dialog: dinosaur.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Oh, well then I'm sure that's it,
dialog: he got killed by a dinosaur,
dialog: anything else?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I want you to go there.
text: Now she looks up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I'm sure it's nothing, but you're
dialog: a paleontologist, this is what we
dialog: do, I--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: This is what we do?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: I'd like you to check out this
dialog: lake. See--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you on drugs?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Kelly--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not going to Maine, I won't
dialog: even go west of Forty-third Street--
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Part of our research--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not even a field person.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Well on this one I'd like you to
dialog: be.
text: Kelly stares back. The nickle drops.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?
dialog: Get me out of the office for a few
dialog: days, until--
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: It has nothing to do with--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I never do field work and even if
dialog: I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of
dialog: a dinosaur who bit somebody,
dialog: couldn't you dream up something--
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Kelly--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I am not going to Maine. That's
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAINE SKIES - DAY

scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: He just came up screaming.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Did he say anything?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He just kinda gurgled. He was
text: pretty much dead.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And you didn't see anything?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: The lake was dead calm until up he
text: came. The tooth is in there.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (seeing)
dialog: There? That's the morgue.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is the dead guy in there?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: That's where they keep them.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You want me to bring the tooth out
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Um.
dialog: (bravado)
dialog: No, no. Let's go.
text: CLOSE ON THE TOOTH
dialog: Reveal--
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE - DAY
text: The Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and
text: kelly. Walt's torso is covered. Kelly is examining the tooth.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I need to get a microscopic look at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: Fine.
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Maybe I should see...
dialog: (the body)
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (reading her)
dialog: I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm fine, thank you.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Have you ever seen a dead body
dialog: before, Ms. Scott?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well.
dialog: (admits)
text: At wakes.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: This is a little different.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I can look at dead things.
text: And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait.
text: She takes a breath.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay.
text: And Daniels peels back the sheet. Kelly strains to disguise her
text: extreme horror. Finally--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (fighting off nausea)
dialog: This... how long did this attack go
dialog: on for?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Seconds. Three, four.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And this is how he came to the
dialog: boat?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: And is there a place nearby I could
dialog: go to vomit?
dialog: OFF this, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. INDIGO MAINE - DAY
text: It's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire
text: station. Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store
text: loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the
dialog: Sheriff's Department.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Nobody lives within twenty-five
dialog: miles, 'cept some old couple who
dialog: live right on the lake. Teenagers
dialog: trek in every once in a while, none
dialog: have disappeared, and none have
dialog: spotted anything unusual.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You talk to the married couple?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What kind of backup do we have?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: We?
dialog: That strikes a nerve.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Sorry. I'm just a little unclear
dialog: as to why the Museum of Natural
dialog: History would send somebody here.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You have a thing against museums?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I got nothing against--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Ever even been in one?
text: He stares back. Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun. As he
dialog: loads it--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Lightweight Forward Area air device
dialog: unit. Whatever's out there, one
text: shot with this and he's dead.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: And you stock these things for
dialog: what, to fend off Russia?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: You're sort of a rude person.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's just that--
text: Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a
text: white fog from a can of Yard Guard. Keough holds a look at her.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mosquitos. I have a thing about
dialog: mosquitos.
text: Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine
text: Fish And Game". Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like
text: radar.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We set?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Ready.
dialog: (re Kelly; dry)
dialog: A museum in New York sent us some
dialog: additional back up.
text: Kelly shoots Keough a look. Then:
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Kelly Scott.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jack Wells. A museum sent you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
text: Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did you make anything of the tooth?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes, it did seem prehistoric but
dialog: I'm sure he just carried the thing
dialog: for luck. Not that it worked,
dialog: obviously. It probably somehow got
text: lodged into his body.
text: Jack holds another look.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you staring at me?
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Do I have a smudge on my face, it
dialog: would be so you not to have told
dialog: me.
text: Keough also lets that pass.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: I'm ready when you are.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's go.
text: As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Excuse me. One other thing, it's
dialog: a small point, but... I have a
dialog: thing about being humored, and I'm
text: feeling humored, more by him, but
dialog: you seemed quick to join in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ma'am, your first impression isn't
dialog: going well.
text: As JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Excuse me? Is it true you're going
dialog: to look for some kind of monster in
dialog: Black Lake?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: We're just going to investigate an
dialog: accident. There's no monster.
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: We heard a man got bit in half.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: There was an accident, that's all.
dialog: Nothing to worry about.
text: And Janine goes into the store. The men just watch her go.
text: Sixteen going on twenty, nubile. Kelly just looks at the men,
text: gaping at the girl.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Keough, Jack, and Kelly are in a boat motoring towards a
text: farmhouse. No other houses in sight.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
text: Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning DELORES BICKERMAN, mid-
text: sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy. She's brought out
dialog: refreshments.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: Oh, my husband passed away almost
dialog: two years ago.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: My department doesn't have any
dialog: record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: (with some attitude)
dialog: Oh well, I'm sorry. I didn't
dialog: realize you keep such a firm track
dialog: of the dead.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (gently)
dialog: What was the cause of your
dialog: husband's death, Ma'am, do you
dialog: know?
text: Off Bickerman's silence--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't mean to invade your
dialog: privacy but... was he ill, was he
dialog: sick?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Was he swallowed?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (reprimanding)
dialog: Sheriff.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're
dialog: up here... a man was fatally
dialog: attacked yesterday by some animal
dialog: in this lake. Do you know how your
dialog: husband died?
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Oh yes. I killed him.
text: Keough clenches his eyes shut. The old woman's a loon.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You killed him.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: (happily)
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: And how would you have accomplished
dialog: this, Ma'am?
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: (rattling it off quickly,
dialog: simply)
dialog: Well, he was very ill and he
dialog: refused to go see a doctor and
dialog: well... I think he had Alzheimer's,
dialog: he would be coherent one day,
dialog: incoherent the next and one
dialog: coherent day, he asked me to end
dialog: his suffering. I wouldn't do it
dialog: but he kept insisting and insisting
dialog: and deteriorating till the point
dialog: the only cognitive thing he could
dialog: really do was that I finish him
dialog: off. Finally I just gave in and
text: hit him on the head with a skillet
text: then buried him under the bulkhead.
text: Jack, Keough, and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman.
dialog: Off their looks--
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Dig him up if you don't believe me,
dialog: Javert.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Keough and Kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the
text: thickly wooded shoreline.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: Half mile up, there's a clearing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You gonna dig up that lady's
dialog: husband?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'll call the coroner.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: What is with this lake? It looks
dialog: black and... there are no waves or
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: They wanted to call it Lake Placid.
dialog: But somebody said that name was
dialog: taken.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Gee.
text: Jack smiles, gets her sarcasm.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: The tents were sent ahead, they
dialog: should already be set-up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (what?)
dialog: We're staying in tents?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I told you. Two days, we'd have to
dialog: camp.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes, camp, I thought that meant
dialog: Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents",
dialog: will there be toilets?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: What the hell?
text: Keough's attention has been otherwise arrested. He sees
text: something in the water.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (slowing the boat)
dialog: I thought I saw...
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: It looks like a branch.
text: He leans over to grab something floating in the water. Looks
text: like a branch. He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler.
text: Connected to the severed head of a moose. Keough, seeing it as
text: he lifts it, screams, throwing it.
text: It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the
text: HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD. Kelly rears
text: back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Hey!!
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You threw it at me!!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (denying)
dialog: I just let go of it.
speaker_heading: KELLY JACK
dialog: You threw it at me!! Alright.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Did you see that?
text: She belts him again.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop hitting me! Ma'am!
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Don't throw heads at me,
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: and stop calling me "Ma'am"!
scene_heading: ANGLE THE HEAD
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: A beat. This head looks ripped off the body.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What is going on here?
scene_heading: EXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER
text: A small tent camp is being set up. People unpacking. Two
text: Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present. Kelly is with Jack.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How big do the bears get?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Big but... a bear couldn't do that
text: to a moose or man in water. On
dialog: land maybe. But...
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And they're sure he didn't get
text: tangled under the outboard somehow?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hank says he's sure.
text: Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It really is beautiful, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Never been to Maine before?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was told they discriminate
dialog: against people with hygiene.
dialog: (off Jack)
dialog: I never believed it.
dialog: He measure her. Then--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why are you here? Really.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I told you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Museum of Natural History
dialog: doesn't send out investigators to--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How would you know, what--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And even if they did, I doubt he or
dialog: she would have problems with tents.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: So I don't like tents, why--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't like tents, mosquitos,
dialog: look at your fingernails, you have
dialog: about as much business being in the
dialog: woods--
speaker_heading: KELLY JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong with my --as Emily Post, it doesn't
dialog: fingernails these are make sense--
dialog: perfectly good--
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (overriding)
dialog: They sent you out to examine a tooth,
dialog: why are you out here on the on the lake?
text: A beat. Might as well tell.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I am a paleontologist.
dialog: (throwing it out)
dialog: I also was dating my boss he turned
text: out to be involved with a co-worker
dialog: who was also my friend and for the
dialog: sake of comfort, theirs, I was
dialog: shipped off to Maine.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don't feel like going back yet.
text: There. She said it. He stares back.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not making it up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well. You don't have to stay out
dialog: here, why don't--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I've come, I'm here, I'm staying.
dialog: Unless there are ticks.
text: We then HEAR the SOUND OF A DESCENDING HELICOPTER. She looks
dialog: up. Then:
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: If this is who I think it is.
dialog: (as it gets closer)
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook
dialog: mythology professor. He's done
dialog: some work with our museum. He also
dialog: treks the world to swim with
text: crocodiles.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Crocodiles. He's an expert on
dialog: them. And if he's here... then he
dialog: must think that's what's in this
dialog: lake.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: In Maine?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: There have been Northern sightings.
dialog: But not this North.
text: As HECTOR CYR, this giant ball of life, deboards his chopper--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (spotting Kelly;
dialog: disappointed)
dialog: You beat me. Balls.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I need some of you to help me
text: unpack.
dialog: (to Burke and Stevens)
dialog: You and you.
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Not you.
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Who do we have from Fish And Game?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH JACK
dialog: (to Kelly) Me.
dialog: Who is this man?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (rapid fire)
text: I could see the algae blooms just
dialog: coming in, how long has this lake
dialog: been stagnant?
text: (extending his hand to
dialog: Keough)
dialog: Hi, Hector Cyr. The Earth is round
dialog: and so should you be.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: --Who is he?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I'll need any and all topographic
dialog: studies.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Wait just a second. You don't just
dialog: fly in here and start barking
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I apologize, I just don't want to
dialog: lose the light, we've got time for
dialog: a quick scout,
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: you've had work done.
scene_heading: KELLY KEOUGH
dialog: (flaring) (frustrated)
dialog: I have not. Who is this man?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me
dialog: know when it sinks in,
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: have you seen it?
speaker_heading: KELLY KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Mister...
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: It couldn't be a crocodile.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: They've been migrating north,
dialog: Kelly, this lake connects to the
dialog: ocean,--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Mr. Cyr!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: C'mon, we're losing light,
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: why does the big one heckle me?
text: Kelly yanks him aside.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Hector. The big one has no sense
dialog: of humor. And since he's the one
dialog: who decides whether you get to
dialog: play, try not to be your obnoxious
dialog: self.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: That hurt my feelings.
text: And it did a little. Hector is a big Teddy Bear.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: If we're gonna go we better go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
text: Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside
text: in another. Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar
text: devices. The calm. The still. The beauty.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: If he's here, I'll find him.
dialog: (to Jack, re Kelly)
dialog: Did she tell you we had sex
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I never had sex with you!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Even so, you're allowed to boast.
dialog: You look thin by the way, I've
dialog: mentally undressed you, I can see
dialog: your ribcage.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I really don't mean to be
dialog: discourteous.
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: But how is it a person could come
dialog: to believe that a crocodile is in
dialog: New England?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: They have saltwater glands, they
dialog: can swim across oceans, it's only
dialog: a matter of time.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: And what would he do come winter?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: They can survive winter. As long
text: as their nostrils don't freeze,
dialog: they survive,
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: am I foolish to explain things, he
dialog: had such trouble with my name?
scene_heading: KELLY KEOUGH
dialog: (scolding) Hey.
dialog: Hector.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Is this where it happened?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Around here. Yeah.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (knows his crocodiles)
dialog: If he's eaten in the area, he
dialog: shouldn't be far away. Crocs hang
text: around the food source.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: But they're nighttime hunters,
dialog: Hector, he'd probably be on land
dialog: now anyway.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: 'Cept he wasn't before, was he?
dialog: (then to Keough)
dialog: You know, when friends or family
dialog: members say things, they tend not
dialog: to register so sometimes it helps
dialog: to hear it from a total stranger.
dialog: You're fat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hector.
text: Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty
text: feet away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: White perch.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are they feeding?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Doesn't look like it.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: They look like they're jumping.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: They look scared.
text: Upon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with
text: one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table,
text: sending them all flying.
text: In an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives.
text: Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's
text: flipped-over back. Breathless, they all exchange confused
dialog: looks. "What the hell happened"?
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: My hair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNDOWN
text: Kelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone.
text: Keough is there as Hector approaches. Jack is approaching as
text: well. Activity bustles in the b.g.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (into her phone)
dialog: None of us actually saw anything.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I realize this Sir, but something
dialog: flipped us over, I doubt very much
dialog: it was a mink.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: They don't believe her.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (still into phone)
dialog: Thank you, it's so rewarding to
dialog: imagine my tax dollar finding its
dialog: way to you, you Fucker.
dialog: (she clicks off)
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Such the flirt.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody
text: without a confirmation.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Same thing from Fish And Game.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Something's in that water.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well until we see it, we're not
dialog: gonna be convincing too many
dialog: people.
text: As DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches--
speaker_heading: GARE (O.S.)
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Sheriff.
text: Keough looks over.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: (pointing to the ground)
dialog: You might want to see this.
text: They all walk over.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE GROUND
text: There's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming,
text: surrounding... a human toe.
speaker_heading: KELLY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh God, worms. I got a thing about
dialog: worms.
speaker_heading: RESUME
speaker_heading: GARE
text: It's a human toe.
text: Hector studies it, picks it up. Then--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Some decomposition, little acidic,
text: it has been swallowed.
dialog: (to Keough; holding the
dialog: toe)
dialog: Is this the man who was killed?
text: Keough deadpans back. Then--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: We'd only just met.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Well, you've got a croc alright,
dialog: they're keystone species.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Keystone what?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Species, keystones affect the
dialog: entire ecosystem, that could
dialog: explain all these worms, the water.
dialog: You've got a crocodile.
dialog: (proffering the toe)
dialog: Bury your friend.
text: Hector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off. Keough stands
dialog: there, holding the tow, as we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: Kelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS,
text: as Jack approaches. He stops. Takes a second to... well,
text: admire her. She's an attractive woman. He then approaches.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Baby crocs?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Adult males will charge hatchlings.
dialog: If there's one out there...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If one could be out there... why
dialog: does Fish And Game tell me it's
dialog: impossible?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Because they just consult their
dialog: little indigenous charts.
text: A beat, as she tends to her work.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen... if you really do know
dialog: crocs, you should know how stealth
dialog: like they are. I wouldn't be
text: standing a foot from the water.
text: She looks.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: He could be right there and you
dialog: wouldn't see him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (still looking at the
dialog: water)
dialog: I'd be able to see something.
text: Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder. As it makes
text: a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh that's funny. That was real
dialog: funny.
text: And she heads off. OFF Jack, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HECTOR'S TENT - NIGHT
text: Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of
text: his tent. From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY.
text: Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: He paid us. Five hundred.
text: Keough continues on toward the tent.
scene_heading: INT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS
text: His tent is on the palatial side. Stereo, generator, he's got a
text: margarita bar going. There's a party. Hector's dancing with
text: Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: You're a beautiful woman.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: And law enforcement, such dangerous
dialog: work. The idea that you could die
text: suddenly with no offspring,
dialog: disconcerting, let's mate, commit
dialog: your genes to perpetuity.
text: Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Hey.
text: He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: We are here on official business.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Cocktail?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: No!!
dialog: (then)
dialog: What's with digging the holes?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: They come on land and they're
dialog: brazen. They're also attracted to
dialog: noise, you can see I make a lot of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Everybody out, back to your tents,
dialog: now!
text: They start to leave.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (re Gare)
dialog: Could she stay, we've tentatively
dialog: scheduled intercourse.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: No!! Out!
text: And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind
dialog: of funny".
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: You listen to me. The only reason
dialog: I'm letting you be part of this is
dialog: 'cause you got the helicopter and
dialog: the radar--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: And you like me.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I do not like you.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Deep down, gut check. I'm growing
dialog: fond of you and it's liberating to
dialog: say so.
text: Keough stares back.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: You're a whacko.
dialog: And Keough leaves, to:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: As Keough heads off--
speaker_heading: HECTOR (O.S.)
dialog: That hurt my feelings.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A CAMPFIRE
speaker_heading: REVEAL--
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT
text: Kelly stands, alone, skipping stones. After a beat, Jack
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Skipping stones. Look how flat
dialog: that water is, you can get ten
text: skips on a good one.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen, uh... Hank and I think it
dialog: best if you stay on shore.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whatever's out there did flip over
dialog: a canoe--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I am not staying on shore.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's too dangerous for--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I didn't fly up here to roast
dialog: marshmallows--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You flew up here because your boss--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I am going out on that boat and why
dialog: are you picking on me, is this some
dialog: kind of--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D) JACK
dialog: hazing, new fingernails I'm not picking--
dialog: in the woods?
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (overriding)
dialog: I'm beginning to see why you were
dialog: shipped off.
text: And her face falls.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (wounded; quietly)
dialog: That was an awful thing to say to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (feels bad now)
dialog: I'm sorry but you're...
text: A beat. He doesn't finish the sentence.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (genuine)
dialog: I do know crocodiles and I won't
dialog: get in your way.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I really do want to be a part of
dialog: this.
text: Jack reads her, he can see that she does.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We're up at six.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: 'Night.
dialog: There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny
text: it. He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book. She
text: gives one last look, watches him go. Then she goes back to her
dialog: book.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - MUCH LATER
text: The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet.
text: The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT. CRICKETS. A LOON. An OWL. A
text: courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage. By
text: the water... a black bear takes a drink.
scene_heading: ANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT
text: He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his
text: trousers, carrying a revolver. He walks into the nearby woods.
text: He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the
text: outside world. Proceeds to URINATE. Then... he hears
text: something. The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES. He STOPS URINATING,
text: we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT. Then quiet. Must be his
text: imagination. He RESUMES his business.
text: More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against
text: leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness.
text: Quiet. He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it
text: for sure. Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him. With his free
text: hand, Keough pulls out his revolver. More RUSTLING... Keough
text: points the gun. Something on the ground is coming toward him.
text: He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness. The RUSTLING is
text: getting LOUDER. It's almost upon him. A beat. CLOSER.
text: CLOSER. Then Keough peels away a bush revealing:
speaker_heading: HECTOR
text: Looking into a gun barrel. He screams. Keough screams. Then--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Jesus Christ!!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: You're crawling around like a--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I'm laying a spring trap!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: A spring trap!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I keep telling you, they can come
dialog: on land, I don't wanna wake up in
dialog: the middle of the night--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I coulda shot you, you--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: This could end up saving your life,--
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D) KEOUGH
dialog: You'll be glad you didn't Hey look, I'm sure you
dialog: shoot me then, you'll be finished first in your
dialog: tongue massaging my class but I think you need
text: hemorrhoids, just before to be retired to the big rubber
dialog: running off to get your room, where you can play with
dialog: sister pregnant, who you soft stuffed reptiles.
dialog: probably already call mom.
text: And now all the others, awakened, are charging.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: Hey! What is going on?
speaker_heading: HECTOR KEOUGH
text: This man takes a pistol He's crawling around--
dialog: to pee!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: (escalating)
dialog: This is an official investigation,
text: and this cuckoo bird is a civilian.
dialog: I don't care how much money he's
dialog: got, he's a total mental.
text: And Hector storms off. A beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You hurt his feelings. I think you
dialog: should go apologize.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Apologize?
speaker_heading: KELLY KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: We're a team here. It He's a fruitcake!
dialog: won't kill you to get
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look. The thing about Hector... he
dialog: takes this crocodile business
dialog: very...
dialog: (how to say it)
dialog: he thinks they're Godly.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He thinks they're what?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: In his defense, every primitive
dialog: culture known to man deified them.
dialog: He's a mythology professor, he
dialog: thinks crocs are divine conduits.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Is this 'spose to make me take him
dialog: more serious?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's to make you understand him,
dialog: with understanding comes tolerance.
dialog: Too bad they don't put proverbs in
dialog: Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (befuddled)
dialog: Why does everybody insult my
dialog: intelligence, I have intelligence,
dialog: intelligent people eat Twinkies.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Keough shoots a look to Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's just all get some sleep.
text: And Keough heads off, under--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'm an intelligent person.
text: Upon which, he disappears from Earth. He's stepped into one of
text: Hector's pit traps. A beat.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (O.S.)
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: I shall kill him.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE
text: The steam is lifting off the lake.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - MORNING
text: Keough, Kelly, Hector, and Deputy Burke are cruising in the
text: whaler. Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear. Jack
text: also has a stick gun for protection. Hector does not.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Again, I don't mean to be annoying
dialog: with my questions. But if it is a
dialog: crocodile which I don't think it
dialog: is. And if they do charge these
text: baby hatchling sounds...
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: why exactly would you want to be
dialog: underwater at the time?
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: With you it makes sense.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: They don't really attack underwater
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: No crocodile has ever--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: You should take a flax pole.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: And what if I tranq him Kelly? He
dialog: drowns. You think about that?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm just saying last resort.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Again. Not to be disruptive. Do
dialog: we have a problem with it dying?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Crocodiles don't sever with their
text: teeth, their molars are blunt.
text: As if that's suppose to clear it up. Keough stares back
text: blankly. Then:
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Is this a trick?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: What I'm saying is if it's a
text: crocodile that cut a man in half he
dialog: would have to be over twenty feet
dialog: which would make him well over a
dialog: hundred years old, it would be
text: unthinkable to destroy him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Burke)
dialog: Alright, let's just drop here.
text: Burke lowers the anchor, as Keough just continues to stare at
text: Hector. Kelly readies the hatchling recorder. She lowers it
text: into the water.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: They respond pretty quick. I'll
dialog: wait till you get down before I
dialog: turn it on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good.
dialog: (climbing over)
dialog: See ya soon.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Good luck.
text: There was a twinge of real concern in her voice. He makes eye
text: contact with her. Then drops over. Goes under.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Two years married, divorced, used
dialog: to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still
text: waiting on his sperm count.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
dialog: (off Hector's look)
dialog: Oh as if I'm interested.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: As if.
text: (as he's about to go
dialog: overboard; to Keough)
dialog: Will you miss me?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: I brought a pork chop, maybe we
dialog: could hang it around your neck for
dialog: luck.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: No thank you, but maybe later you
dialog: can chew the bark off my big fat
dialog: log.
text: And Hector drops overboard.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (strict)
dialog: I asked you to be nice to him.
text: Keough rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - ANGLE ON JACK - DAY
text: Jack, diving. We HEAR the HIGH PITCH of CROCODILE HATCHLINGS.
text: Visibility is again pretty limited.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON HECTOR - UNDERWATER - DAY
text: Hector dives through the dark black water. Visibility is lousy.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - THIRTY MINUTES LATER
text: Jack dives, searched. Looks ahead, sees something... He moves
text: closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER
text: Kelly and Keough onboard.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He may be a kook but he's also been
dialog: all over the world with them. He
dialog: even swam in the Grimetti with
text: killer Niles all around him, he
dialog: never got nipped.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: And that's why he thinks they're
dialog: Godly?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He said he knew it when he looked
text: into their eyes.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (simple)
dialog: You like Jack?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: What? I don't even know the guy.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Hector thinks you like him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well Hector's a giant cracker.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: You think Jack's handsome?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'm just curious. I can never tell
dialog: what women think is handsome. Is
dialog: he handsome?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well. He's probably rugged
dialog: handsome I guess. Yeah.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Am I?
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: Jack and Hector, diving together.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - TWO HOURS LATER
text: The boats sit still on the dead calm water. Kelly works the

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It shouldn't be taking so long.
text: They both scan the surface. Dead calm.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector moves about. We can hear the HATCHLING RECORDER, but
text: he's not seeing anything.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - (ANOTHER AREA) - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack looks about. He looks up. Doesn't see much but he gets an
text: eerie feeling. Something's out there.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
text: Keough, Kelly, and Burke, standing idly, scanning the calm
dialog: surface.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (into headset)
dialog: Hector, Jack, we show you with
dialog: about twelve minutes of oxygen
dialog: left, and you're on the last tank.
dialog: Time to go home.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That was a bust.
text: A beat. Another beat. Then... something jerks the boat a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I don't know. It was like a tug.
dialog: Something tugged us.
text: Upon which something really yanks the boat. So hard... Kelly
text: flips over the back, into the water.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
text: The boat is moving, being dragged quickly.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Something's got the anchor line!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Kelly!!
text: But Kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away.
speaker_heading: RESUME
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (into headset)
dialog: Jack!! Hector! We're being
dialog: dragged!!
text: (as he starts the motor; to
dialog: Burke)
dialog: Cut the line! Cut the fucking
dialog: line!
text: Burke goes to work on the anchor line as we ANGLE Kelly,
text: treading water, in the middle of nowhere. She's completely
dialog: vulnerable.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector, swimming for the surface.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
text: Kelly, treading water. FIND Keough on the boat, he now has the
text: engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that
dialog: boat has a fucking strong hold.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Cut the Goddamn rope!
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (working away)
dialog: I'm trying!
text: And finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
text: with a jump, Burke nearly sails out. Keough's boat then races
dialog: to Kelly.
speaker_heading: ANGLE KELLY
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hurry up!!
text: Suddenly about thirty feet away... we SEE fish breaking water.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!! Hank!!
text: The boat is zooming toward her. It arrives. As Keough and
text: Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Look out!!
text: And Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow. Keough
text: and Burke pull them both aboard.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (back to Kelly)
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I think. My hair.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Where's Hector?!
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We went in different directions.
dialog: That water is thick, you can't see
dialog: through it!
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector is swimming toward the surface. Suddenly... a shadow
text: looms over him. He looks up.
speaker_heading: HIS P.O.V.
text: There is no boat. We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass.
speaker_heading: RESUME HECTOR
text: He's scared.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (into headset)
dialog: Hector! Hector, we got dragged off
dialog: position, when you surface, you
dialog: gotta yell.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector is still charging toward the surface. The lack of
text: visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and
dialog: he wouldn't know it.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: There's bubbles over there! Look!
text: Keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated,
dialog: under--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: There he is. Here he comes!
text: And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface.
text: And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on
text: Hector as they lean over to rescue him. On the far right... two
text: eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers.
text: Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector,
text: Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see
text: Hector. If only he knew what he's not seeing. The eyes come
text: closer. They're now in the water right below Burke's head. How
text: can he not see it? A beat. Another beat. Then... suddenly, a
text: mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water--
text: snap. And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body
text: hangs over the boat. Kelly screams in horror.
text: In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone. OFF
text: their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET
text: Burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance. People move in
text: silence, the wake of tragedy. A few State Troopers are on the
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (giving a statement)
dialog: Nobody actually saw it. It
dialog: happened sudden.
text: PAN TO FIND Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a
text: phone call, approaches. He measures her expression, she's still
text: in shock.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You okay?
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: Kelly?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Nobody saw anything?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
dialog: (then)
text: U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That's probably good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Police want to keep it quiet, if
dialog: the press gets word... lake
dialog: monster. They just want us to sit
dialog: tight.
speaker_heading: ANGLE KELLY
text: She is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off
text: shock. Jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Um... y'know...
dialog: (swallows)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A man died. You don't have to be
dialog: so tough.
text: She nods, appreciatively. Part of her would love to collapse
text: into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm fine. I uh... I'm fine.
text: PAN TO FIND Keough, walking. Still visibly shaken. He
text: unwittingly approaches Hector. They hold a look.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (genuine)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Was he a good man?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Whenever somebody dies I consider
dialog: it such a waste that I didn't know
dialog: him better.
text: A beat. Then--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (fighting off disbelief;
dialog: shock maybe)
text: His head was just... bitten off.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I used to have this recurring
dialog: nightmare that I was headless.
text: Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly rattling it off)
text: I'd be on the ground looking up at
text: my body, no head, walking around
dialog: bumping into everything. And my
dialog: parents wouldn't let me in the
dialog: house 'cause they'd just bought all
dialog: these new antique lamps and they
dialog: were afraid I'd knock them over,
dialog: made sense, and meanwhile, the
dialog: neighborhood bullies would see my
text: round little head on the ground
text: looking like a ball, and they'd
dialog: come rushing over to start up a
dialog: game of soccer. I'd actually feel
dialog: grateful just for being allowed
dialog: into the contest, that's esteem for
dialog: you, what are your thoughts?
dialog: Keough has had enough of this guy.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (a powder keg)
dialog: You know, Hector, I'm sure you're
dialog: a fine person in your own mental
dialog: way. But I think it would be best
dialog: if you and I didn't speak.
text: And Keough heads off. He takes about four steps... then SNAP.
text: Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket. He's stepped in
text: Hector's spring-bow trap. A beat. He swings upside-down like
text: a pendulum. Another beat.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: This is a setback.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: You don't want to cut me down.
dialog: 'Cause I'll kill you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: Kelly and Jack.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hard to believe there could be a
dialog: monster under such peacefulness.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought I might track the
dialog: shoreline tomorrow, look for
dialog: prints.
text: She just stares out as if she didn't hear. And he fixes his own
text: stare on her. Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at
text: her, he diverts the stare. She feigns a non-reaction. A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You know they say the brain
text: confuses fear for passion.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: When you get scared, the brain
dialog: releases a chemical, same chemical
dialog: it releases when somebody's...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: in high school, the thing to do was
text: to take the girl to a scary movie.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm saying between the moonlight,
text: a beautiful lake and a monster that
dialog: bites heads off... you look good.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Gee, that was so poetic, Jack. I'm
dialog: all moist.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forgive me for trying to be nice.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Nice? Nice would be "you look
dialog: pretty," nice is not some man-
dialog: eating monster has tricked my brain
dialog: into making you look good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn't say it like that.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You did, you--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was trying to pay you a
dialog: compliment, I was guising it as
dialog: science 'cause I know you're
text: comfortable in that arena.
dialog: Science.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: A man just died, you're hitting on
dialog: me with science.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just forget it.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: Beg pardon? Sorry to intrude but
text: Hank seems to have gotten himself
text: stuck in a tree.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER
text: Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly,
text: and Jack approach.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I probably could've accomplished
dialog: freeing him myself but he had a
text: look of mayhem on his upside down
dialog: face.
text: They arrive. Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hank?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Yes.
text: The three exchange looks.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (calmly; almost sweet)
dialog: Other than feeling slightly
dialog: embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Could you cut me down?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Promise you won't kill me, first.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: I have no interest in ever looking
dialog: at you, Hector.
dialog: (again)
dialog: Could you please cut me down?
text: Jack gives Kelly a knife.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You cut, we'll hold him.
text: Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the
text: ground. He rises.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (calm)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I lied.
text: And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach. Keough
text: chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him. And
text: suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging
text: GROWL. An attack. Screams all over, a half-second of confusion
text: before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the
text: darkness, right at Hector. Hector dives out of its path.
text: Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs.
text: Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water
text: the giant jaws of a crocodile.
text: In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it,
text: slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.
text: The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
text: be one outcome here. In a matter of seconds, both bear and
text: crocodile have vanished. And the water is calm again.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE FACES
text: Utter catatonia. Shock. Whatever they expected to find in this
dialog: expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that. There are
text: no words here. Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.
text: What they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise
text: up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear. A beat. Then--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (admitting)
dialog: Okay. It's a crocodile. I'll
dialog: admit it.
text: A beat as they gulp air.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: You're cut.
text: There is a little blood over Jack's right eye. He dabs it.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: He was an Indo-pacific.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (daunted)
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Scales were oval. It was an Asian
dialog: crocodile.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Asia? How... how could he get
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong
text: flushed him down a toilet.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: He had to be thirty feet long.
text: Another beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (charged)
dialog: Hank. The little cannon you
dialog: brought, get it. Guard the
dialog: shoreline. Otherwise, we're done.
dialog: We made the I.D., our job is
dialog: finished.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Alright, Ms. Paleontologist. I
dialog: wanna know why that monster is
dialog: here. You got a theory?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why he's that big, I don't know.
dialog: Why he's here... the wetlands are
text: being developed, crocodiles are
dialog: moving. Australia, Fiji, the
dialog: things have started to cross
dialog: oceans.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But why Maine and why alone? Crocs
dialog: are social, why's this guy on the
dialog: move by himself?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Maybe he doesn't play well with
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Is everything a big fucking joke to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (re his groin)
dialog: Bite my bishop.
text: And Keough starts for him, but Jack intercedes.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'm sick of him!
speaker_heading: JACK HECTOR
dialog: (interceding) Let him go! I'm sick of you
dialog: C'mon. too, let him go.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Thing about being rich, Sheriff,
dialog: my parents had the added luxury of
dialog: being able to ditch me off at Karate
dialog: school, I'm a brown belt. So go
dialog: ahead. Take your best shot.
text: Keough throws a haymaker, decking Hector. Lays him out.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hank!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (who knew?)
dialog: He said he knew Karate!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: At school they'd always say "go"
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Get your big gun and guard the
dialog: shore. Hector. Go to your tent.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (muttering as he goes)
dialog: He never said "go".
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Get the gun.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (muttering as he goes)
dialog: If I fall into a hole or get
text: hoisted into a tree...
text: And he's gone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (re Keough and Hector)
dialog: Like little children.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah. I got some stuff for your
dialog: cut.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I couldn't believe... did you see
dialog: the size of that thing's mouth?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I wonder if he's some kind of
dialog: mutant.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That bear had to be surprised.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (taking her arm; ushering)
dialog: Let's get away from the shore.
text: She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self-
dialog: consious.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's okay.
text: They hold a look.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT
text: We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake. A
text: four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly
text: unpassable dirt road into the clearing.
speaker_heading: TOM (O.S.)
dialog: Told you I could make it.
text: As the jeep comes more INTO VIEW, we REVEAL its occupants to be
text: six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL,
text: ELLEN. They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk. As
text: they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from
text: the branch of a tree that overhangs the water.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: There it is.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (stripping)
dialog: Last one in's a dead man.
text: Could be more like first one in. The teenagers begin to strip
text: off their clothes. As they giggle and laugh we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KELLY'S TENT - NIGHT
text: Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very
text: close to him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ow. Shit.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Just gotta pull it a little
dialog: tighter.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who taught you be be a nurse?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Father's a surgeon. I can even
dialog: stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a
dialog: bad idea here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Keep it dry. No swimming.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Thank you.
text: They hold a look. Then --
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're having the best time of your
dialog: life, aren't you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (caught)
dialog: What? Why... people have been
dialog: killed, I hardly think I'm having
dialog: a good time, why would...
dialog: (off his look; copping)
dialog: Does it show?
text: Jack nods slightly.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the first time I've
dialog: actually... y'know been in the
dialog: middle of anything. I've never
dialog: really even gotten dirty before,
dialog: with me showers have always been
dialog: preventative.
text: Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and
text: nervous.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's why you're here. To get in
dialog: the middle of something?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Maybe. I've always read about
dialog: what's happened. I've never... I
dialog: know it sounds silly but, it's nice
dialog: to be someplace while something is
dialog: actually... y'know... happening.
text: Something is happening right now. A beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: We should probably go to bed.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Get rest, get some rest. Go to our
dialog: separate beds, get some rest.
text: The Freudian slip of her life. They hold another look. Then he
text: starts to exit. He stops at the door, turns back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks for the... bandaid.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (please don't go)
dialog: Night.
text: He holds another look, then leaves. OFF her punishing herself
dialog: for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment
dialog: short.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT
text: The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'
text: flirtatious time. As they splash and frolic and cop their
text: feels, we ANGLE... about fifty yards away. Two eyes pop above
text: the surface... followed by the snout. GO TO:
speaker_heading: THE CROC'S P.O.V.
text: Six fresh delicious teenagers. Midnight buffet.
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: the croc as he slowly starts to move. The teenagers start to
text: take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the
text: shoreline. As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long
text: rope... landing with a splash. About ten feet from the croc,
text: waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface. He could
dialog: easily go for Danny... but he somehow knows the service will get
text: better. As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the
dialog: rope.
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Here I come. Ready or not.
text: And she swings away... a better swing than Danny's... and she
text: splashes down about five feet from the eyes. Again, the eyes
text: don't move. The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing
text: as Tom takes hold of the rope.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: All or nothing, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: From the jaws of defeat...
text: And he flies away. It's a leap to die for. As he splashes
text: down... gulp. Like a seal grabbing a fish... and Tommy has
text: vanished. The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when
text: Tommy fails to resurface. A beat. They first think he's
text: playing a joke.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ha ha.
text: Another beat. Still no sign of Tommy.
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: (still in the water)
dialog: Tommy?
dialog: (then)
dialog: This isn't funny, Tommy.
text: And now they're concerned. They all move down toward the shore.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tommy?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: C'mon, Tommy.
text: And now they're starting to panic.
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: This isn't funny!!
text: Suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water. The crocodile, Tommy
text: in its jaws. Bloodcurdling screams from all as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
text: Hector and Keough both hear the screams of the teenagers.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: It came from across the lake.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
text: Keough, Jack, and Deputy Stevens are in the boat, zooming
text: towards the teenagers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: You said nobody came in here!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Obviously I was wrong!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
text: Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams
dialog: are on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JANINE
speaker_heading: JANINE
text: He just took him in his jaws.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT
text: The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on.
text: Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting
text: the water. Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy. Alive.
dialog: And basically unhurt!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He was in his mouth?!
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (stunned; to Tommy)
dialog: You're okay?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (in shock)
dialog: I think; just cuts.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: The thing just came up out of the
text: water and kind of spit him at us.
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: You should have signs posted, for
dialog: God's sake!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (examining him)
dialog: You're really okay?
text: Tommy nods. Then--
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I might need a Tetanus.
text: Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER
text: Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward
dialog: their tents.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Just spit him back out. Some shall
dialog: live, some shall die, arbitrarily,
dialog: sound like any higher power we
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: He didn't eat the kid cause he'd
text: just swallowed a bear.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Sobek. Half man, half croc, oldest
dialog: God--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'm tired, Hector. I know this
dialog: because you're beginning to not bug
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: That sounds good but underneath
dialog: it's hurtful.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Nightcap?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Raincheck.
text: They're growing on each other. Jack and Kelly exchange a smile.
text: Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost. They
text: continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well. Goodnight.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We seem to say goodnight a lot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We could not say it and...
dialog: (suddenly a coward)
dialog: Well, that thing is ambulatory if
dialog: you want somebody in your tent
dialog: to...
text: She smiles. Then:
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Night.
text: He holds another look. She goes into her tent. He stands
text: there. A beat. Waits to see if she calls him back. She
text: doesn't. He then heads off. Her head pops out. Watches him
text: go. Almost calls after him. Doesn't.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: We see the campsite, looking at it from the water. All is
text: still. After a beat. An eye blink. We are not looking at the
text: campsite. We are CLOSE ON an EYE, REFLECTING the campsite.
text: Another blink. Still another. We HEAR a slight SNARL. Then:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE
text: Hector and Deputy Gare, inside the chopper, lifting of, to
text: begin an early morning search.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE - (DIFFERENT PART OF THE LAKE) - SUNRISE
text: Kelly, Jack, Keough, and Stevens searching for tracks along the
text: wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore.
text: Their senses are very heightened. Keough has his cannon gun.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get back from the shore. We know
text: how fast he can leap out.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: We shouldn't even really be doing
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They won't be here till at least
dialog: noon. We got a few hours to kill.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: So does he.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (obsessing)
dialog: I'm gonna get ticks. I know it.
dialog: They're drawn to me. I got a thing
dialog: about ticks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Ssssh!
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I heard something.
text: He's staring at a brush thicket. After a beat, we HEAR a slight
text: RUSTLE. The guns go up quickly. A beat. Nothing. Jack bends
text: down, picks up a stone. Tosses it into the thicket. And out it
text: charges. Kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they
text: realize it's only a beaver. It scurries into the water.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (trying to gather herself)
dialog: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Look.
scene_heading: ANGLE A GIANT PAW PRINT

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: It happens when I land.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: Why are we landing?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: 'Cause this is the cove he

speaker_heading: GARE

dialog: Hector.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: KELLY

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not mushing it.
text: Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all

text: head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin.
text: She screams as they all jump back.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE HEAD
speaker_heading: RESUME

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That is it!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Really--
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No. I keep getting hit with heads!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (holding her shoulders)
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You calm down!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Calm down.
text: She takes a couple of calming breaths.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm being very calm. I'm composed.
dialog: This is the second time I've been
dialog: hit with a severed head, I'm
dialog: entitled to complain.
speaker_heading: STEVENS
dialog: (re the head)
dialog: Is that uh...
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I can't recognize him from the
text: back. It looks like him.
text: Keough takes a stick. Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head,
text: trying to turn it over.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE HEAD
text: It is Burke.
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: Keough leans in for a closer look.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: That's him.
dialog: (re something)
dialog: What the...?
text: Something appears to be in his mouth. Keough takes a small
text: twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I'm gonna puke.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: You gotta be kidding.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: THEIR P.O.V.

speaker_heading: RESUME

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What is she doing now?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Mother of God.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Look ten feet into the water.
speaker_heading: THEIR P.O.V.
text: There waiting... mouth fully open... is the fucking crocodile.
speaker_heading: RESUME

text: at each other, then back at the foregoing.
scene_heading: EXT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mrs. Bickerman, singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" is happily leading
text: the blinded cow to the shore. The cow, tentative, just allows
text: itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is. As Mrs.
text: Bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: Come and get it.
text: And with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump

speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: I haven't broken any laws.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (bordering on
dialog: condescension)
dialog: Oh, but you have, Ma'am. You lied
dialog: to us, that could be obstruction of
text: justice. A man's been killed in
dialog: part 'cause of your silence, I
dialog: could make out a charge of reckless
dialog: endangerment and I'm sure PETA
dialog: would be annoyed at how you treat
dialog: your cows.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: The reason I lied is if I'd told
dialog: you the truth, you'd just hunt it
text: down and kill it which seems to be
dialog: exactly what you're doing.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How long have you been feeding this
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: About six years. He first appeared
dialog: in May of nineteen-ninety-one.
dialog: Bernie was out fishing and it
dialog: followed him home. So we threw him
dialog: some scraps and well... he didn't
dialog: seem to bother anybody. He became
dialog: kind of like a pet who lived in the
dialog: wild.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He just appeared. You have no idea
dialog: how he arrived in this lake?
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: No. Do you?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Ma'am. Your husband, Bernie. You
dialog: didn't, by any chance, lead him to
dialog: the lake blindfolded?
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: (offended)
dialog: No, I did not.
dialog: (then)
text: The crocodile did kill him, though.
dialog: But it was all... it was a mistake.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: A mistake.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: One of our horses got loose two
dialog: years ago, went to the lake to
dialog: drink and... well the crocodile
dialog: started coming in, Bernie went to
dialog: intercede and... it was all a
dialog: terrible misunderstanding.
dialog: (then)
dialog: If I reported it, they would've
dialog: sent people to kill it.
text: Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.
dialog: Then--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Ma'am, how could you not report
dialog: this? He puts human life at risk
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: Nobody lives on this lake. it's
dialog: really his lake now.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
text: The chopper, free-floating, is drifting near a small cove.

speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: (getting panicked)
dialog: C'mon Hector. I know you're crazy
dialog: but you can't--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I need to see his habitat.
text: As he drops in.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: Please. I'll have sex with you,

speaker_heading: BICKERMAN

speaker_heading: GARE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: What problem?
speaker_heading: GARE (O.S.)
dialog: (through walkie-talkie)
dialog: He went swimming.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector is underwater, exploring.
text: ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER
text: Her radar is up, she heard something. But she doesn't see
text: anything. She scans the surface closely.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
text: The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims. Other than
text: the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing
text: extraordinary. Then, a flash shadow looms over him. He looks
text: up, but sees nothing. Probably just the sun ducking under a
text: cloud. It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head
text: for the surface. He swims upward.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector breaks the top. Lifts his mask, looks toward the
text: chopper, which he sees about forty yards out. He continues to
text: breaststroke on the surface. Suddenly... the croc's head rises
text: up right behind Hector, who's oblivious. He continues to swim.
text: The croc follows. Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets
text: a feeling he's being followed. He then turns to look the other
text: way, upon which his face goes rigid.
speaker_heading: HIS P.O.V.
text: About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ANGLE HECTOR
dialog: ashen.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Oh.... my.
text: The croc doesn't move. It just stares at him. Then end of his
text: snout is almost touching Hector. Hector himself doesn't dare
dialog: move, for fear of spooking the croc into action. We get the
dialog: idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling
text: any spiritual voids. A beat.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I suddenly feel a bit foolish.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You're different from the others.
text: The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout. And his
text: deadly smile. Hector just tries to tread water with as little
text: motion as possible. He deathly fears a quick movement will
text: cause his life to be over. Perhaps this is what he came for.
dialog: To be judged by this symbol of mythology.
text: He backswims ever so slightly. The croc pursues just as slowly,
text: their eyes are locked. He could snap off Hector's head in an
dialog: instant.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (terrified; trying to
dialog: convince himself)
text: Holy spirit of Sobek. Holy ghost.
dialog: (swallows)
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEA CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS
text: Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of
text: Hector. And her face freezes. Oh yes, there's the sign.
speaker_heading: HER P.O.V.
text: Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
text: slowly follows.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: Hector!!
text: We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice. As he continues
text: to slowly backswim.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (to Gare; forced calm)
dialog: Just turn the ignition, it's fuel
text: injected.
text: Gare turns the ignition, the ENGINE KICKS and DIES.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: Come on.
text: She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER.
speaker_heading: ANGLE HECTOR
text: The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
text: closer toward the chopper.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I know under the circumstances,
dialog: biting off my head might seem
dialog: viable. It would cheapen you.
text: But nothing's funny about this to Hector now. What he's staring
text: into is death. His own. Gare raises her rifle.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: I might get a shot.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (fear in his voice)
dialog: No. If you don't kill him
dialog: instantly, I'm dead and you'll only
dialog: kill him instantly if you get his
text: brain, which is about the size of
dialog: a cherry. And even if you were on
dialog: target, a bullet might not
text: penetrate his hide.
speaker_heading: ANGLE GARE
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: (re the croc)
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: (to Hector)
text: About twelve more yards. Keep
dialog: coming just like that.
speaker_heading: ANGLE HECTOR
text: craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
text: contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS. Hector quickly locks
text: eyes with him again.
speaker_heading: ANGLE GARE
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there
text: too. Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
text: it's impossible to discern why. The crocodile seems poised to
text: finish him. There's a slight GROWL.
text: And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an
text: EXPLOSION out of the water. it's an inflatable life vest and as
text: it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.
text: As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the
text: chopper. In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the
text: croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.
text: Hector's up on the chopper's ski.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Move over!!
text: The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws
text: snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two. Hector
text: dives into the chopper, screaming.
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: Go!!
text: She REVS the CHOPPER. The croc comes up again, chomping down on
text: one of the landing skis. Both Gare and Hector scream as the
text: whole helicopter is jerked mightily.
speaker_heading: GARE (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Go!!!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I'm trying!!!
text: The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
text: thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open. Gare
text: FIRES her REVOLVER. It might as well shoot BB's. The croc is
text: undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
text: and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: HECTOR
text: Bastard bit my chopper.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)

dialog: divine suicide?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Alright, Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No!
dialog: (back to Hector)
dialog: You might think they're Godly, you

speaker_heading: HECTOR

speaker_heading: KEOUGH

speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: You probably do want to be killed

dialog: your maker.
speaker_heading: HECTOR

scene_heading: INT. HECTOR'S TENT - A MINUTE LATER

speaker_heading: HECTOR

speaker_heading: KELLY

speaker_heading: HECTOR

speaker_heading: KELLY

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Nothing's real.

speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: With crocodiles... everything's
dialog: even.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm no psychiatrist. But I would
dialog: think there have to be better

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (pained)
dialog: I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has
dialog: robbed me of the dream in life, I

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, bullshit.

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Didn't even sound good?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (worth a try)
dialog: Eh. Fuck it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Can I tell them you won't go back
dialog: in the water?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Yes. You may. But maybe... I
dialog: don't know...
text: He has trouble saying it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Could we have intercourse?

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY
text: Jack and Keough are there to meet Kelly.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We might as well pack.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Good idea.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (O.S.)
dialog: They'll kill him.
text: They turn to see, Hector is standing there.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: They're not going to be able to
text: snag him in pitmans. Tranq him in
text: water, he drowns.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: They could try to tranq him on
dialog: land.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (knowing)
dialog: They won't. He's taken human life,
dialog: the mission will be to put him
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Gee, that would really disappoint
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Forget about him being God, he's
text: thirty feet long, he is a miracle
text: of nature, who somehow made his way
dialog: to Maine. This is a grand beast.
dialog: A grand dragon. An attempt should
dialog: at least be made to capture him
text: alive.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, you can try talking them into
dialog: that, if--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I have enough flaxedil with me to

dialog: way to--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Look. I know I'm crazy, but when
dialog: they come, they will kill it. They
dialog: have to, politically, he's too
dialog: dangerous, if something were to go
dialog: wrong... the odds are he will be
dialog: destroyed,--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Which is exactly Please, Hank, let me finish
dialog: what... I'm having a sane moment, this
text: is a window.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: If he were neutralized when they
dialog: got here... they might consider
text: saving him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And how would we neutralize him?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: We lure him on land and pump him
dialog: with the drugs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Jack. We've all seen it. He's
dialog: probably a hundred and fifty years
text: old, he's bigger than an elephant.
text: Hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So maybe Wildlife will try to save
dialog: him, they're more equipped to--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: We both know what they'll do.
text: Silence. Admission by silence. Then--
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Even if we could tranq him-- how
dialog: would we get him on land.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Other than to eat us?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
text: He follows anything that moves.
dialog: You guys can be in the trucks with
dialog: tranq guns. If he charges, drive
dialog: off, plus Hank you've got your hand-
dialog: held cannon. We could do this with
dialog: no safety risk. If it works, we
dialog: save a beast that should be saved.
text: A beat. They are sympathetic to the idea.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: They're coming right in.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Such a simple idea and it's
dialog: working. What does that tell you?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: That it's about to go wrong.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (into walkie talkie)
dialog: Almost here, Hector. Don't forget
dialog: to lift up the cow.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (O.S.)
dialog: (sarcastic, through walkie
dialog: talkie)
dialog: Thank you, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to the team)
dialog: You shoot on my order. If he
dialog: charges, I'll be yelling "go" which
dialog: means drivers take off. And drive
dialog: fast, they can move on land.
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: You set?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Don't worry about me.
text: Incredibly... the plan is working. A giant dragon is following
text: a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline.
text: Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore. The
text: big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank
dialog: steak. The time is now.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: We're in about four feet of water
dialog: now.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Little closer. Three, two, one...
text: The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping
text: at air. Hector pulls up with the chopper.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Fire!!
text: Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts.
text: But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to
text: swing like a pendulum. It rocks the chopper.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: The chopper is in trouble. The cow sways, the helicopter
text: struggles to stay airborne.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - ANGLE KELLY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Watch out!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Keep firing!
text: The men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS
text: Hector's having trouble righting his chopper.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Motherfucker.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS
text: Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping
text: off the cable.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shit!!
text: And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it. It
text: crashes into the lake.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hector!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: Take him.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I can't. I'll get Hector!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where is he?!
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We gotta get to Hector!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: Back us in a little, we need to get
dialog: a shot!
text: Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper. He looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to the Deputies)
text: Tranq guns down, rifles up!
text: The men switch guns, under--
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling to Hector)
dialog: Do not go in that water!
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: Back us in!!
text: As the pick-up backs closer to the shore--
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: If you get a safe shot...
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'll take it!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hector. Do not move.
text: The water is calm again. A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Gare)
dialog: You see anything?
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: (looking through binocs)
text: Nothing. Maybe he swam out.
text: Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging
text: the truck. Screams.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go!! Drive!!
text: The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off
text: balance. The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains
dialog: his balance.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Take him!!
text: And Keough blasts. It detonates the ground near the croc
text: causing him to surge airborne into the water. And he goes
text: under. Silence. A beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Did you get him?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (to the Driver)
dialog: Back the truck--
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: No!!!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hector, you see anything?
speaker_heading: ANGLE HECTOR
text: on the pontoon of his chopper. He's looking about, studying the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I just have this feeling
dialog: everything's totally safe.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I see blood. Maybe you got him,
dialog: Hank.
text: And as Hector looks further. Behind him... up surfaces the
text: crocodile in all his stealth. His head is two feet from Hector
dialog: and nobody knows it. Least of all Hector.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't see him, but this is
dialog: definitely blood. Maybe you got
dialog: him.
text: And as he turns back, he sees it. The croc comes up as Hector
text: screams, jumps off. Screams. Keough leaps off the truck and
text: charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give
dialog: Hector some cover.
text: Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper. He
dialog: climbs in.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Where is he?!
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I don't know!
text: No sooner said than the croc comes launching up. As he springs
text: toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other
text: side. The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin
text: and he becomes wedged. The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes
text: right through the chopper. He's not completely immobilized but
text: wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Hector!!
text: But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand. Hector surfaces again,
text: swimming for shore. Jack runs to help him onto land.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: (taking aim)
dialog: Alright. Game over.
text: But the croc looks feeble now. He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.
text: And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Should I?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
text: But there's no rage in his behavior now. He seems desperate.
text: He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two
text: ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I think the drugs are kicking in.
text: Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to
text: free himself from the mangled wreckage. As unbelievable as that
text: cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even
text: more astonishing, if not preposterous, now. A thirty foot
text: exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter. And he
dialog: just cannot go on anymore.
text: Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back. They approach with
text: caution. They all stare at the tired crocodile.
speaker_heading: ANGLE THE CROC
text: He's now looking back. Bleeding, gasping... beaten. In his
text: eyes... we can see it. The beast is beaten.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES
text: There's no triumph. In their eyes... sadness.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't think we really want to
text: wait for him to catch his breath.
text: It continues to breathe heavily.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He's through fighting. Look at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't care. Hank. End it.
text: Keough raises his cannon.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: No. Look. He's got nothing left.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah and every time we think
dialog: there's no more danger--
text: Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the
text: water, seizing Hector. Screams. It death rolls Hector, flings
text: him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
text: Keough blasts his Avenger. A direct hit.
text: It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing
text: into the air. It splashes down, the first head not to hit
dialog: Kelly.
text: They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore. He's
text: bleeding.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get him onto shore.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: He heeds a tourniquet.
text: Keough quickly peels off his shirt. Gives it to Kelly, who goes
dialog: to work.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Guess I finally got bit.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix
dialog: it.
text: A sudden ROAR. Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...
text: the big croc. Maybe his final roar, he looks weak. GASPING in
text: the crashed chopper. Jack and Keough approach.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (quietly; re the big croc)
text: He's done. He's dying.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't count on it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We better take him out.
text: But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at
dialog: them... nobody wants wants to take him out.
speaker_heading: ANGLE THE CROC
text: looking back at them. He knows he's in their hands now. He
dialog: knows.
scene_heading: ANGLE THE HUMANS
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (quiet)
text: Flax him under his tail. Two
text: hundred cc's. Under the tail,
dialog: that'll put him to sleep.
text: Upon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS. Florida Fish And Game,
text: U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank God.
text: OFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches.
text: Stares with utter disbelief.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We need to get it some medical
dialog: help.
dialog: (re Hector)
dialog: And him too.
text: By now the Florida army has moved in. They all stare with the
text: same suspended disbelief.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (explaining)
text: We trapped him with our chopper.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATER
text: A crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying
text: to free it from the wreckage. FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector,
text: on a stretcher. Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: We're gonna airvac him to Portland.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: That's where they're taking the
dialog: croc, Hector, they've got some big
dialog: tank there.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: He's gonna live?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah. Thanks to you.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: And Hank.
dialog: (to Keough)
dialog: I know you weren't really trying to
text: hit him.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I was aiming for you.
text: Hector smiles.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Thanks for the rescue.
text: Jack leans down.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You take care.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: You talk to Bickerman?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She didn't tell us about the other
dialog: croc 'cause she was afraid we'd
dialog: blow it's head off.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Women's intuition. Are there
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just those two.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: We gotta take him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: We got room for one.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well... I got stuff to pack up
dialog: and...
text: He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"--
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: (grudging)
dialog: I'll go.
text: Hector smiles. The Paramedics board Hector. Keough turns to
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: Thanks for your help.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You too.
dialog: Handshake. Respect. That's about as much affection as you get
text: from Keough. He then extends his hand to Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm sure this would offend you on
dialog: principal but... could we keep in
dialog: touch?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I guess.
text: And she kisses him on the cheek. Keough fights off his blush,
text: boards the chopper. As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You wanna ride in my truck?
speaker_heading: GARE
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: Your truck is jammed. Should we
dialog: take some stuff out?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, no, I'll be a while anyway.
dialog: I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You sure? I don't mind...
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, I actually want to stay for a
dialog: little while.
text: They hold a look. Then--
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll miss you most of all
dialog: scarecrow.
text: And she kisses his cheek.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I'm ever in New York...
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah.
text: They hold another look.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Y'know, if we didn't live in
dialog: separate worlds and...
dialog: (a beat)
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: But we do.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hey, we'll always have Maine.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It was... something meeting you.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Likewise.
text: He kisses her hand. Holds a look. Heads off.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DUSK
text: The tents are down, everything's packed. A couple trucks
text: remain. The croc is gone. Things are quiet. Kelly stands down
text: by the water, staring out.
speaker_heading: HER P.O.V.
text: Hypnotic beauty. The lake doesn't even ripple. She soaks it in
text: as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
text: this again. She HEARS every BIRD. Including a DISTANT LOON.
text: Serenity has returned. Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping
text: out, four, five, six skips. Kelly turns around. Jack stands
text: there. They hold a look.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought I should say goodbye to
dialog: the lake too.
text: He approaches. Takes her hand.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Different worlds, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, I thought about that as I was
dialog: driving... and... I haven't found
dialog: somebody in my world. You found
dialog: anyone in yours?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So I was thinking... maybe if I met
dialog: anybody in my world who was good
dialog: for you and if you know somebody in
dialog: New York good for me, we could fix
text: each other up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Worth a try. We don't wanna be
dialog: alone forever, do we?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Probably not.
text: They hold a look. He kisses her softly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That was... y'know if the guy asks
dialog: me can she kiss, now I'll be able
dialog: to tell him if you can.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Good thinking.
text: And they kiss again, this one escalates a little. They break.
text: And then he holds her. Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an
text: AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAINE TURNPIKE - AERIAL SHOT - DUSK
text: Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway. Behind
text: them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.
text: Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike. Rolling.
text: Rolling. Rolling along. It doesn't even look ridiculous.
dialog: We've become accustomed to such sights.
text: As we lift up higher and higher, Richie Havens' "I CAN SEE
text: CLEARLY NOW" RESUMES. Eventually, we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET
text: Jack and Kelly board his vehicle. They drive off, as we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BICKERMAN FARM - SUNSET
text: Daffy Mrs. Bickerman sits at the end of her dock, feet dangling
text: in the water. Throwing bread crumbs.
speaker_heading: BICKERMAN
dialog: Cute little Buttons. Mommy loves
dialog: you. Come eat your supper little
text: buttons. Nibble Mommy's toes.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
text: Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are
text: swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes.
dialog: OFF them, THEN happy Mrs. Bickerman, we:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
