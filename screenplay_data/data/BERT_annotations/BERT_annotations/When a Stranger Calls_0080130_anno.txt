speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT
text: A quiet upper-middle class neighborhood. The CAMERA is at
text: the curb, looking down the street. There are no sidewalks.
text: Trees arch overhead. CICADAS drone on the soundtrack.
text: The OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT, framed by the
text: trees on either side of the street. Footsteps are heard
text: approaching.
text: As the picture TITLE FADES, out of the dark emerges a GIRL
text: 17 years old, carrying schoolbooks. This is JILL. CAMERA
text: PANS with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a
text: house and stops.
text: Lights are on in the bottom half of the house, and the
text: curtains across the windows are open. A single light burns
text: in the upper right side of the house, presumable in a bedroom,
text: but the curtains in the room are drawn.
text: A scene TITLE appears on the lower half of the screen:
dialog: 8 pm Tuesday, March 23, 1971
text: The TITLE FADES, and Jill heads up the walk to the front
text: door of the house.
text: The light in the upper floor of the house is turned off.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - FRONT HALL
text: A middle-aged DOCTOR is standing at the foot of the stairs.
text: His WIFE is descending the stairs, putting on her earrings.
text: She is in an obvious hurry.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Where's the girl?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I only called her ten minutes ago --
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (passing into living
dialog: room)
dialog: I made our reservation for 8:15.
dialog: We're going to be late.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: Here she is now.
text: He crosses to the front door and opens it. The girl smiles
text: at him uncomfortably from outside.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Dr. Minakis?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets
dialog: it wrong the first time. You're Jill?
dialog: Come on in.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Thank you.
text: The wife comes back into the front hall.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I've written the number of the
text: restaurant on the notepad by the
dialog: phone.
dialog: (to Doctor)
dialog: Zip me up, will you please?
dialog: (to Jill)
dialog: If we aren't home in two hours, it
dialog: means we've decided to go on to a
dialog: movie and won't be back until after
dialog: midnight. Is that all right?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (helping wife on with
dialog: her coat)
dialog: I've told my service to pick up any
text: calls coming in to my office phone.
speaker_heading: WIFE
text: The children are asleep upstairs --
dialog: first door on your left at the top
dialog: of the landing. They're both just
dialog: getting over a cold -- so try not to
dialog: wake them.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Do you have any questions?
text: Jill shakes her head.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: We have to go now. We're late.
text: They cross to the front door and begin to exit.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Make yourself at home. The
text: refrigerator's loaded.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (pulling doctor through
dialog: the door)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: The doctor pokes his head back through the door.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We even have some low-fat yogurt.
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
dialog: Will you please come on!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Bye.
text: The doctor pulls the door shut behind him. Jill turns toward
text: the living room. Pause. She walks into the living room and
text: sets her books down on a table with the telephone on it.
text: O.S. we hear the car doors close, the engine start up, then
text: the car backing out the driveway and heading down the street.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
text: It is dark. O.S. we hear the phone in the living room being
text: lifted off its receiver, a dial tone, then a number is dialed.
text: Pause, then ringing. CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLIES from the dining
text: room, across the front hall and into the living room where
text: we see Jill talking over the phone to a girlfriend, NANCY.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Nancy?
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, Jill? How's it going?
dialog: (out of phone)
dialog: I got it, Dad!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Father!
dialog: (into phone again)
dialog: Jesus Christ! My father's in one of
dialog: his moods again. Male menopause, you
dialog: know. So how are you?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis'?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yeah, I've been here for about an
dialog: hour already.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Isn't it a neat house?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I guess... I haven't looked around
dialog: very much.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Did you see his kids?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, they were asleep when I got here.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: They're really cute. So what can I
dialog: do for you?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You didn't happen to talk to Billy
dialog: today, did you?
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, I talked to him.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Did he say anything about me?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know what you did to him, or
dialog: said to him, or what... but he's
dialog: really pissed off at you! What did
dialog: you do?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It's what I didn't do.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Yeah, I can imagine.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Do me a favor, Nance.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Do you think you'll be talking with
dialog: Billy some time tonight?
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Prabably. I'm going to the library
dialog: in a few minutes. I just have to get
dialog: out of this house!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over
dialog: there? He'll come along if I tell
dialog: him to.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That isn't what I had in mind.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: You'll be safe with Billy. I'll be
dialog: there. Come on.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Nancy, all you want to do is come
dialog: over here and get drunk.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Who? Me?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (mimicking)
dialog: Who? Me?
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: You want to see Billy, don't you?!
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I've got a lot of work to do. I don't
dialog: want you coming over!
text: Long pause.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: You know what your problem is, Jill,
dialog: is you're so straight. I really mean
dialog: that. You go to a private school,
dialog: you wear a bra. No one can have a
dialog: good time with you!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, Billy asked me to go out
dialog: with him this weekend, and I was
dialog: really really tempted because I like
dialog: Billy... a lot... as much as you do.
dialog: But I told him I couldn't, that I
dialog: didn't think it was right because
dialog: you were my friend --
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You are my friend.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Listen, just give Billy the number
dialog: here, but don't tell him I told you
dialog: to. Okay?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Okay. I've got to go now.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you.
speaker_heading: NANCY (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah. Bye.
text: Jill makes a face at the phone and hangs up. She tries to go
text: back to her homework, but she cannot.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Jill is working now, diligently. The phone rings. She picks
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello?
text: There is a brief pause; then the line goes dead and a dial
text: tone cuts in. Jill hangs up and goes back to work.
dialog: Pause.
text: The phone rings again. Jill picks it up.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Billy?...
text: A VOICE speaks on the other end of the phone.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Have you checked the children?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What?
text: The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and goes right
text: back to work.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Jill sits at the table as before, doing her homework, smoking
text: a cigarette. The phone rings. Jill picks it up.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Have you checked the children?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Mrs. Mandrakis?
text: The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and looks off
text: into space, thinking.
text: O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the
text: house. Jill hears it too. She stubs out her cigarette, gets
text: up from the table and walks out of the living room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Jill enters the hallway and pauses. Then she starts walking
text: slowly down the hall to the kitchen door.
text: Again the rattling noise O.S., only louder this time. Jill
text: stops dead, listens, then continues forward even more
dialog: cautiously.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: As Jill enters. She cannot find the lightswitch, so she stands
text: in the darkness listening. Again the rattle, very close now.
text: Jill turns her head sharply, then walks to the refrigerator
text: and opens it. It is only the automatic icemaker creating the
text: rattle.
text: Jill takes a piece of cake from the refrigerator and leaves
text: the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Jill is sitting at the table, polishing off the cake. Then,
text: the phone rings. Jill stands up quickly and picks up the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello!
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Have you checked the children?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Billy! I don't think this is very
dialog: funny!
text: Pause. "Billy" doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: ...Who is this?
text: The line goes dead. Jill stands frozen beside the table with
text: the phone in her hand as the dial tone gets louder and louder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner, pouring herself
text: a drink. She samples the alcohol, doesn't cough, and starts
text: to pour a little more into the glass.
text: The phone rings. Jill turns, then slowly walks to the table,
text: kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to
text: her ear. She waits and listens, a full three seconds. No
text: sound comes to her.
text: She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be
text: broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end.
text: Then, she shuffles through her books and papers on the table-
text: top until she finds the notepad the doctor's wife has left
text: for her with the name and phone number of the restaurant.
text: Jill picks up the phone and dials. After several rings...
speaker_heading: MAITRE D' (O.S.)
dialog: Golden Bull...
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr.
text: Mandrakis. This is his babysitter.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D' (O.S.)
dialog: Hold on a minute.
text: Jill waits for several seconds until the Maitre D' comes
text: back on the line.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D' (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MAITRE D' (O.S.)
text: Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant
dialog: about forty minutes ago.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Forty minutes?
speaker_heading: MAITRE D' (O.S.)
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
text: She hangs up, thinks for a moment, then picks up the phone
text: again and dials "O"...
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Operator...
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello, Operator? Can you get me the
dialog: police?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Is this an emergency?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, not really.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: The number is 555-9431. Would you
dialog: like me to connect you?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Please.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
text: Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello, I've been getting phone calls,
dialog: every fifteen minutes or so. I think
text: it's a man. He's trying to scare me.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: An anonymous caller?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Has he threatened you?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Has he been using obscene language?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No. He just keeps calling me.
text: Sometimes he doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: There's really nothing we can do
dialog: about it down here. Is the phone
dialog: listed in your name?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, I'm just the babysitter.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: It's probably just some weirdo. The
dialog: city's full of them. Believe it or
dialog: not, we get reports like this every
dialog: night. It's nothing to worry about.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Have you tried whistling?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: If you can find a good loud whistle
dialog: somewhere in the house, blow it into
text: the phone hard, next time he calls.
dialog: Probably break his eardrum. He won't
dialog: bother you after that.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, I... You're probably right. It's
dialog: nothing to worry about.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Or you could just take your phone
text: off the hook.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, the people I'm babysitting for
dialog: might try to reach me.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Well, as I say, there's nothing we
dialog: can really do to help you down here.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: You bet. Goodnight.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Jill hangs up. After thinking for a moment, she tries a couple
text: of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and
text: feeling foolish, she soon gives up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Jill is sitting in an armchair facing the TV set. The TV is
text: on, but she is bored. She runs through several channels,
text: then gets up and turns the TV off.
text: She looks around and moves aimlessly back to the table, but
text: O.S. a dog is barking and she is drawn to the window. A car
text: passes outside, its lights reflecting off the window and
text: Jill's face.
text: Then the phone rings. Jill moves quickly from the window to
text: the table and answers the phone.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Why haven't you checked the children?
text: Stunned, Jill hangs up the phone. She turns and goes slowly
text: back to the window. She pulls the shutters closed in front
text: of the window. Then she walks out of the living room.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL
text: Jill goes to the front door, turns the bolt and draws the
text: chain across the door. Then she starts to go upstairs.
text: The phone rings. She stops halfway up the stairs. She turns
text: and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone, but then
text: thinks better of it. She sits on the bottom step and lets
text: the phone ring and ring...
text: Finally, it stops. Jill gets up and heads into the living
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Jill goes to the table, picks up the phone and dials...
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
text: Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I called you before... about the man
dialog: who keeps calling me?
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: He called me again.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Did you try whistling?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, he's out there somewhere.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Out where?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: In the neighborhood. He's been
dialog: watching me... through the windows.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Did you see him?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No. I know he's there.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Is the house locked up?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: And the windows?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes. Everything.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Then you're safe. If he wanted to
dialog: break in, he wouldn't be calling
dialog: you.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Please, can't you help me? I'm all
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Tell you what. If this guy calls you
dialog: again --
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: He will call again! I know he will!
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, calm down now. I can alert the
dialog: phone company so that if he calls
dialog: again we can try to trace the call.
dialog: What's your number there?
speaker_heading: JILL
text: 555-0672.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: And the address?
speaker_heading: JILL
text: 3317 Oakridge Drive.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, yeah, I know where that is. All
dialog: right. If the guy calls again, try
dialog: to keep him on the line for at least
dialog: a minute so we can trace the call.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: But he never stays on that long!
text: Sometimes he hangs up after just a
text: couple of seconds.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: It's the only way we can help you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: By the way, what's your name?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Jill Johnson.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Jill, the important thing is to relax.
dialog: You're safe where you are. We've got
text: patrolmen cruising the area all night
dialog: long. Just stay calm. Will you do
dialog: that for me?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: In the meantime, we'll be watching
dialog: your line. Okay, Jill?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Call again if there's any problem.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Jill hangs up the phone and looks forlornly off into space.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Jill is sitting on the sofa, a drink in one hand, a cigarette
text: in the other. She is waiting. She sets her glass down, stubs
text: out the cigarette, leans back and sighs. She is very tense.
text: Then the phone rings. She rises from the sofa and slowly
text: crosses to the table. She sits down and picks up the phone.
text: During this conversation it becomes apparent that the VOICE
text: has a slight English accent.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: It's me.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I know. Who are you?
dialog: Pause. No answer.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I won't be here much longer. The
text: doctor and his wife are coming home
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Can you see me?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (turning toward the
dialog: window)
dialog: I'm sorry I turned the lights down.
dialog: It didn't work anyway. I can turn
dialog: them back up if you like --
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Don't?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've really scared me. Is that
dialog: what you wanted?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is that what you wanted?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Your blood... all over me.
text: Pause. Jill is terrified.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You don't know me. You don't know
dialog: who I am or where I live. I'll get
dialog: Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him
dialog: or the police.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: You've called the police?
text: Pause. Jill searches for some way of answering him.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I want to talk to you.
text: The line goes dead. Jill hangs up. She stands. She starts to
dialog: shake.
text: The phone rings and Jill snatches it up.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Leave me alone!
speaker_heading: SACKER (O.S.)
dialog: Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen
dialog: to me!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We've traced the call. It's coming
text: from within the house. A squad car's
dialog: on its way over there now... just
dialog: get out of that house!
text: Jill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds
text: go by. She doesn't move.
text: Then the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front
text: door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for
text: a second, then continues.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL
text: Jill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns
text: the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks
text: up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is
text: coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track.
text: Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens,
text: but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She
text: frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing
text: seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open.
text: Standing there on the other side of the door, is a police
text: Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some
text: twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several
text: patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their
text: domelights silently flashing.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Are the parents here yet?
speaker_heading: COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Christ!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What a homecoming!
speaker_heading: COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: They wanted to talk to someone. I
dialog: asked them to wait until you got
dialog: here. Come on in.
text: Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is
text: closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been
text: speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is
text: CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall
text: and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around
text: them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other
text: POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: We were only a block away when the
dialog: call went out. When we got here, the
text: guy was still waiting upstairs in
text: the children's bedroom. He was covered
dialog: with blood.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Blood?
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Not his own. The children had been
text: dead for several hours.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: GARBER
text: He'd been using an old phone in their
dialog: bedroom that the parents had never
dialog: had disconnected.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: We found a Merchant Seaman's card on
dialog: him. He's English. Entered the country
dialog: less than a week ago.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: How about the babysitter?
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: She's going to be all right.
text: As Garber delivers his final line, we see ambulance attendants
text: dressed in white, taking a sheet-covered stretcher out the
text: front door.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER AFTERNOON
text: An upper-class neighborhood. The CAMERA is facing down the
text: street. A car approaches the intersection at the end of the
text: block, turns and comes slowly up the street.
dialog: Because it is not a new car or an expensive car, and because
text: it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male
dialog: occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that
text: the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood.
text: The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into
text: the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the
text: front door.
text: A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen:
dialog: 4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978
text: As the TITLE FADES, the driver shuts off the car engine and
text: opens the door to get out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - DAY
text: The doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall,
text: goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John
text: Clifford, the detective from six years ago.
text: He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer,
text: his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder
text: with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an
text: uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe
dialog: occupation.
text: No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across
text: the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still
text: keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in
dialog: this new atmosphere.
text: The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme
text: of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings,
text: and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady
text: and reverent.
text: The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase
text: and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting
text: for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for Clifford
dialog: to enter.
text: Clifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be
text: an upstairs study.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - DAY
text: A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door.
text: Presumably he is the master of the house. Although his face
text: is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is
text: engaged in writing something down.
text: Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in
text: front of it. Then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the
text: house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the
text: pervasive stillness.
text: After a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen
text: and leans back in his chair. Pause.
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: So you're in business for yourself
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yes, sir, for the past three and a
dialog: half years.
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: That's good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's
dialog: escape?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: Do you think the police will... find
dialog: him?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I know they haven't assigned anyone
dialog: to it specifically. It's an old case.
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: (a tinge of bitterness)
dialog: An old case.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can you find him?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not
dialog: this week, but I'll find him.
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: He could be anywhere by now.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I don't think so... because he's a
dialog: foreigner. He'll come back to the
text: city. After six years in confinement,
dialog: it's the only place that's familiar
dialog: to him. That's important.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: MASTER
text: A man murders two children in cold
text: blood. A jury declares him insane.
dialog: How could such a person not be?
text: Clifford lowers his eyes, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: MASTER
text: He is sent to a state mental
dialog: institution where the security is...
text: less than perfect. And he escapes.
dialog: It... it isn't fair.
text: The master of the house leans way forward over his desk, and
text: his face comes out of the shadows and into the light. It is
dialog: Dr. Mandrakis.
text: He seems much older. His complexion is pallid. His eyes stare
text: out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a
text: dark cave.
speaker_heading: MANDRAKIS
dialog: A thing like that should never be
dialog: allowed to happen again.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I couldn't agree with you more.
text: They look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment.
text: Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh.
speaker_heading: MANDRAKIS
dialog: Go ahead then. My accountant will
dialog: contact you.
text: Clifford stands and they shake hands.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How is Mrs. Mandrakis?
speaker_heading: MANDRAKIS
dialog: She is... unable to have any more
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I'm sorry. Please give her my best.
speaker_heading: MANDRAKIS
dialog: Of course.
text: Clifford turns to go.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - STAIRCASE &amp; ENTRANCE HALL
text: As Clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out the
text: front door.
text: A WOMAN watches Clifford leave from the back of the staircase.
text: It is Mrs. Mandrakis. As with her husband, the change in her
text: is remarkable. She is now a brooding, barren woman.
text: O.S. the front door closes. Clifford is gone. Mrs. Mandrakis
text: walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly
text: ascending them.
text: The houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a
text: side door and watches her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A HALLWAY - MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY
text: A male PATIENT wearing green, institutional pajamas and
text: slippers shuffles slowly up the hall. His movement is
text: catatonic, unfocused.
text: Canned Musak faintly underscores the scene.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Curt Duncan isn't going to run right
dialog: out and kill more children. I'm not
dialog: worried about that.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLIFFORD
text: Standing in the doorway of an office, facing into the hall,
text: watching the patient.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: We had him for six years... under
dialog: continuous therapy, some of it rather
dialog: forceful...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PATIENT
text: Moving past CAMERA. He is really out of it. It is a
text: depressing, vaguely unnerving sight.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: ...and drugs... tranquilizers
dialog: depressants, lithium...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLIFFORD
text: He turns and goes back into the office.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: We see now the MAN who's been talking -- the director of the
text: State Hospital, DR. MONK. He is sitting comfortably behind
text: his desk; his jacket off, his tie loosened, his feet up on
text: the desk. He is very matter-of-fact.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Eventually, anyone will respond to
dialog: the treatment here.
text: Clifford sits down in front of the desk, picks up a folder
text: and leafs through it.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: You gave him electric shock?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Yeah, we zapped him a few times.
dialog: It's fairly standard.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: It says here thirty-eight... thirty-
dialog: eight times.
text: Monk shrugs, then yawns expansively. He needn't justify
text: himself to the layman.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: What will happen to him now, without
dialog: the drugs he was on?
text: DR. MONK'S SECRETARY enters the office and hands him a folder.
text: Without interrupting the delivery of his lines, Monk takes
text: the folder, opens it, initials something on the inside, closes
text: the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns and
text: leaves the office without uttering a word.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: There'll be some deterioration. That's
dialog: inevitable, but we can't say how
dialog: much.
text: Pause. Clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning his
text: casual assessment of "some deterioration."
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: During the time that you had him
dialog: here, did you discover any particular
dialog: habits of his, peculiarities, quirks,
dialog: anything that might help me find
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: (shrugging again)
text: It's all in the folder.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Any letters from people back in
dialog: England? Family?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
text: That, too, is in the folder.
text: Clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open folder,
text: then looks up again, his eyes narrowing.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Let's get something straight here,
dialog: Doctor. I've been 33 years in the
dialog: business of tracking people down and
dialog: putting them away. I spent almost a
dialog: year on Curt Duncan alone, with the
dialog: trial, the testimonies, the background
dialog: investigations. I didn't come here
dialog: today to look in your goddamn folders.
dialog: In fact, I wouldn't have come here
dialog: at all if you'd done your job right.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital,
dialog: not a penitentiary. Everything that
dialog: pertains to one of our patients is
dialog: meticulously recorded in that
dialog: patient's folder... whether you can
dialog: make sense of it or not.
text: They glare at each other for several seconds. Monk is the
text: first one to look away.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-
text: schizophrenic. They see themselves
dialog: as victims, and they always blame
dialog: other people for the way they are.
dialog: When Duncan killed the Mandrakis
dialog: kids, it wasn't an act of hostility
dialog: against the children but against
text: their parents. He was getting back
dialog: at his own parents for traumas he
dialog: suffered in early childhood. The
dialog: criminal side of Curt Duncan is one
text: of terrible, symbolic vengeance.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (looking up)
text: Assuming he isn't found right away...
dialog: what will happen to him?
text: Monk rises and walks to a window.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: I think you'll find him. Somebody
dialog: will find him. He can't function out
dialog: there. He'll make a mistake.
dialog: (turning to face
dialog: Clifford)
dialog: This is where he belongs. After six
dialog: years in here, he's suddenly gone
dialog: out to confront the world again. I
dialog: think he's in for a bit of a shock.
text: Monk looks back out the window.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: Not a terribly good section of town. We are looking at the
text: nondescript exterior of a bar across the street.
scene_heading: INT. BAR
text: This is not a slum bar, but it's close. There are a few tables
text: and chairs and a pool table in the back. The atmosphere is
text: quiet, almost depressed, and the handful of REGULARS here
text: are exercising their privacy without having to be alone.
text: They include: HANK, the bartender, also the owner, who
text: absently polishes things with his cloth; TRACY, an unemployed
text: woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar with a drink
text: and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current
text: feelings -- none of them new or particularly hopeful; a
text: COUPLE, probably retired, sitting at the same table they
dialog: come to every afternoon at this time -- him for his beer,
text: her for a glass of sweet white wine; and BILL, at the pool
text: table, a young man lithe and powerful, minding his own
text: business and playing his game of pool with a steady,
dialog: aggressive concentration.
speaker_heading: RETIRED MAN
dialog: Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Doin' all right.
text: The old man smiles stupidly around the room. He racked 'em
text: up a little in his day, too. His smile fades as he looks at
text: his wife. He takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories.
text: Then the door opens to the outside and the yellow-orange
text: light of late afternoon floods into the bar. The regulars
text: turn to glimpse who's coming in. They see the figure of a
text: MAN silhouetted in the doorway. He stands there for a long
text: moment, not coming in. Finally even Bill interrupts his game
text: to turn and look.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: C'mon in and shut the door.
text: The intruder enters, indecisively. The door swings shut behind
text: him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is "a
text: little weird", and the regulars continue to stare at him
text: until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits
text: down. Then everyone returns to his own thoughts.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: What'll it be?
dialog: (pause, no answer)
dialog: Hey! What'll it be?
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - INTRUDER
text: A bit startled, a bit defensive toward the directness of
text: this question. It is Curt Duncan. He looks understandably
text: harried. He hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of
text: days, and is wearing regular clothing.
text: He clears his throat to answer...
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD (O.S.)
dialog: What kind of clothes was he wearing...
dialog: when he escaped?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DR. MONK'S OFFICE -DAY
text: Clifford is looking through the folder again.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Ordinary street clothes. Not all of
dialog: our patients have to wear the green
dialog: Gucci gowns.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Did he have any money with him?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Probably. But not more than, say,
dialog: fifty dollars. Some of the patients
dialog: are given little jobs around the
dialog: ward, for which they are paid. It's
dialog: part of the rehabilitation.
text: Looking down, Clifford pauses over a page in the folder.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER
text: A page of legibly organized facts and statistics about Curt
text: Duncan. One of the entries reads: Guy du Marraux.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD (O.S.)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: What's Guy du Mar--
speaker_heading: DR. MONK (O.S.)
dialog: (pronouncing it
dialog: correctly)
text: Guy du Marraux syndrom.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
text: It's a psycho-motor dysfunction.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Duncan had it?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Only from time to time, which is
dialog: unusual.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: It attacks the nervous system. People
dialog: suffering from it are irresistibly
text: compelled to utter obscenities,
dialog: sometimes one, sometimes a whole
dialog: string of them. They can't control
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (somewhat taken aback)
dialog: Are you being serious?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example.
text: He opens a file cabinet drawer, finds a reel of quarter-inch
text: magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on
text: his desk.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Duncan never had the twitch that
dialog: sometimes goes with it. And with
dialog: Duncan, as I said, the disease would
dialog: only manifest itself in periods of
dialog: extreme anxiety. When he was really
dialog: flipping out, in other words.
text: There is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder and
text: Clifford looks back down at the folder.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Duncan was Catholic?
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So am I.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (mildly surprised)
dialog: That makes three of us.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Is that right? So we all share the
dialog: same guilt.
text: Clifford smiles. Monk keeps fiddling.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly
dialog: after he was admitted here in 1972.
text: Monk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits forward in
text: his chair to listen.
text: At first, nothing can be heard. Then there is a click as if
text: the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation:
speaker_heading: DR. MONK (O.S.)
dialog: -- to put the situation right. The
text: hypodermic needles are only used to
dialog: give you medication that will calm
dialog: you down. They make you feel good,
dialog: relaxed. All right?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: We're not putting anything in your
dialog: food either. The food is just food.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: (extremely agitated)
dialog: No. I don't eat the food. It doesn't
dialog: taste right.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK
dialog: (to Clifford)
dialog: That's Duncan.
text: Clifford nods and keeps listening:
speaker_heading: DR. MONK (O.S.)
dialog: Curt, why are you fidgeting? Can't
dialog: you get comfortable?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: No, I'm not comfortable!
speaker_heading: DR. MONK (O.S.)
dialog: Wait a -- Hey!
dialog: (to someone else)
dialog: Hold him down there. Grab him! Never
dialog: mind the chair!
text: There are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard,
text: heavy breathing and then, getting louder and more furious,
text: Duncan falling into the throes of Guy du Marraux.
speaker_heading: DR. MONK (O.S.)
dialog: (periodically
dialog: interjecting)
dialog: Pull him down... That's right...
dialog: Just lay him out... Lay him right
text: out... Steady... Pull out his knees...
text: Finally Monk is heard no more and Duncan continues with the
text: frightening verbal torrent of Guy du Marraux.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BAR - LATE AFTERNOON - CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: Sitting at his table inside the bar. He takes a long, noisy
text: drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks. It tastes
dialog: good, being the first real drink he's had in over six years.
text: But Duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully. His eyes
text: are ever restlessly, suspiciously moving about.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BAR
text: As Bill walks up and stands next to Tracy. Hank moves off to
dialog: get Bill another beer.
text: Tracy looks up at Bill and smiles. As regulars at the same
text: bar, they are loose and comfortable with each other.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: A little action for your game?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: What, him?
text: They both turn and look across the room at Duncan.
speaker_heading: POV - DUNCAN
text: As Bill and Tracy look straight at him over their shoulders
text: and then turn back.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BAR
text: As they both smile at her joke.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I wouldn't bet against you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's the matter? You don't like me
dialog: playing with myself?
text: Tracy grimaces as Hank comes back with Bill's beer. Bill
text: picks up the bottle, nods his thanks to Hank and heads back
text: to the pool table.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: As his eyes follow Bill to the pool table, then come back to
text: Tracy at the bar.
speaker_heading: POV - DUNCAN
text: Looking at the back of Tracy. She reaches into her purse.
speaker_heading: ON TRACY
text: She takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse. She pulls
text: out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her
dialog: lips.
text: O.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match. He shoves
text: it forward at her. It goes out.
text: Duncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him with
text: undisguised repulsion. Duncan gets the second match lit and
text: holds it out for her. She accepts the favor and lights her
dialog: cigarette.
text: Duncan smiles. Tracy nods and turns away. Duncan is still
text: holding the burning match for her to blow out. As it doesn't
text: look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the
dialog: floor.
scene_heading: REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER
text: He gives a look as if to say, "Jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo".
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY
text: Pause. Duncan is still smiling at her.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Hi.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: What you been up to?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (looking at him)
dialog: My own business.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thanks for the light. Okay?
text: The Englishman sits down beside her, but doesn't look at
dialog: her.
text: Tracy looks away too, determined to ignore him, not to let
text: him get into her space.
text: Duncan coughs. After a long moment, he turns back to her.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Next round's on me.
text: Tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead, acknowledging nothing.
dialog: Pause.
text: Duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the
text: bar, staring at her. Tracy turns to him:
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Listen, mister, I've got my own money.
dialog: So, if you don't mind...
text: She looks away again. Pause.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: After what I been through, I don't
dialog: mind anything.
dialog: Longer pause.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: See, that's the whole point. My
dialog: mind... Your mind... Where do they
dialog: fit in? You know what I mean?
text: Tracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the bar
text: away from him one seat, then another seat.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ELDERLY COUPLE
text: They are watching this little spectacle with growing
dialog: curiosity.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DUNCAN
text: Still looking at her. By pointing at what she has, he orders
text: two more drinks from the Bartender. When they arrive, he
text: takes a big swallow from one, picks up the other, stands,
text: moves down the bar and sits beside Tracy again.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (setting her drink
dialog: before her)
dialog: Do you live around here?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Get offa me!!
speaker_heading: REACTION SHOTS
text: Even Bill now looks up from the pool table. His expression
text: darkens.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BAR
text: Tracy has clammed up -- her elbows on the bar, head between
text: her elbows, arms covering her ears, hands clasped behind her
text: neck. Duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again:
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (rapidly)
dialog: Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I
dialog: don't live around here. See -- ?
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: I think the lady wants to be left
dialog: alone.
text: Duncan looks up. Bill enters the frame and stands in front
text: of Tracy, confronting Duncan.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: Looking up at Bill, his eyes red, his gaze unsteady.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: The air is charged with tension.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I think an apology is in order.
text: Duncan doesn't know how to handle this. He looks at Bill,
text: half shrugs, half smiles.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That the best you can do?
text: Duncan looks away. A long moment passes.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I think you'd better just move along,
dialog: pal.
text: Duncan doesn't move, says nothing. He swallows hard.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: He'll be okay now, Bill. He just --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No! I want him out of here!
text: The bartender steps back, deciding to mind his own business.
text: Tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further
text: down the bar.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: Go on, beat it.
text: They glare at each other. The longer Duncan sits there without
text: moving, without saying anything, the angrier Bill gets.
speaker_heading: REACTION SHOTS
text: As the tension builds.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BAR
text: Duncan looks away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm not going to say it again, mister.
text: Duncan reaches for his drink, but Bill reacts quicker. With
text: a swipe of his hand, he knocks the glass off the bar, and it
text: shatters on the floor behind the bar.
text: Duncan sits there, stunned, not looking up. After a long
text: moment, Duncan coughs. Then he turns and looks at Bill. He
text: purses his lips. It looks like a nervous facial movement.
text: Then suddenly, Duncan spits at Bill, hitting him square in
text: the face.
text: Before anyone can register what's happened, Bill lunges at
text: Duncan, knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the
dialog: floor.
text: The fight is fast, vicious and one-sided from the very start.
text: Pinned to the floor on his back, Duncan flails his arms
text: ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him in
text: place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his powerful
text: right arm, pumping up and down like a piston, pounds into
text: Duncan's face time and time again.
text: Duncan's screams diminish into pathetic, sickening groans
text: and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes
dialog: from this brutal spectacle.
text: Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing
text: a number. He turns away from the fight to talk.
text: Then, as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan, he leaps
text: to his feet and turns to the bar. He reaches over and grabs
text: the phone from Hank, slamming it down into the cradle.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who're you calling?
text: Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his
text: face off. He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles
text: on a shelf behind the bar. Hank quickly hands him a bottle.
text: Bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. He is still
text: charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid
text: succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself.
text: As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, Tracy
text: stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the
text: door behind her.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: You're welcome, baby!
text: Then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns
text: and, standing over Duncan's inert form, empties half the
text: bottle onto him. He sets the bottle back on the bar. He grabs
text: Duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and
text: throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap.
text: Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Hank)
dialog: Okay?
text: Hank just looks at him, doesn't answer. At the wife's silent
text: insistence, the elderly couple stand up to go.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh,
dialog: Bill?
text: Bill doesn't answer and the couple quietly leave.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: A fight breaks out, there's gonna be
dialog: damages. Insurance company doesn't
dialog: pay without a police report...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You see any damages?
text: Hank lowers his gaze to the floor. Bill finishes his drink.
text: He is still very hopped up. He pulls a few dollars from his
text: wallet and drops them on the counter.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: See ya 'round.
text: He turns and strides out of the bar.
text: CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty
text: establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police
text: calling back.
text: After several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No, it's over now...

dialog: into the lock...
text: Inside the house we can hear faint whispering. Someone is

speaker_heading: MAN

dialog: Donna. Donna! Hey!
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: What the hell -- !
text: Suddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out,
dialog: "SURPRISE!"
text: A broad smile breaks across the man's face. We may recognize
dialog: him as the cop from six years ago -- Charles Garber. Today
text: he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for

speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: (genuinely surprised)

text: crowd of GUESTS singing "Happy Birthday".
text: Everyone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside
text: her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm
text: around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her
dialog: tacky/plastic appearance.
text: When the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs
text: and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers.

scene_heading: INT. GARBER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
text: The party is still in full swing. Garber is following Clifford
text: up the stairs. They are both fairly loaded by now.
text: Garber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation
dialog: where standing still is pretty hard to do.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Will you tell me what this is about,
dialog: Cliff?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Yeah, in a minute.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: I don't think I can take any more of
dialog: these surprises.
scene_heading: INT. A BEDROOM
text: As Clifford and Garber enter. Garber turns on a light as
text: Clifford closes the door, shutting out the sounds of the
dialog: party below.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Okay now, what's the big deal?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Stand still. I want you to remember
dialog: this in the morning.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: If you want me to remember something
dialog: in the morning, then tell it to me
text: in the morning.
text: Garber half comically turns to go. Clifford stops him.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Charlie, come on.
text: ANGLE ON CORNER OF BEDROOM
text: A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib.
text: It opens its eyes and starts looking around.
speaker_heading: GARBER (O.S.)
dialog: All right, all right. What is it?
dialog: You're getting married.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: No. I got a job today, tracking
dialog: someone.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD &amp; GARBER
text: Garber, still moving restlessly, pats his friend on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll
dialog: find your man.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: It's Curt Duncan.
text: Garber stops suddenly, stunned. In an instant, he has become
dialog: stone sober.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: What?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BABY
text: Kicking and wiggling about.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD (O.S.)
dialog: You didn't know he got out?
text: The baby opens its mouth and starts to cry.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD &amp; GARBER
text: Garber glances over his shoulder at the baby, then turns
text: back to Clifford.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I need your cooperation on this one.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Sure. Anything.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: It is late. The block is virtually deserted. Across the street
text: is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in
text: earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be
text: near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down
text: the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause.
text: A car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a
text: woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to
text: the right and starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: He is standing in shadows across the street, watching her.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT
text: A series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains
text: consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING
text: with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up
text: her passing reflection in a darkened store window.
text: The impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is
text: following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we
dialog: know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle
text: from which we see Tracy is his POV.
dialog: But Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA
text: begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an
text: impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety.
text: Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump
text: out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes.
text: But he doesn't.
text: Finally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block
text: and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street
text: she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that
text: Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Tracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING
text: Tracy steps into the elevator. The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS
text: on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from
dialog: one to six.
text: O.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and
dialog: close.
scene_heading: INT. SIXTH FLOOR
text: Tracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to
text: her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends
text: over the lock to let herself in.
text: Behind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her,
text: starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open,
text: then turns and sees him. Duncan stops.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh, it's you!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (moving forward)
dialog: ...Came to apologize. I...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Look, I'm the one who should be sorry.
dialog: I didn't want that to happen.
text: (she sees his face;
dialog: shudders)
dialog: Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all
dialog: right.
text: Duncan half shrugs, half smiles. Tracy edges into her door-
text: way. Duncan stands opposite her.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I'm new in town. Don't know anybody...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Where're you from?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (coughs)
dialog: New York. Ever been there?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sure. Sure I've been there.
text: They look at each other. Duncan coughs again.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone
dialog: cold, unfriendly...
text: Inside Tracy's apartment, the telephone rings. Tracy turns
text: vaguely, indecisively, and goes to answer it.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She disappears into the apartment. O.S. she picks up the
text: ringing phone.
speaker_heading: TRACY (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?...
scene_heading: INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT
text: As she sits with the telephone.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: ...No, I just got in... I don't know
dialog: if I can... Listen, I can't talk
dialog: now. Can I call you back?... Okay...
dialog: Goodbye.
text: She hangs up the phone, stands and turns back toward the
text: door. Duncan is standing right behind her.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I'm not from New York, actually. But
dialog: I'm very, very far from home.
text: He sits down.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Look, you can't come in here.
text: Duncan looks at her for a moment, then looks about the
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: I thought we might get some coffee.
dialog: Can I buy you -- ?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Someplace nearby?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Not tonight. You'd better go.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I got no place to go.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: You can't --
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Just, just a little coffee?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Maybe tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Okay, tomorrow. When?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I said maybe. I don't know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen, I'm sorry about this
dialog: afternoon. I really am. All right?
dialog: That was my boyfriend on the phone.
dialog: He's coming over. So please leave.
dialog: Now.
text: Duncan doesn't move. He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I like you.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (her voice rising)
dialog: Look, do you want me to call the
dialog: cops?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (standing)
dialog: It's okay. It's okay.
text: He backs to the doorway and pauses.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I'll see you later... sometime. I
dialog: still want to buy you that drink.
text: He steps into the hall. Tracy closes the front door and bolts
text: it. She turns, leans against it and sighs.
text: Outside the door, Duncan's footsteps move down the hall,
text: pause, then come back to the door. A moment passes. Then
text: there is a faint knocking on the door. Tracy doesn't move.
text: The knocking comes again, a little louder this time. Tracy
text: stands and waits, scarcely breathing. After another long
text: moment, the footsteps finally move away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Three years is a long time in a place

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Three and a half.
text: Garber stops at the WATCH COMMANDER'S desk and picks up some
text: paperwork. The WC looks up briefly and sees Clifford.
speaker_heading: WC
dialog: Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'?
text: The WC looks down again. Three and a half years mean nothing
text: to him.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Hi...
text: He can't remember the man's name. Garber smiles at him and
text: they continue walking.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: How long will you be here?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Depends on how lucky I get.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll only be coming around once,
dialog: maybe twice a week.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: You want to use your old desk?
dialog: Someplace to sit down?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

dialog: Is it vacant?
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - POLICE STATION
text: A. Clifford and Garber appear in the doorway. Clifford enters,

scene_heading: CLOSEUP - BACK OF PICTURE

text: Clifford looks up from the pad to a bar he has pulled up in

text: Clifford has just underlined. Clifford gets out of his car

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
text: There are only a few CUSTOMERS sitting around, waiting for

text: A MAINTENANCE MAN in grey work clothes enters from the back.
text: He opens a broom closet, takes out a bucket and mop and rolls
text: them toward the front of the laundromat. He stops at Cheater's
text: table and shakes him hard.
speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN
dialog: Okay, man, move it out. Let's go.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: Wha -- ?
text: Cheater sits up and starts to pull himself together. An OLD
text: WOMAN sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles
dialog: of washing machines and says to the maintenance man:
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: There's another one down there.
text: The maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks
text: down into the nook created by the absence of one of the
dialog: washing machines.
speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN
dialog: Hey!
text: He nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot.
speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN

dialog: Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake --
dialog: Jesus Christ! What happened to you?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON NOOK

speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN (O.S.)
dialog: You get hit by a truck or what?

speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN
dialog: I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay

dialog: Okay?

speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN
dialog: God bless it! Hey!

speaker_heading: MAINTENANCE MAN

scene_heading: EXT. LAUNDROMAT

speaker_heading: CHEATER

dialog: All right! All right!
text: He straightens his rags indignantly, then looks at Duncan

speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a
dialog: bone. You got any money?
text: Duncan looks at Cheater distrustfully and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: You neither, huh?
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P.

scene_heading: INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I've got nothing to say about anything

dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD (O.S.)
dialog: Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty
text: minutes with a search warrant and a
dialog: handful of cops, and I can probably
dialog: have you arrested, whether or not
dialog: the charges would stick. Now do you
dialog: want to let me in and talk?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Have you got a badge?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD (O.S.)
dialog: I'll show you a badge when you open
dialog: the goddamn door!
text: Tracy unbolts the door and opens it. Clifford walks right in
text: and closes the door behind him.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a
dialog: license, a piece of paper, and I
dialog: left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller?
text: Tracy nods.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Can we sit down?
text: Tracy leads him into the living room. They sit. Clifford
text: gives her a picture.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Do you recognize this man?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Why?
text: Clifford lets out a sigh of frustration, realizing that this
dialog: woman will continue to be difficult.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
text: He's escaped from the insane asylum.
dialog: In 1972, he murdered two children...
dialog: broke into a house and found them
text: asleep in bed. It was a little boy,
dialog: five an a half, and a little three-
text: year-old girl. After the coroner's
dialog: investigation, their bodies were
text: taken to the mortuary, where the
dialog: undertaker took one look at them and
dialog: said he couldn't have their bodies
dialog: reconstructed for the funeral without
dialog: six days of steady work. Then he
dialog: asked what had been the murder weapon,
text: because looking at the mess in front
dialog: of him, he couldn't imagine what had
dialog: been used. The coroner told him there
dialog: had been no murder weapon. The killer
dialog: had used only his hands.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The undertaker went to work and had
dialog: them done in four.
text: The picture falls out of Tracy's hands. She is stunned to
dialog: the point of nausea.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD (O.S.)

speaker_heading: TRACY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: No.
text: Pause. Clifford sits down.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I'm going to kill him, Charlie.
text: Garber leans forward in his chair and stares at Clifford. A
text: long moment passes. A button on the lieutenant's phone lights
text: up and the intercom buzzes. Garber doesn't even look down at
text: it. The button flashes on and off, on and off. Finally it
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: The closer I get to this guy, the
dialog: more I... It gets to me. I don't
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: I think you'd better go on home,
dialog: Cliff. You've fallen in.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: No. Not this time. This is the case
dialog: that makes up for a whole career. If
dialog: you can't understand it now, you
dialog: will in a few years.
text: Pause. Garber considers another tack and follows it.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: What part does money play in all
dialog: this? Play straight with me.
text: Clifford is stunned by the question, but he tries to be
dialog: casual.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

dialog: For what I'm being paid, it's not

speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Who's hired you for this?

speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: (cynically)
dialog: So you're a hitman now.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (passionately)
text: He murdered two kids in cold blood.
dialog: You were there, too.

speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: You could get busted.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I understand that.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: What are you going to use?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

dialog: at least.
speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: You're stretching our friendship,
dialog: Cliff. If you blow this at all --
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: You'll never hear from me again.

speaker_heading: GARBER
dialog: Take your time. Do it right.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

speaker_heading: GARBER

scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: What happened to you?

speaker_heading: DUNCAN

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay, buster, one cup. On the house.
text: She pushes the cup back to him. Some of the coffee spills

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Drink it and be on your way.

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You're welcome.

text: slowly rises from his seat.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Duncan and the waitress stand face to face, shooting darts

text: over and places a quarter on the counter between them.
text: The waitress looks at the man irritatedly, then picks up the

speaker_heading: CHEATER

dialog: Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy,
dialog: not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad.
dialog: Crazy Curt, huh?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Where?
text: Cheater scratches his head, and glances anxiously down the
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see
dialog: him again though. Tell you what. You
dialog: leave the money with me, I'll see he
dialog: gets it... as a favor to you.
text: Clifford shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I have to talk to him.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: Whatsa matter? You don't trust me?
dialog: I'll have you know I used to be a
dialog: college professor. We can work
dialog: together.
text: Clifford stands to go. The bottle comes back to Cheater,
text: three-quarters down.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: "Long life to the grape! For when
dialog: summer is flown, The age of our nectar
dialog: Shall gladden our own." That's
dialog: Shelley, you know.
text: Clifford is gone. Cheater takes a long drink and almost
dialog: forgets that Clifford was ever there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Clifford is "suiting up" for his night's work. He is dressed
text: casually -- blue jeans, shirt open at the neck, sports jacket,
text: Adidas running shoes. He looks at himself in the mirror, is
text: satisfied. Then he picks up from the dresser two awl-like
text: instruments with short handles and long, glistening tapered
text: needlepoints -- his weapons. He slides them into a leather
text: sheath inside his jacket and turns to go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - NIGHT
text: It is lit up inside. The bar is open for business. Across
text: the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is
text: waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. BAR
text: The place is empty but for Hank who half watches the
text: television over the bar, and Tracy who sits alone in a corner.
text: Several moments pass as both of them sit and wait.
text: Then, the front door starts to swing open. Someone is coming
text: in. Tracy and Hank both glance nervously toward the door.
text: A MAN'S head peeks in. He is somewhere in his forties, a
dialog: regular customer.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Hey, Hank, what're you doing open
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (relaxing)
text: Trying to make a buck.
text: The customer walks up to the bar, sits down and talks quietly
dialog: with Hank.
text: Tracy looks nervously at her wristwatch. She stubs out her
text: cigarette, takes one last gulp of her drink and stands up to
dialog: go.
text: She walks to the bar, opens her purse and reaches inside.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Keep it, honey. My treat.
text: They exchange a meaningful look. Then she heads for the door.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: That how you make a buck?
scene_heading: EXT. BAR
text: Tracy looks up and down the street, hoping to see Clifford
text: somewhere, afraid of glimpsing Duncan instead. Then she starts
text: walking quickly homeward.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS
text: Following Tracy to her apartment. We pick up Clifford now,
text: and we cut back and forth between the two of them -- her
text: walking quickly, never looking back, and him sneaking along
text: several hundred feet behind her, looking everywhere for
dialog: Duncan, whom we never see.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACY'S APARTMENT
text: She walks up the steps and enters.
scene_heading: INT. SIXTH FLOOR
text: Tracy steps off the elevator and goes to her door. She fumbles
text: through her purse for the key. Then she hears footsteps on
text: the stairs. She turns. It's Clifford.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (coming forward: half-
dialog: whispering)
dialog: No luck. You see him?
text: Tracy shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
text: He still could be out there, though.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Oh, God...
text: She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on
dialog: Clifford for support.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Are you all right?
text: Tracy stands there for several seconds to regain control of
text: herself. Then she steps away and turns back to the door.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I'm going to hang around outside for
dialog: awhile. I'll be back on and off again
dialog: all night.
text: Tracy gets the door unlocked. She pushes it open.
scene_heading: INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL
text: Tracy steps in. Clifford stays in the doorway. They are still
text: whispering.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Are you sure you're okay?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: All right. Bolt your door. Don't let
dialog: anybody in, no matter what.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I'll be seeing you.
dialog: (starts to move off;
dialog: comes back)
dialog: Listen. Thanks.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sure.
text: Tracy closes the door and throws the bolt. Then she walks
text: into the apartment and out of frame. CAMERA STAYS in the
text: hallway. We can hear Tracy moving about O.S.
text: Then, as if on its own, the door to the hall closet slowly
text: swings open...
text: ...until we can see Duncan standing inside the closet.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Tracy is putting some coffee on. Then she removes her coat
text: and walks out of the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL
text: Tracy goes up to the closet with her coat. The door is closed.
text: She opens it. She hangs up her coat and closes the door again.
text: Then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the
dialog: living room.
text: As she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks
text: right into Duncan. She barely has time to gasp before he
text: clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (urgent whisper)
dialog: I just have to talk to you.
dialog: (pathetically)
dialog: I want you to be my friend.
text: As she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Please...
text: He takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and
text: slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a
text: breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams.
text: Duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy
text: doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Tracy's screams carry out into the night as Clifford races
text: across the street and into the apartment building.
scene_heading: INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT
text: Duncan runs to a window, throws it open and climbs out onto
text: the fire escape.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - APARTMENT STAIRS AND FIRE ESCAPE
text: As Clifford bounds up the stairs, flight after flight, and
text: Duncan tears down the fire escape.
scene_heading: INT. SIXTH FLOOR
text: The screaming has stopped when Clifford reaches Tracy's door.
text: He grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door.
text: It's bolted shut.
text: Clifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers
text: it into the lock. The bolt springs and Clifford runs into
dialog: the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT
text: As Clifford bursts in. Tracy gestures toward the window.
text: Clifford runs to it and sticks his head out.
speaker_heading: POV - CLIFFORD
text: Duncan is gone.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Clifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto
dialog: the street.
speaker_heading: POV - CLIFFORD
text: No sign of the Englishman.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Clifford runs out of the apartment, yanking his needle from
text: the lock as he passes the door, and charges back down the
dialog: stairs.
text: Tracy moves to the door and closes it. She is breathing
dialog: heavily.
text: O.S. we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the
text: hot stove, as Tracy goes to get it.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING
text: Clifford comes out, looks around and moves rapidly up the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET
text: Duncan is hurrying along, dodging in and out of people, trying
dialog: to move quickly but not draw attention to himself...
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET
text: Clifford is travelling along the sidewalk, crossing the
text: street, looking everywhere...
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY
text: Duncan is running up the alley. He comes to a stop beside
text: some piled up trash cans. He leans against the brick wall of
text: the building, huffing and puffing. He is frightened, but he
text: feels safe for now. He slowly slides down the wall to the
dialog: ground...
scene_heading: FLASH BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Duncan is curled up in the corner of a bare cell with padded
text: walls. He is in a strait-jacket. His head is shaved. We can't
text: tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply
text: frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. A ROOM - NIGHT
text: This is the children's bedroom in Dr. Mandrakis' house of
text: six years ago. It is dark. Two small beds occupy one corner
text: of the room. We can see two small lumps on the beds, but no
dialog: more.
text: Duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap.
text: He is dialing a number. The phone rings three times before
text: it is answered -- or rather, picked up, because there is no
text: voice on the other end. After several seconds the phone is
dialog: hung up.
text: Duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment. He picks up the
text: phone and dials again. This time he gets a busy signal. He
text: hangs up, stands and goes to the door. He opens it slowly,
text: peers out. Jill's voice can be heard faintly talking to the
text: operator, asking for the police.
text: Duncan closes the door and comes back into the room, mumbling.
text: He goes to the window, looks out. Then he goes to the
dialog: children's beds.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: As he raises the covers and stares down into the CAMERA.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DECK OF A SHIP - MORNING
text: A freighter, broad and low, arduously cuts through the water.
text: Early morning mist hangs over the deck which is empty but
text: for a lone FIGURE standing on the prow.
scene_heading: MIDDLE SHOT - LONE FIGURE
text: It is Curt Duncan. He is looking out over the front of the
text: ship. Another SEAMAN comes up behind him and claps him on
text: the shoulder.
speaker_heading: SEAMAN
dialog: So this will be your first time?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: An old salt like you?
text: Duncan moves away, wanting to be left alone.
speaker_heading: SEAMAN
dialog: (still laughing;
dialog: slightly punchy)
dialog: You'll love it here. It's where they
dialog: make the bombs. It's where they make
dialog: the planes that carry the bombs; the
dialog: planes we saw over Singapore and
dialog: Manila.
text: He walks away laughing.
speaker_heading: SEAMAN
dialog: There she is. That's America.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN'S POV
text: The coast of Southern California emerges through the mist. A
text: foghorn blows somewhere in the distance.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP - DUNCAN
text: As he peers ahead with inscrutable interest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dark. A little BOY is lying in bed, apparently asleep. This
text: is Curt Duncan as a child.
text: Some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom.
text: They are gruff, with heavy English accents, but subdued; a
text: MAN and a WOMAN, well into middle-age.
text: The boy's eyes open as he listens:
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Save it for later. Let's go out and
dialog: get some food.
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: What about the lad? You can't leave
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Curt's asleep. He'll never know we're
dialog: gone.
text: From outside, a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and
text: turns. The bolt slips and the door is securely shut.
text: The boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. In TIGHT SHOTS of the
text: floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another.
text: They make "chit-chit" noises as they begin to explore. One
text: of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the
text: bedpost. Then we see two more rats appear.
text: We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed. The
text: "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's
text: apprehension turns to fear, then to terror. The boy starts
text: to whimper.
text: Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room. The floor
text: is crawling with rats, hundreds of them. The "chit-chit"
text: rises to practically a roar as the boy, alone on top of the
text: bed, begins to wail.
text: The room seems to darken, and the boy becomes just a little
text: white speck in it. The focus is turned. The picture becomes
text: a black and white blur.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - THE PRESENT
text: At first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black
text: screen. The previous sound of a boy crying increases. Then
text: the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire
text: screen image moves toward normal definition. Finally, we
text: know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that
text: the white blur is actually a little BOY lost, sobbing
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: Awakening to the scene, coming back to reality. He is
dialog: confused.
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE ON DUNCAN AND BOY
text: The boy continues sobbing, moving about in little circles.
text: Duncan, amazed at what he sees, slowly crawls out from the
text: wall on his hands and knees, crawls toward the weeping child,
text: staring at it with a strange look on his face.
text: Suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at Duncan quizzically,
text: hesitantly. They are less than a foot apart, almost face to
text: face. Together they form a kind of frozen tableau. Something
text: close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the
text: boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition.
text: Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he
text: runs off down the alleyway. Duncan watches him disappear.
text: Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Clifford is coming up the sidewalk. As Clifford crosses the
text: entrance to an alleyway, the boy comes running out and almost
text: collides with him. Clifford grabs the boy and looks down at
text: him. Then he passes the wailing child off on a nearby
text: PEDESTRIAN and runs up into the alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET
text: Duncan is hurrying along the sidewalk. Something makes him
dialog: look up.
speaker_heading: POV - DUNCAN
text: He is looking at a neon "Jesus Saves" sign above the doorway
text: to an inner city mission.
scene_heading: BACK ON DUNCAN
text: As he stares at the sign.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Crazy Curt!
text: Duncan turns to see Cheater elatedly hobbling up to him.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: Hail fellow well met, and all that
dialog: jazz. It's our lucky day!
dialog: (taking Duncan by the
dialog: arm)
dialog: A friend of your's got money for
dialog: you. We got to get back to the park
dialog: and meet him.
text: Duncan pulls his arm free.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy
dialog: Curt. S'got some money.
dialog: (reaching for Duncan's
dialog: arm)
dialog: We'll get us a little joy juice.
text: Duncan pulls free again and heads toward the mission.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy!
dialog: C'mon!
text: Duncan enters the mission and Cheater stands out on the
text: sidewalk for a moment, bitterly frustrated.
speaker_heading: CHEATER
dialog: "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!
dialog: Rage! Blow, you cataracts and
dialog: hurricanoes, spout till you have
dialog: drench'd our steeples and drown'd
dialog: the cocks!"
text: Several PEDESTRIANS stop and gape at this sudden outburst.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET
text: Clifford comes out of a derelict hotel, looks up and down
text: the street and hurries off, not giving up the chase.
scene_heading: INT. MISSION - MOMENTS LATER
text: A MAN is leading Duncan to the bathroom. Duncan enters slowly
text: and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old
text: razor blade and a can of shaving cream. Duncan picks up the
text: razor for a moment and looks at it. He is lost in thought.
text: Then he sets it down and turns on the tap water.
text: He glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed
text: by his own image. He looks deeply into the mirror for several
text: seconds. Then he starts to cry, and having begun, a flood of
text: emotions comes pouring out of him. He drops to his knees.
text: The man comes running back into the bathroom. He holds Duncan
text: and helps pull him back to his feet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Cheater is trudging along the sidewalk, hands in pockets,
text: head lowered. He looks up and sees something that brings him
text: back to life.
speaker_heading: POV - CHEATER
text: Clifford is standing on the corner up ahead, looking around.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE ON STREET
text: Cheater calls out and starts to run toward Clifford.
text: Clifford turns, sees Cheater.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MISSION - NIGHT
text: The "sleeping dorm". It is a large empty room. Thirty or so
text: OUTCASTS are stretched out on the bare floor in the darkness.
text: Their combined snoring/wheezing creates a steady, ghastly
dialog: din.
text: The door at the far end of the hall opens. A figure steps in
text: and quietly closes the door behind him. He stands for a moment
text: taking in the scene, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness.
text: Then he slowly creeps forward to the prone body of the nearest
dialog: sleeper.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - FIGURE
text: It is Clifford. He moves stealthily from one body to the
text: next. In one hand he carries a small flashlight. He turns
text: the bodies over just long enough to shine the light in their
text: faces and identify who they are, or rather who they are not.
text: Then he moves on. In his other hand he holds a small, gleaming
dialog: Jimmy needle.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger.
text: He turns over and sees the dark figure of Clifford slowly
text: advancing toward him.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Clifford keeps coming, closer and closer to where Duncan
text: lies. He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps
text: up suddenly and bolts for the door.
text: Clifford looks up, sees the fleeing figure and charges after
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDORS
text: Racing through a maze of narrow hallways, Duncan can't stop
text: to think where he's going. Clifford is barreling after him
text: some forty yards behind.
text: Duncan rounds a corner and ten yards up ahead, the hallway
text: deadends in a set of double doors. Duncan has no choice but
text: to hurl himself against the doors. They yield and he goes
dialog: through them.
text: Four seconds later, Clifford comes to the same doors and
text: pushes through to the other side.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH
text: As Clifford comes through the doors which are a side entrance
text: into the chancel of this large, gothic-style church. Behind
text: him now, is the altar. Before him stretches the nave of the
text: edifice with its rows of pews, its dimly glowing stained
text: glass windows, and way in the back, its choir loft. At regular
text: intervals, tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on
text: high.
text: There is no sign of Duncan, but Clifford knows he must be in
text: here, hiding somewhere. He slowly walks forward to the front
dialog: of the chancel.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come
dialog: on out.
text: Pause. Duncan doesn't come out. Clifford holds very still.
text: He hears nothing. He speaks again and his voice echoes through
text: the large empty church.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: My name's John Clifford. I'm a private
dialog: detective. I've been hired by
dialog: Alexander Mandrakis to take you back.
dialog: I'm not going to hurt you.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DUNCAN
text: Hiding beneath a pew. He hears the name "Mandrakis" and it
text: registers like a thunderbolt. He silently mouths the name
dialog: "Mandrakis".
text: Then he hears Clifford's footsteps approaching.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLIFFORD
text: Slowly moving up the center aisle, looking from side to side
text: into the pews.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: (gently; coaxing)
dialog: I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not
dialog: going to hurt you... There'll be no
dialog: more pain... You're safe now...
text: Clifford moves closer and closer to Duncan's row until
text: finally, Duncan can bear it no longer. He jumps up from
text: beneath the pew and runs.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: No! Mandrakis! No!
text: Clifford chases him through the pews and up the aisles to
text: the front of the church. He is clutching a needle in both
text: hands, ready to strike.
text: Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the
dialog: church.
scene_heading: INT. BELL TOWER
text: Duncan faces a spiraling stone staircase. He has no choice
text: but to climb them, higher and higher, the sound of Clifford's
text: angry footsteps always coming up behind him.
text: Finally, Duncan can climb no higher. He is at the top of the
text: bell tower. A lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of
text: him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower. Above him
text: are the huge iron bells. A rope hangs down from the bells,
text: dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to
text: the floor of the church.
text: Clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him.
text: Duncan has little choice. He is trapped. Just before Clifford
text: reaches him, Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the
text: bell rope.
text: The bell starts to clang as Duncan, hanging in mid air, swings
text: back and forth within the narrow shaft. Clifford leans way
text: out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at Duncan,
text: but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing
text: down the rope.
text: Clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. At last,
text: he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose
text: his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below.
text: But Duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. The bell
text: continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night.
text: Then Clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins
text: to haul up on the rope.
text: Clifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster
text: than he is climbing down. Still twenty feet off the ground,
text: Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone
dialog: floor.
text: Then PEOPLE come rushing into the church, awakened by the
text: commotion of the bells. Duncan rolls into the shadows and
text: drags himself out a side door, while Clifford plans his own
text: escape from the bell tower.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER ALLEYWAY
text: Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two
text: buildings, catching his breath. CAMERA MOVES IN on him, and
text: we see him looking the craziest he's ever been. He shakes
text: uncontrollably and begins to mumble, softly at first, then
text: getting louder. He's falling back into the grips of Guy du
dialog: Marraux.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I wish you wouldn't leave me

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: I'll be around.
speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: You like ice cream?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Chocolate chip.

speaker_heading: CLIFFORD

speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Mommy, what's for dinner? Could we

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: They will be soon.

dialog: Give them about twenty minutes and
dialog: then take a peek -- but if Stevie

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Here's the number of the restaurant.
dialog: Call us if you need us. For police,

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Nine-one-one? Oh, sure.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: And just in case, I've written the

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (O.S.)
dialog: Have you checked the children?
text: Jill screams and falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JOHN
text: Around him, other DINERS fall instantly silent and wonder

text: John leaps up from his seat and dashes through the tables
text: like a madman. Suddenly the restaurant comes alive with
text: excitement and alarm.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JILL
text: As John runs up and drops to his knees beside her. She is
text: shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Jill, what's happening? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It was him! Somebody call the police!
dialog: Help me!
text: Other PEOPLE have crowded around and are making urgent noises

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wait a minute! Just hold on!
dialog: Sweetheart, what was him? What are
dialog: you talking about?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That man... Curt Duncan... He's home
dialog: again! He's got our children!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He was on the phone?
text: Jill nods.
text: John grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number. The

text: to let John talk. The phone rings and rings. Finally...
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart.
dialog: What's going on over there?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Nothing's going on.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Is everything all right?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yes, there's nothing --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Everything's fine. Why? What's --?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Carol, listen to me very carefully.
dialog: If there's a man in the house, if
dialog: there's any reason why you can't
dialog: talk to me right now, just answer
dialog: yes to me over the phone. That's
dialog: all. If there's any danger of any
dialog: kind, just say yes.
text: Long pause. They wait for her answer. Jill is listening into
text: the receiver now, too.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I don't understand what's happening.
dialog: What man in the house?
text: Jill is confused. John breathes a guarded sigh of relief.
text: Jill takes the phone.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me
dialog: truthfully. When was the last time
dialog: you looked in on the children?
speaker_heading: CAROL
text: About forty-five minutes ago.
dialog: Everything's fine. They were fast
dialog: asleep.
text: Jill gives her husband a look. John takes the phone again.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Carol, I'm sorry about all the
text: hysterics. We're leaving the
dialog: restaurant now. We'll explain
dialog: everything when we get home. Before
dialog: we hang up, could you do just one
dialog: more thing for me, please?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Would you go upstairs and, and check
dialog: on the children for me?
text: Jill is violently shaking her head. John silences her with a
dialog: gesture.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Sure. Hold on.
text: Carol O.S. puts the phone down. Then there is silence on the
text: other end. The crowd of people around Jill and John begin to
text: shuffle and murmur. John tries to keep them quiet while
text: listening into the phone.
text: Then TWO POLICEMEN come forward through the crowd. One of
text: them kneels down to John and Jill who are still on the floor.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #1
dialog: What seems to be the problem here,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a
dialog: second please, and I'll explain
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (whispering to
dialog: Policeman)
dialog: I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter
dialog: seven years ago with the child killer.
text: This means nothing to Policeman #1.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: The babysitter. The guy got into the
dialog: house and killed the two children
dialog: upstairs.
text: Policeman #2 kneels down now.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #2
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Oh, yeah, I remember something about
dialog: that. A Greek doctor...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's right. That's the one.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #2
dialog: (to Policeman #1)
dialog: It was in the seventh precinct...
text: As the two policemen and John mumble between themselves,
text: Jill takes the telephone.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Hello?
text: She presses the receiver tighter to her ear.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Carol?
text: John quiets down the policeman. Jill can now hear what she
dialog: couldn't a second ago.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (growing hysterical)
dialog: Carol? Carol?!
text: ZOOM into the telephone until we can also hear what Jill is
text: reacting to. It grows louder and louder... A dial tone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL
text: They look into the living room. Carol isn't there.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Sshhh...
text: June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep.

text: Satisfied that her children are safe, Jill pulls up the covers
text: on Stevie and then walks slowly out of the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL
text: Jill quietly pulls the door shut, and Policeman #2 walks
text: back up the hallway. Jill leans against the wall and buries
text: her face in her hands. She is drained. She starts to cry.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: Nothing was wrong?
speaker_heading: CAROL (O.S.)
dialog: When I got back to the phone, the
dialog: line was dead. I figured we got cut

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Jill is sitting on a corner of the bed, looking at the floor.

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What are you thinking about?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: If I ever get my hands on the guy
dialog: that made that call...
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: John, it wasn't a prank. I know that
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He disguised it though, didn't he?
dialog: Same as before?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I know that voice.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: How can we just sit here?
text: John turns and moves over beside her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Look, we promised never to talk about
dialog: this.
text: REACTION SHOT of Jill. She is shocked.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are we supposed to do? Leave
dialog: town? Take the kids and lock ourselves
dialog: up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a
dialog: good night's sleep, and in the morning
dialog: we can rethink this whole thing.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm
text: not about to fall asleep.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're
text: both here. The house is locked up.
dialog: The cops'll be just outside all night
dialog: long. We're safe now.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That's what they told me before.
text: John stands up and goes to his dresser.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel
dialog: any better...
text: He takes a revolver from the dresser drawer and emphatically
text: checks the action. Then he walks to his side of the bed and
text: sets the pistol on his bedside table.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'll keep it right here beside me
dialog: all night. You know I'm a light
dialog: sleeper and a damn good shot. Are
dialog: you satisfied?
text: Pause. Jill tries to smile.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: John, I'm sorry to be putting you
dialog: through all this.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, you're not putting me through
dialog: anything that you don't have to go
dialog: through yourself. I'm with you all
dialog: the way. Trust me. Okay?
text: Jill nods. John leans forward and kisses her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's my girl.
text: He gets up and walks out of the room talking.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: Now try to relax. We'll get some

dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (complaining)
dialog: Honey...
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Not so loud. You're going to wake

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Naw. Those kids'd sleep through an

dialog: (handing her the pills
dialog: and water)
dialog: Here, take a couple of these. They're
dialog: just what the doctor ordered.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - JILL
text: As she takes the pills and swallows them, one at a time.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: You know, I read somewhere about
dialog: this psychological thing called
text: hysterical delusion or hysterical
dialog: recall or something. It had to do
dialog: with how an event from your past can
dialog: sneak up on you sometimes and fool
dialog: you when it's only just a memory. I
dialog: don't know. We'll talk about it in
dialog: the morning. Maybe there's someone

text: Jill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on
text: another light. Apparently, only a lightbulb has blown. Jill
text: unscrews the burned-out bulb from its socket and throws it
text: in the trash.
text: She leaves the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL
text: Jill walks to a hall closet and opens it. A light comes on
text: inside as she does so. A puzzled, half-startled expression
text: comes onto her face.
speaker_heading: JILL'S POV
text: Inside the closet, half the hangers with coats, etc., are on
dialog: the floor.
text: Sound over: A telephone being dialed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Clifford has just finished dialing the phone. He waits,
text: nothing happens. Then a strange, siren-like noise comes out
text: of the telephone. Clifford listens, then hangs up.
text: He picks up the .38 he has lying on the desk and idly starts
text: flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles.
text: After a moment, he lays the gun down and picks up the phone
text: again, this time calling the OPERATOR.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Operator.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Can you dial a local number for me?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: What is the number, please?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: 555-2183.
text: The operator dials. There is a pause. Then the same strange
text: noise cuts in.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Operator, what does that mean?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, that line seems to
dialog: be disconnected.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Why don't I get a recording?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know, sir. Maybe the number
dialog: was just recently disconnected. Maybe
text: there's a temporary malfunction in
dialog: the wiring. Why don't you try it
dialog: again in the morning?
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Yeah, okay. Thanks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOCKHART HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Jill is walking down the hall to the children's bedroom. She
text: opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM
text: As Jill quietly enters. The children are asleep. Jill goes
text: to June and tucks her in. Then she walks over to Stevie's
text: bed. He is sleeping, but with a Sugar Daddy in his hand.
text: Jill looks down at him, again puzzled. She leans over, takes
text: the Sugar Daddy and gently wakes him.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Stevie... Stevie...
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: (stirring, but not
dialog: fully awake)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Stevie, listen to me. Where did you
dialog: get this candy?
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Where did you get this?
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: (very groggy)
dialog: The man gave it to me...
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What man?
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: (drifting off)
dialog: I don't know... He was... Wings on a
dialog: horse...
text: He closes his eyes and is asleep.
text: Jill stands up, turns and starts to walk out of the room.
text: Halfway across the floor, Jill stops. She stands rigid as a
text: thought penetrates her own drowsiness. She turns very slowly
text: and moves to the closet in the children's bedroom.
text: She stands before it a moment. Then she reaches her hand
text: forward for the knob on the closet door. She very slowly
text: pulls the door open. She looks inside. There is nothing.
text: Jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Jill enters. John is still asleep facing the wall. Jill gets
text: into bed, sitting up. She is wide awake now. She sits for a
text: moment in the darkness, thinking.
text: Then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table.
text: She doesn't get a dial tone. She quietly pushes the phone's
text: disconnect button up and down several times. Still no dial
dialog: tone.
text: Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension
text: creeping over her face.
text: Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the
text: muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in
text: the throes of Guy du Marraux.
text: Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more
text: menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom
text: closet which is a couple of inches ajar.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (urgently whispering)
dialog: John?... John?...
text: She reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on, never taking
text: her eyes away from the closet door. As soon as the light
text: comes on, the voice stops.
text: Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's
text: shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: John!... John!...
text: The body beside her stirs, rolls over, looks at her hideously.
dialog: It is Duncan!!
text: Jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed.
text: Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness
text: grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her
dialog: nightgown.
text: As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly
text: while she fights to get away.
text: Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's
text: ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose
text: her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the
text: doorway leading out of the room.
text: Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his
text: hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate
text: sound of a woman facing certain death.
text: Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other
text: sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud.
text: Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in
text: hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks
text: around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down.
text: On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall
text: lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs,
text: as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some
text: time yet before he comes to.
text: Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over
text: Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the
text: doorway, sobbing hysterically.
speaker_heading: CLIFFORD
dialog: Your husband's okay.
text: Then he is gone.
text: As Jill sits there unable to rein in her emotions, June and
text: Stevie toddle up to her groggily from the hallway.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Mommy?
text: Jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries
text: her face between them.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL
text: Looking through the open front doorway into the quiet night
dialog: beyond.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
