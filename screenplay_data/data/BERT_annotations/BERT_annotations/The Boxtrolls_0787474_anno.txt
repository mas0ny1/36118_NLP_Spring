dialog: 
text: SFX: A BABY CRIES out.
dialog: 
text: Stumpy CLAWED FEET wrapped in rag run past a boxed labeled
text: LAIKA. The camera follows the shadowed figure as it runs

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A FABRIC BANNER reading "BOXTROLL EXTERMINATORS".
dialog: 
text: The banner hangs on a strange rattletrap TRUCK that winds its

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They will add your flesh to their

dialog: 
text: As the truck passes, PEDESTRIANS gasp and hurry into their
text: houses, heeding the amplified warning. A CHEESEMONGER at The
text: Cheesery pulls his FOLDING SIGN from the sidewalk and hurries
text: inside. A COUPLE stops mid-conversation and heads indoors. A
text: MAN CARRYING A CRATE brings his load into his shop,
text: abandoning the crate sitting at the curb. Two FEMALE
text: TOWNSFOLK head off down the street.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Archibald Snatcher as the truck rounds a corner.

text: Dragged underground and feasted

speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lock your windows! Bolt your doors!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (O.S.)
dialog: Beware the bloodthirsty monsters!
dialog: They'll fry your eyes, gnaw on your

dialog: 
text: After Snatcher's truck has passed the CAMERA lands on: A
text: MANHOLE. Carved in the heavy iron cover is a warning: "HERE
scene_heading: BE MONSTERS".
dialog: 
text: A LONG BEAT OF SILENCE. The manhole cover slowly twists and
text: lifts, a pudgy blue hand emerges. Two pairs of yellow,
text: glowing eyes peer out. The creatures talk in expressive but
text: unintelligible GURGLES. Down the street, two more manhole
dialog: covers lift.
dialog: 
text: In pairs and in gangs, these BOXTROLLS -- so called for the
text: cardboard boxes they wear -- emerge from the sewers and
text: scurry through the streets of the besieged town. Their long,
text: forboding SHADOWS creep across walls plastered with posters
text: that read: "CHEESEBRIDGE: A GOUDA PLACE TO LIVE", "REDHATS -
scene_heading: BOXTROLL EXTERMINATORS".
dialog: 
text: We watch them scurry through streets and alleyways, gurgling
text: quiet directions to each other. They move swiftly and travel
text: in packs. We see a lone boxtroll jump and pull himself in to
text: his box as a DOG BARKS. He pops back out of his box and moves
text: along quickly.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: what appears to be a LARGE BOXTROLL MONSTER peering
text: around the corner of a moonlight street. Its glowing eyes
text: turn toward the camera as it sways slowly. Five more pairs of
text: eyes light up within the large, boxy shadow and SIX BOXTROLLS
text: separate from the mass, popping off to run their errands
text: while the coast is clear.
dialog: 
text: BIRDS EYE VIEW: Groups of two and three boxtrolls snake their
text: way down streets, skirting carefully around areas lit by
text: street lamps.
dialog: 
text: In a small lane, groups of boxtrolls stop to collect
text: mechanical stuff. They work together, using their boxes as
text: tools and props.
dialog: 
text: SIX BOXTROLLS stack up in the background to steal a SHOP
text: SIGN, while THREE BOXTROLLS cooperatively steal the WHEEL
text: from a WOODEN CART.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: One boxtroll uses his box to prop up a corner while the other
text: two release the wheel from the axle. A LONE BOXTROLL crosses
text: the frame to see what treasures he may find in a trash bin;
text: as he knocks it over with a CLANG, TWO BOXTROLLS scurry past
text: and stack together, stealing the HOUSE NUMBER from the front
text: of a brownstone.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: the boxtrolls' booty - the shiny brass number `2',
text: the shop sign for `TIMELESS TIMEPIECES', the wheel that rolls
text: along between two boxtrolls.

text: Six other boxtrolls on the hunt stack together against a
text: fence. We watch as one boxtroll makes it over the top,

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The inside of a trash can as the lid is removed.
text: Two BOXTROLL HANDS wriggle into view over the rubbish, fill
text: of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, an APPLE CORE, a BANANA PEEL, and a
text: FISH CARCASS. The boxtroll gurgles "EWW" and "BLECH" sounds
text: as he moves these unwanted items aside. He gurgles with joy
text: when a bit of brass is revealed.
dialog: 
text: FISH, a nervous 4-foot tall, wonky-toothed, pointy-eared,
text: gangly-limbed boxtroll, pulls an old broken ALARM CLOCK from
text: the trash barrel. He is in a large alley, filled with old
text: boxes, crates, broken items and tarps strewn about.
dialog: 
text: Fish stares curiously at the object, turning it over in his
text: hands and holding it to his ear, listening. He shakes the
text: clock and hears loose gears RATTLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH
dialog: Hmm...
dialog: 
text: Fish opens the clock face and gurgles, intently toying with
text: the mechanical interior. After a moment, the clock begins to
text: TICK with activity. Fish gurgles excitedly and closes the
text: clock face, holding it to his ear to listen to the rhythmic
text: ticking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH (CONT'D)
dialog: (GURGLES) Oh yeah...
dialog: 
text: Fish's eyes go wide as the clock's alarm RINGS, attracting
text: the attention of an uglier, 2-foot-2 boxtroll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHOE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As Fish stands proudly admiring the sound of his ringing
text: alarm clock, SHOE bounces around his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (GURGLES) Gimme that!
dialog: 
text: Shoe, short and feisty, grabs the alarm clock from Fish and
text: scampers away with it. Fish watches as Shoe climbs a stack of
text: crates and hisses back at him, sniffing at his new prize.
text: Fish scowls at Shoe and returns to the rubbish pile, shaking
text: his head and muttering.
dialog: 
text: Behind him a half-dozen boxtrolls methodically pick through
text: an assortment of trash barrels and old boxes. It's like a
text: troop of monkeys at the dump. They find mechanical stuff,
dialog: inspect it, and then either drop it into their box to keep or
text: toss it back into the trash.
dialog: 
text: A filthy TEDDY BEAR WITH A MUSICAL KEY is discarded by
text: another boxtroll, landing with a THUNK and A FEW TINNY
text: MUSICAL NOTES. Fish turns excitedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH
speaker_heading: (CURIOUS)
dialog: Ohhhh...
dialog: 
text: He picks up the teddy bear and cranks a key in its back as
text: Shoe toys with the stolen alarm clock. The teddy bear plays
text: MUSIC. Fish gurgles along to the tune and bobs his head,
text: enjoying the moment.
dialog: 
text: Again, Shoe notices Fish has found something interesting. He
text: shoves the alarm clock into his box, stealthily sneaks up on
text: Fish and makes a grab for the teddy bear! Fish refuses to let
text: go and they squabble over it. Suddenly all the boxtrolls snap
dialog: to attention, their ears alert--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHASE ALLEY
dialog: 
text: The creepy RATTLING SOUNDS of the Redhats' truck returns.
dialog: 
text: All the boxtrolls hide in their boxes. The "camouflage"
text: works. Their boxes fit in perfectly with the trash barrels
text: and packing crates.
dialog: 
text: The rattling comes closer... closer... then STOPS.
dialog: 
text: BAM! HEADLIGHTS light up the alley.
dialog: 
text: Three men dismount from the truck and cast long shadows
text: across the alley and all of the boxes: the giant MR. TROUT,
text: the beanpole thin MR. PICKLES, and the short, pit bull MR.
speaker_heading: GRISTLE.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The boxtrolls don't run -- they just KEEP HIDING IN THEIR
speaker_heading: BOXES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (O.S.)
speaker_heading: GENTLEMEN!
dialog: 
text: Snatcher spreads his arms theatrically and wades into the
text: garbage-strewn alley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at all these boxes left lying
dialog: about. How curious, how peculiar. I
dialog: do believe... evil is afoot.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
speaker_heading: (COLD BLOODED)
scene_heading: HAHAHA. FOOT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: Huh.
dialog: 
text: Fish peeks out of his box momentarily, then retreats when he
text: sees the Redhats advancing into the alley.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles absentmindedly check boxes for
text: boxtrolls, but Mr. Gristle methodically stomps and smashes
text: every box he can. When he finds a box with a boxtroll, he
text: uses a CRICKET BAT to WHACK it back to the others to load
text: onto the truck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PICKLES (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever seen someone's foot be
dialog: evil, Mr. Trout?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: I believe the boss meant evil is
text: nearby, Mr. Pickles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: My foot had a pretty nasty bunion
dialog: once. I wouldn't say the foot
dialog: itself was evil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: No, it's just a fancy-man's word
dialog: for vicinity.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: Wrinkly ol' bunion looked like my
dialog: grandmum. Had to saw her off. The
dialog: bunion, not my grandmum.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mr. Gristle spots a shivering box and positions himself over
text: it, cricket bat in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
dialog: Ah, yes. FOOT!
dialog: 
text: WHACK! Gristle kicks the box, and it flies toward Mr. Pickles
dialog: and Mr. Trout.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: There's one!
dialog: 
text: Mr. Pickles scoops it up in a dog catcher's net.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your
dialog: days of evil-doin' are over.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Gristle finds another shivering box. He swings his bat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 
text: WHACK! A box slides over to Trout. A dizzy boxtroll pops out
text: for a moment, groaning. Trout taps its head and the boxtroll
dialog: retreats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: You really think these boxtrolls
dialog: understand the duality of good and
dialog: evil?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: They must, right? Why else would
dialog: they hide from us. We are the good
dialog: guys.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Pickles strolls off with both boxtroll and net.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE (O.S.)
dialog: (hitting more boxes)
dialog: Nice! NICE!
dialog: 
text: WHACK! Another box slides over to Trout. Trout scoops up the
text: box before the creature can get away. The boxtroll's legs
text: dangle below as it is carried away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: Yeah... I suppose we are.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Fish and Shoe, in the shadows at the edge of the
text: alley, gurgle to each other while the Red Hats are
text: distracted. Their heads stay hidden in their boxes as they
text: waddle slowly out of the alley.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mr. Gristle is too preoccupied with smashing other boxes to
text: notice them. He grunts and laughs with the effort.

dialog: 
text: The boxtrolls pop out of their boxes and RUN!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE STREET
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Gristle smashes THROUGH the fence--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
dialog: COME BACK AND LET ME HIT YOU!
dialog: 
text: --but the boxtrolls have disappeared. Gristle stalks down the

dialog: 
text: After Gristle disappears, two boxes that are holding up a

dialog: 
text: Sweets stops, thinks, gets an idea and starts to speak just
text: as SPECS, a myopic boxtroll with an elaborate head gear of
text: eye glasses, twists an ANCHOR switch, turning on the
text: pneumatic tubes. First his DENTURES, then Sweets, are sucked

speaker_heading: (GURGLED)
dialog: Eggs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: (low, feral growls)
dialog:

text: He excitedly launches himself at Fish. They play wrestle over

dialog: 
text: Eggs hugs the bear. So cute. Then... RIPS ITS HEAD OFF!
dialog: 
text: He reaches into the teddy bear's chest cavity and pulls out

speaker_heading: EGGS (CONT'D)

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Baby Eggs lies looking straight up. The ceiling of the cavern

dialog: 
text: The box pile explodes and falls apart as all the boxtrolls

dialog: 
text: - EGGS NOOK: Fish winds up the teddy bear's MUSIC BOX and

dialog: 
text: Eggs pounds a hammer on a typewriter at the bottom of the

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: the CHUTES.
dialog: 
text: Wheels swerves to avoid boxtrolls as they tumble off of the

speaker_heading: (GURGLED)
text: BOXTROLLS NEVER TAKE OFF THEIR
speaker_heading: BOXES!

dialog: 
text: - Close on several PILL BUGS crawling on the cavern floor.

dialog: 
text: Eggs hides behind a little barrier of corrugated metal with

dialog: 
text: - CLOSE ON: Eggs as he slides on a "new" HELMET made out of

dialog: 
text: PULL OUT. Eggs stands beneath the pneumatic tubes as the

dialog: 
text: - The boxtroll sleeping pile dwindles as more and more

dialog: 
text: - Another night of scavenging as a garden gate hinge SQUEAKS!
text: Eggs and Fish continue running but Oil Can can't help himself
text: - he stops to oil the gate.
dialog: 
text: Oil Can doesn't realize Gristle is standing right behind him
text: aiming a medieval looking BLUNDERBUSS BOLAS GUN!
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Marvelous! Then let us begin.
dialog: 
text: Trout takes a little piece of cheese out of a package labeled
text: "EXTRA MILD CHEDDAR". He focuses and cuts off the tiniest

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Snatcher bangs his fist on the table. Startled, Pickles and

text: front of him.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher loses patience and spins the table so that a plate

scene_heading: INT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - DAY TO NIGHT

dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Boulders and dust rain down. Through the murk, Eggs sees a
text: huge metal box covered in bits of scrap metal, with gaps
text: revealing an interior of huge gears and cables all spinning
text: and twisting like the guts of a giant watch. The whole
text: machine has an ad hoc, made-from-assorted-scrap-and-junk feel
dialog: that is unique to a boxtroll creation.
dialog: 
text: ON EGGS as his eyes go wide.
dialog: 
text: Two big spot lights BLAST ON like eyes, and the mecha box
text: drill rises up on three legs. As it rises, it tears walkways
text: and lights from the cavern walls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOXTROLLS
dialog: AHHHHHHHH!!!!!
dialog: 
text: As it turns, it rips the intricate boxtroll clock from its

text: like a monstrous, giant mechanical boxtroll.
dialog: 
text: The mecha box's spotlight "eyes" cut through the dust and
text: darkness, catching each fleeing boxtroll, making them
text: instinctively STOP RUNNING and HIDE in their boxes!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Snatcher hits a lever and a large MECHANICAL ARM unfolds from

text: swings the claw at stalactites, sending them crashing to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
speaker_heading: AHH!
dialog: 
text: Eggs shoves boxtrolls out of the way as the rocks fall to the

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Some jump out of the way and Snatcher swings again, sending

dialog: 
text: Eggs drags boxtrolls towards the pneumatic tubes -- but they

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
scene_heading: NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, TRUBSHAW!
dialog: 
text: Eggs turns the anchor switch and the boxes start to rise into
text: the tubes. The mecha box's claw arm GRABS the tube and rips
text: it out of the machine. Cocoa falls! There's no way out.
dialog: 
text: Eggs jumps out of the way as the mecha claw arm drops the
text: tube overhead. He rights himself and gasps up at Snatcher in
text: at the mecha drill controls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Time to earn my white hat!
dialog: 
text: Snatcher pulls another LEVER and releases the VACUUM ARM. It
text: slithers toward a group of boxtrolls. Eggs whimpers as
text: Snatcher hits the lever's BUTTON to begin the suction.
dialog: 
text: The boxtrolls in front of Eggs get sucked up by the mecha
text: box's vacuum arm. He tries to hold on a boxtroll mid-suction
text: but it is ripped away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: The mecha box's vacuum arm turns on other boxtrolls.
dialog: 
text: Sweets and Knickers grab hold of boulders. Knickers nearly

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: EGGS (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Eggs and Fish huddle together as Snatcher rides up,

scene_heading: MR. GRISTLE!
dialog: 
text: Eggs holds Fish tightly and tries to run but Gristle fires

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH
dialog: Eggs? Eggs?

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: ACQUIRE THEM!

speaker_heading: FISH
speaker_heading: (SNARLS FEROCIOUSLY)

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Lord Portley-Riiiiind!
dialog: 
text: The door cracks open and Lord Portley-Rind looks out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I come bearing the most delightful
dialog: news.
dialog: 
text: He blinks in amazement at the scene before him - Snatcher
text: atop a giant machine, a huge expectant crowd around him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
speaker_heading: (TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE)

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Flattened to extinction. Every

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Your lordship, I said I would not
dialog: rest until I caught every last
dialog: boxtroll and I am a man of my word.
dialog: 
text: He hits a switch and the mechanical arm swings around to
text: present Eggs, wearing the evil-boxtroll costume Mr. Gristle
text: wore in the Madame Frou Frou show. The mask covers Eggs' face
text: and his hands are bound behind his box. His feet and hands
text: are covered with grotesque claws.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: With this boxtroll, I will end
dialog: their reign of terror.
dialog: 
text: Up on her balcony, Winnie stares at the monster. CLOSE ON the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINNIE
speaker_heading: EGGS!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: (to crowd, arms wide)
dialog: I'd say that deserves a white hat,

dialog: 
text: The crowd cheers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOPKEEPER WOMAN A
dialog: A white hat for Mr. Snatcher!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE TOWNSFOLK (O.S.)

dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: (in unison, chanting)
text: WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT!
dialog: 
text: The Redhats stand with the crowd, Gristle chanting along with
text: them. Pickles and Trout look uncomfortable.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: There's probably some, uh,
dialog: paperwork... then have a hat
dialog: shipped in...
dialog: 
text: Snatcher moves the machine forward, dangling the "boxtroll"
text: out front, daring Portley-Rind to deny the mob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: No. Methinks a deed of this
dialog: magnitude deserves something a bit
dialog: more... significant.
dialog: 
text: Portley-Rind stares up at him blankly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want YOUR hat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND

dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: (through gritted teeth)
dialog: All right. All right. As soon as

scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: Yes. And then we can eat cheese

speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
text: In the Tasting Room.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher laughs and climbs down from the mecha drill. Gristle
text: has removed his hat and taken a knee, Snatcher uses his head
dialog: as a step stool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
dialog: Haha, FOOT!
dialog: 
text: He hands a REMOTE CONTROL to Trout, who is huddled nervously

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Do the honors.

scene_heading: MR. PICKLES

speaker_heading: MR. TROUT

speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
scene_heading: HAT! (CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Pickles quickly puts on his mustache and Trout presses the

text: swings on the chain.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher steps in front of Portley-Rind. He removes his red

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Trout! Lower the beast down.
dialog: 
text: Trout reluctantly maneuvers Eggs over the furnace's mouth.

dialog: coal fire.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON EGGS as his eyes widen, flames reflected in them.
text: He struggles.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher takes a knee, and presents his head. Portley-Rind

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: With this hat, I, Archibald

dialog: 
text: Trout begins to lower Eggs into the furnace. He and Pickles

dialog: head.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: With profound esteem for dairy and

speaker_heading: WINNIE
speaker_heading: (HURRIEDLY)
dialog: Sure, yes, whatever! Just let him

dialog: 
text: Pickles and Trout stare at each other, unsure of what to do.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: ON EGGS as he shuts his lids tightly against the coal fire.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Back to Trout and Pickles, who smile at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: (at Mr. Pickles' nod)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS

dialog: Huh?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: Watch yourself.

speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE

speaker_heading: MUSTACHE)

dialog:

dialog: 
text: The naked gaggle of boxtrolls carries Gristle away and throws
text: him into a barrel labeled "LEECHES".
dialog: 
text: Fish releases Eggs from the mechanical arm, sending him
text: flying into a CHEESE TENT. He tumbles out on to the market

dialog: 
text: What Eggs couldn't see is the boxtrolls, led by a NAKED Fish,

dialog: threshold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (O.S.)
dialog: Wow, good speech.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Get your grimy paws off of my

dialog: 
text: Snatcher pulls a lever and the furnace ROARS to life, spewing

dialog: 
text: Snatcher deploys the spinning chassis. The box rotates,

speaker_heading: EGGS

dialog: 
text: Mr. Pickles tosses it to Mr. Trout, who puts it on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: I think white quite suits me.
dialog: 
text: Trout tosses the hat back to Pickles, teasing Snatcher as a
text: mecha leg misses him. He tosses the hat to Winnie.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO a wider view of Market Square as Winnie, Pickles, and
text: Trout play keep away with the white hat, tossing it around
text: like a frisbee. Snatcher spins the mecha box around, trying
text: to grab the hat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Over here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: You ungrateful stooges!
dialog: 
text: Pickles, now holding the hat, taunts Snatcher.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: Is this what you wanted, boss?
dialog: 
text: Pickles tosses the hat high. It soars past Snatcher's head.
text: Snatcher fails to grasp it, then Lord Portley-Rind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Mine!
dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: Mine!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Herbert leaps up and grabs the white hat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERBERT
speaker_heading: JELLY!
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Herbert laughs as he runs around, weaving between the mecha
text: drill legs. Portley-Rind chases after him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: It's not funny! No, no, no!
dialog: 
text: Herbert gives an extra-jaunty laugh and ducks away from a
text: mecha leg quickly. Portley-Rind runs SMACK into it, falling
text: to the ground.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO Gristle as he climbs woozily out of the leech barrel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
dialog: Ohhhh...
dialog:

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
speaker_heading: (TO HERBERT)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: Jelly!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
speaker_heading: HUH?
dialog: 
text: Gristle gets WHACKED, sending the white hat sailing into the
text: air and Gristle sailing across the square.
dialog: 
text: The hat is caught by Winnie. Snatcher chases her, corners her
text: and is about to crush her with the arm when the gears GRIND
text: in protestation.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO Eggs, Shoe, and Oil Can on the mecha arm joint. They
text: sneer at Snatcher. Shoe giggles as he removes a final gear
text: from the arm. The arm hangs in the air for a moment then
text: suddenly FALLS OFF and CLANGS TO THE GROUND with Shoe and Oil
dialog: Can!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: Whoops!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SPARKY/BOXTROLLS
dialog: (GURGLE YELL!)
dialog: 
text: Eggs watches the arm fall, worried about his friends. He
text: doesn't notice Snatcher looming over him. Furious, Snatcher
text: swings a LARGE WRENCH at Eggs' head.
dialog: 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Stop destroying my indestructible
dialog: machine!
dialog: 
text: Eggs barely ducks out of the way and falls, catching a hold
text: of the arm joint and scrambling up to the front of the box.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher keeps swinging the wrench again - KLANG! -, tracking
text: Eggs. He SMASHES the left headlight of the mecha drill and
text: reels back to swing again when--
dialog: 
text: Eggs grabs onto a lever, pulls it hard, and the mecha box
text: tilts violently back, sending Snatcher tumbling to the edge.
text: Smoke starts coming out of the furnace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: AHHHHHHH!!!!
dialog: 
text: Eggs presses the red button and THE VACUUM ARM SWINGS DOWN
scene_heading: LIKE A GIANT ACCORDION.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: Fish, grab hold!
dialog: 
text: ON CUE, Fish and Shoe scream directions. A group of boxtrolls
text: run up to the vacuum arm and grab hold. They form a

speaker_heading: SQUARE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH
scene_heading: (GURGLES "PULL!")
dialog:

speaker_heading: EGGS

speaker_heading: SNATCHER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
speaker_heading: AHHHH!
dialog: 
text: Snatcher grabs Eggs by the shoulders and forces him down over
text: the edge of the mecha drill control booth.
dialog: 
text: ON THE BOXTROLLS as Fish grabs the mouth of the vacuum and
text: jumps down into the sewer, dangling ABOVE THE WATER! The
dialog: vacuum can't reach!
dialog: 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH
speaker_heading: (GURGLED) Uh oh.
speaker_heading: (GURGLED)

dialog: 
text: ON WINNIE, SHOE and the others as they STRAIN to pull the

scene_heading: MR. PICKLES
dialog: Pull!
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON the mecha box's legs as they are dragged toward the

dialog: 
text: WITH Fish as the tube reaches the water. He scrambles up the

dialog: 
text: MEANWHILE, Snatcher and Eggs struggle, their hands on each
text: others' throats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: I'm nothing like you. You're the
dialog: monster!
dialog: 
text: Snatcher pulls him close and GROWLS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER
speaker_heading: MONSTER?
dialog: 
text: Snatcher GROWLS and rears back with the wrench! Eggs reaches

speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: FOOOMP! Water is sucked up in HUGE GULPS that race up the

dialog: 
text: WATER HITS THE RED HOT FURNACE! BOOM! An EXPLOSION of steam
text: and smoke fills the screen, obscuring our view.
dialog: 
text: ON THE WHITE HAT as it sits on the cobblestones. Lord Portley-
text: Rind picks it up with a chuckle and places it on his head.
text: He twirls his mustache with delight.
dialog: 
text: ON THE MECHA DRILL as it stands still, steam dissipating
text: around its carcass. The vacuum arm is now just a stump of
text: steel and shredded canvas.
dialog: 
text: The boxtrolls and townsfolk stare at it through the steam.
dialog: 
text: A LONG BEAT OF SILENCE is broken by shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE HATS (O.S.)
text: WE'VE DONE IT!/ HUZZAH!/ THREE
speaker_heading: CHEERS FOR US!
dialog: 
text: Sir Langsdale, Sir Broderick, and Sir Boulanger crest the

dialog: Lord... Portley-... Rind?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE
text: UGH! I HAVE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.
dialog: 
text: Gristle looks up to see Snatcher and Eggs still clinging to

text: watches as the box gets closer...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GRISTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Boss?
dialog: 
text: Timbeeeeer! The mecha box drill crashes on to Mr. Gristle and
text: sends Snatcher and Eggs flying SPLAT! into the GIANT CHEESE
text: WHEEL! SMOKE, STEAM, AND MELTED CHEESE SPLATTER EVERYWHERE!
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The crowd watches while Fish runs to look for Eggs in the

speaker_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D)

scene_heading: YEAH! ARSHBALL SHNASHER, YOOFINE'LY

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: Men, don your White Hatsh...
dialog: 
text: Snatcher lowers the hat onto the top of his head.
dialog: 
text: REVEAL Snatcher is sitting at the Tasting Room table, still
text: clutching Winnie under his swollen arm. She whimpers in fear.
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Portley-Rind, wearing Snatcher's red hat, and Eggs and Fish,
text: wearing pilfered white hats, sit on the other side of the
text: table. Fish's hat slips down over his eyes, too big for his
text: pointy head.
dialog: 
text: A small, ornately covered cheese tray sits in front of Lord
dialog: Portley-Rind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: Please, Snatcher, let her go. You
dialog: don't have to do this--

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: ISH TASHTING TIME!
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: LORD PORTLEY-RIND
dialog: I present the tastiest cheese known

speaker_heading: SNATCHER
dialog: (interrupts, angry)
dialog: Shut up! Enough shtalling.
dialog: 
text: Portley-Rind lifts the lid off the cheese tray, revealing a
text: small greenish portion of powerful looking cheese. A waft of
text: stink fills the air and everyone recoils. Fish stabs a fork
dialog: into the cheese.
dialog: 
text: Eggs pushes the cheese tray across the table, face drawn in
text: disgust. It stops in front of Snatcher. He lifts the fork in
text: his ham-sized swollen fist and removes a curd. He gives the
text: cheese a looong SNIFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNATCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (snifffff) Yesh... rich bouquet,

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Eggs looks at Winnie. She shrugs.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher growls, shrugs it off, and raises the forkful of

text: loudly. Everyone else recoils, scared. Fish hides in his box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONG PAUSE

dialog: 
text: ON EGGS, WINNIE, FISH, LORD PORTLEY-RIND as Snatcher slowly

dialog: 
text: Snatcher chews loudly.
dialog: 
text: Snatcher swallows. He glances down to his stomach...
dialog: 
text: Eggs and Fish flinch, expecting something terrible to happen.
text: Even Portley-Rind and Winnie cower.

speaker_heading: EGGS

speaker_heading: WINNIE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: (quietly, to Winnie)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: The square is cleaned up from the battle and there are a few

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks!
dialog: 
text: Eggs walks away as Langsdale backs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIR LANGSDALE
dialog: Oh. I... I don't think that's a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: EGGS

speaker_heading: (TOOTHLESS MOUTH)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERBERT (O.S.)
dialog: Ahh, there he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISH
dialog: Eggs!
dialog: 
text: Snatcher's vehicle appears. Herbert is driving and Fish is
text: riding in Snatcher's old seat.
dialog: 
text: A new logo has been painted over the old silhouette of a
text: rampaging boxtroll. In its place is a kinder silhouette of a
text: boxtroll holding a light bulb, surrounded by a circle made of
text: three arrows - it's the prototype of the international sign
dialog: for recycling.
dialog: 
text: Eggs holds up the record - a new copy of the QUATTRO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: Look what I found!

speaker_heading: HERBERT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGGS
dialog: And now we go like this.
dialog: 
text: Fish and Eggs start rocking out, bobbing their heads to the
text: music like they used to. Fish and Eggs hum to the tune.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: Ahh. I've missed so much.
dialog: 
text: He joins them in the head-bobbing.
dialog: 
text: WIDE: As the music swells we follow the vehicle as it winds

text: sweeping up some trash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TROUT
dialog: Aww, ain't that lovely?
dialog:

dialog: Like the end of a story, if our

dialog: 
text: Shoe climbs out of the barrel. He pulls Lord Portley-Rind's

text: the rest back in the trash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PICKLES (O.S.)
dialog: Not sure what we'd do next, though.
dialog:
