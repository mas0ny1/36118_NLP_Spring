speaker_heading: DARIUS (VO)
dialog: Grew up in New Jersey - wait,

speaker_heading: DARIUS (VO)
dialog: They always said they just thought

text: Dad’s smile turns awkward when he locks eyes with one of the
text: BLACK WORKERS shoveling dirt under the brutal summer sun.
speaker_heading: DARIUS (VO)
dialog: So, grew up there with them.

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Did that answer the question?
scene_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: (not amused)
dialog: Usually people just say where
dialog: they’re from and where they worked
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Great. I’m already overqualified.
scene_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: So, in any of your previous jobs,
dialog: can you tell me one instance in
dialog: which you went above and beyond the
dialog: call of duty for a customer?
text: Darius lets a laugh slip out.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What would I be doing here?
dialog: Fighting fires and saving lives? I

text: The Manager sweeps her application into a folder.
scene_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: I’m going to be honest. I’m not
dialog: sure your attitude fits what we
dialog: look for in customer service.
text: Darius gives him a wide eyed look. She looks prettiest when
dialog: not on the offense.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Wait, I mean I could make something

scene_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: You think you’re too good for this?
dialog: Why are you even here?
speaker_heading: DARIUS

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What’s up.
scene_heading: INT. FACSIMILE - MAIN OFFICE - DAY
text: Darius lugs the asswipes through an office designed to look

scene_heading: INT. FACSIMILE - BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: BRIDGETTE BAY, 34, a harshly beautiful editor with a visible

speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: hand over phone receiver
speaker_heading: PB
dialog: Don’t put that there.
text: Darius puts it on the ground.
speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: No! Put it in the utility closet
dialog: and fill all the bathrooms.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah, I was just giving you this.
text: Bridgette, annoyed, waves the money away and glares at her
text: desk, where Darius places the change. She removes a pack of
text: tampons from a plastic bag.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I got your...stuff, too.
text: Bridgette scowls at her. The tampons go on the table and
text: Darius kneels to power squat the economy pack back up.
speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah, an intern. They need
dialog: everything spelled out for them.
scene_heading: INT. FACSIMILE - BATHROOM - DAY
text: On her knees, Darius has to really lean and tilt her head
text: dangerously close to the toilet bowl to get the empty paper

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Ohhhhh-kay.
scene_heading: INT. FACSIMILE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: So the lesbian band story is in for
dialog: next month.
text: JEFF SCHWENSEN, 29, has a slight Jersey accent and looks like

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Wasn’t one of the interns in one of
dialog: those female bands? Who was that?
text: Jeff looks around and stops his eyes on Darius in the back of
text: the room. She doesn’t like being put on the spot.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It was you, right?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yep. Played bass. We weren’t a les-
dialog: band, though.
text: Jeff nods confusedly, sure up to now that she was a lesbian.
text: Darius fills the silence.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: We were called Period Pieces. Cause
dialog: of the double entendre.
text: Now more silence.
speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: Okay. What else do we have?
text: Jeff looks over his notes.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What about the time traveler ad?
text: A blown-up CLASSIFIED AD comes up on the Powerpoint screen.
text: Darius is immediately intrigued by the words that appear.
dialog: WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a
text: joke. P.O. Box 322, Ocean View, NC 28469. You'll get paid
dialog: after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not
dialog: guaranteed.
text: Some LAUGHS around the room.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So this is an ad someone e-mailed
dialog: in, taken from the classifieds of a
dialog: newspaper. I’m thinking kind of a
dialog: funny piece about it, maybe a
text: tongue-in-cheek investigation.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Who put it up? Is it real, a prank?
dialog: Come up with theories and whatnot.
speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: You want it? It’s yours.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Can I get a couple interns for
dialog: research?
text: Darius’ eyes open. This is her chance to escape Bridgette.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Me. Please.
text: The socially awkward, prematurely balding 22 year-old next to

speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Done.
scene_heading: INT. FACSIMILE - JEFF’S OFFICE - LATER
text: A small office. Darius and Arnau sit across a desk from a

speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: We sent a letter to the address in
dialog: the ad and asked them to get back
dialog: to us.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: And I called the local paper but
dialog: they’re all uptight and won’t give
dialog: out the info on the people that
dialog: take out ads.
text: Jeff leans back and runs a hand through his hair.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I fucked Bridgette.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Whoa.
text: Arnau’s mouth freezes in the open position.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: That's gross, kinda.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I know. Sometimes someone pisses
dialog: you off so much you just wanna -
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Did she like boss you around and
dialog: criticize your technique the whole
dialog: time?
text: Bridgette makes quick eye contact with Jeff through the glass.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We gotta get outta here. Go to
dialog: Ocean View.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: We?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don’t want to go?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I don’t know. You’re not going to

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What? No. What’s
dialog: Christ, the shit

speaker_heading: DARIUS (OS)
dialog: My dad is sadly at the point where

dialog: to clear the browsing history.
text: After a slew of teen-themed sites a couple preggo’s go by.
scene_heading: INT. BRITT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Darius is at a living room computer in a sparse suburban
text: home. A polite Algerian in a SUNY sweatshirt, FARID, 20's,
text: sits on a couch behind her.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: This is worse than watching
dialog: beheading videos. Why do I do this?
speaker_heading: FARID
dialog: Those are not mine, I promise.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I know. You would know how to cover
dialog: your tracks, with all that

dialog: you're from.
text: Farid shakes his head patiently.
speaker_heading: DARIUS

text: Darius’ father, MR. BRITT, 50, enters the room.
speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: Dary, after dinner see if you can
dialog: figure out why the computer’s been
text: so slow. Videos take forever.
text: Darius nods, blank faced.
speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: Hey Farid, would one of those

speaker_heading: FARID
dialog: No, Mr. Britt. You’ve been too

speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: Out out?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s just this work thing.
speaker_heading: MR. BRITT

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I have no funk. Totally funkless.
speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: Something is wrong with you, honey.
dialog: But getting out there, being
dialog: social, it’1ll make you feel better.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: This is, this is - okay, what? What
dialog: is wrong with me?
speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: You're sad. I don’t know how to
text: describe it. There’s a cloud around
dialog: you. You’re very antisocial. And
dialog: you're a virgin.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: FARID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: Honey, even in my day twenty-one

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Oh my god, how do I eject? What

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: How do you know I’m not on

speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: I talked to Amy.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Why are you talking to my college

speaker_heading: MR. BRITT
dialog: We're friends on Facebook.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Ew. This is too much. I’m done. But
dialog: I’m staying to finish because I’m

scene_heading: INT. CLUB - NIGHT

text: listen to Jeff in awe.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Dude, it was fucking insane.
dialog: I knew from her friend that she had
dialog: herpes but I wasn’t supposed to
dialog: know, her friend swore me not to
dialog: say she told me, so I was in the

dialog: night trying to make up reasons why

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Why didn’t you just get the fuck
dialog: out of there?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: She was fucking naked and looked

dialog: quandary.
speaker_heading: JON
dialog: What’d you tell her?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I was saying all this shit like I
dialog: didn’t want to rush into anything
dialog: and get hurt. Meanwhile she’s like,
dialog: “I want you to fuck my ass.” And
dialog: I'm like, you're the kind of girl I
dialog: might fall in love with, let’s take
dialog: it slow.
text: The two dudes laugh hard. Darius observes like she’s on a

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: So excuse me for interrupting but
dialog: were we supposed to talk about the
dialog: story?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hold on, I’m gonna get a drink.
dialog: Talk to my buddy, Eric.

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Dude, your intern is sort of hot.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - LATER
text: Jon gets nasty on the dance floor, grinding obscenely with a

text: Darius ricochets her eyes away from the scene, still seated

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So do you watch Family Guy?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That shit is hilarious.
text: Darius nods. He nods.

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It would make me really happy if
dialog: you would not let this night end
dialog: and let me buy you one more drink.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No thanks.

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Is this normal? What’s he doing?

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Can’t you feel what you do to me?

speaker_heading: DARIUS

text: INSIDE THE POST OFFICE
text: A FIGURE, only visible from behind, opens box 322. Nothing
text: inside, he quickly closes it and steps away.
text: Darius cranes her neck but can’t get a good look at the
text: Figure exiting the front door.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s him.
text: The Figure gets into a piece of shit 80’s Datsun.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s the guy.
text: Darius starts Jeff's car.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Following him. You coming?
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What about Jeff? We should call
dialog: him.
text: Darius doesn’t care. She pulls forward as the Datsun drives

scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - DUSK
text: The Datsun drives across a suspension bridge to the mainland.
text: Darius follows, keeping her distance.
scene_heading: EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY - DUSK

text: across the field at the Datsun.
scene_heading: EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME
text: The Figure exits the car and stands on his toes to see
text: through a locked fence gate and into the compound. He picks
text: up a clipboard heavy with pages of scrawled notes.
text: This is KENNETH CALLOWAY, 28.
text: Not bad looking at all, but off. His hair, facial
text: expressions, style, everything, just a bit off. A few nucleic
text: acid sequences away from being a happy human.
dialog: 20.
text: He jots down a note, nods with a serious determination that
text: is slightly comical given his odd, mullet haircut, then gets
text: back into his car.
scene_heading: INT. U-SAVE - NIGHT
text: We track behind Kenneth pushing a pallet of detergent through
text: the lonely aisles of the 24 hour warehouse superstore.
text: Darius appears from behind, discreetly trailing him.
scene_heading: INT. U-SAVE - LATER
text: Kenneth speaks to SHANNON, 63, an aging black man with a
text: weary face, as they stock shelves. Darius pretends to browse
text: nearby as she listens.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The economy isn’t a fixed thing.
dialog: People think because that’s how it
dialog: is now then that’s how it’ll always
text: be, but they’re just looking at
dialog: this narrow band of time when if
dialog: you look at the big picture the
dialog: distribution of wealth has been
text: steadily spreading out from
dialog: aristocratic society to slave
dialog: economy to industrial and on and on
text: in both directions.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I gotta do a bathroom check,
dialog: brother. To be continued.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yeah, okay. It’s just amazing how
dialog: they can get these people to vote
dialog: against their economic interests.
dialog: Like it or not it’s historically
dialog: headed in one direction, they're
text: just delaying the inevitable.
text: Kenneth continues stocking. Darius walks past and eyeballs
text: his name tag as he stretches to reach the high shelf.
scene_heading: INT. U-SAVE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Darius approaches a SHIFT MANAGER, pen and card in hand.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Excuse me, I wanted to fill out a

dialog: name?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: SHIFT MANAGER
dialog: Aw jeez, what’d he do? I apologize
dialog: ma’am, he’s a little...
text: The Shift Manager points at his head.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No. It’s a positive comment. Like
text: complimenting him.
speaker_heading: SHIFT MANAGER
dialog: Oh. Oh? Good. Kenneth Calloway.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Thank you.
text: They look across the jewelry displays and spot Kenneth, who
text: makes a dramatic spin, scoops up a stray can on the floor and
text: re-stocks it with an unusual amount of flair and purpose
text: before continuing on with that oddly funny focus.
scene_heading: EXT. TIKI BAR - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. TIKI BAR - NIGHT

text: Arnau plays his on-line game on the laptop while sipping a
text: can of soda. Jeff looks over.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Are you kidding me with this? You
dialog: said you needed to check your e-
dialog: mail. And order a beer for God’s
dialog: sake.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: I’m just seeing who’s online.
text: Jeff pulls the laptop away. He sees an e-mail alert.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: Jeff checks his e-mail. He clicks on a message that directs
dialog: him to Facebook.com.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Alllright. She accepted my friend
dialog: request and she still lives here.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: (veading profile)
dialog: Who's Liz Cleary?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: She was like the local chick I used
dialog: to hang out with when my family
dialog: came here. Summer lovin’. Fuck she
text: was so tan and hot. And her hair
dialog: was always bleached white from the
dialog: sun. Man, if there’s one girl I
dialog: always wondered about it’s her.
text: Darius approaches from behind.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You creeps, drunk-stalking on
text: Facebook at a bar.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well there she is. Went all rogue,
dialog: huh? What’d you get?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Got his name, where he works.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nice. Good job. Tomorrow I’1l go in
text: undercover, pretend to answer his

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: (re: computer)
dialog: What’d you get?
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Basically he came here to hook up

dialog: high school.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Seriously?
text: Jeff shrugs.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I'd be weirded out if some guy
dialog: tracked me down after twenty years.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I would be weirded out if some guy
dialog: tracked you down too. Just knowing
dialog: there’s a guy out there who would
dialog: do that for you.
text: Jeff sips his rum and cola.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: And it wasn’t twenty years. It was

scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: The Acura stops in front of a small house that must’ve once

scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - SAME

text: Jeff turns off the car and grabs the digital recorder.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Can I go in, too?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You did good last night but let’s
dialog: let me handle this. I don’t want to
text: overwhelm the guy.
text: Jeff gets out and heads across the street. Darius and Arnau
text: watch through the windows.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: So, do you go out a lot back home,
dialog: like clubs and stuff?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: ARNAU

scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - SAME

scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - SAME
text: Darius opens her door.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I wanna see.
text: Arnau pauses for a moment before following her outside.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Darius and Arnau sneak around the leafless trees lining the

text: ON THE FRONT PORCH
text: Kenneth stops at the bottom of the porch.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Kenneth Calloway?

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You work out?
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I haven’t been able to lately.
dialog: Shoulder.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh, that sucks. But yeah, so I’m
dialog: here cause I saw your ad in the

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What’d you do? The credit header

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: The credit header?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I’ve had like tons of people, four
dialog: at least, show up at my door.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: KENNETH (cont'd)
dialog: Found my address connected to the

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah, me too. I didn’t know that’s
dialog: what they were called.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: They were all jerks, though.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So then the position is still open?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What’s your mission?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: My mission?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Reason. For going back.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well, who wouldn’t want to? I mean,
dialog: it’s an amazing opportunity.
dialog: (Kenneth waits for more)
dialog: You know...see dinosaurs with my
dialog: own eyes? Um, watch the gladiators?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You're just tryin’ to have a laugh
dialog: at me, like the rest of ‘em.
dialog: Sending me joke letters, wasting my
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No, I’m not making fun of you.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It takes guts, man. Real guts to do
dialog: what I need to do.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’ve got guts.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Can you look fear and danger in the
dialog: eye? Have you ever?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I live inside fear and danger.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Get out of here, man! Who do you
dialog: work for?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: For you?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s not a trick question,
dialog: jankhole! What do you know about

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What’d he say? Was he totally Van

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He’s the real deal. That ad is no

dialog: but there’s something wrong with
dialog: him. Definitely did not like me.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: So, what? That’s it?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh no, this just got good.
speaker_heading: BAR - DAY
text: eat burgers at the bar.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What makes you think he won’t slam
dialog: the door in my face, too?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You gotta be sincere and charm him.
dialog: He’s used to assholes coming to
dialog: make fun of him.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Also probably none of the other
dialog: people were beautiful girls.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Easy, Arnau.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But use that too. There’s something
dialog: off about him. You gotta go really
dialog: slow, like you're trapping a
dialog: skittish animal or something. Feel
dialog: him out. Lure him. Girls know how
dialog: to do that shit. Pretend he’s the
dialog: guy all your friends want to fuck
dialog: and you’re gonna be the one that
dialog: gets to because you act like you
dialog: don’t care.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You're dangling my vagina out there

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Then the story’s even better.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN VIEW - DUSK
text: The cold sun sets down beyond the town.
scene_heading: INT. U-SAVE - NIGHT
text: Tracking through the aisles behind Kenneth again. We see
text: Darius, casually browsing. She turns her head and makes eye
dialog: contact with Kenneth.
text: Kenneth is a bit thrown off by this young woman. He re-
text: focuses and turns left into another aisle.
scene_heading: INT. U-SAVE - SPORTING GOODS - LATER
text: Darius browses in the sporting section. Kenneth tentatively
text: appears and makes himself busy rearranging a shelf. Darius
text: glances over discreetly. Kenneth shyly meets her eyes.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Do you sell guns here?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What kind of gun?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I don’t know, something sexy and
dialog: affordable with killing power.
text: Kenneth digests these criterium with earnestness.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Hm. You probably want to go to C&R
dialog: Guns in Wilkins. We only have
text: airsoft and pellet guns.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What about one of those things with
text: the spiky ball at the end of the
dialog: chain? Does this kind of store
dialog: still carry those or did Rosie
dialog: O'Donnell ruin that too?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What exactly is the intended use?
dialog: Like, hunting? Or pest problem?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Well if your ad had been written
dialog: properly I'd have a better idea of
dialog: what I need.
text: Kenneth pauses, looks around, as if people are watching.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: My ad?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah. Sloppy. I hope you worked
dialog: harder on your calibrations.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: My calibrations are flippin’
dialog: pinpoint, okay?
text: Darius shrugs, not convinced. Kenneth begins pacing,
dialog: 28.
text: paranoid. He nervously picks up a pink rubber coated dumbbell
text: and starts distractedly doing curls with one arm.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: There’s people after me. How do I
dialog: know you don’t work for them?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Cause I’ve never worked for anyone
dialog: in my life.
text: Darius’ nonsense slides so slickly out of her mouth. Kenneth
text: chews on all of it like it has meaty meaning.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You ever faced certain death?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: If it was so certain I wouldn’t be
dialog: here, would I?
text: Kenneth is at a loss. She makes too much sense.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: This is a bad place to be talking.
dialog: I’m off in like fifteen minutes.
dialog: Let’s rendezvous.
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - NIGHT
text: Jeff sleeps, stretched out in the back seat. Arnau types on a

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Get down!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (scared)
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Get down! Don’t let him see you.
text: Arnau slides the seat back and ducks down, curling up in the
text: foot space. Jeff slides down onto the floor of the car.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Is he coming?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What the fuck is going on!
text: Darius spots the Datsun ahead of her. It flashes its brights
text: twice before pulling away.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I got him all juicy for me but he’s
dialog: all paranoid about everything.
text: Darius starts the car and follows Kenneth.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: He’s taking me to a secure location
dialog: to talk more. He’s all freaked out
dialog: though, he thinks people are
text: following him.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY LIMITS - NIGHT
text: The Acura follows the Datsun through the streets in the edges

scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - NIGHT
text: Jeff laughs in the back.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: If this guy’s a predator taking you

dialog: when me and Arnau come falling out
dialog: of here like some clown car.
text: The brake lights ahead of them FLASH RED as Kenneth stops in
text: an alley behind a supermarket. He gets out of the car and

text: Darius tenses.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What’s going on out there?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: He’s coming!
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Oh man.
text: Arnau curls into a smaller, frightened ball on the floor.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don’t let him see us. We'll blow it
dialog: all!
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What do I do?
text: Kenneth is almost to the Acura.
text: Then HEADLIGHTS light him up as a car pulls into the alley
text: behind them. Darius thinks fast and seizes the opportunity,
text: putting the car in drive.
text: Kenneth steps back she Darius accelerates. She shouts out the
text: window as she passes.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: We're being followed! Go!
dialog: 31.
text: Darius’ Acura speeds around the Datsun and turns a corner.
text: Kenneth’s eyes go wide at the innocently approaching car. He

scene_heading: INT. APPROACHING CAR - SAME
text: An OVERWEIGHT BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND watch Kenneth’s
text: panicked run to his car.
speaker_heading: BOYFRIEND
dialog: What the hell is this?
text: They slow as they approach. Kenneth opens his trunk and pulls

speaker_heading: BOYFRIEND
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: Git! Git! Go! Git out!
text: The Boyfriend wildly swerves his car and speeds away.
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - NIGHT
text: Darius pulls over on the side of the road around the corner.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Get out.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Where the fuck are we?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I don’t know. Just get out and I’1l
dialog: come pick you up after I’m done.
text: Jeff looks out the window and sees a row of run-down houses.
text: On one porch several BLACK MEN in wife beaters drink from

speaker_heading: ARNAU

dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: JEFF

scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S DATSUN - NIGHT
text: A shaking, spooked Kenneth drives with his cell to his ear.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s too hot here right now. I have
dialog: a gut feeling you’re not with them
dialog: but, but I just don’t know. I’m
dialog: gonna do a background check on you

speaker_heading: DARIUS (VO)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Yeah, okay.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Okay. Good-bye, uh, good night.
text: Kenneth hangs up. He leans over and looks at his face in the
text: rear view mirror. He pushes his ear back closer to his head
text: and studies himself, positioned so that only that half of his
text: head is visible in the mirror. He keeps driving.
scene_heading: INT. SEASIDE INN MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Darius wakes up to bright daylight filling the room. She gets

text: She rubs her eyes and checks her cell phone. Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. HAIR SALON - DAY
text: Jeff enters a salon where a half dozen STYLISTS do their
text: thing. A MAN and WOMAN occupy the RECEPTIONIST so Jeff drifts
text: back against the far wall and surveys the interior.
text: His hopeful eyes settle on a thin BLOND, who turns around and
text: reveals her face. Not her. Jeff scans the other stylists. He
text: finally focuses on a wood cutting of the name LIZ in one
text: stylists’ area. He studies the woman cutting hair there.
text: LIZ CLEARY, 30, is more than a little on the heavy side, has
text: brown hair, pale skin and generally does not match Jeff's
text: description of a sun-kissed beach blond hottie.
text: Jeff stares at her, the brightness fading from his eyes.
text: He turns and exits the salon.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: INT. TIKI BAR - DAY

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: She was, she was big, and like...
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Your age? I know, gross.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Let’s just say the years have not

dialog: shit all over her.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: When I go back in time with him I’m
dialog: finding you as a child and turning
dialog: you gay.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Did dude call yet?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don’t sweat it. He’ll call. Your
dialog: weird mojo clicked with his weird
dialog: mojo and you got him in the bag.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Should we like do a background
dialog: check on him, or something? Make
dialog: sure he’s not a murderer.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
text: He seems pretty harmless.
text: Jeff's eyes follow a young HOSTESS who walks toward them
text: before meeting up with her baby-faced BOYFRIEND, 17. A brief
text: reality check registers on Jeff's face. Darius sees.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Unlike perv-ison here. That girl’s

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What girl?
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Over Kenneth’s shoulder we see his computer screen.

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - BLEACHERS - NIGHT
text: The Friday night lights glisten off the wet grass in a medium-

text: We follow Darius through a crowd and up the bleacher stairs,
text: past the seated band, pounding their drums, to the top row.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Hi.
text: Kenneth puts down a seat pad next to him. Darius sits on it.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: KENNETH

dialog: I hope you don’t mind the noise.
dialog: It’s a good public place to meet.
dialog: They won’t be able to hear our
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I would have done the same. Who are
dialog: we dealing with here?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Can’t say for sure. They’ve been
dialog: following me, monitoring me since I
dialog: started this mission. Government
dialog: agents maybe. Probably.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Look. I just need to know if you’re
dialog: some kind of nutjob and this is all
dialog: bullshit or if you’re legit.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Oh I’m legit.
text: Darius gives him a dead stare.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Trust me. I didn’t put up that ad
dialog: just so people would make fun of
dialog: me. They wouldn’t do that to my
dialog: face!
text: Darius isn’t threatened by his awkward attempt at rage.
speaker_heading: DARIUS

speaker_heading: KENNETH

scene_heading: EXT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - OTHER BLEACHERS
text: Jeff and Arnau sit a good distance away, watching Darius from

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: God, I remember that smell. The
dialog: smell of grass, you know? And the
text: sound of the drums.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: You should give Liz a chance. That

dialog: wondering about her and you’re

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: All that time I was wondering
dialog: About her she didn’t look like a
dialog: female butcher.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: That's sad if the love of your
dialog: youth was just based on what a girl
text: looked like in her bikini.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Naw, it’s not like that. It wasn’t
dialog: her looks. She had the hottest
dialog: southern accent. And she was so, I
dialog: don’t know, warm. I don’t know how
dialog: to describe it.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: How do you know she’s still not?

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: ARNAU

speaker_heading: ARNAU

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'll go see Liz again if you start
dialog: talking to that chick right there.
speaker_heading: ARNAU

dialog: the...means of transportation?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Hold it in your holster for a sec.
dialog: I’m still making up my mind about
dialog: you as a potential partner. I have
dialog: to be completely certain I can
dialog: trust you before I include you in
dialog: certain information.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: That’s fair. What’s the time table?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: There’s a critical step soon. I
dialog: need to obtain certain materials to
dialog: facilitate the travel. I’m planning
dialog: to execute this within the next
dialog: week. As far as you’re concerned,
dialog: this is an evaluation period. I’m
dialog: not making any promises.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Why 2003? What are you going back
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Like I said, certain details will
dialog: have to wait.

text: nearest to them, then gives Darius a poignant look. She nods.

text: A DEPUTY SHERIFF walks up the bleacher steps. The Mom stands
text: and points out Jeff and Arnau.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Right there, officer.
text: Jeff downs a gulp of his beer and looks around, puzzled.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: These two.
text: The Deputy beckons to Jeff with his finger.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: You two! Up! Let’s go.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What’s the problem?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: You're drinking alcohol at a high
dialog: school football game. Come on.
text: Arnau takes a deep breath, his world ending around him.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: It’s a football game.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Smartass if I have to ask you one
dialog: more time!
scene_heading: EXT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - BLEACHERS
text: Heads are turning to see what the ruckus is about. Kenneth
text: and Darius look over and spot the Deputy shouting at Jeff.
text: Darius’ eyes go wide for a moment as Kenneth looks.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: These drums are giving me a
dialog: headache. Is there somewhere else
dialog: we can go?
text: Kenneth takes his eyes away from the scene.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - OTHER BLEACHERS
text: Who are now up, being escorted away by the Deputy.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That's right. Get them out of here!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don’t worry, he’s still gonna fuck
dialog: your daughter.
text: The Deputy WHIPS his red face around. Arnau shakes his head

dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: No, that’s not true.
scene_heading: EXT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - CONCESSION STAND
text: Darius and Kenneth weave through the crowd. They pass a group
text: of ROWDY TEENS, where a big BEEFHEAD KID, 18, roughhouses
text: with a JOCK.
text: Kenneth is BOWLED OVER by this big mutant, knocked to the
text: ground. The Jock then slaps Beefhead’s hand holding his
text: fountain soda, causing it to spill all over Kenneth.
text: The teens LAUGH. The Beefhead pretends to have remorse.
text: Darius helps Kenneth to his feet.
speaker_heading: BEEFHEAD
dialog: (through a big grin)
dialog: I’m sorry man. It was his fault.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: W-w-w-watch it, man.
speaker_heading: JOCK
dialog: (mock stuttering)
dialog: I-I-I can’t believe you just
dialog: assaulted a retard.
text: Kenneth is suddenly tight and uncomfortable, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You guys are total assholes.
text: Beefhead and Jock turn to face Darius.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I mean, how useless are you? At
dialog: least all the other fatasses are
dialog: out there playing football right
dialog: now. And this one?
text: Darius looks at the Jock, as if to speak, but SLAPS his
text: elbow, knocking his fountain soda into his own face.
speaker_heading: JOCK
dialog: You fucking bitch.
text: The other teens pull him back as Kenneth leads Darius away.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I'd have really messed them up if I
dialog: wasn’t trying to keep a low
dialog: profile. But I’m glad I got to see
dialog: your qualities.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: KENNETH (cont'd)
dialog: I think you’re ready for the next
dialog: phase, some basic training.
text: Kenneth spots the Jock approaching with another DEPUTY SHERIFF.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The heat’s moving in. That’s all
dialog: for tonight.
text: The Jock points her out to the Deputy Sheriff.
speaker_heading: JOCK
dialog: That’s her! She assaulted me with
dialog: my drink.
text: Darius turns back to Kenneth but he’s gone. One with the
text: night. She sighs and turns to face the music.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Jeff and Arnau are escorted out through a gated door in the
text: fence just as Darius is led through at the same time by her
text: own Deputy Sheriff. They all eye each other curiously.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Seriously, how'd you guys get
dialog: kicked out of a high school
dialog: football game?
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S DATSUN - NIGHT
text: Kenneth climbs into his seat. He looks at the Coke stain on
text: his shirt. He SLAPS the steering wheel over and over. This
text: isn’t the first time he’s been humiliated.
text: He performs a few karate moves with his arms, complete with
text: self-generated sound effects, re-playing in his mind what he
dialog: wished he could’ve done to those guys.
text: The driver's side window FALLS in its slot, disappearing into
text: the door. Kenneth stops and looks at his broken window.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: BLAM! Darius fires a .22 handgun in a remote woodland. A
text: bottle on a fallen tree shatters. Kenneth nods.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Nice. You smoked it.
dialog: 41.
text: Kenneth pushes PLAY on a cassette deck boom box he’s hung
text: from a branch by its strap.
text: Cheap Trick’s cheesy 80’s anthem “MIGHTY WINGS” plays, as
text: recorded off of the radio two decades ago.
text: Kenneth nods to the music, really finding the elusive zone
text: through its lyrics, then fires his gun at a bottle. The top
text: chips off and he finishes it off with two more shots.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I’m getting better than you. All I
dialog: need is one shot.
text: Kenneth, insulted, takes her joke personally.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s easy to shoot standing still
dialog: with no pressure.
text: Kenneth runs a few steps, then takes a dramatic stance with
text: both knees bent, both arms extending his gun out, and FIRES.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: But you have to be able to shoot on
dialog: the move...
text: Kenneth spins and fires off two more shots.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
text: ..-with the heat flying by...
text: He drops to a knee and FIRES, then pulls out a backup gun.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: .-.-do what I’m doing. Come on.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Really?
text: Kenneth ducks behind a tree, faking like he’s under fire,
text: then spins out from the cover and shoots a bottle. It all
text: looks very awkward and slowly paced.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Come on!
text: Darius imitates him, but with only a fraction of his effort
dialog: and intensity.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Smoke it! Come on, smoke it!
text: Darius fires some shots.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
text: They’re closing in. Smoke ‘em.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Okay, just shut up.
text: Darius finally hits a bottle.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yeah! You smoked him.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yes, I smoked him. He’s smoked.
text: An enraged MAN IN A FLANNEL storms through the trees.
scene_heading: MAN IN FLANNEL
dialog: Hey! Stop your shooting!
text: They freeze as the man screams toward them.
scene_heading: MAN IN FLANNEL
dialog: My house is back there! You put a
dialog: hole in my swimming pool you
dialog: jackasses!
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Should I smoke him?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Run, go!
text: Darius and Kenneth take off into the woods. The Man in
text: Flannel huffs and puffs but just stops, hands on hips.
text: Running side by side, Darius sneaks a sideways peek at
text: Kenneth’s face as he runs. She can’t help but burst out in
text: laughter at the comical severity of his expression as he
text: breathes rapidly in and out through his O-lips.
text: Kenneth tones it down as they slow their clip.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What?
text: She just keeps laughing good-naturedly. Kenneth cracks a
text: smile, too. Soon they’re both laughing hard.
scene_heading: EXT. LIZ’S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hello, Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Jeff! Oh my goodness! Look at you.
dialog: Come here!
text: She's all sweet southern goodness, like a hot cotton T-shirt
text: right out of the dryer. She hugs him fondly, looks him over.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m sorry about yesterday. I’m here
dialog: on work and something came up, I
dialog: just couldn’t make it.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I was so sad when you didn’t come

scene_heading: INT. LIZ'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Liz draws him into the house.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This is the best smelling house
dialog: I've ever been inside.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Well what do the houses in New York
dialog: smell like?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Like Chinese food.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I just have to get on the computer
dialog: and read this magazine of yours.
dialog: That’s so exciting, I always knew
dialog: you were going to do something
dialog: special with your life.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Special? Easy now.
text: Jeff winces and rubs his neck.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What’s wrong with your neck, honey?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m sharing a bed with my intern. I
text: sleep like a stiff corpse, trying
dialog: not to rub ass with the guy.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You need heat on that...Oh! I have
text: pies in the oven.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Wow, you made them? Like with flour
dialog: and that roller thing?
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: KENNETH

dialog: initiation.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I was born ready.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I like your intensity. You’re like,
dialog: no-nonsense.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: There’s no sense in nonsense.
dialog: Especially when the heat’s hot.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Exactly.
text: Kenneth nods. She’s speaking his language.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: They wouldn’t be making fun of me
dialog: if they saw us just now. Sometimes
dialog: I wish I was like a superhero that
dialog: doesn’t stop crime, but like steps
dialog: in when someone’s getting made fun
dialog: of and stops that, you know? Not
dialog: me, but other people that get made
dialog: fun of, that aren’t tough like me.
dialog: 45.
text: Darius looks at Kenneth in a way we don’t recognize from her.
text: Something changes here. She’s no longer making fun of him.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: But you’re pretty good with the
dialog: gun. No, you’re damn good.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I like your intensity, too. You've
dialog: got good moves.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I do have to know what you’re going
dialog: back for, though.
text: Darius looks at him questioningly.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I have a certain responsibility to
dialog: keep.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Right. That’s fair. Okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m going back to stop my mother
dialog: from dying when I was fourteen.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: How'd she die?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: She was killed by some guy. Just
dialog: some guy at a gas station took her
dialog: and killed her.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Oh man. Like a random thing?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah. Well, no. She was driving
dialog: home. It was late, like after
dialog: midnight. And she called me to tell
dialog: me she was on her way home. And I -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I asked her to stop and get me some
dialog: chocolate milk. Because I had to
dialog: have chocolate milk. So like five
dialog: minutes later she calls me from the
dialog: gas station and says they had it
text: and she was coming home. Her voice
dialog: was so excited. Like she was so
dialog: happy to get this chocolate milk
dialog: for me. And I was just like
dialog: whatever. I wasn’t even nice.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DARIUS (cont'd)
dialog: And that was it. Last time I talked
dialog: to her. So, no. It wasn’t quite
dialog: random that she was there.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: But it wasn’t your fault.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: That’s what they tell me.
text: Silent beat. Kenneth nods affirmatively to himself.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You're ready. I trust you, Darius.
text: A speck of guilt in Darius’ eyes.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Good. You should.
scene_heading: INT. LIZ'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Liz has a heating pad wrapped around Jeff's neck as she rubs
text: the trouble spot. A half eaten pie rests on the table.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You bake pies like this and you’re
dialog: not married? What’s going on there?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I was married. Married this boy
dialog: when I was twenty and that didn’t
dialog: work out.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He was a ball player, so I followed
dialog: him around everywhere his team
dialog: went, he was in the minor leagues
dialog: for four years. I was the good
dialog: little wife, working to support the
dialog: both of us, baking cookies for the
dialog: team.
text: Jeff takes a bite of pie, neck wrapped in heating pad, Liz
text: massaging his shoulder. He’s on a cloud.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Ohh, cookies, too?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: But as soon as Cameron got called
dialog: up to the Marlins and started
dialog: making money he started running
dialog: around with those Miami girls and
dialog: that was that. I came back here.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What a dick.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Well, we were both young. It
dialog: happens. Hey, do you have a free
dialog: night while you're here? I want to
dialog: make you a homemade dinner.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (nearly cooing)
dialog: I want to eat that homemade dinner.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: Darius and Kenneth at a booth in the country kitchen.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s important that we don’t abuse
dialog: the power that will come with our
dialog: knowledge of the future. No matter
dialog: how tempting it might be to be the
text: first poster on a message board to
dialog: “find” all the secrets of the
dialog: newest video games. Or to say, you
dialog: know, hey I think that Battlestar
dialog: Galactica show might really be
dialog: awesome before anyone else is
text: talking about it.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What about, for the betterment of
dialog: future society, assassinating
dialog: certain celebrities when they were
dialog: vulnerable before they got famous
dialog: and got entourages?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Absolutely not. We must stick to
dialog: the plan.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: So when do you fill me in on it?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
text: Soon. The action’s getting hungry.
dialog: Real hungry.
dialog: 48.
text: Darius spots a KID, 5, at a table licking the sugar bottle.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Oh my god.
text: The Kid proceeds to place the whole rim of the salt shaker in
text: his sloppy mouth while his MOM ignores him.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I can’t eat here.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Do you see this mutant kid? I’m
text: getting nauseous. I can’t look.
text: Kenneth turns to look and Darius notices his left ear off
text: kilter. It sticks out in an odd angle.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Oh. Something... your ear -
text: Kenneth’s eyes go rigid with fear. He feels at his ears, then
text: SNAPS the ear back into place.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Oh yeah. It, uh.
text: Kenneth is running out of breath, near panic attack.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s cool. We can eat here.
text: Kenneth’s panic mixes with anger and he curses at himself.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Stupid! Forget it, it’s off.
text: Kenneth gets up and storms out of the diner.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER - CONTINUOUS
text: Darius follows him out as he rushes to his car.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Dude, what’s wrong?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I’m sorry. I changed my mind.
dialog: You're not the right one.
dialog: 49.
text: Kenneth gets into his car. Darius runs to the window but he
text: pulls away. She stops, confused.
text: The car pulls onto the road, begins to speed away, then
text: brakes. It finally stops on the side of the road.
text: Darius watches for a moment, then walks over to the car.
text: Kenneth has his head on the wheel. Darius leans down.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenny, what’s the deal?
text: He sits back, takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s fake.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: My ear.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s fake?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I was born with only one.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Is that what this is about?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: They used to make fun of me. All
dialog: the other kids. My parents could
dialog: only afford one prosthetic so they
dialog: waited until I stopped growing.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth, I don’t care. It’s nothing
dialog: to be embarrassed about. Shit,
dialog: people made fun of me, too. I wax
dialog: my lip and shave my arms. I know
dialog: it’s not the same, but I get it,
dialog: you know? I had a freaking mustache
dialog: until I was fifteen.
text: Darius places a gentle hand on Kenneth’s tense shoulder. He
text: reacts like it’s electricity, like human contact is something
dialog: he’s starved of, and he just tasted the best kind there is.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: We can still do this if we just
dialog: never talk about it again. Please.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Okay.

scene_heading: INT. SEASIDE INN MOTEL ROOM - EVENING
text: Darius types on the laptop while Arnau jots down notes.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: (to Darius)
dialog: So then what’d you tell him your
dialog: reason for going to 2003 is?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I just made up some story.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Yeah, what’s the story?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I told him I wanted to go back and
dialog: stop my parents from getting
dialog: divorced.
text: Jeff enters the room, a bounce in his step.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: There he is.
text: Jeff slaps Arnau’s back.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Arnau, the man.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Whatever I’m doing, I’m feeling
dialog: fucking fantastic doing it.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Did you just have sex with that fat
dialog: girl you came here to stalk?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No we didn’t. We shared nice
dialog: conversation. And she’s not that
dialog: fat.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: A girl's beauty is, it’s in the
dialog: eyes, you know? And that never goes
dialog: away.
text: Darius does the jack-off motion.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No wonder you didn’t nail her, with
dialog: lines like that.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: So anyways, for the article we
dialog: should know what’s wrong with this
dialog: guy. Like low I.Q., or emotional
dialog: disorder, or whatever it is.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What makes you think he’s ‘got’
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: ARNAU
text: He thinks he’s going back in time.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: So? Did Einstein have something
dialog: wrong with him? Or David Bowie?
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Maybe he’s just a guy trying to do
dialog: something new. What makes that such
dialog: a freak show?
text: Jeff watches Darius with curiosity as he cracks a beer.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So you think it’s normal?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I don’t know. Is it normal that
dialog: your interns do all the work on
dialog: your story? Is that how all your
dialog: articles get written?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m better at running things.
dialog: Leading. I’m not good with like
dialog: words and shit and making sentences
dialog: sound good.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: That's probably kind of important,
dialog: being that your job is writing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I never thought of myself as a
dialog: writer. I got the job off of
dialog: something I wrote in college, but
dialog: it took me all fucking year to
dialog: write that thing. And it only
dialog: turned out so good because it was
dialog: about the one thing I could get
dialog: into and really write well about.
dialog: It’s funny how you can do one thing
dialog: and you just become that guy. Your
dialog: whole life gets defined by it. And
dialog: it was just like an accident in the
dialog: first place.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What was it about?
text: Darius’ cell RINGS. She looks at the name.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s him. I have to go.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. VAN - NIGHT
dialog: Kenneth and Darius.
speaker_heading: KENNETH

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I'll breach the outer perimeter,
dialog: disable their security measures,
dialog: penetrate the target, locate and
text: secure the package, then rendezvous
dialog: with you at the getaway point. The
dialog: details are all in these notes.
text: Darius flips through the notes. Page after page of diagrams,
text: maps, lists, and action drawings of Kenneth fighting guards.
text: Kenneth pulls a black mask over his face. He gets out of the
text: van. Darius follows him with her eyes as he runs to the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH FACILITY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kenneth flies down a long hallway in a panic, looking a bit
text: lost as he pushes the cart as fast as he can.
text: He turns a corner wildly and rolls into a large lounge area
text: where over a dozen EMPLOYEES celebrate a CO-WORKER’S birthday
text: with cake and food.
text: Kenneth pulls his cart to a stop. No one notices him. He
text: backs the cart out the way he came, completely unseen.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH FACILITY - STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT
text: The Guard lays down on a mattress made from boxes and foam
text: pads and gets comfortable.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH FACILITY - STOCK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kenneth wheels the cart into a store room and begins loading
text: it up with medical devices about the size and shape of old

scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH FACILITY - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Employees from the party chat in the hallway as Kenneth

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Crap, stick?
scene_heading: EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT
text: Kenneth wheels the cart out through the back doors onto the

text: to Kenneth, while ONE GUY is on his cell phone, gesturing as
text: if giving play-by-play of what’s going on.
text: Kenneth’s head whips around searching for the getaway.
text: We see a festive sign posted on the door behind him
text: announcing a birthday party for ELLA PARKS tonight.
text: The van jumps and jerks its way close to the loading dock.
text: Kenneth wheels the cart to the back, opens the rear doors and
text: spills the contents of the cart into the back.
text: He jumps inside the van and shuts the doors.
dialog: 55.
text: The employees at the back door watch the van pull away, then

text: again. It starts, JUMPS forward and SPEEDS out of the lot.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT
text: The van is parked next to Kenneth’s Datsun in a dry riverbed
text: under a rural highway overpass. Darius watches Kenneth
text: hurriedly transfer the lasers from the van to the Datsun.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What do we do with the van?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Leave it. I stole it from a lot.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth, you didn’t hurt anyone in
dialog: there, did you?
text: Kenneth shakes his head.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: No casualties.
text: Darius grips Kenneth’s arm.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You're shaking.

speaker_heading: KENNETH

scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S DATSUN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kenneth steers around a bend to a dirt path leading up to the

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: No!
text: There’s a night road work crew ahead of them. Bright stand
text: lights illuminate a traffic light in need of repair as a
text: WORKER is raised up in a crane to reach it.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s fine. They won't know.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: We can’t have any witnesses to

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: KENNETH (cont'd)
dialog: The people that are after me will
dialog: be on full alert after tonight.
text: They’1l put the pieces together.
text: Kenneth reaches the verge of another panic attack.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Dangit! Why didn’t I plan for this?
dialog: This is not good. Not good!
text: Darius puts her hand on his back.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: We'll just wait here until they’re
dialog: done. It’1ll be okay.
text: Kenneth nods, breathes deeply, then steers the car behind
text: some brush and turns it off.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m just so close now.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s cool. I know.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s a girl.
text: Darius looks over at him.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I’m going back for a girl.
dialog: Belinda St. Sing.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Who was she?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: My first girlfriend. Only one I
dialog: ever wanted to have. We were both
dialog: twenty-one. Her birthday was the
dialog: same day in April as mine is in
dialog: October. She was really, really
dialog: pretty. When she first started
dialog: working at the restaurant I didn’t
dialog: really think about her. But then
dialog: she was so nice to me. She’d get me
dialog: food. She’d talk to me while I
text: cleaned up. Everyone else was off
text: getting ready to go out, all her
dialog: friends. But she’d sit there on the
dialog: stool and talk to me.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: She died. Some jerk, some a-hole
text: jerk in a band who got drunk after
text: his show, crashed his car into her
dialog: house one night. A night I was
dialog: supposed to be there but wasn’t. I
dialog: should’ve been there.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You would've just gotten hurt, too.
dialog: It’s not your fault.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Everyone always says there’s plenty
dialog: of other girls out there. But it
dialog: doesn’t work like that. It’s not
dialog: just about the girl, it’s about a
dialog: time and a place. You just can’t go
dialog: find that again.
text: Darius leans back in her seat, sleepy, and somehow so
text: comfortable in this odd place and company.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I like your reason for going back,
dialog: Kenneth.

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Fucking lasers?
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What kind of lasers?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I don’t know I’m not a freaking

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This guy’s awesome. He’s over there

speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: He’s not a freaking Storm Trooper.
speaker_heading: JEFF

dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: I gotta go see this shit.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S SHED - DAY
text: Darius, Jeff and Arnau sneak to the locked shed next to the
text: house. Jeff tries to climb up the shed wall to peer in
text: through the crack between the roof and wall.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Isn't this like violating his
dialog: privacy?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: I can’t see down far enough.
text: Jeff drops back down to the ground.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What are you building in there,
dialog: Kenny?
text: Arnau, on look-out, frantically combines as many warning
text: gestures as his mind holds: throat slash, incomplete pass,
dialog: thumbs down, etc.
text: Jeff and Darius crouch and hold their breath as KENNETH
text: emerges from the shed and locks the many locks behind him.
text: He carries a large box to his car and loads it into the trunk.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shit. Get the fuck outta here.
text: A SUNGLASSED MAN in dark slacks and jacket appears from the
text: trees beyond Kenneth’s house and runs across the street. He
text: gets into a black sedan parked around the corner.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Who's this asshole?
dialog: 59.
text: Kenneth’s Datsun drives away. The black sedan slowly pulls
text: out onto the main street and follows his car.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
text: They're following him. Oh my God.
dialog: There really are people following
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN VIEW STREETS - DAY
text: Kenneth’s Datsun turns right onto a residential street.
text: Moments later the Sedan does the same.
text: Next comes the Acura, Jeff behind the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S DATSUN - DAY
text: Kenneth checks his rear-view mirror and sees the Sedan a good
text: distance behind him. He makes another turn.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY
text: The man in sunglasses nods to his nearly identical partner.
dialog: We'll call them JONES and SMITH.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Stay back. Don’t spook him.
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - DAY

speaker_heading: ARNAU

scene_heading: INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY

speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Shit, he saw us. Go!

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I think we’re being trailed.
text: Jones spins around.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Huh?
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - DAY
text: The Sedan in front of them quickly speeds up and turns around

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shit, they’re on to us.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: On to what?
scene_heading: EXT. DEAD END STREET - DAY
text: A LOCAL WOMAN pulls her car to the end of her driveway,
text: braking for the Datsun to drive by.
text: Kenneth reaches the dead end and does a tight U-Turn, kicking
text: up dirt and tearing up the corner of someone’s lawn.
text: The local woman slams on her brakes before pulling out,
text: surprised by Kenneth’s quick turnabout.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY
text: Smith guns the sedan around the corner onto the dead end
text: street and swerves to avoid swiping the nose of the local
text: woman’s car. He hits the brakes hard as Kenneth drives past.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Shiiiit.
text: Kenneth glares at them as he passes and continues in the
text: opposite direction.
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - DAY
text: Jeff takes the corner tight and fast. The Datsun appears and

text: Jeff and Darius duck their heads down.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don’t let him see you!
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S DATSUN - DAY
text: Kenneth looks into the Acura as he steers around it and onto
text: the main street. All he sees is Arnau, frozen like a deer in
text: the backseat, staring back. The front looks completely empty.
text: Kenneth, confused, speeds away.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - DAY
text: Arnau exchanges the same confused looks with Smith and Jones,
text: who slowly drive past before speeding away.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What the hell, did you see those
dialog: guys?
speaker_heading: ARNAU
text: They look like government agents or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: (amazed)
text: He’s really being followed.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Holy shit is this guy for real?
scene_heading: EXT. COASTAL PICNIC AREA - DAY
text: Jeff sips on a milk shake as Arnau types on the laptop on a
dialog: picnic table.
text: Darius’ cell RINGS. She answers. Jeff hovers. She eyes him
text: and turns away for privacy.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth? Are you okay?
text: Jeff shoots an arched eyebrow at Darius.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: Kenneth paces, cell to his ear.
speaker_heading: KENNETH

speaker_heading: KENNETH (VO) (cont'd)

dialog: It’s almost time.
text: Click. Darius lowers the phone.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Look at you.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Are you in love with this guy?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You're getting all worked up about
dialog: this whole thing. What’s been going
dialog: on with you two when you’re off
dialog: alone?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I’m doing what you made me do.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Maybe that was his plan the whole
dialog: time. Whoever answered that ad
dialog: would have to be his soulmate.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
text: It was like a personal ad.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: E-harmony for lunatics.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You guys are assholes. Take me to

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oooh, for a picnic?
scene_heading: EXT. U-SAVE - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Darius and Kenneth on the outer edge of the vast U-Save lot.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
text: It’s obvious they see a threat in
dialog: me possessing this kind of power.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Who are they?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s not clear what entity they
dialog: represent. Their presence here
text: accelerates the plan, though.
dialog: 63.
text: Kenneth hands Darius a wide shoebox wrapped in a string.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: They’1l have one of their guys at
dialog: every door, but you should be fine.
dialog: I don’t think they’ve ID’d you yet.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Got it.
scene_heading: EXT. U-SAVE - DAY
text: Darius carries the box inside. She can’t help but eye the

scene_heading: INT. U-SAVE - STOCKROOM - DAY
text: A STOCKBOY leads Darius into a back storeroom and points out
text: the weary old black man, Shannon, who we saw Kenneth talking
text: to at work earlier. Darius approaches.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Shannon?
text: Shannon leans a dolly against a wall and turns.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Yes ma’am.
text: Darius holds out the box.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: This is from Kenneth. He wanted me
dialog: to give it to you.
text: Shannon, surprised, slowly takes the box from her.
text: watches him slide the string off and open the lid.
dialog: She
text: Inside are thousands of dollars. Looks like every last dollar
dialog: Kenneth could possibly have.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Kenneth said to give this to me?
text: Darius, shocked as much as Shannon is, nods.
dialog: 64.
text: Shannon tries to speak, but is overcome by emotion. He shakes
text: his head, his tired eyes fighting off tears.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I don’t even know how to thank the
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You tell him...
text: Shannon chokes up.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I know. I’11 tell him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: And tell him I hope he gets
dialog: wherever he’s goin’ an’ it all
dialog: works out how he wants.
scene_heading: EXT. U-SAVE - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Darius walks through the lot. Her face is a bit blank, a bit
text: overwhelmed. She looks so much softer than when we met her.
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S DATSUN - SAME
text: Darius gets in and just stares at Kenneth, a smile in her
text: eyes, trouble in the rest of her face. Kenneth looks back at
text: her, then the road, then her.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. LIZ’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Jeff sits at a picnic table while a wholesome feast is laid
text: out before him by Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It sounds dangerous. Her running
dialog: around with this guy and these
text: other men following him around.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Ah, she'll be fine. There’s still
dialog: leftover pie, right?
dialog: 65.
text: Liz brings him an icy bottle of beer.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you remember when you talked me
dialog: into going on that boat with that
dialog: strange man?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah, see. Nothing bad happened to
dialog: us. We got to go wake boarding, had
dialog: a good time.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He spent all day taking photographs
dialog: of me in my bathing suit!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh yeah, he never did mail those to
dialog: us like he said he would, did he?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No! He was probably a sexual
dialog: predator and you threw me right to
dialog: him so you could waterski.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It worked out, right? Fair trade.
dialog: I’m sure he got some pleasure out
dialog: of those photos.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He took hundreds!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How did I not even think that was
dialog: weird at the time?
text: Liz falls down into his lap playfully.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He took a lot of you so he might’ve
dialog: been getting pleasure out of those
dialog: ones, too.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well of course he did. I was ripped
dialog: back then.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh you were not. You were scrawny.
text: Jeff forces her hand onto his chest.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah, well feel me now.
text: Liz rolls her eyes. Jeff kisses her.
scene_heading: EXT. BOY SCOUT CAMP - DAY
text: The Datsun parks in a remote wooded area where a small camp
text: area consisting of open, wood framed shelters blends into the
text: fall foliage. Darius and Kenneth get out of the car.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The place we’re going is a short
dialog: walk, maybe five minutes from here.
dialog: You have to make sure you remember
dialog: how to get here.
text: Darius strolls along the camp shelters.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Here.
text: Kenneth leads her to one of the shelters where a sleeping bag
text: lies next to a duffle. Some books are scattered on the wooden
text: floor next to a cooler. Kenneth opens the cooler and takes a
text: local trail map out of it.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: This is your stuff?
text: Kenneth draws on the map with a pen.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yeah, the Boy Scouts don’t use this
dialog: place after September so I just
dialog: kind of set up here, like having a
dialog: second home to come spend some
dialog: nights, you know. Clear the head.
text: Darius digs into one of the boxes and pulls out a an old
dialog: zither, a kind of flat, square guitar that’s laid on your
dialog: knees when you play it.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: There, I drew the location on here
dialog: so you'll always be able to get
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You play this?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I’ve been trying. Belinda really
dialog: loved music. Back when we were
dialog: together I always wished I could
dialog: play her something. My dad had one
dialog: of these so I’ve been learning some
dialog: songs for when I see her again. I
dialog: want to be a better man for her
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Play something.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Oh, nah.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Come on. You need to practice on
dialog: somebody. I’1l tell you if it’s
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yeah, you're right.
text: Kenneth takes the zither and sits down, laying it across his
text: knees. He begins to play.
dialog: It’s Van Halen’s When It’s Love but it’s hard to recognize,
text: slowed down. He plays like a savant, technically perfect,
dialog: even adding notes to fill spaces.
text: Darius watches with wonder. The sound is amazing. Then he
text: begins to SING.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Everybody's lookin’ for somethin’,
dialog: somethin’ to fill the holes...
text: His voice isn’t great, but not bad either. He sings softly,
text: sincerely. It’s at once ridiculous and beautiful. He wraps.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Oh, oh, oh, when it’s love.
text: His shy eyes can’t even look up at Darius.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: So anyway, that’s one of them. I’ve
dialog: learned like thirty of ‘em.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth it’s so good.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DARIUS

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh my God. That’s the best I’ve
dialog: ever had. I’m not lying.
text: Liz giggles.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That’s what you said about the
dialog: fried chicken.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m so serious.
text: Jeff props himself up and gazes at her, his brain loaded with
dialog: food and sex pleasure chemicals.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don’t now how long I’ve been
dialog: thinking about this right here.
dialog: Ever since I used to come down here
dialog: in the summers I never met a girl
dialog: like you. You’ve been this
dialog: character in my head like from an
dialog: old fairy tale. Like you were the
dialog: last of a kind that doesn’t exist
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No, I’m so serious, I wrote a story
dialog: about you. Like how love never
dialog: feels as good as the first one, and
dialog: you can’t ever get that high again.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You’re so cute.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I want you to come to New York.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I want to figure this out, make it
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. You’re not in
dialog: your right mind right now.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm completely sincere about this,
dialog: Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Jeff. As soon as you drive out of
dialog: this place you’re not going to want
dialog: me there anymore.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Come on, don’t you feel this?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s a fantasy. This is fantasy
dialog: time. I’m dating a real solid man
dialog: right now. He works at the post
dialog: office, he grew up here. This isn’t
dialog: a fantasy world for him. He can
dialog: take care of me.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So can I.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Jeff, I’ve been through that
dialog: before. I’m too old to take those
dialog: chances again.
text: Jeff stands up, now becoming angry.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So no? You’re saying no?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This is un-fucking-believable. I
text: stretched my ass out on the line
dialog: here and look what I get. Fucking
dialog: punched in the face. Hey asshole,
dialog: follow your heart. Listen to your
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JEFF (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, ok, what’s that you say, heart?
dialog: You just got punked and now you
text: look like a giant dildo.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Jeff, I think you’re acting a
dialog: little crazy about this.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Goddammit!
text: Jeff punches the air, but tweaks his back muscle, and doubles
text: over holding his neck.
scene_heading: EXT. LIZ’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jeff marches away from Liz, fuming. She watches him go with
text: sympathy from the porch.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Kenneth leads Darius down a hill to an old, large tree on the
text: edge of a wide lake. A rope swing with a wood disk at the end
text: hangs from a branch that stretches over the water.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Here it is.
text: Kenneth finds a large knot in the tree, reaches his arm up
text: into it, pulling away a small wood covering. He strains until
text: he pulls an old army ammunition tin out of the tree hollow.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: When we go back in time, if
dialog: anything bad happens, if anyone
dialog: gets hurt, you mess up, the people
dialog: after me catch us, anything bad -
dialog: come here and put a note inside.
dialog: I’'1l do the same, then we know what
dialog: went wrong and we can fix it. Got
dialog: it? This is very important.
text: Darius nods. Kenneth looks inside the box. It’s empty.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: So far so good.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: This was here in 2003?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: It’s been here since I was a kid. I
dialog: used to camp back there when I was
dialog: in the Boy Scouts.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: KENNETH (cont'd)
dialog: Some of the other kids used to make
dialog: fun of me for bringing my Star Wars
dialog: figures with me, cause I didn’t
dialog: want them to be alone back at my
dialog: house, so they’d take them and
text: throw them into the fire and laugh
dialog: at me for sleeping with them. This
dialog: was before my martial arts
dialog: training, of course. I carved out
dialog: this hiding spot for them so I
dialog: could still take them with me and
dialog: no one would hurt them. I’d just
dialog: sneak down here at night and take
dialog: them out, then put them back in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I wish I could see you when you
dialog: were a little kid.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: (snort laughs)
dialog: I was not as impressive as I am
dialog: now.
text: Kenneth replaces the box back into the tree. Darius runs her
text: finger along the wooden disk at the end of the rope, tethered
text: to the trunk by a nail.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Me and my dad made that, too.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What do you do? Swing?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yeah, get on.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No, I’m not much of a swinger.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Come on, get on.
text: Kenneth unhooks the swing from the nail and holds the disk
text: flat for her.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Come on. I played that song.
text: Darius reluctantly swings her leg around the rope and
text: straddles it, seated on the disk, feet dangling a few feet
text: off the ground while Kenneth holds it in place.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Hold on!
text: Kenneth SPRINTS forward toward the pond, running down the
text: hill, pushing Darius on the swing. Their faces are a few feet
text: apart, her eyes wide with surprise, his wide with the glee
dialog: you normally only see in a child’s.
text: Kenneth pushes her to the lake’s edge and lets go.
text: Darius, hands tight on the rope, swings free and far out over
dialog: the water.
text: She swings back over land. Kenneth laughs as he chases her.
text: He grabs onto the disk and tucks up his legs as she begins to
text: swing back to the lake, now with Kenneth hanging on.
text: The two of them soar over the lake. At the highest point
text: Kenneth lets go and splashes into the water.
text: Darius swings back over the land, half screaming, half
text: laughing. Kenneth motions her into the water with his hands.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Come on! Jump!
text: Darius makes another pass over him, shaking her head ‘no.’
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: How else are you going to get off?
text: Darius swings over the land, then clenches her eyes shut as
text: she flies back over the water. She pushes off. The swing goes
text: back alone. She plunges into the cold water.
text: She splashes to the surface and swats water at Kenneth, who
text: laughs.
text: To the music, a series of shots:
text: -- Kenneth holding Darius’ hand, helping her out of the
dialog: water.
text: -- Kenneth giving a soaked Darius the only towel out of the
text: back of the Datsun and helping wrap her up in it.
text: -- Kenneth, shivering cold, gets a fire started in the camp
text: fire pit as night falls. Darius, snug in her towel, laughs as

dialog: 73.
text: -- They sit by the fire. Kenneth lights the wing of a paper
text: airplane and sends it on a fiery flight.
text: Darius takes his head in her hands so softly. He’s paralyzed.
text: Her hands run over his ears. Kenneth’s hand defensively grabs
text: her wrist to pull it away from his prosthetic, but then he
text: relaxes and lets her arm go.
text: She kisses him.

scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: Jeff and Arnau have a drink at the bar. Jeff scans the joint.

scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
text: Jeff exits the Acura. A group of three GIRLS and one SOUTHERN
text: GOTH GUY wave him over from the corner of the storefront.
text: Arnau watches from the car.
text: The most audacious of this group, LINSEY, holds out a twenty

scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - NIGHT
text: Arnau is squeezed in the back seat next to a DECENT GIRL, her

speaker_heading: ARNAU

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You don’t even know what you’re

speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: No, you don’t! You wouldn’t do

speaker_heading: JEFF

scene_heading: SEASIDE INN MOTEL - NIGHT

scene_heading: SEASIDE INN MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: I’m sorry.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hey, pillow fight!
text: Jeff smacks the Decent Girl with a pillow, then smacks Arnau,

text: Jeff looks at the Goth Guy.
speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: This Belinda St. Sing? The

scene_heading: EXT. SEASIDE INN MOTEL - MORNING

dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: She is alive and well. Lives a

speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: How? What do you mean?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I mean she’s alive. Bridgette
dialog: called her and set an interview

text: Darius composes her face and makes busy with her bag.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I know he’s crazy. So she’s alive.
dialog: Whatever. I want to do the

scene_heading: EXT. BELINDA’S HOUSE - DAY

text: Arnau sleeps in the backseat.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You sure you got this, kiddo?
text: Darius nods.
scene_heading: EXT. BELINDA’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Darius stands on the porch of a suburban home in a lush,

speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Hi. Darius, right?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah, like the Hootie and the

speaker_heading: BELINDA

scene_heading: EXT. BELINDA’S HOUSE - PATIO - DAY
text: Darius sits across a patio table from Belinda.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: He worked at Anderson's, a
dialog: restaurant I was waiting at during
dialog: college. Really sweet. So different
dialog: than any of the other guys. All of
dialog: my friends were like, why are you
dialog: dating this guy? But he was really
dialog: fun, and funny. I remember he had
dialog: all these little insecurities. He'd
dialog: never let me touch his head. And he
dialog: got real serious real fast, you
dialog: know? I guess we’ve all had one of
dialog: those guys, right?
text: Belinda laughs. Darius swallows uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: We broke up after not long. He
dialog: quit the restaurant, I didn’t see
dialog: him for awhile after that. Then
dialog: there was the accident.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What was the accident?
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: He crashed his car into my
dialog: boyfriend’s house. It was when I
dialog: first started dating Rob, my
dialog: husband. He had a show in
dialog: Wilmington that night, he was ina
dialog: band back then. Anyways, we had a
dialog: party at this little house he was
text: renting at the time after the show.
dialog: I stayed over and we went to sleep
dialog: and next thing we know Kenneth
text: crashes his car into the front
dialog: lawn. Went all the way up to the
text: house, put a dent in the wall under
text: the kitchen window. Kenneth seemed
dialog: a little drunk. I convinced Rob to
dialog: let him go before the police came
dialog: and we reported it as a hit and
dialog: run. And now that I think of it,
dialog: that’s the last time I saw him.
scene_heading: EXT. BELINDA’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Belinda waves as Darius makes her exit.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Hope I helped. It’s Facsimile
dialog: Magazine?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah. Thanks again.
text: Darius walks to the car, head spinning.
dialog: She takes
text: a few steps down the street before she sees the two
text: men in black, Smith and Jones, exit their parked Sedan.
dialog: Jeff gets
dialog: and Jones
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Oh shit.
text: out of his car and catches up to Darius as Smith
text: reach her.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Excuse me. Can we have a moment of
dialog: your time?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Nothing to be alarmed about. We'd
dialog: just like to ask a few questions
dialog: about Kenneth Calloway.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Look, we're just here doing a story
dialog: on him. We’re not involved in
dialog: anything he’s involved with.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: We don’t mean to come off the wrong
dialog: way. We’ve actually talked to
dialog: Facsimile magazine and verified
dialog: your connection to Calloway.
dialog: (off Jeff's look)
dialog: You talk to people and we talk to
dialog: those people. It’s our job.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What do you want with him?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: We work in the private security
dialog: branch of Gower MedLabs. We’ve been
text: investigating Calloway for a couple
dialog: of years now. We suspect him of
text: being an agent working for a rival
dialog: medical research company.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Why would you think him?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: He’s participated in trial testing
dialog: conducted by our company at a
dialog: frequency that raised some internal
text: alarm. Turns out he’s repeatedly
dialog: applied for various jobs with us,
text: all in unrelated fields.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: He can’t be a spy.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: He was arrested in Florida for
dialog: breaking and entering at one of our
dialog: facilities. And then there was the
dialog: recent robbery at one of the
dialog: testing facilities here...
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh yeah? What’d they take?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Prototypes for a laser hair removal
dialog: system.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Technology that could be very
dialog: valuable to a competing
dialog: corporation. Have you had any
dialog: contact with him in the past 24
dialog: hours?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No. Darius?
text: Darius shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You know for sure he was the one
dialog: who robbed the research place?
dialog: Like, you have evidence?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: We're confident. Give us a call if
dialog: you hear from him?
text: Smith hands Darius a card. Jones turns to leave. Smith pauses.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: What’s this story about?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What’s that?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: For the, for your magazine.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh, the story. Time travel? I don’t
dialog: know anymore, actually.
text: He eyes them both.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Good luck.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: The Acura parks in front of Kenneth’s house. Jeff looks at
text: Darius as she opens the door.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Yeah.
text: Darius exits the car. In the back, Arnau awakens and groggily
text: pokes his head forward.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Sex clinic, Romeo. You have a
dialog: serious problem and need help.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY
text: Darius knocks and waits.
text: It’s dark inside the cracked open window. She slides the
text: window up and lifts the screen off its groove. She reaches in
text: shoulder deep around to the door lock and unlocks it.
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Gray shafts of daylight reveal the nest of an organized
text: hoarder. Books and magazines piled neatly, edges squared but
text: eating up all of the interior space. Some mechanical device
text: lies in neat pieces on a blanket on the floor.
text: Darius turns sideways to squeeze through the neat, chest-high
text: columns of clutter on her way to the computer in the corner.
text: Darius shakes the mouse and the screen saver blinks off. The
text: computer’s desktop is as cluttered as the apartment. She
text: clicks on a few of the icons, finds nothing.
dialog: 83.
text: She turns her attention to stacks of papers on the desk. She
text: leafs through journal entries and hand-drawn designs of small
text: component machine parts.
text: Her eyes are drawn to a small pile of photographs on a shelf.
text: She looks through photos of Kenneth at various ages...until
text: she stops on one photo in particular. An 8 by 10 we only see
text: the back of. This photo makes an impact on her.
speaker_heading: KENNETH (OS)
dialog: Darius? What are you doing here?
text: Darius shakes out of the spell and finds Kenneth there.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I just came to see what’s going on.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Everything’s set. I moved the
text: machine to the launch site.
text: Departure is at five PM. Things are
dialog: pretty hairy, I had to sneak in
text: through the back cause the spooks
dialog: are all over me. They could be out
dialog: there right now.
text: Kenneth slyly peers out through the closed blinds.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth, we need to talk.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: About what happened last night. I
dialog: know our working relationship
dialog: became complicated but we need to
dialog: re-focus and not let it compromise
dialog: the mission.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No, Kenneth, I mean I talked to the
dialog: guys who are following you. They
dialog: said you stole those lasers to sell
dialog: the technology, like you’re some
dialog: corporate spy or something.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Hah. Simpletons. Let them think
dialog: that, it works in our favor.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I also talked to Belinda. I was at
dialog: her house like an hour ago.
text: There’s a subtle twitch in Kenneth’s expression.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Wait, what? What’s going on here?
dialog: You're checking up on me?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Well yeah. Most people that promise
dialog: to take me on a journey through
dialog: space and time I do a little
dialog: research on.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I knew it. See, this whole mission
dialog: is getting janked up by you.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What’s the mission? She’s alive,
dialog: Kenneth. I just saw her. You lied
dialog: to me about her. What else have you
dialog: been lying about?
scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Waiting inside the Acura, Jeff and Arnau see Jones and Smith
text: pull the black sedan into Kenneth’s drive.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shit.
text: Jeff sits up and opens the car door.
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Kenneth paces, concentrating hard.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: No, no, no. Don’t you see?
dialog: Obviously if she’s alive then I’ve
dialog: already succeeded in my mission.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth, just be honest with me.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The question is why I’m not with
dialog: her. What does it mean?
text: The front door opens. Jeff spills into the room.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Darius, fuck! They’re right behind
dialog: me.
text: Jones and Smith push in right on his heels.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You're with that guy?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth, oh God.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You're just like the rest of them?
dialog: You were making a joke of me?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No. No, I’m not.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Look, man. We’re trying to write an
dialog: honest story about you for a
dialog: magazine. Nobody was trying to make
dialog: a joke out of you.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Jeff, don’t -
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: A magazine story?
text: Kenneth’s face drains. His wide, hurt eyes fall on Darius.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You've been pretending? Darius?
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Kenneth Calloway, we’re taking you
dialog: into custody and transporting you
dialog: to Florida to stand trial.
text: Jones and Smith step forward.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: You guys aren’t cops. You can’t
dialog: come in here.
text: They brush by Darius and close in on Kenneth.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: I have been granted power of
dialog: attorney by your bail bondsman to
dialog: apprehend you and deliver you to
dialog: Clearwater to stand trial.
text: Jones and Smith move to cuff him but Kenneth struggles.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You can’t take me now! I’m leaving
dialog: tonight!
dialog: 86.
text: Kenneth whips out of their grasp, knocking over towers of
text: folded clothes and magazines, spilling onto the floor a flood
text: of junk that Jones and Smith get caught up in, dropping them.
text: Kenneth takes one last pained look at Darius and flees out
text: the back. Jones and Smith scramble to their feet and follow.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
text: Jones and Smith run into the backyard just in time to see
text: Kenneth vanish into the thick reeds of the wilderness beyond
text: his property. They stop, hands on hips.
text: Darius exits the house. She shuts her eyes and holds her
text: hands to her head.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: I’m such an asshole.
text: Jeff appears behind her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So was he really building a time
dialog: machine or what?
speaker_heading: ARNAU (0S)
dialog: Hey! Check this out. It’s open.
text: Darius looks over to the shed. The chains on the doors dangle
text: freely, their locks hanging open.
scene_heading: INT. KENNETH’S HOUSE - SHED - MOMENTS LATER
text: Darius opens the doors, Jeff and Arnau behind her.
text: They enter the shed, lit by sunlight filtering in through the
text: spaces between the roof and walls.
text: It’s mostly empty.
text: The cement floor is largely clean and bare except ina
text: distinct pattern around the edges, suggesting something the
text: size of a small RV recently rested here.
text: Dozens of tools litter the floor’s edges, along with pieces
text: of tubing, pipe, gaskets, gears and circuit boards.
text: All eyes are drawn to the walls of the shed, however. They
text: are covered with DETAILED SCHEMATICS OF THE TIME MACHINE.
text: From the drawing we get the sense of an airboat heavily
text: modified with extra propeller engines and intricate
text: machinery. It’s impressive. It looks like the real deal.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: Whoa, awesome.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This is fucking fantastic.
text: They look to Darius.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: You don’t think he really - ?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Holy shit, would he already be
dialog: gone? How would we know?
speaker_heading: ON DARIUS
text: Realizing she knows exactly how they'd know.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DUSK
text: Darius hurries down the hill to the base of the tree at the
text: edge of the lake. She reaches her arm into the hollow of the
text: tree and removes the ammunition tin.
text: She sits down on the hill with the tin on her knees as Jeff
text: and Arnau approach.
text: She opens it. There’s a note inside. Her fingers almost
text: tremble as she reads.
speaker_heading: ARNAU
dialog: What is it?
text: Then we hear the rumbling ROAR of engines in the distance.
text: It’s the sound of raw combustion engine mixed with the
text: smooth, high pitched purring of electric motors.
text: Darius stands, drops the note and follows the sound to the
text: edge of the lake. The source quickly becomes visible.
dialog: It’s incredible.
text: A crazy, modified airboat with four propellers, multiple
text: engines, and all kinds of tubes and cords and unidentifiable
text: parts fixed together create an intimidating piece of
text: machinery floating in the water next to a narrow dock.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Kenneth stands on a small deck on the machine. He flips a
dialog: switch.
dialog: 88.
text: Behind him a raised chassis on the machine begins spinning in
text: circles so quickly it becomes a dangerous blur of whirling
dialog: steel.
speaker_heading: UP THE HILL
text: Jones and Smith crest the hill behind them, out of breath.
text: They spot the machine and share a bewildered look.
dialog: ON THE DOCK
text: Kenneth sees Darius as she runs onto the dock.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth!
text: Kenneth sees Darius. He eases a throttle back and the noise
text: of the engines dies down.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: Kenneth, I’m so sorry...
text: He steps off the machine onto the dock, keeping his distance.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Were you just making a joke of me
dialog: the whole time?
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: No. I promise you. I lied about the
dialog: story but everything else was real.
dialog: That was really me.
text: Kenneth processes this, wanting to believe her...then nods to
text: himself, resolute.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Get on.
speaker_heading: DARIUS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I wasn’t going back for Belinda.
dialog: I’m going back for you. I have to
dialog: save your mother.
text: Tears appear in Darius’ eyes, surprising her.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Come with me.
text: Darius looks behind her. Jones and Smith are closing in. Jeff
text: and Arnau watch from the shoreline.
dialog: 89.
text: Kenneth reaches out his hand.
text: Teary-eyed but laughing, she takes it.
text: He pulls her onto the time machine and they share a moment,
text: now face to face. Kenneth places her hand on a railing.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Hold on to this. I won’t let you
dialog: get hurt.
text: Darius nods. He returns to the controls and pushes the
text: throttle. Lights glow and machinery spins as the noise
text: accelerates.
dialog: ON THE DOCK
text: Arnau picks up the fallen note as Jones and Smith walk past.
text: Jeff watches in disbelief.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What is she doing?
scene_heading: ON THE MACHINE
text: floating away from the dock, rocking wildly in the water.
text: Kenneth holds on to the support rail with Darius. His wide
text: eyes look upwards, hopeful, expectant.
text: As the roaring engines reach a crescendo, we hear a loud POP.
text: Kenneth’s expression is invaded by doubt.
scene_heading: ON THE MACHINE
text: Kenneth pushes buttons and checks gauges, his face wracked
text: with desperation. The spinning parts are now grinding. Smoke
text: spills upwards.
text: Darius watches Kenneth with a desperate look, hoping for
text: something that is not possible and she knows it.
text: Kenneth shouts at the controls, pleading and anguished.
text: His shouts fade with the roar of the engines as the machine
text: slowly winds down and finally becomes deathly quiet, bobbing
text: on the black water.
text: Kenneth slumps back against the rail.
text: All hope drains from Darius. She puts a hand on his.
text: Jeff and Arnau watch silently and sadly from the dock as
text: Jones and Smith ready their handcuffs.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - SUNDOWN
text: Kenneth’s despondent face is turned down in the backseat of
dialog: the Sedan.
text: He makes eye contact with Darius one last time as Jones and
text: Smith drive him away.
text: As the car disappears, Arnau looks at the note from Kenneth
text: still in his hand.
text: It reads: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. JEFF’S ACURA - MORNING

dialog: And so in light of having written a

dialog: hits in the history of Facsimile,
dialog: created an internet sensation and
dialog: brought unprecedented attention to

dialog: can do is promote you to full time
dialog: feature writer.
text: As Bridgette speaks, we track across the faces in the room,
text: all looking in one direction, to Darius, whose face we
text: finally settle on. She forces a smile as the room APPLAUDS.
speaker_heading: BRIDGETTE
dialog: Not to mention this is the first
