scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
scene_heading: SUPER: April 27, 1973
text: All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
text: Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
text: the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
text: Two faded yellow buses stand ready.
text: The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
text: A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
text: broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
text: the cars and the buses.
text: Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
text: nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
text: Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
text: dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
text: stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
text: girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
text: two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
text: school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
text: HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.

dialog: the young couple)
dialog: She's too busy. Let's go
dialog: by ourselves.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why?
text: Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands.

text: He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
text: Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
text: pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
text: look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
text: towards her and Nick is bicycling away.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Okay, let's go.
text: The sisters start to walk across the lawn.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Y-you 1-1-like him?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
speaker_heading: (SMILES SHYLY)
dialog: Y-you know.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess.

speaker_heading: ROBIN
speaker_heading: (FINALLY)
dialog: Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Robin?
text: Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the

text: denly Kim halts.
speaker_heading: KIM
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Oh, damn!
text: Robin looks up in surprise.
speaker_heading: KIM
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED! (2)
text: Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
text: into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
text: As she turns off the main road into a side street,
text: Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
text: of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
text: the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
dialog: investigate.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
speaker_heading: (CALLS OUT)
dialog: Alex?
text: The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
text: through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
text: sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
text: classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
text: KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
text: child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
text: eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
text: up onto the floor of the building.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I want to play 'Murder.' Who's
dialog: the killer?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You, Wendy!
speaker_heading: JUDE
speaker_heading: (GIGGLING)
dialog: you, Nick.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes, Nick!
speaker_heading: WENDY
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: You'll never catch me. Hide your
dialog: eyes, killer!
text: As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
text: posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
text: Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
text: counting, and whirls around.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The killer is coming for you!
text: He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a
text: low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
text: tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.

text: Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught
text: her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the "kill"
text: chant in unison with Nick.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2
text: Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,
text: gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-
text: rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
text: mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the
text: chant. As the three "killers" move through the vast
text: structure searching for Wendy, "KILL, KILT" ECHOES off
text: the walls and hardwood floors.
text: Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
text: mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across
text: the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
text: CHANTING of the children.
text: Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off
text: its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The
text: NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE
text: SILENCE in the structure.
text: Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The
text: CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
dialog: of relief.
text: Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.
text: Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer"
text: searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,
text: she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-
text: fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this
text: time, coming from nearby.
text: Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and
text: peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.
text: Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.
text: The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
text: ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from
text: behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched
text: behind a cardboard box in the corner.
speaker_heading: WENDY
speaker_heading: (HISSING)
dialog: You better not tell!
text: Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.
text: Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an
text: opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy
text: standing in the corner, he howls in triumph.

speaker_heading: (CALLING OUT)

text: Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears
text: the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET.
speaker_heading: WENDY
speaker_heading: (MALICIOUSLY)
dialog: Now you've done it, you idiot!
text: The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the "killers" rush towards
text: the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-
text: cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she
text: grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face.
speaker_heading: WENDY
scene_heading: (CONTINUING; SLOWLY)
dialog: Kill, kill, kill...
text: Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.
text: Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,
text: bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the
text: game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy
text: in pursuit of Robin.
text: Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, "KILL, KILL
text: ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-
text: pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and
text: sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of
text: a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out
text: blindly, escapes the "killer."
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3
text: Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a
text: wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the
text: darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through
text: a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-
text: right near the opening are several sheets of window
text: glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
text: der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
text: the doorway, a vicious look on her face.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Killers, here!
text: Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: N-n-n-no!

dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting
text: "Kill, kill." Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder
text: and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock
text: over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.
text: Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.
text: But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her,
text: Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and
text: grabs the ladder.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: P-p-please!
text: Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is
text: deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes
text: even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy
text: to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass
text: stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is
text: just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
text: send it hurtling down directly at Robin.
text: The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the
text: glass slices through her neck. She is instantly
text: decapitated.
text: Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
text: to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude
text: sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,
text: he manages to speak.
speaker_heading: NICK
scene_heading: (WHISPERING HOARSELY)
dialog: We gotta get somebody quick!
text: Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Are you crazy? They'll put us in
dialog: jail!
text: Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow
dialog: silent.
speaker_heading: WENDY
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: If we tell anyone, they'll say
dialog: it's our fault. Who'd believe it

text: With a final glance down at Robin's mutiliated body,
text: Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the
dialog: room.
text: As their FOOTSTEPS ECHO away across the hardwood floor,
text: there is a terrible silence. Then, starting very
text: quietly, more FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, this time a single
text: person approaching the ladder from above. The FOOT-
text: STEPS STOP and a deep, black shadow falls across the
text: ladder; HEAVY BREATHING punctuates the oppressive
text: quiet, growing louder and more anguished.

text: HAMMOND, Robin's father. A handsome, dark-haired man
text: in his late thirties, he teaches history at George
dialog: Winston High School.
text: Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the
text: floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
text: of his daughter from the dark basement.
text: A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
text: sheet covering Robin's remains. Hammond steps up
text: and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body. A
text: look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes
text: on his face; what he sees he will never forget.
text: Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP
text: in front of the construction site. He turns and
text: looks out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DUSK 5
text: A Police Officer is getting out of his car. Walking

text: The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it
text: out of the room. As they pass through the doorway into
text: the corridor, a corner of the sheet slips off Robin's
text: corpse. Before a Paramedic can replace it, the de-
text: capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family.

speaker_heading: (CALLS OUT)
dialog: Okay, Mom!

text: of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture
dialog: is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing,
dialog: that is! Love, Nick."
text: Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror.

text: ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,
text: daydreams or passes notes.
text: Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively
text: opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.
text: Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
text: across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude
text: tears out part of a page from her biology book and
text: scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy
text: next to her and motions for him to pass it on.
text: Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning
text: it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the
text: word "Wow" to Jude who blushes happily.
text: Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-
text: ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.
text: Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs
text: to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
text: gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends
text: watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.
text: Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose
text: to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.
text: Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn
dialog: around.
text: Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief
text: at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
text: itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise
text: turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
text: Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her
text: eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick. Jude nods. Kim
text: and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do
text: not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
text: rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the
text: words, "See you at lunch.., in the van." Jude nods and
