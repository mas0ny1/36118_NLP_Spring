text: Their twin sons, EMERSON and FINN (10), are in the back. Finn

text: actual book. Pete takes a hard curve, dropping into the wrong
dialog: gear.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: We got it, Pete. You’re a man. Slow
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This is how they drive.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You’re not “they.”
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There’s no speed limit here.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That’s Germany. This is Austria.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s the Autobahn.

dialog: Tell you what, I’11 look it up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I looked it up. I read it.
dialog: *
dialog: JA 1st 2.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (calling bluff)
dialog: Great. Now, I’1l read it.
text: Pete concedes. Slows down.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I just want to get out on the
dialog: mountain.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I’m very aware of what you want.
text: He glances in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Em, you’re missing it, buddy.
text: Em looks up, gets a quick glance, and returns to his book.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: (off incline)
dialog: Are we going to ski this?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: What? No. Why would you say...?
speaker_heading: PETE BILLIE
dialog: I’m saying there will be He said “this.” Will we ski

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He knows what I meant...
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: (to Em)
dialog: We're going to ski this.
text: Em doesn’t even look up from his book. He could care less.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Like this, buddy. Like this.
text: Pete gives a playful “Oops” look.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Be. Clear.
text: She glances out the window.
dialog: JA 1st 3.
text: BILLIE’S POV of a passing sign/billboard for “Ischgl Ski

dialog: undeniable: “Relax. If You Can...”
text: BACK TO SCENE, as...
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (scoffing, amused)
dialog: Kind of feels like a threat...
text: Just then, a LARGE BUS rounds the bend in Pete’s lane. Pete
text: slams the brakes. Everyone freaks a bit. The BUS DRIVER,
text: clearly annoyed, HONKS.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: -+. Am I on the wrong side?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: This is the side we've been on.
dialog: We've always been on this side...
text: The Bus Driver HONKS, again, and waves Peter to back up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He wants me to back up.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You can’t back up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Am I on the wrong side?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Have him back up.
dialog: (to Driver)
dialog: You back up. You back up.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: It’s a bus. He can’t back up.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
text: Buses can back up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Am I in the wrong...?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Just go around.
text: Peter navigates to the other lane, BUT NOPE - there’s a
text: number of cars trailing the Bus in that lane.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Do we even get a lane?
dialog: JA 1st 4.
text: HONK. The Bus Driver waves Peter back, even more insistent.
text: In fact, he drives FORWARD.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
text: He’s coming at us.
speaker_heading: BILLIE PETE
dialog: Okay, back up. Yeah, we have to back up.

scene_heading: EXT. SKI MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: A still photo of our family: Twins center, flanked by Billie
text: and Peter. Mountains in the background, sun in their faces.
text: Snow blows across, the family shuffle. It’s not a still, it’s
text: live action.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER (0.S.)
dialog: Danke! Danke schon! Thank you -
dialog: yes. Ja. Next one.
text: The family moves around to pose for a series of photos. The
text: poised classical framing is all wonky. We struggle to see our
text: family, to focus on individuals, as Peter and Billie arrange
dialog: themselves and their kids until:
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Jetzt mache schneeballe und wirf
dialog: sie. Ja?
text: Billie looks nonplussed. Peter doesn’t get it, either. But
text: then the photographer makes a snowball and they understand.
text: As other families pass by, we see the Stantons through their
text: eyes: looking good. Cavorting for the cameras and for each
text: other. Peter rough-housing the laughing boys, with just a
text: hint of an eye on the camera. Click click click.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Wunderbar!
dialog: Happy days. Good times.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS/SLOPES - DAY
text: Sun plays across the snow. The peaks are beautiful, but
text: terrifyingly, overwhelmingly massive.
dialog: %
dialog: JA 1st 5.
text: Closer in: A blank white screen of snow. Billie, Pete, and
text: the Twins come down the mountain. All decent skiers, carving
text: long S shapes. They make a pretty pattern as they slip in-
text: between one another. A family in sync.
scene_heading: EXT. MID-MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: Peter and Billie stop. They breathe and just take in that
text: first run. Below them, the Austrian resort.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (facetious)
dialog: Wow. That was not too shitty.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah, right? Better than I
dialog: imagined.
text: Billie glances at her boot, shaking it out a bit, as the
text: Twins arrive by their sides. Finn, all smiles. Emerson kicks
text: snow off his skis.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How about that, huh?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Awesome.
text: Em doesn’t pipe up.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Em? Pretty cool, huh?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: (going along)
dialog: Uh-huh? Sure.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: “Sure?” It’s more than “sure.”
text: Peter nudges/play-punches Emerson until he cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, everyone follow me.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah, keep an eye on daddy.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We good?
text: Billie is back with her boot, shaking it.
dialog: JA 1st 6.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah, let me just...
text: But, Pete is already off down the mountain. The Twins follow. *
text: As Billie scrambles a bit to gather herself and “catch up,”
dialog: We...
scene_heading: INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - DAY
text: Peter and the Twins are gathered around a terminal where the
text: photos taken up at the top of the mountain can be viewed.
text: They point, laugh and argue over which ones to ‘tick’ and
dialog: print out.
text: Billie sits with a young SKI RENTAL KID, considering her
dialog: boot.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I think they're good. I just felt
dialog: that they might be a little tight *
dialog: here? It’s a little tight here but *
dialog: felt kind of loose there?
text: ON YOUNG SNOWBOARDER bursting in from outside, letting out a
text: piercing WHISTLE to get the Ski Rental Kid’s attention. *
text: Clearly, the Snowboarder wants to hit the mountain and is
text: getting impatient. A slightly heated German exchange for
text: which we receive no subtitles. Billie coughs to get the
text: attention back.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, here it’s tight. But, there *
dialog: it’s loose. Is that good? *
text: The Kid gives a cursory, meaningless touch of the boot.
speaker_heading: SKI RENTAL KID
dialog: Is good.
text: Peter approaches.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She just felt a little sliding of
dialog: the foot and a little, too much
text: grip on the ankle.
speaker_heading: SKI RENTAL KID
dialog: Is good.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is good?
dialog: JA 1st 7.
speaker_heading: SKI RENTAL KID
dialog: Is good.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to Billie)
dialog: Is good?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Is good?
dialog: Billie considers.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to the Kid)
dialog: We all got moulded boots but she
dialog: decided hers weren’t right, so?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I mean, they’re tight? Maybe I have
dialog: weird feet?
dialog: (conceding)
dialog: No. Good. Yeah?
text: Peter nods. Yes. Enough.
scene_heading: E/I. HOTEL - DAY
text: The family approach the front entrance. A whirlwind of
text: activity as the ski day comes to a close. SKIERS whisk by,
dialog: taking advantage of the “ski in/ski out.”
text: The family enters the...
speaker_heading: LOBBY.
text: Billie clocks the GREGARIOUS GROUPS (all adults) passing
text: them, heading out towards town, beers/cocktails in hand. The
text: whole lobby is a madhouse. SKIERS/GUESTS of all nationalities
text: mill about, gather at the bar, etc.. A cacophony of different
text: languages echo throughout the space. The Twins take off
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: Stay where I can see you.
text: DING! From Pete’s phone. A text. He checks.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: Have you noticed there are no other
dialog: kids? Seems weird, right?
dialog: JA 1st 8.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (shrugging, lost in phone)
dialog: School schedules are different?
text: Billie hands an ATTENDANT a ticket for their luggage at
text: BAGGAGE CHECK. They had left them there in the urgency to get
text: on the mountain.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Still. You'd see some kids.
speaker_heading: EMERSON/FINN (0.S.)
dialog: Mom!
text: ON TWINS, by a table decked out with an array of sweets and
text: coffee. They are pleading to “dive in,” hands in “prayer
dialog: mode.”
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: One thing each.
text: They scoop up two things each and immediately take a bite.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I said one.
text: Deer in headlights. Both put the “bitten choices” back.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: No, don’t... Take them back.
dialog: They do. Again, deer. Now, what?
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, put the uneaten ones back.
dialog: Still deer.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. You get two. Two.
text: They take off running. Billie notices Pete, still in phone.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you texting?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: It’s Zach. He and Rosie are in
dialog: Amsterdam, apparently.
text: ON PHONE SCREEN. “HIGH from Amsterdam!” There’s a series of
text: selfies of ZACH and ROSIE, a very youthful and free-spirited
text: couple. They are sporting backpacks.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: And, they’re backpacking?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, travelling wherever. No real
dialog: agenda. See, I know this because it
dialog: says right here.
text: ON SCREEN. Below the photos, more text: "#NoAgenda
dialog: #LiveYourBestLife”
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: (reading jokingly)
dialog: Hashtag no agenda. Hashtag live
dialog: your best life.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Hashtag get better hashtags.
text: They both laugh. The ATTENDANT brings out their bags.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, let’s not be in our phones.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, totally. I’m just finishing it.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: This is a family vacation, so let’s
dialog: be here. Not texting. Playing
dialog: 
dialog: games...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Absolutely. He texted me. I’m
dialog: just... I mean, you’ve been on your
dialog: phone...
dialog: If ever Billie gets adamant, it is with this.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah. To deal with work stuff. And,
dialog: family stuff. I’m doing both.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, totally...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: And, now I’m done and I’m here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m done, too. Great.
text: Pete puts away his phone. They nod to one another and
dialog: quick kiss. All good.
dialog: steal a
dialog: JA 1st 10.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete and Billie approach RECEPTION as a group of MIDDLE-AGED
text: GUYS on a men-only weekend are laughing/flirting with the
text: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST. The GUYS depart, laughing. The
text: receptionist is momentarily called away.
text: CHARLOTTE (50s), a worldly Scandinavian woman, approaches. *
text: She has packets of documents under her arm and an air of
text: someone very happy. (NOTE: She’s on the same side of the
dialog: counter as Billie/Pete.)
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Hello. I’m Charlotte. So. The
dialog: flight was okay? What time did you
dialog: check in?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, uh, hi. Midday. Yes. All good.
speaker_heading: PETE *
dialog: I wanted us to get right out on the
dialog: mountain.
dialog: *
text: Billie and Peter, confused by Charlotte’s role, glance back
text: in the direction of where the Receptionist had been. *
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Well, sorry I wasn’t there to meet
dialog: you. Now, what the fuck have I got
dialog: for you?
text: Billie and Peter clock one another. However, there’s little
text: time to process as Charlotte is a whirlwind of peculiarities.
text: She gives them envelopes, key cards and maps. *
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay. Resort map. Key cards. Um,
dialog: ski passes you got, right? *
dialog: With the pack? *
text: Finn and Emerson run up, grabbing onto Billie. She settles
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Well, hello, handsome ones.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: This is Finn and Emerson. Our sons.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Hello tiny men, yes?
dialog: JA 1st 11.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: So, I’m curious. Are there more
dialog: kids around?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oh yes. Many.
text: Pete glances at Billie: “See?”
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Not here. The town of Fiss-- Maybe,
dialog: minutes of 20 from here-- Yes,
dialog: there is all families.
text: Billie looks at Pete: “Did you know this?” But, Pete shrugs
text: and shakes his head. It seems genuine, at least.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: But, here better, yes? Is lively.
text: The Ibiza of the Alps. Ski hard.
dialog: Then, party as hardest. Yes?
text: But, she offers no time for them to answer or process...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes! Okay. Now. Restaurant
dialog: recommendations. Around the centre
dialog: you will find quite fine dining,
text: quite upmarket. And in the sauna.
text: She pronounces it Scandinavian style ‘sow-nah’.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: In Europe it’s considered
dialog: unhygienic to sauna in your swim
dialog: suits. So, please, the body is not
dialog: to be ashamed of, yes?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, speak for yourself.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: No. Your body is good. Celebrate
dialog: it.
dialog: (nod to Pete)
dialog: Both.
text: Charlotte stays locked on them, waiting for confirmation.
speaker_heading: PETE BILLIE
dialog: «.. Thank you. No, yeah. Celebrate. Thank
dialog: you.
dialog: JA 1st 12.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: (pleased, back to
dialog: business)
dialog: For your skiing, there are the easy
text: runs on the Austrian side. Over the
dialog: other, if you like, you can go
dialog: crazy in Switzerland.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Switzerland?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
text: Over the top is Switzerland and
dialog: everything is different. And so any
dialog: questions?
text: Maybe they do, but Charlotte doesn’t wait for them...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay, so. We are finished. I’m here
dialog: as friend, yes? Do you want to be
dialog: my friend?
text: The slightly odd phrasing and European directness throws them
text: off. She holds their gaze.
speaker_heading: PETE BILLIE
dialog: Um-— ++. Yes?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Good. Then, we are friends.
text: Charlotte laughs. So, naturally Billie and Peter laugh.
text: Charlotte gives them her card.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Please call me. You are American.
dialog: You have paid, so you must have
dialog: everything!
text: As they make “good-byes,” Billie and Peter fumble with their
text: bags. They speak in hushed tones during the following:
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Should you tip her?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t - Who the fuck is she?
text: Peter presses a 20 Euro note into Charlotte’s hand. It wasn’t
text: quite expected. It’s hard to understand her expression:
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Nope. You weren’t supposed to.
dialog: JA 1st 13.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is she offended?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I don’t know...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Take it back?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No, you can’t...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Maybe, it wasn’t enough?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No, don’t add...
text: But, he does add tip. Charlotte is still hard to read,
text: staring.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: She’s still there.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: So, let’s not be, anymore.
text: They start off with their bags.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: No, silly friends. We bring bags.
dialog: You do nothing!
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No, yes. Of course. That’s what we
dialog: were just discussing.
dialog: (can’t get away fast
dialog: enough)
dialog: Okay.
text: As they shuttle to the elevator,...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Billie through the nice spacious arrangement,
text: complete with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a common area
text: with a full kitchen and dining table.
text: She passes the Twins’ room. They are tossing clothes out of
text: their bags, haphazardly.
dialog: JA 1st 14.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: All that stuff in drawers, please.
dialog: And, hang up your ski stuff to dry.
text: We continue with Billie into...
text: THE MASTER BEDROOM.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Them sharing a queen will be a
dialog: disaster...
text: ON PETE, immediately tossing his phone on the bed as if it’s
text: on fire. Clearly, he was on it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Now, I’m done.
text: Billie just playfully slaps his ass. They start to unpack.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
text: Zach kept texting. Asking questions
dialog: about Ischgl. Wondering where we
dialog: were staying...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We're not looking for them to “No
dialog: agenda” their way here, are we?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, no, no. That’s why I was
dialog: finishing the conversation. No. I
dialog: see him enough at work.
text: Billie nods, “Good.” Pete pulls a vintage-looking, knit ski
text: hat out of his bag. Tad tacky. Very old school.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look. I found my Dad’s old hat.
dialog: Thought I'd bring it. Wear it on
dialog: the slopes. Have him here with me.
text: The moment catches Pete off guard. A little swell of emotion.
text: She rubs his back.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I love that.
text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sorry, if I’ve been...
dialog: JA 1st 15.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: It’s okay.
text: She pats his heart.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s why we’re here.
speaker_heading: FINN (0.S.)
dialog: Dad! Come look!
text: Pete collects himself.
speaker_heading: FINN/EMERSON (0.S.)
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I heard “Mom.”
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I know you did.
text: She pushes him toward the door, as we...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM/COMMON AREA - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a BIDET.
text: REVEAL Em, Finn and Pete hovered around it.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s European.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: What’s it for?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: .+. For washing.
text: ON BILLIE, in COMMON AREA. She’s stacking and laying out ski
dialog: clothes for everyone for the next day.
speaker_heading: EMERSON (0.S.)
dialog: For washing, what?
text: Curious, Billie approaches the bathroom door, as Pete
text: continue to struggle with what to say.
dialog: JA 1st 16.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: For washing your, uh...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Feet. But, let’s not use it for
dialog: that. Or, anything. *
text: Billie nods toward Pete to follow her. He complies as they
dialog: get a safe distance from the twins.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: If we tell them what it’s really
dialog: for, we'll never get them off of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So,... Don't be clear.
text: Pete smirks, giving her shit. Billie’s not connecting the
text: dots from the previous conversation.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, we don’t be clear.
dialog: Now, she’s “up to speed.”
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yes. Because there will be hijinx.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So, don’t be clear when there’s a *
dialog: possibility of hijinx.
dialog: *
text: Billie swats him away and walks off as...
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D) *
dialog: (as if committing to *
dialog: memory ) *
dialog: No chance of hijinx means full *
dialog: clarity. Chance of hijinx, lie. *
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - NIGHT *
text: Pete and Billie are on their bed, watching TV. There is a
text: tray with leftover room service between them. They pick at
text: the scraps which is mostly just fries and wine.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay, we should stop, yes?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: JA 1st 17.
text: Yet, they each take more fries.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, stop. We’re going to want to
dialog: eat a big breakfast.
text: Pete complies, pushing the tray away.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m going to want to get out first
dialog: thing....
text: As she heads into the BATHROOM,...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I know you will.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just so we account for that big
dialog: breakfast.
text: Off screen, the SHOWER starts. Now safe, Pete pulls a handful
text: of fries and downs them with great speed. He considers,
text: clears the fry debris with his tongue, takes a gulp of water
text: and heads into the bathroom.
text: CAMERA HOLDS outside during the following:
text: We HEAR the shower door, opening.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: (half laughing/half
dialog: adamant)
dialog: .-. No. We’re not doing it in here.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.S.)
dialog: It will be fast.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: It never works.
speaker_heading: PETE (0.S.)
dialog: There’s a bench...
speaker_heading: BILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: No. Pete. This is my time...
text: Clearly, Pete is teasing and grabbing at her trying to win
dialog: her over. It works:
dialog: JA 1st 18.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, we can do a quickie on the
dialog: bed when I’m out.
text: During the following, CAMERA slowly dollies back and PANS to
text: the bedroom window.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But, go figure out what we’ll watch *
dialog: on TV afterwards. I don’t want you
text: sitting there and scrolling around
dialog: for half an hour....
text: CAMERA lands on the window and PUSHES IN. In the distance,
text: bright, white lights illuminate the mountain. Three SNOWCATS
text: ascend the slopes, grooming. We RACK FOCUS into the window,
text: giving us the reflection of Pete turning on the TV and

dialog: No, yeah. For under.
text: - Pete puts on his dad’s knit hat, and then attempts to add
text: his helmet. Clearly, it’s not going to work. A bit bummed, he
text: goes with just the helmet.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY
dialog: Our first real taste of the madhouse that is the lift line.
text: It’s hovering just between order and chaos. Our family
text: navigates and attempts to figure out “how the system
text: operates.” Pete powers ahead, confident that he can figure it
text: out. Billie keeping tabs on the boys.
text: LATER - They are just shy of the front of the lift line. A
text: LIFT ATTENDANT is there checking everyone gets on safely. He
text: chunters away in German as people pass.
text: Before our family, there’s a GROUP OF THREE. The Lift
text: Attendant calls for someone from the SINGLES LINE to join
text: them to make it four. The SINGLE GUY scoots up past Pete. He
text: can’t help but notice that the Guy is skiing in a knit hat.
dialog: Old school. In fact, there’s a fair number of “non helmet”
text: skiers.
text: It’s the family’s turn. The scoot into position. As Billie
text: and Peter pass the Lift Attendant, he raps his knuckles on
dialog: their helmets.
scene_heading: LIFT ATTENDANT
dialog: Helme fiir die Kinder! Helme fiir die
dialog: Kinder!
text: Pete and Billie don’t know what to make of what he said.
dialog: (NOTE: We won’t get subtitles on this. Or, at all,
text: throughout.) Billie and Pete assume, incorrectly...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I think he just wants to know that
dialog: they’re on secure?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (knocking, cheery)
dialog: All good!
scene_heading: EXT. PISTE - DAY
text: The family descends. Not as compact as “day one.” Finn is out
text: in front, eager to show his parents what he can do.
dialog: *
dialog: JA 1st 20.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Slow up, Finn!
text: But, he doesn’t hear. He just keeps plowing ahead. Pete
text: pursues. Billie hangs back with Em, who makes a more
text: tentative descent.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Finn stops just outside the agreed restaurant. Pete arrives.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We need to stick with the group.
dialog: Alright, buddy?
text: Finn nods. Pete pats Finn’s helmet. They both look up the
text: slope at Billie making wide curves ahead of an increasingly
dialog: slow Emerson.
text: Finally, Billie and Em join them. Finn looks at his brother
dialog: like: come on man, stop hamming it up. Emerson makes a fuck-
dialog: you face.
text: Billie raises her eyebrows at Peter, meaning: Jesus he took
dialog: his time.
text: As they start to unclip their boots, we...
scene_heading: EXT. SKI RESTAURANT - DAY
text: An outside terrace. Blue sky. Waiters come and go. The family
text: are looking at menus.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I’m thinking... How about if we
dialog: just have soup? Then, we can have
dialog: pastries at four and also be hungry
dialog: for a dinner? Is that a plan?
text: Peter is looking at a piste map.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Should we do this black after
dialog: lunch?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I’1l do that Dad.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Umm?
dialog: JA 1st 21.
text: Peter takes her lack of engagement as skepticism.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, I don’t think it will be that
text: challening. It looks black, but
text: skis red. American blue. Several of
dialog: these blacks are really American
dialog: blues - European reds - but they
dialog: want them to be black for the
dialog: glamour?
text: Billie looks at the map.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Unless... Should we go find some
dialog: good powder? Get in some practice
dialog: in case we want to blow it out and
dialog: go for a--
text: She mimes ‘helicopter’ - not well. Rotors over her head --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Rodeo?
text: Off on the opposite hillside: a loud BANG! BANG!
text: Everyone on the terrace looks over to the mountain side. A
text: controlled explosion rumbles.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Whoa. Look at ...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay!
text: And, on a distant piste, an avalanche starts to roll. A low
text: rumble that soon grows, exponentially. The mass of snow
text: builds. It’s A BIG AVALANCHE. Suddenly, snow is filling the
dialog: whole valley.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Is that okay?
text: Peter, the man of the world, smiles but it’s billowing and
text: ADVANCING FAST. PANIC RISES. There’s a scream on the
text: restaurant terrace. It’s that moment when NORMALITY FADES and
dialog: you have to judge whether this is a life or death scenario.
text: THE AVALANCHE is going to be upon them in a second -- What
dialog: the fuck?!
text: Billie PUTS HER ARM AROUND the kids. Cries out in FEAR.
dialog: JA 1st 22.
text: Without time to think Peter STANDS, and FUMBLES A RETREAT. He
text: grabs his phone and STUMBLES FAST out of the shot just as
text: people SCREAM and the terrace is TOTALLY ENVELOPED IN SNOW.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
text: EVERYTHING IS WHITE.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Pete!
speaker_heading: FINN/EM
dialog: Dad!!
text: Confusion and PANIC reign. Muted shouts and screams. Then -
text: after the moment of maximum noise and panic, the shouts calm
text: down. And SLOWLY, the snow starts to settle. It was just a
text: plume of SLOWLY SETTLING POWDER. Not a mass of snow.
dialog: Everyone begins to realize that this was not a life or death
text: moment. There are even a couple of muffled LAUGHS, mild
text: mannered exclamations. The Waiters and Waitresses move into
text: action, to clear the DUSTING OF SNOW from the tables.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Are you okay? Kids? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We're okay. We’re okay.
text: Then, clomping back in his ski boots, comes Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Whoa.
text: The family are silent. They look at him. He rejoins them.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. Huh?
text: Billie doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: JA 1st 23.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you all okay?
text: They nod, mutely.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: That was -- wasn’t it?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «+. Yeah.
text: More silence. Finally, a Waitress comes to their table to
text: dust off the snow.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. Here we go.
text: Pete has an air of “back to normal.” Almost defiantly “not
dialog: fazed.”
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So, we're all doing soup?
text: The kids and Billie look at him. He’s claiming it’s all over.
scene_heading: EXT. SLOPES - DAY
text: The family are out skiing again. Peter at the front. He
text: carves off ahead, unaware or unconcerned that behind him
text: Billie and the kids hang back.
text: Even Finn is taking it easy. He looks behind him for Emerson,
text: who looks behind him for Billie, who looks behind herself at
text: the mountain to assure that everything is safe. Just then, a
text: YOUNG SKIER flies past them all at full speed. They flinch.
scene_heading: INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - DAY
text: The family is putting their gear away for the day in lockers
text: and racks. The atmosphere is chaotic as many SKIERS jostle to
dialog: do the same.
text: At one end of the shop are a series of floor-to-ceiling
text: movable racks for boots on runners. The racks can be shifted,
dialog: and different aisles created, to get to the boots.
text: Emerson is dawdling in one of the aisles, as he looks for the
text: spot to put his boots. A DUTCH SKIER on the next aisle pushes
text: the racks along their rails unaware that Emerson is in the
text: next aisle looking the other way. The big metal unit nears
dialog: his back --
dialog: + eH
dialog: JA 1st 24.
text: ON PETER, nearby, noticing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey?
text: The Dutch Skier doesn’t hear, slides on. *
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Hey! Stop!
text: ON BILLIE, across the room, pulling off her boots. She looks
text: up as, Pete rushes over to put his hand up against the rack. *
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch what you're doing!
text: The Dutch Skier steps out. *
speaker_heading: DUTCH SKIIER
dialog: Ontspannen. Ontspannen.
dialog: (what? )
dialog: Okay? Cool, yeah? Everything's
dialog: cool. *
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s not cool. You could have
dialog: crushed my son?
text: Pete’s reaction to this feels a bit heightened.
dialog: Overcompensating?
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Em)
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Yeah.
text: The Dutch Skiier touches the big set of racks with a finger.
speaker_heading: DUTCH SKIIER
dialog: They stop easy, yeah?
text: Billie has arrives, puts her attention on Em, too.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Yeah, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This guy wasn’t looking. But, I *
dialog: took care of it. *
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: JA 1st 25.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: (then to Skier)
dialog: I don’t want trouble.
dialog: *
text: The Dutch Skier doesn’t either. He’s still not sure what all
dialog: the fuss was about. *
speaker_heading: DUTCH SKIIER
dialog: Yes. I don’t... *
text: Billie watches as Pete shuttles Em away, consoling. She’s
dialog: still lost in this residual fog: What happened? Where was *
dialog: this Pete on the mountain? Does she believe this Pete? *
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, COMMON AREA - NIGHT
text: The Twins are on the couch, dressed for bedtime, watching
text: television. It’s The Loud House or Spongebob Squarepants.
dialog: (Basically, whatever is popular for boys and is “cleared.”)
dialog: That said, it’s all in German with no subtitles. The Twins
dialog: don’t seem to mind.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, BATHROOM - SAME TIME
text: Billie stands at the dual sink, finishing her make-up. She’s
text: quite dressed up and very much still playing back the day in *
text: her head. Pete enters. *
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You look pretty.
text: He kisses her neck.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «.. Thank you.
text: Pete reaches over her to grab his toothbrush. Billie zigs
text: when she should have zagged. The “ballet” at the sink before
text: is “out of sync” here. Eventually, Pete gets his toothpaste
text: and begins brushing. They stay on the same side of the sink
text: despite the “vibe.” Billie takes a moment. It’s clear she *
text: wants to ask about today. But, just as she opens her mouth... *
speaker_heading: EMERSON (0.S.)
dialog: Stop!
speaker_heading: FINN (0.S.)
dialog: Give it to me!
speaker_heading: EMERSON (0.S.)
dialog: No!
dialog: JA 1st 26.
text: Pete heeds the call and heads out to investigate. He might
text: have welcomed it. From the other room, Pete and the boys:
speaker_heading: FINN (0.S.)
dialog: He won’t give me the remote.
speaker_heading: EMERSON (0.S.)
dialog: It’s my turn to choose.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Pete is scrolling movie options on the television, while
text: Billie preps the twins. She’s holding the cordless hotel
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Okay, this is the phone. You can
dialog: call us at any point from this on
dialog: our cell phones. Numbers are here.
dialog: Okay? They work. We checked.
text: OFF SCREEN, a soft KNOCK at the door. Pete heads to answer.
dialog: [During the following, we’ll hear the faint sound of Pete
dialog: conversing with Room Service. ]
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
text: (lays out a piece of
dialog: paper)
dialog: Or, call reception. Or, the
dialog: restaurant. Or, one of you can even
dialog: come down. We’re right downstairs
text: at the restaurant off the lobby.
dialog: You saw where that was, remember?
text: Pete returns with a tray, complete with TWO covered plates.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Mom ordered a couple burgers and
dialog: fries. How cool is that? And, they
dialog: have movies in English. So, we can
dialog: pick one of those.
text: The boys seems a little wary. Perhaps residual feelings from
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: And, we'll be back by the time the
dialog: movie ends to tuck you in, okay?
text: She smiles. As does Pete. The boys seem consoled.
dialog: JA 1st 27.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Billie and Peter walk down to dinner. Glances exchanged.
text: Smiles, flashed. Billie grapples. A need to start a talk.
text: Just as she’s about to speak--
text: An enthusiastic ITALIAN COUPLE exit their room up ahead, mid-
text: conversation. They continue down the corridor just ahead of
dialog: Billie and Peter.
text: Peter lets the back of his hand brush Billie’s. He offers a
text: hand-hold. Billie doesn’t take it right away, but eventually
text: gives in and they walk interlinked.
text: The Italian Couple peels off down a different corridor. Back
text: to silence. Billie lets her hand go passive, letting Pete’s
text: fingers ride interlinked with hers, but with no grip between
text: them. They slip away.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Peter and Billie are waiting to be seated. She glances at
text: Pete, a desire to start. Pete stays focused ahead. He feels
text: her gaze but chooses to be oblivious.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
speaker_heading: wee SOpeee
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (0.S.)
dialog: Yay! My good friends! Yes!
text: ON CHARLOTTE in a banquette, waving. Her dinner companion,
text: CHARLIE, a slightly older British fellow, is excusing himself
text: to the restroom.
text: ON BILLIE/PETE, waving back.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (aside)
dialog: I think she wants us to...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (aside)
text: She's just waving...
text: Charlotte’s wave becomes a “waving over.” She gestures for
dialog: them to “join.”
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s just make an excuse...
dialog: There’s NO WAY she heard that, but...
dialog: JA 1st 28.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (calling over)
dialog: There is no reason I take!
text: Off Pete, giving a “What are we going to do?” to Billie,
dialog: We...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER
text: Peter and Billie are opposite Charlotte. A WAITER delivers
text: “first” drinks for Billie and Pete and “another round” for
text: Charlotte and her companion (still in bathroom. )
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (to Waiter)
dialog: And, bring another for my friends.
speaker_heading: BILLIE PETE
dialog: Oh, I’m not sure I’ll... Yeah, I’m good for...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: No smart to get now. Bar is crazy.
dialog: The Ibiza of the Alps, yes?
text: The Waiter heads off.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I drink if you not. Going to clubs.
text: Charlotte does a small “dance groove.” Pete attempts to fish
dialog: out her precise role.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's nice. So, a night off from--
dialog: (off Charlotte, not
dialog: clicking in)
dialog: Do you find you get enough time off
dialog: from your duties as a... ?
dialog: But, still no such luck--
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oh sure. Enough to catch a dick
dialog: whenever I want!
text: Billie swallows with a gulp.
speaker_heading: PETER BILLIE
dialog: That's... great. +.. Time is nice.
text: Charlie returns to the table. He slides next to Charlotte.
dialog: JA 1st 29.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: (introducing)
dialog: Charlie, this is Billie and Pete.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I was just talking about you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All good, I hope?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (with meaning)
dialog: Uh-huh, sure.
text: Charlie is gossipy and pally.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What did she say?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh. Um?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I said I can always catch a dick
dialog: when I like.
text: She smiles. Playful. But he’s not quite up to the challenge
dialog: of being so comic-casual about their liaison.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh. Oh, right?
text: Charlie takes a swig of his drink. Smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I mean. Okay, I just thought --
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I was kidding!
dialog: (off his slightly hurt
dialog: look)
dialog: Why, you think we're getting
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No! God. No.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I just thought. I had a nice time
dialog: today? This afternoon?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: JA 1st 30.
dialog: Charlie looks at her - aren’t you going to give me more?
text: Weird beat. Pete tries to break it...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And, you two know each other
dialog: from...?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Here. I got in on Sunday? She
dialog: showed me around.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yeah, but you’re a quick learner.
text: Charlotte licks her lips. Charlie smiles, flattered but also
text: discombobulated. The Waiter returns for more drinks, loading
text: up Billie and Pete. He starts to offer menus, but...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: No, I order for table. You’1l love.
dialog: (to Waiter)
dialog: You know what I’d say. All that and
dialog: bread. Yes?
text: The Waiter does know what she'd order and walks off.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Billie/Pete)
dialog: So, what do you do?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, I’m a lawyer. Trademark law.
dialog: (joking)
dialog: So, yeah. Riveting.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: No.
text: Billie is thrown.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Love it. Or, no do it.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, no. I love it. For me. Yes.
text: Charlotte smiles. “Good.” She looks at Pete, cueing up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m in real estate.
dialog: (then, quickly)
dialog: And, I love it.
dialog: JA 1st 31.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: And you guys have a good day on the
dialog: mountain?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (diving in)
dialog: Great day. Great conditions. Real
dialog: alpine experience.
dialog: Billie can’t let that fly--
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I mean, we almost all died in an
dialog: avalanche but... Yeah, great.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: ("don’t exaggerate”)
dialog: Come on, Billie...
dialog: (to Charlotte/Charlie)
dialog: There was a moment...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
text: There was an avalanche.
scene_heading: CHARLIE CHARLOTTE
dialog: Good Lord. Good fuck. Were you okay?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There was a - For a moment, it
dialog: could have felt dicey.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: For more than a moment it did feel
dialog: dicey.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. And, then it was over. And,
dialog: it was fine. We were fine...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: The kids were scared...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Of course...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Pete. What they saw was...
dialog: Does Pete know where this sentence is going? About him?
text: Regardless, he wants to end this.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes. Scary. For them, for sure. It
dialog: was. But, now we’re here. And, the
text: boys are upstairs watching a movie.
dialog: So, I guess I just... Emotionally,
dialog: we've already been through a lot
dialog: lately...
dialog: (to Charlotte/Charlie)
dialog: My dad died eight months ago. And,
dialog: our sons adored him. We all did.
dialog: And, it’s been hard. More so than
dialog: certainly I thought it would be.
dialog: It’s all been a lot. So, we came
dialog: here. That’s why we’re here.
text: Pete glances at Billie. That’s for her. As she said earlier:
dialog: “That's why we’re here.”
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: So, let’s just be here.
text: Billie nods, conceding in her mind to let go of the
text: conversation. She does know he’s been hurting. Pete reflects
text: on a memory.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: My dad was a travel agent for
dialog: thirty years. Not that he ever went
dialog: anywhere. What he knew of the world
dialog: was based on research. Anyway, when
dialog: he retired-- alongside one of his
dialog: good buddies-- They received these
text: beautiful, cut glasses. A set.
text: Billie has heard this story way too more times.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, they were precious to my Dad.
text: He just kept them up on a shelf.
dialog: Even when we went to visit, he
dialog: wouldn’t get them down. He was
dialog: saving them for... Who knows? Maybe
dialog: nothing. Well, when we were back
dialog: home for his funeral, I went to see
dialog: Hughie. That was his buddy from
dialog: work. And, we had a little drink to
dialog: toast my Dad in those cut glasses.
dialog: And, later, he tossed them right
dialog: into the dishwasher. And I asked,
dialog: “You use these for everyday?” And,
dialog: do you know what he said?
text: Charlie and Charlotte shake their heads.
dialog: *
dialog: JA 1st 33.
speaker_heading: BILLIE PETER
dialog: (under her breath) “Every day is all we have.”
dialog: “Every day is all we have.”
text: He just nods, letting his profundity lie there. While
text: respectful of the “sentiment,” Charlie and Charlotte choose
dialog: their words/reactions, carefully.
scene_heading: CHARLIE CHARLOTTE
dialog: (bone dry) Today might be it. Yes.
dialog: ... Very powerful.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: (not picking up on)
dialog: Yeah. So, to me. Today was today.
text: Charlotte clocks Billie, who seems to be “conceding” her
dialog: feelings about the avalanche/today.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Even so. Maybe you report to resort
dialog: safety, yes? If only to give you
dialog: ease?
dialog: Pete knows to agree here.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: ... No, yeah. For sure.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Billie is on her side of the dual sink, getting ready for
text: bed. Pete enters, choosing (probably wisely) to use the other
text: sink. A moment of silence, then...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was an avalanche. And, it was
dialog: scary. We experienced an avalanche.
dialog: And, look... You suffered some
dialog: shock.
dialog: Billie could bust up over this, but--
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We did suffer some shock.
text: More bubbles underneath, but for now a couple comes to an

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was scary.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - NIGHT
text: ON PETE, in bed. His eyes are closed, but it’s doubtful he’s
text: asleep. After a beat, he opens his eyes, sensing. He turns to
text: see Billie’s side of the bed is vacant.
text: From the BATHROOM, the faintest sound of TINNY MUSIC.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - SAME TIME
text: Billie sits on the toilet, with the top lid down. Her face
text: illuminated by her iphone. She’s playing an addictive, mind-
text: numbing game. Candy Crush or Tetris. The “candy” or “blocks”
text: tumble much like an “avalanche.”
scene_heading: THE SCREEN GOES BLACK
speaker_heading: SKI DAY 3
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, MAIN BEDROOM - DAY
text: Billie and Peter are dead asleep. The clock radio cuts the
text: silence. An aggressive German morning show blares. Peter hits
text: the clock radio, but it slides behind the side table, still
text: blaring.
text: Billie stirs awake as Peter fumbles to retrieve the clock
text: radio. Finally, success. Silence, again. Peter and Billie sit
text: up on the edges of their sides of the bed, backs to one
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS OF:
text: - Pete parts the curtains. Bright sun reflects off the white
text: vista. Pete squints a little. It’s a lot.
text: - All the ski gear is in messy piles. Billie, Pete and Em
text: pick through it all. Everyone with bedheads, looking
text: exhausted. But, true to form: Finn is dressed at the door.
scene_heading: EXT. RESORT SAFETY OFFICE - DAY
text: A semi-municipal, semi-commercial set of low wooden
text: buildings. There is a red cross on one of the windows.
dialog: JA 1st 35.
text: Out front, a couple of snow-mobiles and an official yellow *
text: jeep with a resort logo. *
scene_heading: INT. RESORT SAFETY OFFICE, ALL PURPOSE AREA - DAY
text: Snow melts on the institutional carpet of the common area,
text: complete with small break room/kitchenette. On four chairs:
text: Billie, Peter, Finn and Emerson in their ski outfits. Two
text: RESCUE TEAM MEMBERS sit at the break table on their phones. *
text: The only sound in the space: The twins banging their ski
text: boots together. Clack, clack, clack. After a beat, Billie
text: gently silences them for everyone's sanity.
text: Suddenly, the door to the outside bursts open. In steps
text: MICHEL (60s), the resort safety chief. He’s an old mountain
text: goat of a man. A bit intimidating. Unshaven. Wind-burnt face,
text: complete with an outline of his sunglasses/goggles. It’s
text: doubtful he believes in sunscreen. He stomps the snow off his
text: boots, staring at our family.
text: Michel has a soft, hushed German exchange with the Team *
text: Members. Clearly, they are “filling Michel in” as to the *
dialog: reason for our family’s presence.
text: ON BILLIE/PETE, having their own hushed English exchange:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Please don’t let that be who we
dialog: have to...
text: Michel looks back over at the family.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D) BILLIE
dialog: Yep. Okay... Yep. This is our guy.
scene_heading: INT. RESORT SAFETY OFFICE - DAY
text: Michel sits behind his desk. Peter and Billie, opposite him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So, we wish to make a complaint.
speaker_heading: MICHEL

dialog: We were at the, uh...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We were eating outside Wonnealm...
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (pronouncing it correctly)
dialog: Wonnealm.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (not getting it right)
dialog: Yes. Wonne--
speaker_heading: MICHEL BILLIE
dialog: Wonnealm. That place.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And, there was an avalanche.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
text: The controlled avalanche from
dialog: Zwolferkoph. Yes.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, you say it was ‘controlled’
dialog: but people freaked out.
text: Peter plays the ‘reasonable man’:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It caused alarm. For sure.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
text: Considerable alarm.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: So, you are coming to say you were
dialog: alarmed?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Considerably.
dialog: Pete knows he needs agree here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: -.. Considerable. Yes.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: But, everyone was safe?
dialog: JA 1st 37.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, we don’t know?
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Yes, I can tell you, obviously.
dialog: Everyone was safe.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. That’s good. That helps...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Why wasn’t there a warning?
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: There was a warning, posted at
dialog: lifts and at hotel receptions.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, we didn’t see it.
dialog: Against his better judgement,...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: «+. Well...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: No? Is that not correct?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Maybe? I mean, I think... I may
dialog: have seen something about snow
dialog: conditions?
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Yes. They were everywhere.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (still on Pete)
dialog: So, you saw it?
text: Pete realizes he shouldn’t have gone down this road.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t... I’m just saying... My
dialog: point is. The point I’m making...
dialog: (Off Billie, confused)
dialog: Warning or no warning. Seen it or
dialog: not. What happened was scary.
text: Pete locks in with Billie: “Correct? Scary?” Pete is trying
text: desperately to get back on the same page. Back to what they
text: already “agreed upon.” Billie “returns” to the task.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yes, it was scary.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Right.
dialog: (with authority to Michel)
dialog: And, we'd like an acknowledgment
dialog: that it was handled poorly.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: It was handled perfectly.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No. No it was not. You can’t tell
dialog: me that was supposed to go like
dialog: that. Snow came and it just --
dialog: Snow went over all the plates!
text: Michel lets that hang there a moment.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: ‘Snow went over the plates’?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was everywhere.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: So, you are here alarmed,
dialog: considerably, about the matter of
dialog: the snow on your plates?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You know what, this was a big event
dialog: that traumatized the family. I
dialog: don’t want to make this a legal
dialog: matter but,...
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: We are not in America where you sue
dialog: because your coffee is hot,
dialog: madame...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Screw you. I’m a lawyer.
dialog: 38.
text: Pete gets up, hoping to calm the situation/end it and shuffle
text: Billie out the door.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay, look, you’ve heard our
dialog: complaint...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Someone needs to hear it..
speaker_heading: JA
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And, we'd like a record kept
dialog: of it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I assure you that we’re not
dialog: ugly Americans. But,
dialog: obviously, my wife was shaken-
dialog: - I had a feeling it was
dialog: under control-- But, we both
dialog: wanted to bring this to your
dialog: attention. And, now we have.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: lst 39.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: And, know I could see you in
dialog: court. I mean, I do trademark
dialog: law-- And, I love it-- But,
dialog: know that there are
dialog: litagators at my firm. And,
dialog: you better believe they will
dialog: not hesitate to have my
dialog: back...
dialog: Thank you for your time...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: A “no thank you” for your time from
dialog: me.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY
text: Our family is in line. Billie is still processing what
text: happened in the office. Pete is searching his mind for the
dialog: right place to start here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What a jackass, huh?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «+. Yeah.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Who's a jackass?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: The man supposedly in charge,
dialog: that’s who.
text: Billie can’t help but side glance at her husband:
dialog: “AR man
text: supposedly in charge.” Beat of silence.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: .»+. Yeah. Big jackass.
text: As they scoot up, Billie notices a SIGN near the front of the
text: LIFT LINE. It’s a posting/warning for snow conditions and
text: “controlled avalanche” alert.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (loaded)
dialog: Is that the sign you may have seen?
dialog: JA 1st 40.
text: She doesn’t wait for Pete’s reply. She can guess it. She just

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - THAT NIGHT *
text: Billie is asleep. Pete’s side is empty. Through the cracks of *
text: the closed door BATHROOM, we see that the lights are on.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: This time, Pete is sitting on the toilet (lid down) on his
dialog: phone.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

text: ON BILLIE as her eyes, slowly, peel open. Is she sensing *
text: something? She jolts back at the sight of...
text: ON FINN, dressed to go, watching her sleep. She looks at the
text: time. Instant panic.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «+. Shit.

scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
text: The family waits out front in ski-gear. Silent and grumpy.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s a treat. It’s a Daddy
dialog: surprise. Should I tell them?
text: Billie is thinking about practicalities. The kids are hungry,
text: whiney.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Should I get us something from the
dialog: buffet?
text: Peter checks his watch.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: ... We are late...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Maybe fruit? Something?
text: Their CAR is pulled around by a VALET.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It'll be fine. Let’s go.
text: Billie grapples, but goes with no buffet...
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER LANDING AREA - DAY
text: At a small airfield. The SUV arrives, pulling up next toa
dialog: Heli-Ski company jeep.
text: Another YOUNG COUPLE are waiting in a small helicopter.
text: There’s a PILOT hanging by the chopper. A young HELI SKI

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Okay, we're here! Sorry.
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
dialog: The Stantons?

speaker_heading: FINN

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, it’s Daddy’s treat!
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: «.. I’m hungry.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Once you get in that powder, buddy,
dialog: you'll forget about that!
speaker_heading: BILLIE

dialog: Maybe, they have a protein bar or
dialog: something.
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
dialog: They were just about to go. *
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yep. Sorry. We overslept.
text: The chopper blades start going.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Do you have a bar?
dialog: *
text: The Employee does not understand “a bar.” She takes a stab at
dialog: an understanding. *
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE *
dialog: ... Uh, yes. This is a seatbelt. *
speaker_heading: BILLIE *
dialog: ... What? *
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE *
dialog: What? *
text: With the chopper going, it’s loud. Everyone has to shout. *
speaker_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
dialog: We should climb on...
dialog: JA 1st 43.
text: Pete’s gathering all the equipment up. She doesn’t have to
dialog: say that twice.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh. Okay. Is there a briefing now?
dialog: Things we should know...?
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
dialog: We can do it on the way.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are we good?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: ... Where’s my glove?
text: But, no one hears him.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (to Employee)
dialog: So, we're just going to...? Is

scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
dialog: As in?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: What’s going to happen?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We'll get all that on board.
speaker_heading: EMERSON

dialog: Mom! I can’t find my glove.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Why are you so stupid?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (mom mode)
dialog: Hey. Uh-uh. No. Come here.
text: Despite the “urgency,” Billie takes time for a “teachable
text: moment.” Finn steps over, face-to-face with Em.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Finn)
dialog: What don’t we do?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Call people names.
speaker_heading: JA 1st 44,
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: It’s mean.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: So, what do you say now?
text: Finn looks down at his feet, and utters a soft:
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No, you need to look him in the
dialog: eye, Finn. Say it loudly and
text: clearly so that he can hear it.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: (he does)
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Billie is satisfied. The Heli Ski Employee ushers them toward
text: the chopper.
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
dialog: We should go. The weather may
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah, hold on. We lost a -- Wait.
dialog: Change? To what?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (an excited child)
dialog: Let’s do this! “Every day is all we
dialog: ha--"
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We lost a glove, Pete. He needs a
dialog: glove.
dialog: (to Employee)
dialog: Change to, what?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There'll be a spare.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (to Employee)
dialog: Are there spares?
scene_heading: HELI SKI EMPLOYEE

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He can wear yours.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ("what?”)

text: Pete rectifies, immediately. He needs to.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He can wear mine, we should --
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: It won’t stay on, Pete--
text: He motions to the helicopter. The Pilot is motioning them
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We can figure it out...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We need gloves. We needed
dialog: breakfast.
text: Pete shouts to the Pilot.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you have gloves?! Protein bars?!
text: The Pilot can’t hear. He just holds his hand up to his ear.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (beyond frustrated)
dialog: Billie, this cost a couple of
dialog: grand. It’ll be fine, okay? This is
dialog: going to be the best, yeah?
text: Pete starts to walk away from them. That visual gets a
text: visceral reaction from her. She snaps.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No. No Pete. We’re missing a glove,
dialog: we haven't had breakfast and
dialog: there’s something about the weather
dialog: changing!
dialog: JA 1st 46.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER LANDING AREA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The helicopter takes off, leaving a blizzard of snow in its

text: standing there, watching it leave.
text: Billie and the kids walk back to the car, as Peter watches
text: the helicopter disappear up, up and away.
text: ON CAR, as they round the back. Billie spots the glove in the
text: snow and just gives it to Emerson.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The family (finally) has a very late breakfast/lunch. Billie
text: lugs more loaded-up plates from the buffet to the booth.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay! So we still have a whole
dialog: afternoon. What do we feel up for?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: The beach?
text: Billie has to laugh. Her son is clever. Pete does, too, but
text: he stays determined to rescue this day.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If we gobble all this down, we
dialog: could still get in an hour, hour
dialog: and a half, on the mountain?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I think we should cut our losses
dialog: for today. Maybe, we hunker down
dialog: for the afternoon? Build a fire?
dialog: S'mores? Play Uno?
text: Finn and Em approve.
speaker_heading: FINN/EM
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: BILLIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Love that idea.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, COMMON AREA - DAY - LATER
text: Billie and the Twins are playing Uno. But, no Pete, at the
dialog: moment.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME
text: Pete is back on the toilet (lid down) on his phone.
text: ON SCREEN. He’s texting with ZACH: “You sure? Is it cool?”
text: Pete hovers over the keys, pondering.
text: As he starts to type: “Totally. Billie would love...”
text: WE HEAR an OVEN DOOR SLAMMING and...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: Billie and Pete are in the KITCHEN, having a very hushed
text: conversation. The stove top is active with a few things
dialog: cooking.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: So, they just showed up?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, they were nearby. And, actually
dialog: called...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (very suspicious)
dialog: They just happened to call?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (“why would I lie?”)
dialog: Billie. Yes. They called and... I

dialog: phone.

scene_heading: IN COMMON AREA:
text: ZACH and ROSIE, sit on the couch, having cocktails. From the

dialog: And, it’s certainly not fooling Rosie.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: (pleasant, calling out)
dialog: Can we help?
scene_heading: IN KITCHEN AREA:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (overly pleasant)
dialog: No, we’re good! You guys relax!
text: Billie pops over to the MASTER BEDROOM to shut the door.
text: Inside, we get a glimpse of the Twins sitting on the bed
text: watching a movie. [NOTE: They both have on headphones,
dialog: listening to the movie. ]
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Well, I hope they like garlic bread
dialog: and kids spaghetti because that’s
dialog: what I have.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m sorry. I should have--
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yep. But, now you can’t. So, let’s
dialog: go offer them gold fish and baby
dialog: carrots.
text: Billie, in fact, grabs two bowls of those very items. The
dialog: “appetizers.”
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, COMMON AREA - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Billie and Pete join Zach and Rosie.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (maybe too much)
dialog: So, let’s hear about this trip!
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: From what we remember...? It’s been
dialog: pretty epic.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: From what I’ve seen, yeah!
dialog: JA 1st 49.
text: Pete keeps chiming in, hoping it all stays light.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: We've hit three countries in four
dialog: days. It’s insane. Just Tuesday, we
dialog: were having morning strudel in
dialog: Dusseldorf and by that afternoon,
dialog: we're hiking along the Rhine River
dialog: in France.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: And, there may have been some
dialog: shrooms on one or all of those
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You have to.
text: Billie can’t help but furrow her brow: “Really, Pete?”
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah, there’s something about
dialog: sporting backpacks-- Strangers just
dialog: want to give you things...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: And, talk to you. They’re all about
dialog: your business. Where you came from.
dialog: Where you’re headed. Who you are
dialog: and what you do.
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: It’s been fun to fuck with people.
dialog: Make up shit about ourselves.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (to Pete, jokingly)
dialog: Did you know I’m an archeologist?
dialog: Heading on a dig?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You didn’t.
text: Billie’s eyes can’t roll back far enough.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: We just made a decision. Our lives
dialog: at home are complicated enough.
dialog: This doesn’t need to be.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hashtag no agenda. Yeah, we love
dialog: that.
dialog: JA 1st 50.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: We didn’t even know what tonight
dialog: would be. Then, you texted. Now
dialog: we're here.
text: Shit. Billie shoots a glance at Pete. “Unbelievable.” Why
dialog: should she be surprised?
speaker_heading: ZACH (CONT’D)
dialog: We don’t even have return tickets?
dialog: Who knows what’s next?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You kind of do. Work on Monday.
speaker_heading: ZACH

speaker_heading: BILLIE

text: Swigs wine. Air out of fun.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: «+. SO, you guys been getting in
dialog: some good ski days?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, yeah. Good. Great days.
text: Pete can feel (and see) Billie’s expression. “Are you telling
text: them or am I?” Pete attempts to get a head of it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I mean, we did have one incident
dialog: that was unnerving. But, we got
dialog: over that and now we’re having a
dialog: great time.
text: Zach wants to nod past the difficulty, but...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Oh, okay? Was it...?
dialog: Zach looks like, “Shall we leave it?”
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was just an event we came
dialog: through was all.
text: Zach can feel the social temperature change and tries to ease
dialog: things along.
dialog: JA 1st 51.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It’s good to come through events,
dialog: isn’t it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's right. We’re good now. It
dialog: was nothing.
dialog: Peter’s pushed it too far for Billie.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: It wasn’t nothing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh sure. No, that’s the wrong word.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: It was something.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, yeah.
text: Billie locks in with Zach and Rosie. She tells the story. In
dialog: complete control.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We were outside at a restaurant and
text: there was a bang. And, suddenly
text: this wall of snow was rumbling down
dialog: the mountain. And, it did not look
dialog: like it was going to stop. It
dialog: looked like it going to kill us...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: For a moment,...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No. No.
text: Billie is not asking to tell this story together. Pete
text: concedes the floor. For now.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And, it wasn’t just us that felt
dialog: this way. People were getting up,
dialog: screaming. And, I screamed. And the
text: kids screamed. And, it felt like
dialog: this was it. We were going to die.
dialog: I looked at Peter. And, he had
text: jumped up and grabbed his phone.
text: Gone. Pete ran. Pete left us.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: JA 1st 52.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess in his mind he left us
dialog: there to get buried because he
dialog: could make it away and we’re too
dialog: far away or on the other side or...
dialog: I don’t know. And so, we just
dialog: stayed there and I put my arm
dialog: around our sons and I waited for a
dialog: moment. I waited for us to die
dialog: together. And then, bang.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m still there. And the kids stop
dialog: screaming. And we realize, we're
text: okay. And then, Peter comes back
dialog: and we just... we just have soup. *
speaker_heading: + HH HH
dialog: %
text: Silence. Billie and Pete just stay locked on each other. Who *
text: goes next? There’s an air to Pete. A man holding strong. In
text: his head, spinning for sure. A man who knows he’s on trial.
text: His manhood, questioned. Rosie doesn’t hesitate to support
dialog: and recognize Billie’s experience.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: That’s intense.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Rosie joins Billie in her look to Pete. She’s curious how
text: Pete could have done that. Zach, on the other hand, is trying
dialog: to defuse. *
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Wow. Yeah, that’s... I guess, there *
dialog: are... You know, when something
dialog: like that happens, it can be, it
dialog: can be like a survival reaction?
text: Zach looks to Peter: “Yeah?” But, Pete is focused on Billie *
text: still. Is he plotting a defense? Zach answers his own
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: ZACH (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s almost like... You know when a
dialog: snail or something goes into it’s
dialog: shell? It’s an instinct...?
text: Pete settles on his next move:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How could I even have possibly run
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: -.. What?
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: In ski boots? It’s not even
dialog: credible. Can you run in ski boots?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ... What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zach, can you run in ski boots?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: --- Um... ?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Fine. “Clomp away.” “Walk,
dialog: briskly...”
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You said “run.” Rosie, can you run
dialog: in ski boots?
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: I don’t... Not very...?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Boom. Exactly...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Regardless-- I wouldn't, like,
dialog: leave my family to die?
speaker_heading: BILLIE PETER
dialog: (pointing at Rosie) No, nor would I. And, I
dialog: That's “boom exactly...” didn't.
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just she said you did?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: He did.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, for fuck’s sake, Billie. Why
dialog: are you..? And, I didn't leave you
dialog: to be buried...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I don’t know...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I do! I was there. And, I saw it
dialog: differently.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Great. Tell me what happened,
dialog: differently!
speaker_heading: PETER
text: There was the snow coming. Almost
text: like an avalanche...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh my-- Now, it’s not even a
dialog: avalanche?!
text: Pete powers on.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I checked you guys, visually. And,
dialog: once it was clear that it was going
dialog: to be okay, I went to get help. For
text: the aftermath.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That doesn’t even make sense! You
dialog: knew it was okay? So, you went to
dialog: get help?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was all very confusing.
dialog: Everything happened fast. BUT, I
dialog: checked you were going to be okay
dialog: and I went to get help.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That’s not what happened.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can accept your version of the
dialog: truth Billie, why can’t you accept
dialog: mine?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Simple. Mine is true. And, not
dialog: dumb.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, you weren’t there with me.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No! I was at the table. With our
dialog: sons!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I love that you are making me say
dialog: that what happened for you,
dialog: happened for me.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
dialog: 55.
text: Billie is beside herself. She heads out of the room. Focus
text: falls on Zach, who is looking for a way to say something. He *
dialog: comes up with:
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: .+. This is very difficult.
text: Met with silence.
speaker_heading: ZACH (CONT’D)
dialog: You know a lot of times people
dialog: involved in road traffic accidents
dialog: get things totally wrong...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Stop pitching theories.
text: Billie returns, holding the hands of the twins, who have *
text: their headphones round their necks.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I’m sorry kids, but just one
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Billie? No, no.
text: The kids are surprised to be in the adult arena, on show.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We were just telling our friends
dialog: about how we were having lunch,
dialog: remember? And, there was the
dialog: avalanche coming? What did Mom and
dialog: Dad do?
text: The Twins hesitate.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You can say. It’s for the story. *
dialog: They wanted to hear. They can say
dialog: right, Peter?
text: Peter is acting as if she’s gone over the edge: “I give up.” *
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: The truth.
text: Emerson looks at the floor.
dialog: JA 1st 56.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: -- Um, -- Dad ran away.
text: Billie acts lightly, jolly, like this is all a game:
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Heheh. Yeah, okay, is that how you
dialog: remember it Finn?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Okay, well let’s get you back to
dialog: the movie!
text: Peter just sits there as Rosie and Zach look uncomfortable.
text: Painful beat. Zach tries to ease.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: «+. They’re such great kids.
text: Billie returns.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are they okay?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Of course, they’re okay.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You might have traumatised them,
dialog: you know that?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, I traumatised them?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You care about being right so
dialog: fucking much, don’t you?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I just want to get things straight.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, you want to get them “right.”
dialog: You're “right.” Well, I guess,
dialog: Billie’s right. So,
dialog: congratulations, Billie! You win.
dialog: Come on, everyone, give her a round
dialog: of fucking applause. Billie’s won,
dialog: again!!
dialog: JA 1st 57.
text: Peter starts to clap and stands up. Zach smiles, tightly. He
dialog: can think of literally nothing to try to make things better.
text: HOWEVER, he opens his mouth, as if to speak and...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: There is nothing you need to say
dialog: here.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, TWINS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Billie sleeps, cuddled up to Em and Finn. WE HEAR the muffled
text: sound of TV emanating from another part of the suite.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - NIGHT - SAME TIME
text: Peter is drinking a beer, cross legged, mindlessly watching
dialog: an episode of “Murder, She Wrote” in German. (Or, some other
dialog: cleared show, current or old. Whatever it is, it’s dubbed
dialog: over.)
speaker_heading: SKI DAY 4
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - THE NEXT MORNING
text: CLOSE ON ALARM. It turns from 6:59 to 7:00. BUZZZZ! A HAND
text: comes into frame, shutting it off.
text: REVEAL Billie, her hand on the alarm, standing by Pete’s side
text: of the bed. Pete wakes up.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I’m going to take a solo day.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: «+. Oh okay...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You and the boys can have an
dialog: adventure.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. Great. Maybe, we’ll cross
dialog: paths on the mountain?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Actually, I saw a leaflet for those
dialog: alpine rail slides. The boys might
dialog: enjoy them. They have them over at
dialog: the family resort. The one just
dialog: “minutes of 20” from here?
dialog: *
dialog: *
dialog: + eH
dialog: JA 1st 58.
text: Billie has a shit-eating grin focused on Pete. Does she
dialog: suspect he knew of the family resort’s existence?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: -+. Yeah. Love that idea.
text: As she crosses off, we...
scene_heading: INT. SKI HIRE SHOP, LOCKERS - DAY
text: Billie is starting her “solo day,” putting on her
text: uncomfortable boots. She snaps them into place, wincing, as
text: she watches a couple of YOUNG GUYS renting out equipment. One
text: well-built SKI SHOP EMPLOYEE is grabbing a couple snowboards
text: from up-high, exposing his wash-board stomach.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (0.S.)
dialog: Getting an eyeful?
text: Charlotte is there, smiling insinuatingly. [NOTE: Charlotte
text: looks dressed for skiing, but there will be no presence of
dialog: actual ski equipment throughout the following exchange. ]
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh. No, I was just-- No.
text: Billie grabs her stuff and heads to the exit. Charlotte
text: follows.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: So. Where is your team?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, I just felt like a solo day.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yes. Good. Adventure just for you.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ... Yes. Okay. Adventure.
text: Charlotte smiles, knowingly.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: And, fun. Yes? Fun just for you.
text: Charlotte nods, as if they are definitely on the same page.
text: Billie has no idea what page that is, but she nods if only to
dialog: complete the moment.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: .«.. Okay, well...
dialog: JA 1st 59.
text: Charlotte holds the door open for Billie and continues with
dialog: her. Guess the moment is not “completed.”
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: Billie steps onto the MOVING WALKWAY. Charlotte follows,
text: studying Billie. Once again, Billie tries to get a precise
dialog: fix on this woman:
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Are you heading this way to get to
dialog: your job as...?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I'm interested, your boys:
dialog: naturally conceived, or in vitro
dialog: fertilization?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh - um. Okay.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I have a friend and she was
dialog: thinking about it. I apologize if
dialog: for you it’s very --
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No. No. It’s personal, yes. But, I
dialog: don’t actually mind talking about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Because they’re twins and you are
dialog: very old, yes?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, at the time--
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: They are ten, no? So, still--
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yes. Okay. Yes, correct. We
dialog: considered a surrogate but in the
dialog: end, yeah, it worked out with the
dialog: help of a clinic. So, yeah...
dialog: (off walkway)
text: This seems slow.
text: Billie opts to walk on the walkway and pick up the pace of
text: all of this. Charlotte stays right with her.
dialog: JA 1st 60.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: And was it okay? Or, lots of
dialog: heartbreak?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, you know, okay. Then,
dialog: heartbreak. Then okay. It was
dialog: everything. It was hard. But, I
dialog: kind of just gritted my teeth.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yes. You’re strong.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ... Maybe.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: No.
text: Charlotte actually grabs Billie’s arm and gazes right at her.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: You are strong.
text: Billie nods. But, Charlotte just holds her stare. Relentless.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah, no, I know that...
dialog: (conceding)
dialog: I am strong.
text: Charlotte smiles. Approving. Billie: “Wtf?”
scene_heading: EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY
text: Billie plops her skis down in the snow, just shy of the long
text: line for the lift.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Okay, well, I’m where I wanted to
dialog: get to, so thank you...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: No, no. This wait is not for you.
text: Charlotte holds up the divider rope, indicating to Billie to
text: skip the line. Billie picks her skis back up, as we...
scene_heading: EXT. SKI GONDOLA - DAY
text: Billie places her skis in the gondola holders herself.
dialog: JA 1st 61.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Okay, well, now I’m where I wanted--
dialog: Thank you for...
text: Charlotte shuttles Billie on...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Adventure, yes? Now. Fun?
dialog: Jeez. She will not let this go.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yes. All that. Just for me.
text: Unbeknownst to Billie, Charlotte waves to a young ski
text: instructor, MAROUANE. He waves back and steps onto the
text: gondola behind them. Then, Charlotte boards with Billie. What
dialog: is happening?
scene_heading: INT. GONDOLA - DAY
text: Billie and Charlotte ride up. There’s a decent-sized group of
text: SENIOR SKIERS on board. From the sound of them, they are all
dialog: Austrian.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: So, can I ask you... Have you had a
dialog: varied life of sexual experience?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: --. I’m sorry? Have I--?
scene_heading: CHARLOTTE BILLIE
dialog: Have you had a varied life of No, I’m not asking so you’1l
dialog: sexual---? repeat it---
text: Billie glances at the Senior Skiers, self-conscious.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (re: Skiers)
dialog: At that age, they rarely bother
dialog: with English.
text: It seems true, at this moment. None of them are paying
text: attention, involved in their own conversations. And, all in
dialog: German.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (scoffing, “unbelievable” )
dialog: Boy, you just get right in there,
dialog: don’t you?
dialog: JA 1st 62.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I'm sorry, it’s just - I don’t like
dialog: so much bullshit all the time.
text: For the first time, Billie really hears something from
text: Charlotte that resonates for her.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t see the point of bullshit.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «+. No yeah. I don’t like so much
dialog: bullshit. No, that’s good.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You just seem to me, like...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: What? A “one man” woman?
text: Charlotte’s silence tells her the answer:
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you’d be surprised. I know my
dialog: way around the -
text: She gestures a “dick.” Charlotte doesn’t seem convinced. Yet.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: In college, I did my fair share of,
dialog: you know,...
text: A bad gesture of a “blow job.” A short, BURST OF LAUGHTER
text: emanates from somewhere in the gondola. Billie glances over
dialog: wondering if someone caught that/understood. But, nope. All
text: of them are still in their own German worlds.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I don’t like to perform that.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, no one likes it.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: So, why do you do it?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No, I'm kidding. I like it. I mean,
dialog: I don’t LOVE it. It’s fine.
dialog: *
dialog: + eH
dialog: JA 1st 63.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I just tend to only do what I like.
dialog: I masturbate. Every day. Because,
dialog: that’s for me...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (half joking/half
dialog: wondering)
dialog: And, having sex with guests, I
dialog: guess...? *
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yes. That is very for me. *
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: But, you’re married, right? *
text: Charlotte’s ring is there on her finger. She nods.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, how does that work for you? *
dialog: With everything? With Mr. Charlie
dialog: and other “guy friends?” *
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Easy. I work the winters here. In
dialog: the summer, my husband and I have
dialog: our farm. What I eat, doesn’t make
dialog: him shit.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, okay?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I think that is a beautiful phrase.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ("Is it?”) *
dialog: ... No, yeah. Absolutely.
dialog: (then) *
dialog: But, will you tell your husband
dialog: about...?
dialog: *
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Can we shake hands?
text: Charlotte holds out her hand. Billie, apprehensive, shakes.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, will I tell my husband about
dialog: that? Will you? Should we? Our
dialog: bodies touched. We have a little
dialog: intimacy.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, that’s not exactly...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Why is there this absurdity if
dialog: these two parts of our bodies
dialog: touch?
dialog: (waves hand)
dialog: No big deal. But, the other ones.
dialog: (she mimics huge shock)
dialog: No! The bodies touched! The special
dialog: parts! Oh my goodness, what shall
dialog: we do! God is angry in his heaven!
dialog: The marriage must be over, the
dialog: special parts have rubbed!
dialog: (the slightly alarming act
dialog: is over)
dialog: It’s superstition.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, shaking hands can’t make
dialog: babies, whereas --
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oh please. Sex doesn’t need to make
dialog: babies and you don’t need sex to
dialog: make babies. So. Shall we all move
dialog: on now? Please?
text: They're approaching the top of the gondola.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No. Sure. I’m just not convinced
dialog: it’s as easy as you make it out.
dialog: Isn’t your arrangement,
dialog: complicated?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Isn't everything?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I guess I just feel, a
dialog: relationship, it’s-- What is it,
dialog: but kind of a story? And, it’s
dialog: important you’re both in the same
dialog: one, right?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I guess I make my own story.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ... But, are you happy?
dialog: 64.
dialog: JA 1st 65.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Yes. Very. Are you?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ... Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I’d say
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: So, good. You have your story the *
dialog: way you want it. And, I have mine.
dialog: Yes?
dialog: Billie thinks a little too long about this. Which, might
dialog: surprise her, too.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ~-. Yes.
text: They have arrived at the top. The Senior Skiers and Billie
text: step off, grabbing their skis. But, Charlotte stays on.
text: ON MAROUNE, getting off the next gondola.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (waving him over)
dialog: Okay. Now. Maroune will be your *
dialog: instructor. *
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: --Wait. Who will be my what--?
text: Charlotte just winks as she travels away in the gondola.
scene_heading: SENIOR FEMALE SKIER
dialog: (to Billie, Austrian *
dialog: accent) *
dialog: I like to perform it. And, on him, *
dialog: I would. *
dialog: Yep. At least, she understood everything. As Maroune *
dialog: *
text: approaches, all sexy smile, we...
scene_heading: EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY
text: The SUV pulls into the lot. Unlike where the family has been
text: staying, this place is flooded with FAMILIES WITH KIDS. The
text: whole vibe feels different. Definitely, with kids in mind. In
text: fact, all the signage includes, “Berta the Cow,” the resort
text: mascot. Yep. A cow.
dialog: JA 1st 66.
scene_heading: EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY
text: Em, Finn and Pete (in that order) are all in their individual
text: slide cars. An ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE works her way along
text: them, checking that they each know how to operate the hand
dialog: brake.
scene_heading: ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE
dialog: (to Em)
dialog: Forward to go.
text: Em pushes the handle forward to show he understands.
speaker_heading: ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
text: Back to brake.
text: Em shows her that. The Alpine Slide Employee gives Em a
text: “thumbs up” and points to a security camera pointed at them.
dialog: Clearly, for confirmation that they understood about safety.
text: Em gives a “thumbs up.” The Alpine Slide Employee moves back
text: to Finn and goes through the same instructions, then to Pete.
speaker_heading: ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: Forward to go.
text: Pete does.
speaker_heading: ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
text: Back to brake.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Won’t be needing to.
scene_heading: ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE
dialog: (not having it)
text: Back to brake.
text: Pete eats crow and shows that he understands, as we...
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: We’re back with Billie and Marouane, who it turns out, is
text: very French. They stand at the precipice of a slope.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: So, first thing of instruction.
dialog: Coffee!
dialog: JA 1st 67.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: To be honest,...
dialog: (pronounced wrong)
speaker_heading: Ma-ROON-ON
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Marouane.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
speaker_heading: Mar-OO-NON
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Marouane. Like, marijuana, without
dialog: the ‘a’. Marijuan-a. Marouane?
text: Billie carefully says “Marijuana” and conscientiously stops
dialog: before the “a.”
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: To be honest, Marijuan... I didn’t
dialog: ask for a, uh-- I’m actually a
dialog: pretty decent skier.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Why stop at decent? There’s better
dialog: than decent?
text: He pulls a thermos from his knapsack.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (displaying)
dialog: See? Coffee. Decent.
text: Then, he pulls out a flask.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alpine coffee. Better, no?
dialog: Billie considers.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Okay, yeah. Why not? I can be more
dialog: than decent.
text: He adds a healthy pour of the flask into her coffee.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. Okay. A lot more than decent.
text: He winks at her, as she “bottom’s ups.”
dialog: JA 1st 68.
scene_heading: EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY
text: Finn, Em, and Pete ascend the mountain, spaced a good
text: distance apart. (It operates much like a “roller coaster,”
dialog: pulling you up to the top on the track.)
text: ON PETE, as we watches SKIERS whisk by. A hint of “I wish I
dialog: was doing that” is undeniable.
text: LATER - They make it to the top and, one by one, descend.
text: ON EM. Contrary to skiing, Em appears not to be afraid of
text: speed on the slide. He’s an expert at navigating the curves.
dialog: This is his thing.
text: ON FINN. He’s more hesitant, riding the brake. His pace is
text: much slower.
text: ON PETE. True to form, he’s all speed.
text: PETE’S POV of Finn, up ahead. He’s gaining on him.
text: BACK TO SCENE.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (joking)
dialog: I’m coming for you, Finn!
text: As he gets closer,...
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ease up on the break, buddy. It’s
dialog: fun!
text: ON FINN. He does, speeding up a little.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: There you go!
text: BACK WITH EM, having the time of his life. While fast, Em is
text: being responsible about his brake. Safe. He passes a CAMERA
text: BOX that snaps photos for purchase as you pass by.
text: BACK WITH FINN. He’s coming up on a sharp curve. He brakes a
dialog: good bit.
text: ON PETE, pulling his brake, but fast approaching.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Alright, I’m gonna tap you!
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Don’t.
dialog: JA 1st 69.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (doesn’t hear him)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Don't!
text: But, he does. Not a slam, by any means. Truly a tap, but it
text: does jolt Finn.
text: ON CAMERA BOX, flashing a photo of that moment.
scene_heading: EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER
text: Post ride. CAMERA HOLDS ON Finn and Em, standing near the
text: entrance. Each has a PHOTO. Em’s photo is of him beaming on
text: the ride. Finn’s is of Pete bumping into him.
text: Behind them, in the distance and out of earshot, is Pete with
text: an ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE. We can't hear them, but it’s pretty
text: clear Pete is being reprimanded.
text: After the “reprimand,” Pete approaches.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Did you get kicked out?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: ("yes")
dialog: No. I just thought we’d, you
dialog: know,... do other things.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Because, you got kicked out?
scene_heading: EXT. SLOPES - DAY
text: Billie is having a great run. She seems very relaxed.
text: Marouane follows closely behind, encouraging and instructing.
text: They get to a stopping point.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Nice!
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Whoa. That felt so different.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Yes because you leaned into it.
dialog: With confidence. Just flow. No need
dialog: to work so hard.
dialog: JA 1st 70.
dialog: Billie likes that. “No need to work so hard.”
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointing down slope)
dialog: Now, you tackle this.
text: Below, a good stretch of pronounced moguls.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, I can’t do moguls. I know that.
text: Marouane is not having it. Presents her with the flask.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: So, just “alpine” now. No coffee?
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: (sexy fucking smile)
dialog: Decent. Better.
dialog: (indicating flask)
dialog: Best.
text: Billie takes a huge swig off the flask.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do like faster? Or slower?
text: Billie is confused.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: moguls/slope)
dialog: Do you want to go faster or slower?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «+. Faster.
text: Maroune steps up behind Billie, perhaps a bit too close, but
dialog: not invasive.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: (pointing at slope)
text: Hands out in front. Find a line and
dialog: Narrow your stance and go around
dialog: each bump. Not over. Maintain a
text: steady rhythm.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (little overwhelmed)
dialog: Maybe, I just follow you...?
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: No. Find a line. Steady rhythm. Do
dialog: not look back. I will be there.
dialog: JA 1st 71.
text: Billie exhales, prepares. She takes off. It’s wonky, but she
text: finds a line. As Marouane follows, shouting instructions,
dialog: We...
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY RESORT RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The Twins are having hot cocoa and snacks. Again, the vibe is
text: different. FAMILIES everywhere. A costumed version of “Berta
text: The Cow” roams the room, taking photos with guests. Pete
text: approaches with a resort pamphlet.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Alright, let’s see what we can get
dialog: into here. Ski, obviously. Right?
dialog: We can ski. Ski park.
text: Pete glances up, slightly. He’s hoping the boys perked up to
text: those options. Nope. He keeps reading.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: What else? There’s a toboggan run.
dialog: Arcade. Indoor mini golf.
dialog: (actually surprised)
dialog: Indoor waterpark?
text: Pete starts perusing options, silently. Probably, to avoid
dialog: the evidence that this place is awesome.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Yeah. A good amount of stuff.
dialog: What are we thinking?
text: But, the boys are silent.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong? Something on your
dialog: minds?
text: Em and Finn stall, looking at one another.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: You can tell me anything.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: You don’t seem like you’re having
dialog: fun?
text: A dagger to his heart. Riddled with a guilty feeling.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: «+. What? Why would you think--?
dialog: JA 1st 72.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Do you want to be here?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What? Of course-- Guys. Listen to
dialog: me. I love being with you. More
dialog: than anything. You know that,
dialog: right?
text: The boys are give nothing at first. And then, just shrugs.
text: They aren’t sure. Brutal.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this about the slide? Daddy did
dialog: get kicked off. But, because Daddy
dialog: was having too much fun.
dialog: Nope. That doesn’t seem to be it.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this about yesterday? The
dialog: helicopter? I just wanted that for
dialog: all of us. I messed that up. I
dialog: overslept. And, we should have had
dialog: food. Is that what makes you think
dialog: that I’m not having fun?
text: Em and Finn look at each other, again. Clearly, it’s because
dialog: of something else. But, maybe they don’t want to say? Pete
text: fears the worst: the avalanche.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you two. So much. I’ve just
dialog: been--
text: Pete avoids “an excuse.”
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s finish this day, right. Just
dialog: us boys. What are you thinking?
text: Pete slides the resort pamphlet in front of them. They glance
dialog: for a beat. But, then...
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Can we have screen time? Back at
dialog: our hotel?
text: Pete flashes a big smile, hiding his stress.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: ... Yeah. Absolutely.

scene_heading: EXT. SKI WARMING HUT - DAY
text: Billie descends more moguls, pretty expertly. Marouane right
text: behind. She comes to a stop, exuberant. She’s breathing
dialog: pretty hard.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That’s a lot of work.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: But, good, yes?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No, yeah. Worth it.
text: Billie is definitely winded.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Let us rest, yes? Warm up? And
dialog: then, go again?
text: Off Billie’s nod, Marouane skis toward the WARMING HUT, as
dialog: We...
scene_heading: INT. SKI WARMING HUT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Marouane lights an oil heater. Billie can’t help but eye the
text: smooth back of Marouane’s neck. His back is spectacular, too.
text: A specimen. The light is flattering and cozy over the bare
dialog: room: Water; supplies; sleeping bags rolled up; emergency
text: equipment; table and chairs.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: How do your calves feel?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, I can feel them alright.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: You might want to... For ten
dialog: minutes or so?
text: He’s taking his ski boots off. Billie starts to pull her feet
text: out of her boots.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (slapping his thighs)
dialog: It can burn here, no?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh yeah. Yup.
dialog: JA 1st 74.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Sometimes I can give people, just
dialog: on the calves or something, a rub?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (wry) |
dialog: Oh. Sometimes you can do that, can
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Yeah. That’s something I do.
text: Marouane kneels to rub her calf.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes? Just to relax out those
dialog: muscles a little. It’s recommended.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh well, if it’s “recommended.”
text: He rubs gently, but firmly. More sports massage than sensual
dialog: come-on. Not too much.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Uh-huh?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Uh-huh. Um. That’s. Yeah. Uh-huh.
text: As he rubs, keeping his hand below her knee, Marouane seems
text: to be studying her.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: So, I’m curious. Who is Billie?
text: Billie scoffs. Is that a line?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: ... What?
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: Why is that silly? To want to know?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: It just sounds like a, uh... I
dialog: mean, “Who?” How do you even
dialog: answer...?
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: (without missing a beat)
dialog: I am very confident, but never
dialog: afraid to admit when I am wrong. I
dialog: tend to fall in love too fast.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: JA 1st 75.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: And, heal too slow. I love to
dialog: paint. And, I’m good at it.
dialog: However, I cannot sing. But, that
dialog: does not stop me from doing it
dialog: everyday.
text: He heads up a bit higher, up above the knee, massaging the
text: front of her thighs. She shifts her body subtly to let him
dialog: know it’s okay.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Skiing is a passion, yes, but
dialog: teaching feeds my soul. To witness
dialog: someone surprise themselves. I live
dialog: for that. And, I am the only child
dialog: of a single mom and she is my hero.
text: He lets that sit, then...
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: That is how I answer.
text: Billie is flush. Her heart racing. He moves up higher,
text: massaging with his thumbs, up towards her inner thighs. It
dialog: feels good.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh-huh?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: You do not need to share with me
dialog: who you are, Billie. But, you must
dialog: promise me.
text: Marouane locks in, holding Billie’s gaze. His eyes stare
text: right at her lips.
speaker_heading: MAROUANE (CONT'D)
dialog: You must promise that you will
dialog: never find it silly when people
dialog: want to make it about you.
text: And, with that, a kiss. A perfect kiss, but not lustful. The
text: kiss breaks. Marouane holds his gaze and slides his hand up
text: her body. But, Billie stops him.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Thank you. But, that’s where this
dialog: ends.
text: Marouane does not hesitate. He respects that. Backs off.
speaker_heading: JA 1st
speaker_heading: MAROUANE
dialog: I apologize if I...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No. I did what I wanted to do. And
dialog: now, I want to ski.
text: She starts to collect her things.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But, make no mistake, I could fuck
dialog: you right through that wall. If I
dialog: wanted. But, I don’t. And, I
dialog: wouldn’t. That much I know about
dialog: me.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - DAY
text: Pete drives in silence. The boys in the back. Pete glances in
dialog: 76.
text: the rearview, pondering. He needs to get back some “love.”
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey, guys. The bidet-- The European
dialog: thing-- You know what that’s really
dialog: for?
text: The shake their heads.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cleaning your butt.
text: They perk up, looking at one another. Is he kidding?
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. It sprays water up and, uh...
text: Pete decides to double down on “cool points.”
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. It cleans the shit out of
dialog: your butthole.
text: The boys are a mixture of shock and joy.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yep. Mom said “feet,” but after you
dialog: take a dump, it’s to clean your
dialog: butthole.
dialog: *
dialog: JA 1st 77.
text: A giggle fit begins. The mood shifts. Pete feels better, but
dialog: thinks to be smart and safe...
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: But, no hijinx now that you know.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Billie squats in a little copse of fir trees, taking a piss.
text: She looks through the trees to where Marouane waits, leaning
text: on his poles, staring the other way out and down into the
dialog: valley.
text: She’s happy. Proud. Relaxed.
text: Over this image, WE HEAR: CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP, as we...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - DAY
text: Billie heads across reception. Clomping in her ski boots. A
text: woman on a mission. She heads into the...
speaker_heading: RESTROOM.
scene_heading: INT. REST ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: She clomps straight into a STALL. From the looks of it, she’s
text: alone. Even if she wasn’t, she wouldn’t seem to mind.
text: IN STALL. She has it in mind to masturbate. What starts as
text: confidence slowly evolves into awkwardness as:
text: - She pulls off her gloves and lowers the zipper on her ski
text: suit. But, her jacket is bulky. Need to lose that.
text: - Her goggles and helmet clatter to the floor.
text: - She tries sitting on the toilet, trying to get her hand in
text: her pants. But, still too many layers.
text: - She stands, navigating zippers and straps. Tangled.
text: OFF SCREEN, “someone” enters. More CLOMPING boots. Billie
text: freezes. The FAUCET comes on. Whoever it is, is washing her
text: hands. Then, the powerful AIR DRYER comes on. Nice cover for
dialog: Billie.
text: - She leans back against the door, putting a foot up on the
text: toilet. Success. An angle. Just as she “begins,...”
dialog: JA 1st 78.
text: THE LATCH GIVES. She falls back onto the floor. Disheveled
text: but not indecent. Our BATHROOM WOMAN stands at the air dryer,
text: perplexed. Billie starts to collect herself and things, as...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I, uh, had a problem in there. I
dialog: think I just... I think it was just
dialog: one of those classic times when
dialog: your contact pops out and, uh...
dialog: Yeah I bent over and blacked out
dialog: when I stood up too fast. So,...
text: She trails off. The moment lingers a bit until...
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (clears throat)
dialog: Yeah, we don’t have to... This
dialog: doesn’t need to continue...
text: The Bathroom Woman goes back to air drying her hands.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: Billie and Pete are at the dual sinks, separated by the
text: mirror. Plenty of tension. Mostly, felt by Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: ... How was your solo day?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Great. Yeah. It was great.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That’s awesome.
text: Pete assumes she will reciprocate. Long beat. Nope. So,...
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Me and the boys had fun.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, we hit the slide for a good
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Until you got kicked off?
text: Doh. As she heads out, we...
dialog: JA 1st 79.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER *

speaker_heading: SKI DAY 5 *
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - MORNING
scene_heading: QUICK IMAGES OF:

text: - The room is dark. Pete sits on the side of his bed.
text: - Pete picks his ski stuff out of the piles. *
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete stands just outside the TWINS’ ROOM. The door is
text: slightly ajar.
text: PETE'S POV of Billie and the boys on bed, watching something
text: on an iPad together. Billie is holding it up so they can all
text: see as they lie on their backs.
text: BACK TO SCENE, as Pete lightly taps and opens the door.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: EM/FINN
dialog: (staring at iPad)
dialog: Morning, dad.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: .-. Morning.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Are we...?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I think we’re going to do this for
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: «+. Okay. Zach texted about joining *
dialog: us. I think Rosie is sleeping in. *
dialog: JA 1st 80.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Great. You guys have fun.

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Should we meet up for dinner? Do
dialog: the restaurant?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You guys have fun.
text: But, the three are lost in the iPad.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Pete steps off the elevator. Zach, dressed to ski, is there.
text: And, he’s wearing a_knit cap.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Let’s do this.
dialog: Pete considers.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hold up.
text: As Pete heads back onto the elevator,...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LIFT - DAY
text: Pete and Zach are in line. And yes, Pete is now wearing his
dialog: dad's old hat. No helmet for this cool motherfucker. Zach,
text: discreetly, takes a hit on his vape pen. He hands it to Pete
text: with a wink.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: A little Amsterdam in Austria.
text: Pete considers: “Why not?” Zach snaps a quick selfie with
dialog: Pete.
speaker_heading: ZACH (CONT’D)
dialog: Hashtag it begins!
dialog: JA 1st 81.
text: LATER - Zach and Pete are at the front of the lift line. They *
text: shuffle into place. The same Lift Operator is there. Pete *
text: waits, but the Operator says nothing. He beams. He’s “cool.”
scene_heading: EXT. PISTE - DAY
text: Zach and Peter are at the top of a run. Pete can’t help it. *
text: This feels good. To be standing here now. Free.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How great is this?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: So great.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: All I have to do, right now. My *
dialog: only obligation? Go down.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah. Live your best life.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah. Every day is all we have.
text: They fist bump. And, with that, push off. Confident. Free. *
scene_heading: EXT. SLOPE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: Pete’s having a great run. Maybe, a little loose from the
text: vape, but in control.
text: A SNOWBOARDER cuts across his path, nearly colliding. *
text: Pete loses his balance, struggles. He can’t stay up and bites *
text: it hard. His momentum carries him, sliding down the slope, in
text: a direct path with a SNOW GUN MACHINE.
dialog: *
text: He skids to a halt, hitting his head on the machine. Not too
text: hard, but he feels it. He sits up and checks the back of his *
text: head for blood. But, luckily, none.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY
text: Billie and the kids are in line for the lift. [NOTE: This a
text: two seater.] Rosie skis up into line.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Well, hello there. Going up? Mind
dialog: if I...?
dialog: JA 1st 82.
text: Billie doesn’t object. Rosie joins them as they approach the
text: front of the line.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You getting a late start, too?
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Yeah, I got a massage.
text: Billie’s face, jealous. “Good for you.” They are next up.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Em, Finn, you go together. But,
dialog: wait at the top, okay?
text: The Twins shift into position and the lift takes them up. As
text: Billie passes the Ski Lift Operator, he raps his knuckles on
text: Billie’s head.
speaker_heading: LIFT OPERATIVE
dialog: Helme sind fur Kinder!
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Hallo...!
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Oh, he’s just checking that it’s

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Ein wenig Respekt bitte!
text: The Lift Operator switches to Italian:
speaker_heading: LIFT OPERATIVE
dialog: li Vaffanculo, non capiscono.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: (Italian)
dialog: Si lavora in fatto di ospitalita,
dialog: essere ospitali, cazzo!
text: Then, she switches to Spanish:
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Folla a tu madre y tu existencia!
text: The Lift Operator does not know Spanish. That was her hope.
text: Billie is surprised by Rosie’s multi-lingual assertiveness.
text: They shift into position, as...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: What was all that?
dialog: JA 1st 83.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Basically, I told him he was a
dialog: piece of shit in three languages.
dialog: Rosie can’t leave it at that. One more scolding:
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (in Dutch)
dialog: Je bent een imbeciel!
dialog: (winking at Billie)
dialog: Four.
text: The lift scoops them up, as we...
scene_heading: EXT. LIFT CHAIR - DAY
text: Billie and Rosie ride up.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: So, how are you doing today?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Better. I guess? I don’t know. I’m *
dialog: sorry that you were there for all
dialog: of that the other night. *
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Why are you apologizing?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I shouldn’t have involved the kids.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Okay. But, you have nothing to
dialog: apologize about. What he did was *
dialog: fucked up.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Well, I shouldn’t have attacked *
dialog: him. His dad died eight months *
dialog: ago...
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Yeah, well, people die. It sucks.
dialog: It happens. But, that doesn’t
dialog: excuse why he ran away like a
dialog: fucking pussy.
text: Billie lets that sink. Someone is validating her.
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t owe him anything. You
dialog: have a right to be angry.
dialog: JA 1st 84.
text: Emotion swells up for Billie. All the shock. All the
text: confusion. She can’t hold it in anymore. Rosie lets her have *
text: the moment. Eventually, Billie collects herself.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: «.. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: I‘1l tell you this much, if Zach
dialog: ever did that to me, I'd kick him
dialog: in the nuts and he’d never see me
text: again. It’s black and white.
text: Billie glances ahead. This part she may not agree with: “Is *
dialog: it black and white?” *
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Outside at a table, Zach and Peter are drinking lagers. Pete
text: is still feeling his head.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do I seem okay?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah. I think. *
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Should you run through the *
dialog: concussion protocol things? *
text: He points to his phone.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Uh-uh, I think you’re fine. *
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I haven't been repeating myself, *
dialog: have I?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don’t know? Like, you asked if *
dialog: you seemed okay a few times?
text: A BAR WOMAN, who might be a bit tipsy, approaches. She *

speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: Hi?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi.
dialog: JA 1st 85.
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: Hi, yeah. My friend just wanted to

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. Oh, okay?
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: Yeah, she thinks... She likes the
dialog: way you carry yourself.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, well that’s kind. Which

text: He looks over to a group of YOUNG WOMEN in their twenties,
dialog: early thirties.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s nice.
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: She thinks you’re the best groomed
dialog: man in this bar.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, thank you.
text: She retreats.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Nice!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh man. That’s embarrassing!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you wanna...? Should we send
dialog: them a drink? Or you want to [go
dialog: over]... ?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Oh, um, I don’t...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. Sure.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean, it just doesn’t happen to
dialog: me all the time. Not like you.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Oh, well. You know!
dialog: *
dialog: JA 1st 86.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah. Come on.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Well, me and Rosie... It’s been
dialog: pretty steady for a while, now!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh sure. But, still. It’s fun to
dialog: flirt, right?
text: Pete thinks about that. “Good times.”
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. I was good at that.
text: The Bar Woman returns.
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: It wasn’t you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: ... What’s that?
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: It wasn’t you. She didn’t like the
dialog: way you carried yourself. It was
dialog: him.
text: She points behind them to a GOOD-LOOKING BAR GUY.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. Cool.
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: Uh-huh. Sorry.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (trying to flirt)
dialog: So, what’s your name?
speaker_heading: BAR WOMAN
dialog: Bye.

dialog: Looking Guy.

dialog: JA 1st 87.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: He is. He is a catch.
dialog: (shouts over)
dialog: You're a catch my friend!

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I can see a resemblance...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s okay, man. I’m not... Yeah.
dialog: All good. So much so.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: An active party scene, already. People have moved straight
text: from the slopes into the bars.
text: Pete and Zach, a bit drunk, are in line for a “Club. " But,
text: as of now, they are just waiting outside an “elevator.”
dialog: [NOTE: Most clubs in the village are below ground. ]
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This place is the Ibiza of the

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Who says that?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I say that!
text: Zach and Pete “high five.” Eww. As they step onto the
dialog: elevator, we...
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The elevator door opens and our senses are in overload with
text: loud euro pop. It’s quite a scene.
text: LATER - Pete is on the packed dance floor, uninhibited and
text: quite drunk. Zach approaches with two more steins of lager.
text: Pete drinks down some more beer, noticing the...
text: GOOD-LOOKING GUY from the top of the mountain. Pete stumbles
text: over. He smiles at him. Then, out of nowhere he makes a
text: lunge. It’s a half hug, half wrestle. The weight of Pete
text: sends them to the floor.
dialog: JA 1st 88.
text: The Guy gets up and actually tries to help Pete off the
text: floor. But, Pete swats his hand away. It’s hard for the Guy, *
text: or us, to understand what’s going on in Pete’s head. His mood *
dialog: and behavior is erratic and all over of the place. *
text: Zach shuffles Pete out of there, as...
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DUSK
text: The guys stumble along.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Maybe we should get you some
dialog: coffee? Pizza?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nope. No. I need to stay hungry.
dialog: For dinner. With my family.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Some food might be smart...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I love my family.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I know. *
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Billie and I didn’t even do it for *
dialog: the longest time. Kids. But, then
dialog: we said if science says we're
dialog: parents, then we’ll be parents.
dialog: That’s awesome. If not, that’s
dialog: okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And, science made us parents.
text: It’s hard to tell where he stands with that.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I just... You lose a parent and the
text: ticking gets louder. Time is...
dialog: Want to know how old you are? Look
dialog: at your kids. Every day they
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah. We get older.
text: Pete grabs for the last tangible excuse in his mind?
dialog: JA 1st 89.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But, you can’t forget about you. It
dialog: happens. You think about yourself.
dialog: That’s all I did. That’s all that
dialog: was... I didn’t mean...
text: Pete stops. “To run away?” Was that what he was going to say?
text: Pete clams up, shaking off whatever he was thinking.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I think coffee might be a good
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know that’s what I said.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Billie and the kids are already at the table, waiting.
scene_heading: I/E. HOTEL CORRIDOR/SUITE - SAME TIME
text: Peter walks down the hotel corridor towards his room with a
text: cup of coffee. Far from sober. At the suite door, Pete
text: breathes. Steadies himself. He opens the door. It’s empty.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi? Hello? People?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER
text: Billie and the Twins are now eating.
text: ON PETE with them at the table, showered and in his regular
text: clothes. Pete flashes a smile at his family trying to look as
text: sober as possible. He drops his knife. CLANK!
text: He regains himself and tries to cut a crostini in two with a
text: knife and fork. It crumbles and he tries to gather it up with
text: his finger tips as he imagines a sober man might. He pops it
text: into his mouth.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Mmm! Yum.
dialog: (he looks at Billie)
dialog: Yours?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I’m not that hungry.
dialog: JA 1st 90.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, did you eat? I didn’t eat. To
dialog: stay hungry. So, I’m hungry.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yeah I ate. We ate a little.
text: Peter sees an opportunity to be magnanimous, an example to
dialog: Billie and the world.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, okay. I don’t mind.
text: That appears to be it for the dinner chat. Back to silence.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Peter and Billie walk behind the Twins, who rush ahead with
text: the key card. Peter has sobered up some, but his reactions
text: are still a bit off. Billie walks ahead of him. The Twins
text: head into the room.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Billie?
text: Billie stops outside the door.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want to say I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You don’t need to do this now.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I want to.
dialog: (exhales )
dialog: What happened is what you said
dialog: happened. I ran. And, I don’t know
dialog: how to make sense of that. I was
dialog: just afraid to... If I said it out
dialog: loud, then it’s true. And then,
dialog: what? That’s who I am? I’m this
dialog: selfish, terrible person capable
dialog: of...
text: Emotion starts to bubble up...
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Which is, I guess, what I am. A
dialog: coward. But, it doesn’t mean that I
dialog: don’t love you. And, that I don’t
dialog: love the kids. I don’t know...
speaker_heading: JA 1st gl.
text: Tears come.

dialog: make this better for you and the
dialog: boys. Or, for me. And, I still
dialog: don’t. I can’t stop an avalanche,
dialog: Billie.
text: His cry grows, odd and all-encompassing. His body shakes.
text: Billie regards this, somewhat cooly. After a beat:
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: This is what you say four days ago.
dialog: Instead, you made me feel like an
dialog: idiot. Like it was my fault. I
dialog: didn’t ask you to stop an
dialog: avalanche, Pete. I just want you to

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING
text: QUICK FLASHES OF THE STATE OF THE ROOM:
text: - Multiple pairs of shriveled-up gloves on the radiator.
text: - BATHROOM. Almost-dry socks draped along the shower curtain
dialog: rod.
text: - Piles of ski clothes. A collective heap.
scene_heading: QUICK FLASHES OF OUR FAMILY:
text: - The Twins in their ROOM, asleep.
text: - Pete in bed, on his side. His eyes, open. Lost in thought.
text: - Billie sits on the couch, drinking coffee. The drapes still
text: closed. She looks over at the...
text: Pile of ski clothes.
scene_heading: QUICK FLASHES OF BILLIE:
text: - Pulling some dry socks down from the curtain rod.
text: - Collecting some dry gloves from the radiator.
dialog: JA 1st 92.
text: - Folding/stacking some of the ski clothes into piles.
scene_heading: QUICK FLASHES OF PETE:
text: - He stares at the alarm, waiting for 6:59 to become 7:00. It
text: does. And, as if a game show buzzer, he turns it off before
text: it even barely makes a sound.
text: - Pete opens the curtains. A wall of snow blankets most of
text: the window. Clearly, there was a huge dump last night.
text: Despite his low energy, Pete’s eyes can’t help but go wide.
text: His wet dream of conditions.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE, COMMON AREA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete emerges from the Master. The Twins [still in pajamas]

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Looks like we got hit with a big
text: dump of snow.
text: Pete might be regretting his choice of words and the timing.
text: “We got hit with... snow.” Billie just glances up at Pete.
text: Not an angry glance. Not a forced smile. Just a look that
text: seems to “study her husband.”
text: Pete goes to grab his ski clothes, noticing that Billie
text: folded and stacked the Twins’ stuff. His stuff remains in a
dialog: pile.
scene_heading: INT. SKI-SHOP - DAY
text: CLOSE ON BOOTS, slammed down on a counter.

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Okay, look, maybe you can’t
dialog: understand me. But, the safer bet
dialog: is you're pretending. These boots

speaker_heading: SKI RENTAL KID
dialog: It’s good to be tight.
text: The Kid looks over at Peter. Can you help me here? *
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: He’s not in my body. And, you're
dialog: not in my body. These hurt. I want

dialog: Can't get better than that. *
speaker_heading: PETE *
dialog: Oh yeah, great way to end our *
dialog: family vacation, for sure. *
text: Billie can’t help but offer up “side eye” to Peter. Really? *
text: Now, he calls it a “family vacation?" The family scoots into *
dialog: place for their chair, as... *
speaker_heading: PETER *

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Yeah!

dialog: Sound good? The Beast?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (aside back)
dialog: Sure. Unless, I decide to go to

speaker_heading: PETER

scene_heading: EXT. LIFT - DAY
text: The family ascends. No one is speaking. After a beat:
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: I hate skiing.
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: No, he doesn’t.
speaker_heading: BILLIE EMERSON
dialog: Finn,... (stealing mom’s line)
dialog: You're not in my body.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It’s cold and dumb. And, you're
dialog: always wet and it hurts when you
dialog: fall and it takes forever if you
dialog: have to go to the bathroom. And,
dialog: people are stupid. They don’t look
dialog: where they’re going. So, you’re
dialog: always scared you're going to die.
dialog: What’s fun about that?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And, I have to go to the bathroom.
text: Smartly, no one protests or chimes in. Billie just puts her

speaker_heading: + HH HHH HH

dialog: JA 1st 95.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
dialog: We're back where the photo was taken in the beginning. The
text: family stands at the edge of The Beast, staring down the
text: steep incline. FEARLESS SKIERS swish right past them.
text: For some reason, no one is initiating a dissent. Not even
dialog: Pete. Em’s words still haunting?
text: Suddenly, BANG! BANG! BANG! From a far distance, an avalanche
text: is being set off. Despite the faintness, the whole family -
text: even Pete - flinch. Finn grabs his dad. Is he holding on for
dialog: comfort or is he afraid his dad will flee again?
text: A moment of clarity for Pete. A decision.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know what I’m thinking I might
dialog: need. Some hot cocoa. Maybe, we
dialog: wait this out? Warm up? I’m not
dialog: sure I’m feeling this.
text: The boys nod. Billie glances at Pete. A hint of smile. It’s
text: about time. They start for the lift, but...
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Billie)
dialog: You should take the run. If you
dialog: want. We'll wait for you at the

text: BACK TO SCENE, as she looks down at the slope ahead of her:
text: The way back to her family. Then, she glances behind her:
dialog: Switzerland. As she ponders, we...
scene_heading: EXT. BASE OF MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: Peter and the boys wait at the base of the run, looking out
text: for Billie. An “avalanche” of skiers descend. But, no sign of
dialog: Billie. Long beat until,...
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: (a bit worried)
dialog: -.. Where is she?
dialog: *
dialog: JA 1st 96.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s okay. Your mom’s better than
dialog: all of us.
text: They scroll the area, but still no Billie. After another
text: beat,... A faint “Pete!” emanates from somewhere distant.
text: Peter listens intently until it’s clear... “Pete! Pete!”
text: Billie is calling out from up high. Without hesitation, Pete
text: pops off his skis.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay right here...
speaker_heading: EMERSON/FINN
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Everything's fine. Stay right here.
text: Pete runs up the slope, disappearing into the crowd of
text: skiers. We stay with Em and Finn, waiting. Long beat plays
dialog: out. Finally,...
text: Through the crowd, we see Peter appear, carrying Billie in
text: his arms. He sets her down.
speaker_heading: EMERSON/FINN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I am now.
text: She shares a glance with Pete. An understanding of what this
dialog: was: Letting their sons see their dad as a “hero for a
text: moment,” instead of “the coward they had witnessed.” Peter
text: seems grateful. Then,...
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (very casual)
dialog: I should get my skis.
text: With that, she just walks back up. But, not before...
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering to Pete)
dialog: By the way, knee deep powder. Best
dialog: run of my life. And, you're not
dialog: going back up there.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE/HALL CORRIDOR - DAY - LATER
text: The family is preparing to leave. All the roller suitcases
text: are packed and stationed by the door. Pete opens the door to
text: the room. The Twins chase one another out.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hold up. You guys are more than
dialog: capable of taking your own bags.
text: The Twins return, grabbing their suitcases and head back out.
text: As Billie passes by Pete in the doorway, he stops her.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll give you more reasons not go
dialog: to Switzerland.
text: A promise to be there. Shared smiles. Two people committing
text: to the story they want to be a part of. They kiss.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I hope you do. Because, I will kick
dialog: you in the nuts.
text: Pete seems confused, trying to decipher her words, but goes

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Friend! This is of course! What the
dialog: fuck good am I if I’m not that?!
text: Charlotte laughs and hugs them, whether they want a hug or
text: not. “Good-byes” all around. Billie and Pete start to peel
dialog: off...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to Billie, hushed)
dialog: Well, I tried...
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Yep. Still don’t know who the fuck
dialog: she is?
text: Charlotte did not hear that, but she reaches out and lightly
text: grabs Billie’s arm. Stopping her. Pete heads over to the
dialog: Twins, as...
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: So,... Your “lesson” good, yes?
text: Billie considers her answer.
text: BILLIE’S POV of Pete rough-housing with the Twins. A man
text: attentive. At this moment, a dad.
text: BACK TO SCENE. Billie, warmed by the image.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: This story works for me.
text: Charlotte beams, approving. As Billie walks away, Charlotte
text: hones in on a group of YOUNG MALE SKIERS, passing by.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: My friends! I’m sorry I was not
dialog: here to meet you earlier! But, you
dialog: must have everything. And, you will

speaker_heading: ZACH

speaker_heading: ROSIE

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (smirks, shrugs)
dialog: Hey. Live your best life, right?
speaker_heading: PETE BILLIE
dialog: You know it. Oh, yeah.
text: Zach and Rosie head onto the shuttle. Pete and Billie’s

text: BACK TO SCENE, as Pete and Billie glance at one another. A
text: sly smile comes to Billie’s face. Pete reciprocates. A mutual
dialog: decision.
text: Pete lays on the gas, booking it to beat the Bus to the

text: smoothly navigates and dodges the Bus, successfully.
dialog: The whole family cheers the success!
speaker_heading: BILLIE EMERSON/FINN
dialog: Nice. Awesome, Dad!/So cool!
text: A shared thrill. We watch as, slowly, this feeling dissipates
