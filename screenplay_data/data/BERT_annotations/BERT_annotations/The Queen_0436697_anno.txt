speaker_heading: MAID

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He's a hard one to read, isn't he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANVRIN
dialog: Yes. On the one hand his background is
dialog: quite establishment. Father a
dialog: Conservative. A public school
dialog: education at Fettes, where he was
text: tutored by the same man as the Prince
dialog: of Wales.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, we'll try not to hold that

text: On the other, his manifesto promises

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do
dialog: you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANVRIN
dialog: I wouldn't put it past him. He's
dialog: married to a woman with known anti-
dialog: Monarchist sympathies - you may
dialog: remember her curtsey the first time
dialog: you met. It could best be described as
dialog: `shallow'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't measure the depth of a
dialog: curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my
dialog: sister.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANVRIN
dialog: And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary
dialog: who said he was expecting the

dialog: 
text: The EQUERRY reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. Without
text: waiting for a reply, he enters..
dialog: 
text: CHERIE is left in the corridor. Alone. She stares at a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister,
dialog: Mr Blair. I'd like to think there
dialog: weren't too many surprises left. My
dialog: first was Winston Churchill. He sat in

dialog: and was kind enough to give a shy
speaker_heading: T
dialog: young girl like me quite an education.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I can imagine.

dialog: ith time, one has hopefully added

text: TONY winces. Wishes the ground would swallow him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr Blair, the people have elected you
dialog: to be their leader. And so the duty

dialog: you to become Prime Minister, and form

dialog: 
text: TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Generally, this is where you say
dialog: `yes.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: `Yes'.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (cont'd)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERIE
dialog: "Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't
dialog: mean a word of this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's not the point. What she's doing

dialog: I'm referring to your visit to India

speaker_heading: TONY (cont'd)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't think I shall ever understand

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The circumstances were exceptional,
dialog: Ma'am. And in the end, you showed
dialog: great personal strength, courage, and
dialog: humility. E
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: ou're confusing humility with
dialog: humiliation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's not true.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I still believe History will show it
dialog: was a good week for you.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And an even better one for you, Mr
dialog: Blair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But there are fifty-two weeks in a
dialog: year, Ma'am. And two and a half
dialog: thousand in a half century.
dialog: 
text: The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: And when people come to assess your

dialog: pause..

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: But let's also not forget the more
dialog: pragmatic reason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Which is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That without me there to distract
dialog: everyone, it'd suddenly become
dialog: embarrassingly clear how much
dialog: unchecked power the British Prime
dialog: Minister actually has.
dialog: 
text: TONY looks up..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If fifty years of doing MY job has
dialog: taught me anything, it is that the
dialog: people doing YOURS generally prefer me
dialog: with all my faults to some kind of
dialog: meddling President..
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Just look at the French.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (cont'd)
dialog: I do love this time of day. Shall we
dialog: walk while there's still some sunshine
dialog: left? I do hope you're a walker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Good. The clocks go back next week,
dialog: then it'll be dark by five.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (cont'd)

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: As a matter of fact, it's how I think
dialog: best. On my feet. I've never been one
dialog: for sitting around endlessly. A good
dialog: walk and fresh air sorts everything
dialog: out..
dialog: 
text: Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been
text: holding something back..

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: One in four, you said? Wanted to get
dialog: rid of me? T
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: For about half an hour. But then you
dialog: came down to London and all that went
dialog: away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I've never been hated like that
dialog: before.

dialog: 
text: They begin walking again..

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Ever since Diana people want glamour
dialog: and tears..the grand performance..and
dialog: I'm not very good at that. I prefer to
dialog: keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly
dialog: I believed that's what people wanted
dialog: from their Queen. Not to make a fuss
dialog: nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve,
dialog: duty first... self second.
dialog: 
text: The QUEEN stops..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It's how I was brought up. It's all
dialog: I've ever known

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: One forgets. You were so young when
dialog: you became Queen.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
