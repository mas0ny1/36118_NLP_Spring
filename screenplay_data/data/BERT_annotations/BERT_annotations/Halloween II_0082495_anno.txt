dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: If that wasn't Michael Myers burning in that car there are going to be a lot of other kids dead tonight.
dialog: COP
dialog: He's dead. I saw him.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: I want to believe you. But I can't stop him until I'm certain he's dead.
dialog: COP
dialog: You talk about him like he's some sort of animal.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: He was my patient for fifteen years. He became an obsession with me until I realized that there wasn't neither consciance nor reason that he was even remotely human. An hour ago I fired six bullets into him and he just walked away. I am talking about the real possibility that he is still out there! Where'd they take the body.
dialog: COP
dialog: The Courier's office.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Get Dennis to meet me there in half an hour.

dialog: NURSE
dialog: (to CARA)
dialog: You were late again tonight.
dialog: CARA
dialog: Just fifteen minutes.
dialog: NURSE
dialog: That could be the difference between life and death for one of those kids.

dialog: You're right. I'm sorry.
dialog: NURSE

dialog: NURSE
dialog: Good. We've been trying to get a hold of your parents. Dr. Misaar said that they were at the same party that he was but they're not there now and they're not home. Do you have any idea of where else they might be?
dialog: LAURIE
dialog: No.
dialog: NURSE
dialog: Well we'll just keep trying.

text: NURSE exits and closes the door. LAURIE picks up the phone. She puts it down. She hears a noise from the other side of the room.
dialog: Meanwhile, MR. GARETTS and JANET are in the hall.
dialog: MR. GARETTS
dialog: I'm going to go check the lines. You wait here I'll call you.(hands her radio)
dialog: JANET
dialog: I gotta get back on the floor!
dialog: MR. GARETTS
dialog: It'll take me five minutes.
dialog: JANET
dialog: But I don't even know how to use this thing!
text: MR. GARETTS exits. He flashes a flashlight on the power lines. He walks over and looks in a trashcan. He sees blood in it, and a cat jumps out at him suddenly knocking him over. He gets up and walks inside the power building. He slides the door open. He goes into another room.
dialog: MR. GARETTS
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: I think someone broke into this storm room.
dialog: ON the other side we see JANET holding a RADIO and we hear MR. GARETTS voice which is so muffled you can't understand him.
dialog: JANET
dialog: Mr. Garret! I can't hear you.
dialog: ON THE OTHER SIDE
dialog: MR. GARET
dialog: Drive down to the sherif's station right away.
dialog: JANET messes with nobs on the radio.
dialog: JANET
dialog: Mr. Garet, how do you work this thing?
dialog: GARET
dialog: Janet!
text: We hear something fall in the next room. GARET opens a closet and boxes fall on top of him. He flashes his light around. He sees another closet, and removes the lock from it. He opens it and finds nothing. He closes it on the right side. And when he closees it on the left we see MICHAEL. MICHAEL slams a hammer down on his face.
dialog: JANET
dialog: Mr. Garet! Mr. Garet I've got to get back on the floor. Hello?
dialog: JANET leaves.
dialog: THE MORGUE-A sheet is moved off of the burned up trick-or-treaters body. LOOMIS and the COP examine it.
dialog: MAN
dialog: It's difficult. Even the gums are charred but look here.See here? No fillings. Young. maybe seventeen, eighteen.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Michael Myers is 21.
dialog: MAN
dialog: Positive ID means we can't get to his dental records.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: It'll take hours!
dialog: MAN
dialog: There's no other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: We haven't got hours. Listen to me we've got to assume that Michael Myers is still alive.
dialog: BRACKET walks in.
dialog: COP
dialog: Everybody goes back out.
dialog: BRACKET
dialog: But we just closed it up.
dialog: COP
dialog: I want a sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass. I want every street, every house, every backyard.

dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Hightens my sense of security.
dialog: COP smiles.
dialog: They get out of the car and walk to the Myers House.
dialog: COP
dialog: Stop it! Knock it off.
dialog: COP
dialog: (to LOOMIS)
dialog: You know. Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight. The only gunshot you heard was to start off the race at the high school track.

dialog: Well this night in '63 Michael Myers did murder his sister in that bedroom upstairs with a butcher's knife.
dialog: COP
dialog: I remember.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: On halloween.
dialog: COP
dialog: I was sixteen years old.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: His anniversary was tonight. He came back.
dialog: COP
dialog: After fifteen years.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Micheal Myers was an extraordinary patient. There was a force inside him biding his time. He came acustomed to the inability and silence. In many ways he was the ideal patient he never talked he never cried he never moved. He just waited. The staff was unprepared they didn't know what he was.
dialog: COP
dialog: Did you know?
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Yea I knew.
dialog: Two boys approach the COP.
dialog: BOY #1
dialog: Mr. Hank?
dialog: COP
dialog: What is it Greg?
dialog: BOY #1
dialog: I'm worried about Ben Tramer he's not home yet.
dialog: BOY #2
dialog: And he left the party at ten.
dialog: COP
dialog: It's only a little after eleven boys.
dialog: BOY #1
dialog: He was real drunk.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: How old is he?
dialog: BOY #1
dialog: Seventeen. And he had this stupid mask on.
dialog: COP
dialog: Alright boys.
dialog: THE BOYS LEAVE.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Seventeen. Wearing a mask. We should check his dental record.
dialog: BRACKET
dialog: There's a break in at the elementary school they're pretty sure that it's him.
dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: Come on.
dialog: The cops dash to their car.
text: HOSPITAL-CARA is in the hall-she hears the patient bell and it alarms her. She laughs and walks into a room with a stethoscope. She touches a patient and he pulls her on top of him. The patient is BUDD. She screams and he laughs.
dialog: BUDD

dialog: CARA
dialog: I wish I had. I also could have used these on you (pulls out scissors). What an a**hole.

dialog: BUDD
dialog: Why is everybody all worded out tonight. All this Michael Myers crap. I just- I just want-
dialog: BUDD and CARA kiss.

dialog: I suppose if we left the door open we could hear if someone was coming or if the kids started to cry. I got to check it out first.
dialog: BUDD
dialog: Fifteen minutes?
dialog: CARA
dialog: IF everything's ok.
dialog: BUDD
dialog: You're wasting time.

dialog: It's hot.
dialog: CARA and BUDD kiss.
text: In the other room MICHAEL turns up the heat all the way up. We see a sign that reads: HYDROTHERAPY POOL WATER TEMPERATURE NOT TO EXCEED 100 DEGREES F.
dialog: In the whirlpool BUDD and CARA stop kissing.
dialog: CARA
dialog: Who am I kidding. It's too hot in hear now, Budd. Why don't you go check.
dialog: BUDD
dialog: It's cold out there.
dialog: CARA
dialog: It can get cold in here.
dialog: BUDD
dialog: Gotcha.
text: BUDD gets out of the whirlpool and wraps a towel around his waist. He goes into the thermo room and starts to change the temperature.MICHAEL comes from behind him and strangels him. MICHAEL then goes to CARA and drown her by repeatedly forcing her head into the whirlpool.

dialog: LOOMIS
dialog: In order to please the gods, the druid priests held fire rituals. Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane, animals were burned alive. By observing the way they died the druids believed they could see elements of the future. 2000 years we've come no closer. Samhaid is not spirits, it's not goblins,ghosts or witches. It's the unconscious mind. We're all afraid of the darkness inside ourselves.

dialog: WOMAN #2
dialog: It isn't fair. They should have allowed you to examine everything. That girl, that Strode girl, that's Michael Myer's sister. She was born 2 years before he was commited. Two years after her parents died and she was adopted by the Strodes. They requested that the records be sealed to protect the family.
