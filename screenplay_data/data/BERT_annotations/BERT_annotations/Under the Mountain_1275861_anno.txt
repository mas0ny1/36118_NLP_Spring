scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY 1A
text: SUPER TITLES as we move across a black rocky landscape.
text: Canyons and crevices, pitted and gnarled — alien.
text: Panning up off the rocks — not an alien world, but the
text: jagged volcanic rocks of Auckland’s North Shore - to
text: reveal RANGITOTO ISLAND on the other side of the water.
text: Dark and sinister.
scene_heading: EXT. RANGITOTO BEACH - DAY 2
text: The prow of a small boat bumps against jagged black
text: rocks. Tight shots as two young men help one another out
text: of the boat onto the rocks, hand clasping hand.
text: Struggling to balance on jagged volcanic rock, they
text: steady each other, at last finding their footing: JOHAN
text: and LENART — IDENTICAL TWINS with COPPER HAIR, dressed in
dialog: coarse 19th century clothing.
text: Ahead of them, a man stands with his back to us, looking
text: up at the dark cone of Rangitoto. He turns to them — this
text: is MR JONES, grey, weathered, ageless.
speaker_heading: MR JONES
dialog: When we get to the crater, use your twin-
dialog: ness. Throw the stones as one.
speaker_heading: JOHAN
dialog: I think we can.
speaker_heading: MR JONES
dialog: You have to believe it.
text: Mr Jones looks to Lenart, less certain than his brother.
speaker_heading: LENART
dialog: But what if they come?
speaker_heading: MR JONES
dialog: They’re dormant. We’1ll take them by
dialog: surprise.
text: The three of them head for the tree line.
text: UNDER THE MOUNTAIN © 2008 Redhead Films 2.
scene_heading: EXT. RANGITOTO BUSH — DAY
text: Figures push through the thick island scrub — Johan and
text: Lenart lead, followed by Mr Jones. Lenart strides ahead,
text: pushing through the undergrowth.
speaker_heading: MR JONES
dialog: Stay together!
text: Noises rattle through the trees around them.
text: The twins spin, pulling two round STONES from their
text: pockets and brandishing them like weapons. A warm, fiery
text: glow spills from between their fingers.
text: Shapes dart in the trees, all around them. A chorus of
text: horrible, otherworldly BARKS rings out.
text: A DARK SHAPE seems to lash out of the shadows — Johan
text: falls — his stone skitters across the ground —
speaker_heading: LENART
dialog: Johan!
text: Johan looks up at his brother, stricken —
text: He reaches for his fallen stone —
text: But is YANKED suddenly into the shadows with a SHRIEK!
text: Lenart looks to Mr Jones desperately —
speaker_heading: LENART (CONT’D)
dialog: Help us, Mr Jones!
text: Mr Jones stumbles back, deciding what he must do —
text: He looks down to see Johan’s stone lying at his feet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY TOWN - DAY
text: Dense bush rolls over rugged hills. Black clouds boil in
dialog: the sky.
text: A straight road leads out of a small COUNTRY VILLAGE
text: through fenced paddocks. A SCHOOLBAG tumbles over a
dialog: fence.
text: A teenage girl wearing a schoolbag, RACHEL, climbs the
text: fence and looks back. She grins, holds out a hand.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Need help?
text: A teen boy, THEO, appears and clambers up the fence.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: No.
text: As he gets to the top, his foot slips on the wire.
text: Instinctively, he throws out a hand, Rachel meets it with
text: her own, steadying him on the fence.
text: The pair are about 14 and have the same COPPER HAIR and
text: green eyes: they’re unmistakably TWINS.
text: They both jump down. Rachel grabs Theo’s bag and runs
text: off, Theo in pursuit. They run together up the road —
text: matched for speed, Rachel just ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GATE - DAY
text: At a wide gate they cross the road. Rachel swings the bag
text: around, flinging it under a hedge. She starts down the
text: long driveway as Theo runs for his bag.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You are so gonna die for that!
text: She rounds a curve in the drive and stops in her tracks —

text: — a police car. Rachel, where’s mum’s car —
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 9
text: Theo’s voice rings in Rachel’s head. Their thoughts have
text: become one, a fluid sharing of words and feelings:
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: — what if there's been —
speaker_heading: THEO (V.O.)
dialog: — there’s been an accident —
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GATE - DAY 10

speaker_heading: THEO (V.O.)
dialog: — there’s nothing to be scared of —
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 11
text: Rachel runs to the house.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: — I’m scared, Theo!
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GATE - DAY 12
text: Theo drops his bag and runs up the drive.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 13
text: Rachel pulls open the screen door of the farmhouse and
text: creeps down the long dark tunnel of the hall.
text: Ahead, through the door, we find a POLICEMAN standing
text: with his hat in his hands. Rachel pushes the door open
text: further to reveal the twins’ FATHER, sitting at the
text: table, face slack with shock.

text: Rachel trembles with shock —
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 14
text: Theo stops in his tracks, trembling as Rachel is —
text: FEELING WHAT SHE'S FEELING.
text: Theo approaches the house with trepidation. He climbs the
text: porch, pulls open the door.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE/VARIOUS - DAY 15
text: Theo heads down the hallway, fearful ...
text: IN THE KITCHEN, Rachel looks up — face wracked with
dialog: grief.
text: In the hall, Theo reels back against the wall, feeling
text: her pain, frozen —
text: IN THE KITCHEN, Rachel looks towards the door that

speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: Theo?
text: IN THE HALLWAY, Theo shakes his head, unable to bear it.
text: We hear her voice in his mind again, desperate.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: Theo? I need you.
text: Something seems to snap. Theo scrambles back up the hall,
text: slams through the screen door and stumbles out onto the
dialog: lawn.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: Theo, I —
text: The screen door BANGS behind him — her voice cutting off

text: PULL FOCUS to the mesh, shutting out everything beyond.

text: A dark hole in the ground: a GRAVE. Gathered around it
text: are two dozen MOURNERS in dark clothing and an Anglican
text: Reverend, REVEREND BLATTY.
speaker_heading: REVEREND BLATTY
dialog: I am the resurrection and the life, saith
dialog: the Lord; he that believeth in me, though
dialog: he were dead, yet shall he live; and
dialog: whosoever liveth and believeth in me
dialog: shall never die.
text: Standing on either side of the grave is Theo and Rachel,
text: the hole in the ground a dark chasm between them. Theo
text: looks to the head of the grave where their father kneels
text: over the edge of the hole, sobbing.
text: Rachel steps forward, scattering a handful of rose petals
text: into the grave.
text: Theo clutches a handful of petals, his expression
text: impassive.
text: Rachel searches Theo’s face, looking for some way in.
text: Tears roll down her cheeks. He meets her eyes for a
text: moment, then looks away. His petals are clenched in his
text: fist, knuckles white.
text: We CUT WIDE: a cluster of dark figures small in the

scene_heading: EXT. BRITOMART STATION - DAY 20

dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Sorry.
text: A CELL PHONE RINGS.

speaker_heading: THEO

dialog: the shore.
text: His eyes fall on one. He steps forward to see better.
text: Across an inlet is a two-story wooden house, its

text: A figure picks its way down from his house towards the

text: Rachel ducks behind the reeds, watching.
scene_heading: EXT. WILBERFORCE HOUSE - DAY 42
text: Under the shadow of the house, the man moves as if slowed

text: face seems roughly hewn from stone, eyes black holes
text: under heavy brows.
text: MR WILBERFORCE reaches into the dead tree. He takes
text: something from its branches, opens his hand to reveal —
text: Rachel's hair tie. Mr Wilberforce slowly raises his hand
text: to his face ... and seems to SNIFF at the hair.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY 43

text: A sign reads MT EDEN SUMMIT.
text: Ricky’s car follows the road up towards Mt Eden. Ricky
text: drives, the twins crammed into the car with him.
text: Craggy trees line the road like a tunnel of gnarled
text: talons, sunlight filtering through in eerie shafts.
text: Rachel’s eyes widen —
text: A DARK FIGURE can be glimpsed between the trunks, still
text: as a statue, as if watching the car.

dialog: trees.
scene_heading: EXT. MT EDEN CRATER/VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY 48

dialog: is Rangitoto.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (pointing)

scene_heading: EXT. MT EDEN CRATER RIM — DAY 51
text: Theo looks up to the crest of the hill above him. A
text: figure sits, silhouetted on the edge, facing Rangitoto.
dialog: Mr Jones is barely older than when we last saw him, but
text: he seems a shadow of his former self: beaten, the fire
text: has died in his eyes. He stares across at the black
text: island opposite.
text: A warm glow of FIRELIGHT dances on his face, emanating
text: from his hands.
text: Theo approaches the old man from behind. A flicker of
text: FLAME in his hands. Theo peers closer, intrigued.
text: As Theo steps up Jones closes his hands, the fire
text: disappears. He stuffs whatever made the fire into the
text: pockets of his jacket.
text: He turns to Theo, his eyes blazing with momentary
text: interest. He looks up at Theo’s copper hair.
text: Theo raises a hand to his hair involuntarily. The man
text: seems to stare into him, read him, as if looking for an
dialog: answer from him ...
text: Theo turns and hurries on around the crater. As he goes
text: the light in the old man’s eyes dies — as if he was

dialog: disappointment, it wasn’t to be found with Theo.

text: In the darkness, a sickly SNIFFING sound, like some

text: SHAPES melt out of the darkness — one, three, five, more:

text: rod. Ricky sits behind, wearing a lifejacket and holding

text: A snorkel surfaces from the black water in a puff of

text: A FIGURE, lurking in the trees above the rocks at the

text: Chilled, Rachel swims strongly to the boat and hauls
text: herself on board. She looks back towards the island —
text: there’s no sign of the Drone now —
text: Suddenly, Cliff’s fishing rod SCREAMS as the reel

text: Theo flails — his stone FALLS — its light dims!
text: CRUNCH! Theo arrests his passage on the thin trunk of a
text: bush with one hand. He scrambles for the stone with the
text: other. The tentacle tightens around him ...
text: From around him, more vicious BARKS sound. DARK SHAPES
text: melt out of the darkness to surround him. Barely seen,
text: the Wilberforces have abandoned human form. They writhe
dialog: with predatory power.
text: Theo winces in pain ... as he reaches for the stone ...
dialog: reaches —
text: The Wilberforces close in —
text: Theo’s hand closes around the stone!
text: Theo swings around and — BLAM — sends cords of fire
text: lashing out into the dark. The tentacles around him whip
text: away ... The creatures shriek and bark, tentacles flail.
text: Theo scrambles to his feet. He shoots forth another jet,
text: clearing a path ahead of him and clambers on up the
dialog: mountain.

speaker_heading: MR JONES

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Y’know, maybe those other twins would’ve

speaker_heading: MR JONES
dialog: He’s here.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Theo?
text: Mr Jones shakes his head. Rachel looks up —
text: A dark shape looms in the moonlight: Mr Wilberforce.
text: Mr Jones rises shakily to his feet between them. He lifts
text: his hands. Tiny licks of fire spark at his finger tips.
text: Wilberforce regards the old man with disdain.
text: Mr Jones holds out Rachel’s stone. Fearful, she meets his
text: gaze. He nods:
speaker_heading: MR JONES
dialog: Take it.
text: Wilberforce advances on them, black eyes burning with
dialog: hatred.

dialog: If they have to die, let them die

text: Wilberforce almost smiles.
speaker_heading: MR WILBERFORCE
dialog: I will make sure of it.

text: Rachel screams as the two cosmic forces meet —

text: Wilberforce looks to Rachel.
text: She gasps, backing away — her fist clenched at her chest.
text: With a terrifyingly fast movement his arm lashes out —
text: over the five metres between them — and grabs her throat
text: with a tangle of tentacles.
text: Rachel beats at the tendrils wrapping around her neck
text: with her closed fist as Wilberforce lifts her from the
text: ground by her throat. She gags, fighting for breath ...
text: Theo crests a rise to see the crater in front of him.
text: Mr Wilberforce stands at the far end of the platform. He
text: holds Rachel by her neck — his arm melding horribly with
text: her own flesh. She hangs limply — the awful decay
text: spreading across her body.
text: Theo gasps in horror. He runs to the platform, his stone
text: balled inside his fist. Theo raises his hand.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Put her down.
text: Wilberforce looks up with contempt.
text: Rachel’s eyes GLAZE OVER.
text: The glow of FIRE flickers from Theo’s stone ... then
text: DIES. Theo looks down at the stone, incredulous ... he
text: shakes it ... nothing happens.
text: Mr Wilberforce drops Rachel in a heap, his arm a mass of
text: writhing tendrils. Her eyes are glazed open, her mouth
text: hanging limp.
text: The sight hits Theo like a sledgehammer.
speaker_heading: THEO (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: Mr Wilberforce smiles cruelly at Theo.
text: A huge EARTHQUAKE rocks the mountain. Theo is thrown to
text: the ground. Wilberforce rides the tremor, unperturbed.
text: CRACKS ripple across the crater edge —
text: The viewing platform sags, the planks rippling like piano

text: From the beneath the ground the MASSIVE ROAR of the

dialog: ever before.

text: The Drones SQUEAL and shrink back.

text: Rachel steps up to meet Theo. He holds out his hand. As
