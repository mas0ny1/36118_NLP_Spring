scene_heading: AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY
dialog: Gimme somethin' for the bleedin'
dialog: pain. C'mon, mate, help me.
text: The Mercenary tries to lift himself out of his stretcher.
text: Can't. He's too weak. His skin is yellow and covered
text: with blisters that look like chicken pox.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (checking the
dialog: soldier's temp)
text: He's still over a hundred and
dialog: six. Why can't we bring it down?
text: The black African army physician, DR. RASWANI, looks on,
text: helpless. Suddenly, the Australian emits a sharp cry.
text: His eyes roll back, and he begins convulsing. Before
text: Raswani can even reach into his bag for medecine, the
text: Mercenary is dead.
text: Raswani and his Nurse stare with horror.
text: The DRONE of a CHOPPER grows LOUDER as a Bell Z180 ap-
text: pears over the edge of the forest and kicks up a storm of
text: dust as it lands. Raswani and the Nurse run to meet it.
text: In their eyes, hope.

text: Two space-suited figures emerge from the chopper, their
text: faces hidden by thick green plexiglass shields. The U.S.
text: flag is emblazoned on the side of their helmets, which
text: also display their ranks. The much taller man is a
dialog: lieutenant whom we'll know as McCLINTOCK. Through his
text: visor, we can just make out his pock-marked, angular
text: face. The shorter, pear-shaped man is a CAPTAIN. We
text: can't see his features, only the reflection of horn-
text: rimmed glasses.
speaker_heading: RASWANI
dialog: Have you brought the medicines?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN

speaker_heading: RASWANI
dialog: Thirty deaths yesterday, eighteen

dialog: killing our men faster than enemy

text: The Captain stops at a young AMERICAN MERCENARY'S cot.
text: He's shaking with fever. His skin is mottled and looks
text: like the pulp of an orange. His voice is a whisper:
speaker_heading: AMERICAN MERCENARY
dialog: Take me home, Captain... Get me
dialog: outta this shithole. Please, I
dialog: wanna see my girl.
text: The American Mercenary reaches out with his arms to the
text: Captain, who shrinks back, not wanting to be
dialog: contaminated.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: We'll get you home, soldier.
dialog: First, I need a tissue sample.
text: He pulls from his black bag a long metal syringe and

speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: I can't.
text: McClintock is in the copilot's seat.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: It's either them or us.

text: Then the plane arcs and approaches again.
speaker_heading: OVER RUNWAY
text: littered with the dead, the plane releases a waxy grey
text: cloud. One second. Two seconds. An eerie stillness.
text: The CLOUD EXPLODES in a huge inferno.
text: The plane releases more and more napalm, burning the

text: The CRIES of ANIMALS caught in the fire pierce the night.
text: Flames shoot up trees a hundred feet high.
text: PULL BACK to show the whole forest ablaze. A long beat,
text: then at the very LEFT CORNER OF the FRAME, a MONKEY with
text: a black and white coat (a Colobos monkey) emerges from
text: the fire, looks back at its mate, threatened by the
text: flames. The Colobos jumps up and down, baring its teeth,

scene_heading: ABOVE RAINFOREST
text: Brilliant streams of orange and purple, the last rays of

dialog: Shattered by:
text: Giant TREES CRASHING to the ground. TRACTORS ROAR,

text: living undisturbed for hundreds of years topple to earth,
text: their roots ripped from the soil.
text: REVEAL the army of construction workers clearing a path
dialog: for the new road linking Kinshasa with Bangui. White
text: foremen bellow orders in French at their black workers,

scene_heading: INTERCUT - TWO COLOBOS MONKEYS
dialog: a mother and her daughter, whom we'll know as Betsy.
text: Betsy plays with a fat, round jackfruit, kicking it and
text: rolling it every which way. Her mother watches the
text: construction workers warily.
text: Morazu hums as he pulls a huge tree limb off the road and
text: into a thick patch of brush where he comes face to face
text: with Betsy. Morazu smiles. He takes a long piece of
text: sweetened bread from his pocket and lays it down right in
text: front of the young monkey.
text: Betsy eyes it warily.
speaker_heading: MORAZU
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Take it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A long beat. Betsy takes the bread, examines it careful-
text: ly, finally takes a bite.
text: Morazu grabs her. BETSY struggles, thrashing and SCREAM-
text: ING. Morazu pins her hands behind her back. She spins
text: around and sinks her teeth into his finger.
text: He lets go with a shriek and swears at Betsy, who disap-
text: pears with the bread.
text: STAY WITH Morazu as he returns to his work. He sucks the
text: blood out of the small wound.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOTABA RIVA VALLEY (AUGUST 15)
text: Morazu gets off a bus by a small muddy river and walks
text: slowly toward his village of about fifty mud-thatched
text: huts. Pain in his back makes him wince. We see him UP
text: CLOSE: his eyes are red and his skin is pale. He's
dialog: sweating.
text: He stops at the village well and takes a drink. Other
text: villagers come up to say hello, and Morazu greets them
text: wearily, dipping his cup back in the water for another
text: drink. The villagers drink too.
text: DISCOVER in the background: the tribal medicine man, the
text: "ju-ju man." Streaks and circles of paint cover his

dialog: return.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: RAIN FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A small group of Colobos monkeys including Betsy and her
text: mother run swiftly through the forest. Suddenly, BETSY

dialog: and pain, hanging upside down --
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: SAME - FOLLOWING MORNING

text: arm. CONTINUE PAST the oak rolltop desk.
text: MIKE GILLESPIE, about 40, keeps singing as he reads
text: through a lengthy typed report, making notes in the
dialog: margin.
text: LUCIANO hits a high C. Gillespie reaches for it... and
text: misses badly. DOGS WHINE O.S., probably in closer
text: harmony to Luciano than Gillespie. He's not pleased.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I rescue you from certain death
dialog: and instead of gratitude, you mock
dialog: me.
text: His two WOLFHOUNDS, Olser and Harvey, GROVEL on the floor
text: contritely, each with a worn shoe in his mouth. Behind
text: them we see the rest of Gillespie's living/dining room.
text: His townhouse is spartan; it needs a woman's touch. Un-

speaker_heading: GILLESPIE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: (reaching into his
dialog: pockets)
dialog: Okay! Okay!
text: Without breaking stride, he throws what look like sticks
text: high into the air. The dogs jump and catch the objects in
text: their mouths and race back to Gillipsie.
text: We see they're old stethoscopes with thick rubber tubing.
text: Gillespie lets them fly again. He laughs at their eager-
text: ness and keeps running, sprinting now, trying to prove to
text: himself that he's still young. Suddenly -- a PHONE RINGS.
text: Without breaking stride, he pulls a cellular phone from

scene_heading: INT. BILLY FORD'S OFFICE (FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND)

speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Mike.
text: ROBERTA "ROBBY" KEOUGH, an attractive, intelligent woman
text: in her mid 30's, opens the door a few inches, until the

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (smiles; delighted)
dialog: Hey, guys!
text: But when she looks at Gillespie, she's guarded.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Robby, I know I'm the last guy
dialog: you'd do a favor for, but I've got
dialog: no one else to ask.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: My lawyer said not to talk to you

speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: -- Look, Robby, if I had any other
dialog: choice, I wouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You should've let me have them.
dialog: You can't take care of them.
text: Beat. Robby's torn. The dogs nuzzle against her leg.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I won't be gone long.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You know I'm moving to Atlanta --
dialog: they want me to start in four days.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I'll be back before that.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Four days is four weeks -- to you.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: It wasn't all my fault, Robby.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I know.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: FRONT HALL
text: overflowing with moving boxes, some sealed, others waiting
text: to be packed. Gillespie feels awkward, a stranger in his
dialog: own home.
text: She hands him a prescription pad. He crosses off her

text: while Robby enters...
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Hey, guys, c'mon!
text: They follow her in.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Guess what I got?
text: The DOGS BARK excitedly.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Damn straight!
text: She opens the freezer, grabs a couple of frozen bagels and
text: flips them to the DOGS. They catch the bagels and start
speaker_heading: CHOMPING.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I missed you guys so much.
text: Gillespie hands her the note.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (reading it)
dialog: 'I, Michael Gillespie, agree that
dialog: if I'm not back in exactly four
dialog: days from now, the ownership of my

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: That's stuff from med school...
dialog: Some of it's yours. I don't know

text: He fishes through it, shoving aside old medical books
text: and equipment. He finds an old wood stethoscope with
text: thick rubber tubing. He shoves in into his pocket.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Got a place yet?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
text: An apartment.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: The first thing you'll do is spend
dialog: the whole night unpacking...
dialog: You'll stay up 'til dawn but

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Nothin' in my life has been
dialog: organized since you left, Robby.
text: Beat. She's surprised at his admission. And un-

text: A photo taken during their honeymoon cruise: they're
text: both smiling radiantly as they hold between them a
text: trophy of a dancing couple.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Y'know, this is the only evidence
dialog: on Earth that I was ever graceful.
text: He checks her reaction. There is a hint of a smile.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Take it.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Nah, people might see it... get

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: There's got to be a way to deal

speaker_heading: GILLESPIE

speaker_heading: GILLESPIE

dialog: If the monkey's antibody is
dialog: effective, you could use it as
dialog: a template. Maybe you could

speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Sir, let me --
text: The Black Hawk blasts through the cloud cover and emerges:
dialog: 126.
scene_heading: ABOVE CLOUDS - NIGHT
text: A full moon illuminates the Black Hawk.
text: The Apaches burst through the clouds, too.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK HAWK
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Fire away! Nothing's going to
dialog: survive the crash.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON FORD
text: a long beat. Gillespie's got him.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You've got until midnight, Mike.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: FOREST SURROUNDING TOWN
text: The forest looks dark and primeval in the damp night. The
text: sounds of BIRD CALLS and CRICKETS CHIRPING can be heard in
dialog: the background. This is what a biological meltdown looks
text: like -- nothing at all. Then suddenly a deer drops to
text: its knees, stricken with the Motaba Virus. It struggles
text: to rise, but fails. The deer keels over, barely
dialog: breathing.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: OUTSIDE QUARANTINE PERIMETER - STAGING AREA
text: Large canisters of deadly nerve gas are loaded onto
text: Chinook helicopters. The canisters are clearly marked
text: with the skull-and-crossbones for "poison" and big red
text: "CAUTION!" labels.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: HOSPITAL HELIPORT - BLACK HAWK
dialog: settling down.
dialog: Cut TO:
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL LAB
text: Tubes run from Betsy to a blood separator as Salt works
text: feverishly to separate the antibodies out. As the
text: centrifuge spins faster and faster --
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - GILLESPIE
text: moving rapidly past the patients 'til he gets to:
speaker_heading: IZZY'S ROOM
text: Gillespie's alarmed. Izzy looks terrible, his voice a
dialog: whisper:
speaker_heading: IZZY BERMAN
dialog: Mike... I know you never liked
dialog: my name.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IZZY BERMAN
dialog: My nickname -- Izzy. You never
dialog: really liked it.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I like it all right.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It's okay, 'cause from now on you
dialog: can call me Hurricane.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Good, â€˜cause I'm giving you a new
dialog: name, too. Guess what it is?
text: Izzy's lips go dusky, his breathing only short gasps.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: IZZY
dialog: Guess.
text: Gillespie's voice breaks:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I can't.
text: Izzy's dead. Tears stream down Gillespie's cheeks.
dialog: Cut TO:
speaker_heading: ROBBY'S ROOM
text: She's lying in a bed, her face flush with fever, her skin
text: covered with the rash. She's just barely conscious enough
text: to see him at the door, watching her.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I'm scared. So scared.
text: He comes toward her.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: No false hope. No games.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: You can't give up.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Just be with me.
text: He cups her hands in his gloved hand.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: How's Izzy?
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: He's gonna be okay. You're both
dialog: going to be okay.
text: Her eyes start to close. Gillespie, horrified, shakes
dialog: her:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Stay with me! Fight!
text: She half opens her eyes, her voice a murmur.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Hold... me.
text: He puts his arms around her. Screams into helmet radio:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Salt, where the hell are you?
dialog: Salt, answer me!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: No response. A long beat. Then Gillespie... with more
dialog: tenderness than we've ever seen:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Remember the first time we made
dialog: love? In France. Behind the
dialog: haystack. And we were so worried
dialog: that the little boy on the bicycle
dialog: might see us.
text: She smiles, remembering.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I never felt anything except with
dialog: you, Robby. I was so stupid to
text: let it slip away.
text: She closes her eyes. A cry of anguish:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Salt!
text: Beat. Then Salt appears in the doorway holding a large
text: plastic bag of Betsy's antiserum.
text: Gillespie connects it to Robby's IV and the brown fluid
text: flows into Robby. Gillespie sits down beside her. A
text: long beat. Then he does:
text: Something crazy. He removes the glove from his biosafety
text: suit so that his own bare hand can touch Robby's skin.
text: He touches her face gently.
text: HOLD ON Gillespie, sitting beside his wife's bed, holding
text: her hand.
scene_heading: EXT. QUARANTINE PERIMETER - NIGHT
text: Massive Chinook HELICOPTERS RUMBLE over the staging area,
text: loaded down by the weight of the nerve gas they carry in
text: their bellies and the spray rigs which protrude on both
text: sides of the fuselage.
dialog: Cut TO:
speaker_heading: ROBBY'S ROOM
text: The wall clock declares 11:30. Robby's still comatose.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: I was wrong. The antiserum doesn't
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Salt shares his despair.
text: A long beat. Gillespie hands Salt a paper.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Take this. A signed declaration
dialog: by me that at all times you were
dialog: following my orders -- Now get
dialog: out of here.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: -- No, sir.
dialog: Gillespie's moved:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: You'll be the only person left
dialog: alive who knows the truth --
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: -- But, sir --
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: -- You will leave! You will not
text: disobey an order.
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: (very emotionally)
dialog: Yes, sir.

dialog: D)
dialog: E)
text: In the pouring RAIN, Ford surveys the vast
dialog: machine he's assembled:
text: Soldiers in Chemwar gear pile boxes of body bags
dialog: into trucks.
text: Tractor drivers REV their ENGINES and THUNDER
text: forward to the front line of Chinooks carrying
dialog: the poison gas.
text: Corpsmen check their watches and flash their
text: signal lights.
text: The CHINOOKS THUNDER into the air.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: All the parts move with such precision he should be proud.
text: But he's deeply troubled. He moves:
dialog: 131.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER
text: BUZZING with activity. Dr. Frankle and McClintock stand
text: beside the computerized map of the quarantine area which
text: shows the red perimeter is within a half mile of the
text: Columbia River. The clock reads 23:47. The RADIO
text: CRACKLES with a Louisiana drawl from the Squadron
dialog: Commander of the nerve gas team; we'll know him as
dialog: Sandman One.
speaker_heading: SANDMAN ONE (V.O.)
dialog: General, we got a problem. It's
dialog: rainin' pitchforks up heah. The
dialog: damn rain will dilute it down,
dialog: barely be strong enough to kill a
dialog: cat.
dialog: Frankle's troubled too:
speaker_heading: DR. FRANKLE
dialog: He's right.
text: Ford agonizes.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: To implement the plan and to kill
dialog: only a portion of the population...
dialog: That would cause great harm and
dialog: solve nothing.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Sir!! The nerve gas rapidly loses
dialog: its potency after it's mixed. The
dialog: choppers have got enough to make
dialog: two runs. The virus is a quarter
dialog: mile from the river. You've got
dialog: to go forward.
text: Ford wavers. He grabs the radio mike:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Stand down!! Return your squadron
dialog: to base and stand down until you
dialog: receive further orders.
speaker_heading: SANDMAN ONE (V.O.)
text: Acknowledge. Return to base.
dialog: Ford moves into:
scene_heading: HIS PRIVATE OFFICE
text: a highly secure area, sound-proofed for top-secret commu-
text: nications. McClintock follows him in and slams the door
text: shut. They're completely alone.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: How are you going to stop the
dialog: virus from reaching the river?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Napalm everything from the town
dialog: outward.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: In the rain, the napalm will burn
text: unevenly.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I'll take that chance.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: The virus will escape and we'll
dialog: have to use nuclear weapons to
dialog: sterlize the area.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I gave you my orders.
dialog: Beat. Then quietly:
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Let's say the antiserum did work,
dialog: General. You'd bus out the people,
dialog: move â€˜em somewhere, and treat 'em.
dialog: And with luck some of them would
dialog: live. But it's not going to work
dialog: and in the meantime you don't
dialog: understand what you've done.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I understand perfectly.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: No, you don't. We can't fool the
dialog: media forever. They'll ask
dialog: questions... there'll be
dialog: inquiries... What we did was
dialog: important. What we did was right,
dialog: sir.
text: A long beat. Ford knows he's ruined either way he turns.
text: McClintock's despair is deep and profound.
dialog: Ford feels sorry for him, but:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I'm sorry, but my decision stands.
dialog: If there is any hope of avoiding
dialog: this horrible contingency, I've
dialog: got to...
text: McClintock has slowly drawn his belt out of his trousers.
text: He quickly throws it around Ford's neck, crosses it, and
text: pulls violently on the two ends. Ford kicks and
text: struggles, but he's no match for McClintock's strength.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: I am relieving you of command on
dialog: the basis of cowardice in the face
dialog: of a national emergency.
text: Ford's dead. McClintock lays him out on the floor. Opens
text: the door and screams into the main room.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Help!
text: He starts doing CPR as aides rush in.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Call the medics quickly. The
dialog: General's had a heart attack.
text: One aide grabs the phone and calls the medics. Two more
text: take over CPR. McClintock straightens his shirt and moves
dialog: back into:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: I am assuming command under the
dialog: authority of the Secretary of
dialog: Defense.
text: PAN AROUND the room: Faces of uncertainty and fear.
text: McClintock grabs the radio mike:
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Sandman One, this is General
dialog: McClintock. You are to proceed
dialog: with nerve gas dispersal. You
dialog: will make two runs.
scene_heading: INT. LEAD CHOPPER - ON SANDMAN ONE
text: He shares a look of concern with his co-pilot.
dialog: 134.
text: BACK TO COMMAND CENTER
text: A long beat. Then:
speaker_heading: SANDMAN ONE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND CENTER
text: Salt drives up in a Jeep. Immediately he's surrounded by
text: MP's, and taken into custody.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROBBY'S ROOM
text: Gillespie stares out the window at the rain. Just visible
text: in the distance: The blue and red lights of the
text: approaching Chinooks.
text: He moves back toward Robby, still comatose. The bag of
text: Betsy's antiserum is empty.
text: He reaches for Robby's hand. Her finger twitches. Beat.
text: Her eyes open.
dialog: Cut TO:
speaker_heading: NURSING STATION
text: Gillespie grabs one phone. The line's dead. He grabs
text: another. Dead. He throws it aside. Races to the window.
text: The choppers' lights burn brighter.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE
dialog: Stop!
text: But nobody's listening. He runs down the hall screaming.
dialog: Cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER
speaker_heading: SANDMAN ONE (V.O.)
dialog: General McClintock, we are ready
dialog: to commence phase one.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Proceed.

scene_heading: CLOSE ON YOUNG MAJOR
text: agonizing. He leaves his post.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAJOR
dialog: Sir, General Ford ordered --
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Sit down, Major, or I will have
dialog: you arrested.
text: The Young Major hesitates. McClintock draws his pistol.
text: Salt enters, escorted by two MP's. The MP's survey the
text: situation, with the General facing off against a young
dialog: Major. What the hell is going on?
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL HELIPORT - GILLESPIE
text: races for the Black Hawk. Throws the door open and grabs
text: the RADIO. A beat, then it FLICKERS to life.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER
text: Gillespie's voice rings out over the radio:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE (V.O.)
dialog: Stop! The antiserum works.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Turn it off!
text: The radioman hesitates.
text: INTERCUT Sandman One in his chopper.
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE (V.O.)
dialog: This is Colonel Gillespie. And I'm
dialog: ordering you... begging you... to
dialog: stop. We can save these people.
text: McClintock punches off the radio.
scene_heading: ON FACES OF OFFICERS
text: in the room, wavering.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 136.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: You do this, every night for the
dialog: rest of your life you will wake
text: up screaming.
text: INTERCUT Sandman One. A long beat.
speaker_heading: SANDMAN ONE
dialog: This is Sandman One... we are
text: returning to base.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: You will be shot for dereliction
dialog: of duty in a national crisis. Do
dialog: you understand?
text: Sandman One doesn't answer. McClintock turns to the
dialog: Young Major.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: Order him to proceed.
text: The Young Major hesitates. McClintock points the gun at
text: his head. The Young Major trembles, but shakes his head
dialog: "no."
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: No!
text: McClintock turns the gun to Salt.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAJOR
dialog: No, sir... Please.
speaker_heading: McCLINTOCK
dialog: I cannot allow a catastrophe to
dialog: occur --
text: He puts the PISTOL into his own mouth and PULLS the
speaker_heading: TRIGGER.
text: Dead silence. Then:
speaker_heading: SALT
dialog: (to the Young Major)
dialog: As the ranking officer, you are
dialog: in command...

dialog: Until --

speaker_heading: AT BLACK HAWK
text: Gillespie has heard this entire action on the radio.
speaker_heading: SALT (V.O.)
text: Colonel Gillespie gets here.

text: the quarantine perimeter.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BONNEVILLE GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT (03:00)
text: The rain has stopped, as if for a brief moment man's
text: battle with nature has been suspended. Buses loaded
dialog: with the townspeople of Bonneville pass by. We
dialog: recognize the Police Chief, Tommy Hulls' wife and
text: children, Sherry Templeton's kids. All the windows
text: and doors of the buses have been sealed with tape.
text: TRACK PAST Betsy being loaded into the back of a van TO:
speaker_heading: GILLESPIE

scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA RIVER - NIGHT (03:10)

dialog: fire.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: CONVOY OF TRUCKS AND BUSES
