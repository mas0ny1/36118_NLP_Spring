scene_heading: EXT. EAST BUCKINGHAM BACK YARD -- DAY
text: Postage stamp size. Clothes on the line. The sunlight cut
text: by the cramped crowd of houses. We're already PULLING
text: AWAY FROM the backs of two men. Drinking beer, smoking
text: Luckys and sharing a laugh. An 11-year-old boy leans on a
text: street hockey stick, watches them. JIMMY MARCUS, unspent
text: energy coiled tight in his chest. His friend SEAN DEVINE
text: steps over, holds up an orange street hockey ball.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN
dialog: Got it.
text: Jimmy's attention is fixed on his and Sean's fathers.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Jimmy.
text: Sean punches him in the arm. As Jimmy looks hard over,
text: Sean wiggles the ball, raises his eyebrows.
scene_heading: EXT. DEVINE HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY
text: Wearing a Red Sox cap, DAVE BOYLE stands eagerly before a
text: makeshift chicken wire goalie net as Jimmy and Sean whack
text: away at the orange ball with their street hockey sticks.
text: As it bounces toward Dave, he takes an arcing swing at
text: it. Connects. The ball sails.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: Save!
text: Sean and Jimmy watch as the ball bounces into the street.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN
dialog: The sewer...
text: They charge off after it.
speaker_heading: GUTTER
text: The ball rolls, disappears down a storm drain. BOOM UP to
text: see the boys arriving too late to stop it. Jimmy and Sean
text: look back at Dave bringing up the rear. Looking guilty.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: Sorry, guys.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Guess I don't know my own strength.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY
dialog: Yeah, Dave, that must be it.
text: As Sean gets down on his hands and knees to look down
text: into the sewer, Jimmy looks up and down the street.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what would be cool?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY
text: Driving a car.
text: Sean looks up from the storm drain.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know. Just around the block.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY
dialog: Anyone on this street keep their keys in
dialog: their car?
text: Sean and Dave exchange a look. Jimmy's crazy.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN
dialog: ( (standing)
dialog: I steal a car, my dad'll kill me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY
dialog: Just around the block. Who said steal?
text: Sean shakes his head "no." Jimmy heaves a sigh. Jimmy
text: walks to where sawhorses have been set up. City crews
text: have replaced several squares of sidewalk. Yellow caution
text: tape is tied to the sawhorses creating a barricade. Jimmy
text: snaps the tape by walking right through it. Jimmy grabs a
text: stick and starts to write his name. Sean and Dave step
text: up, look over his shoulder, J-I-M-M-Y. Jimmy looks back
text: over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your dad kill you for writing your name,
dialog: too?
text: Sean takes the stick, squats down. S-E-A-N. Jimmy smiles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now it'll be there forever.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: Me, too. Forever.
text: Dave takes the stick, starts his own name by the other
text: two. D-A -- A little SQUEAL as a CAR lurches to a stop
text: across from them. A dark, plain Plymouth. The DRIVER gets
text: out. Crewcut, white shirt and black tie, a gold badge and
text: cuffs clipped to his belt buckle.
text: There's another man in the passenger seat. Hard to make
text: out through the watery reflection of trees in the glass.
text: Hard to tell whether he's wearing a priest's collar or a
text: turtleneck. The kids look at the badge. The Driver crooks
text: a finger at them, wriggles it toward his cheat until they
dialog: step over.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Let me ask you something.
text: He looks from the sidewalk to the stick in Dave's hand.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: You brats think it's okay to destroy
dialog: municipal property?
text: No answer. The Driver cups a hand behind his ear.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: No what?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JIMMY
dialog: Sir...
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: You're the hard case of the group, huh? A
dialog: pack of punks, huh?
text: The Driver looks at Sean.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: You live around here?
text: Not intimidated, Sean points at the house behind them.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SEAN
dialog: Right there.
text: The Driver's eyes flicker up toward the house. For just
text: an instant we see the fear and doubt in them. Then,
text: deciding, he looks hard at Dave. Dave is near tears.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: How 'bout you? Where do you live, son?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DAVE
dialog: Rester Street.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Your mother home?
text: Dave starts to cry. He nods.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to go have a talk with her.
dialog: Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.
text: The Driver opens the back door of the Plymouth.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in.
text: Dave doesn't move, looks at Jimmy. Sean leans out,
text: notices the trash collected on the floor of the back
text: seat. A strange, lost moment. The spell is broken as the
text: Driver slaps his hand on the roof of the car.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get the fuck inside!
text: Bawling, Dave climbs in.
text: The Driver points a finger at Jimmy and Sean.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Go tell your mothers what you've been up
dialog: to. And don't let me catch you shits
dialog: ruining my sidewalks again.
text: The street goes mute with the SLAMMING of CAR DOORS. And
text: then the car is driving off. Dave looks back at them out
text: the window, his head darkened by distance and shadows.
text: And then he's gone. Leaving Sean and Jimmy behind.
text: In the b.g., VOICES, each more panicked than the last.
speaker_heading: VOICE #1 (V.0.)
dialog: Weren't there three of you? Where's Dave?
speaker_heading: VOICE #2 (V.0.)
dialog: The cops took Dave? What cops?
speaker_heading: VOICE #3 (V.0.)
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God. Dave.
speaker_heading: VOICE #4 (V.0.)
text: Damaged goods. Even if they find him
dialog: alive, he'll never be the same.
scene_heading: EXT. GANNON STREET -- SIDEWALK -- DAY
text: Dinged and cracked with twenty years of age. There are
text: the names: Jimmy, Sean and D-A. Forever.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: PRESENT DAY
text: COME OFF the sidewalk to allow a MAN, wearing a Red Sox
text: cap, late 30s, walking down the sidewalk with an eight-
text: year-old boy (MICHAEL) wearing a little league uniform.
speaker_heading: DAVE (MAN)
dialog: You took some good swings today.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dad, I struck out.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Good swings though. That's what counts.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll never be a good ballplayer.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, you're my son. Me. Dave Boyle, star
dialog: shortstop of Don Bosco High School 1978
dialog: to 1982. You're going to be a great
dialog: ballplayer.
text: Michael's not so sure. Dave sees something ahead, points.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: See that gutter drain? I used to play on
dialog: this street when I was a kid. That drain
dialog: used to swallow every ball we had.
text: They start walking again, Michael listening eagerly.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
text: Baseballs, street hockey balls, pinkies.
dialog: If we could get the manhole cover off,
dialog: there'd be a thousand balls down there.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Really? Let's try.
text: As they near it, Dave spots the sidewalk square with the
text: names in it. His good mood shifts a bit.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
text: The Driver/cop slamming his palm on the hood of the
text: Plymouth. Young Dave blinking back tears.
text: Dave looks at his son, finally answers...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home before Mom
text: starts to worry.
text: They continue. As Dave looks back over his shoulder...
scene_heading: INT. MARKET -- JIMMY MARCUS -- DAY
text: Forty years old. Sitting at a small desk surrounded by
dialog: shelved stock: cigarettes, corn flakes, soda... Going
text: over some order sheets, Jimmy's lost in thought.
text: Different from when he was a kid, this is a 1,000 yard
dialog: stare.
text: Beyond, through a half-open curtain, a CASH REGISTER
text: RINGS, a couple kids working behind the counter. One of
text: the clerks, PETE, 21, steps into the back.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy.
text: He waves a hand in front of Jimmy's face.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Earth to Mr. Marcus.
text: Jimmy snaps back to reality.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What do you want now, Pete?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden. We're
text: out of Marlboros and Winstons are looking
dialog: grim.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So that's lost profit. And more profits
dialog: means I get a raise.
text: Pete grabs a carton of cigarettes and heads out.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: If the Surgeon General calls, you're my
dialog: alibi.
text: As Pete exits, Jimmy tries to focus on his order forms.
text: Then KATIE is in the door looking at him. Nineteen,
text: beautiful, Jimmy's daughter. She smiles as she watches
text: him. He finally feels her eyes on him.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Going out tonight with Eve and Diane. And
dialog: it's seven-thirty.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don't be out late. It's your sister's
dialog: first communion tomorrow. Christ, I sound
dialog: like, I don't know...
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Someone's father?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. Not mine, but somebody's.
text: She leans in, kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Later, Daddy.
text: He watches her breeze out. Finally...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Later...
scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE MARKET -- DAY
text: The BELL TINGLES as Katie walks out the front door.
text: Humming to herself. In a great mood. She gets into her
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: EXT. CAR
text: Katie STARTS the CAR, nearly screams as someone sits up
text: from the back seat. Then she recognizes:
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Brendan. You scared the shit out of me.
text: In the back seat BRENDAN HARRIS. Nineteen, he loves Katie
text: Marcus like crazy. Brendan is an anthem for her.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Sorry. But I didn't want your dad to see
dialog: me waiting.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: He sees you sneaking into my car, he'll
dialog: shoot you...
text: And they're kissing. Like nineteen-year-olds.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (between breaths)
dialog: What'll he do if he sees this?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Shoot you -- then kill you.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: It's been six hours. I had to see you.
text: As the passion increases, Katie suddenly breaks off.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I'm going to be late for Diane and Eve.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tomorrow. Like we planned.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Tomorrow...
text: They kiss again. Brendan ducks at the STORE BELL. It's a
text: customer exiting.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Drop me around the corner.
text: Katie laughs, drives. As the car turns the corner, we
text: look up to the TOBIN BRIDGE. A gloomy old erector set
text: spanning the Mystic River. THUMPING with the passing
speaker_heading: CARS.
scene_heading: EXT. TOBIN BRIDGE -- SUNSET
text: Southbound lanes swarming with state police. The sight of
text: a road-rage killing. Absolutely senseless.
speaker_heading: HANDCUFFED MAN
dialog: He kept cutting me off. He kept cutting
dialog: me off.
text: SEAN DEVINE is here, now a detective with the staties.
text: Grown up into a good-looking adult. He looks down at the
text: tenements of Faneuil Heights and the East Bucky Flats.
text: He's joined by his partner, WHITEY POWERS.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Guy won't stop confessing. We should pull
dialog: a lawyer out of one of these B.M.W.s.
text: Sean keeps staring down over the rail.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What'cha looking at?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: My old neighborhood.
text: A FEMALE TROOPER joins them. Her uniform not drab enough
text: to hide how sexy she is. She stares straight at Sean.
speaker_heading: FEMALE TROOPER
dialog: We're done, Sean, but I can stick around
dialog: if you need anything.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No. We're fine.
speaker_heading: FEMALE TROOPER
dialog: A few of us are going to the Can Tab
dialog: after.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don't think so, Jan. Thanks.
text: Disappointed, she heads off. Whitey watches her ass.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: The wife left you, what, six months ago.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: So, Jenny Coughlin there, Jenny with the
dialog: bod', the voice, the cuffs, the girl
dialog: makes gay guys reconsider their
dialog: orientation.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's your point?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: She is trying to bed you and you don't
dialog: even blink.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I'm married, Whitey.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You haven't even talked to Lauren in six
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: She calls all the time.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: And doesn't speak. Weirdest fucking thing
dialog: I ever heard.
text: Sean looks back out at the neighborhood.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: One of these days the phone'll ring and
dialog: she'll talk. I'll pick it up and she'll
dialog: tell me why she left.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Maybe she's waiting for you to say
dialog: something.
scene_heading: INT. McGILL'S BAR -- JUKEBOX -- NIGHT
text: Where DIANE CESTRA drops a quarter in the slot. Pressing
text: D-3, she looks back and smiles at her friends, EVE PIGEON
text: and Katie Marcus. It's "Brown Eyed Girl" as VAN MORRISON
dialog: starts: "Hey where did we go...?"
speaker_heading: BAR
text: Diane unsteadily rejoins her friends. A girl's night out
text: as they laugh, swig beer and sing-a-long with the music.
scene_heading: FURTHER DOWN BAR
text: Dave Boyle sits hunched over a beer with a FRIEND,
text: watching the Red Sox game on the TV.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on. Double play.
text: At the sound of a cheer (not for the Sox), the Friend
text: looks back over his shoulder, nudges Dave in the ribs.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: You believe those chicks?
text: As Dave turns to follow his gaze... Katie and Eve have
text: climbed onto the bar, dance on top of it. Katie the class
text: of the two. Some of the guys cheer, others watch with a
text: sad yearning, know it's not for them. Dave cocks his
text: head, watches Katie. Smiles to himself as her hair falls
text: over her eyes like a veil.
speaker_heading: FRIEND (CONT'D)
dialog: Ain't that Jimmy Marcus's girl?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah...
text: We CLOSE ON Dave as he seems suddenly lost in the moment.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I remember when she was a kid.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. BOYLE APARTMENT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: CELESTE BOYLE, 37, in her nightgown, leans against the
text: door frame, looking in at her sleeping son Michael. She
text: looks sad. At the click of the front door lock, she looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR
text: Dave's closing it shut behind him when
text: Celeste steps around the corner, concern
text: still overriding anger.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Dave, it's three in the morning. Where
dialog: have you been? I was --
text: She stops short as she sees there's blood all over him.
text: He stands there embarrassed, like he was ten years old.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: I tucked up. The guy tried to mug me,
dialog: right? So, so I swung on him. And he
dialog: sliced me.
text: He clutches at his side. Celeste sees that it's crimson.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (stepping forward)
dialog: Jesus, Dave, you have to go to the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, no. It's not that deep. It just bled
dialog: like hell.
scene_heading: INT. BOYLE APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Dave, shirt off, holds his arm up, grimaces as Celeste
text: dabs hydrogen peroxide on a sweeping gash along his rib
dialog: cage.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm walking to my car and this guy comes
dialog: up to me, asks for a light. I say I don't
dialog: smoke. Guy says neither does he. So my
text: heart starts clocking a buck fifty
dialog: ‘cause there's no one around but me and
dialog: him.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: That's when I see the knife and he says,
dialog: "Your wallet or your life, bitch. I'm
dialog: leaving with one of 'em.,
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: That's what he said?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah. So, so then I try to brush past him
text: and that's when he slices me.
dialog: Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?
text: She touches his cheek.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I'm sorry, baby.
text: He kisses her hand.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I went fucking nuts on him, babe. I went
text: off. I bashed his head on the parking
dialog: lot. I, I might have killed him, honey.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Killed him?
text: Dave nods. He's serious. Celeste looks at him. Eyes wide,
text: face pale and sweaty. His breath starts to get a little
text: ragged as he looks back. He's really scared.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It makes you feel alone. Hurting someone.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: But you had to.
text: Celeste embraces him. Over her shoulder:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It makes you feel... alien.
text: Celeste looks at him, suddenly filling with strength.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Baby, you hop in the shower.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll take care of your clothes.
dialog: 14.
dialog: Dave's not sure what that means. Neither are we.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Jimmy looks tough even when he's sleeping. His wife
text: ANNABETH snoozes beside him. The bedside clock reads:
text: 6:02. The PHONE starts to RING. Jimmy answers, bleary.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
dialog: (over phone)
dialog: I'm in the weeds here at the store,
dialog: Jimmy. I need some help.
text: Jimmy looks at the clock.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You and Katie can't handle six, how you

speaker_heading: PETE (V.0.) _
dialog: That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No? Hold on.
text: Jimmy rolls to his feet. MOVE WITH him as he walks
dialog: down...
speaker_heading: HALL
speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
dialog: The Sunday paper's still bundled,
text: doughnut guy's honking his horn.
text: He looks in her room. Her bed is empty and made.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'll be there in ten minutes, Pete. Call
dialog: Sal and see if he can make it by eight
text: instead of ten.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Jimmy pulls on his clothes. Annabeth watches from bed.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: She no-shows at work, what if she no-
dialog: shows at church?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm sure she'll make it.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Yeah. She's going to screw up this day,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What other day has she screwed up lately?
text: Annabeth puts up her hands, doesn't want to fight.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH

dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: One hour. I'll still be back before
text: anyone gets out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. COTTAGE MARKET -- DAY
text: Jimmy arrives to a morning rush. Folks coming off the
text: night shift: Cops, nurses from St. Regina's and a few
text: working girls, all coming off the same battlefield
text: together. Pete looks up, smiles in relief as Jimmy takes
text: up a position by the cash register and lottery machine.
text: Jimmy punches out tickets, RINGS UP at the REGISTER. He
text: also takes the phone off the wall behind him, dials.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey, Drew, it's Jimmy. Sorry to
dialog: wake you, I'm looking for Katie.
speaker_heading: DREW (V.O.)
dialog: I think she's here, yeah. Lemme go check.
dialog: Hold on.
text: Jimmy's relieved. First time he even knew he was worried.
text: As he bags a sale, smiles across at a customer.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DREW (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. It was Diane Cestra slept over.
dialog: But no Katie. Eve said Katie dropped them
dialog: off at one. Didn't say where she was
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay, man, I'll track her down.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: She seeing anyone maybe?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Nineteen-year-old girls, Drew? Who could

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That's the cold truth.
text: As Jimmy hangs up the phone, the BELL over the door RINGS
text: and the first Sunday mass crowd rolls in. A shitload of
text: blue hair old ladies. Pete looks over at Jimmy.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Welcome to hell...
text: As they surge toward the counter in a wave.
scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE MARKET -- DAY
text: As the blue hairs exit, the CASH REGISTER DING is

scene_heading: INT. COTTAGE MARKET -- BACK ROOM -- DAY
text: Jimmy pulls another pot of coffee from the brewer. Pete
text: appears from out front.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'll take the hookers over the old ladies

dialog: a smoke?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fuck, Pete, smoke the whole pack.
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: INT. COTTAGE MARKET -- DAY
text: The BELL RINGS. Jimmy looks up as Brendan Harris and his
text: little brother Silent Ray enter. Ray carries his street
text: hockey stick, a blankness living in his face.
text: Brendan clocks Jimmy with a brief look of surprise before
text: turning down an aisle. He talks to his brother with sign
text: language. His brother's hands flying back answers.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: Help you, Brendan?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Uh, no, Mr. Marcus, just getting some of
dialog: that tea my mom likes.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: Barry's. Next aisle over.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Oh thanks.
text: Hands fly again as Brendan and Silent Ray move an aisle
text: over. As Pete returns from his smoke.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What time's Sal getting here?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Any time now.
text: Jimmy sighs, looks out the front window. Brendan comes to
text: the counter with his tea. Pete steps over.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: That it, Brendan?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: And a Globe.
text: While Jimmy is preoccupied and as Pete RINGS UP the sale.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: So's, ah, I thought Katie worked on
dialog: Sundays.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You sweet on my man's daughter, Brendan?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: No, no, no. I was just wondering, you
dialog: know, because usually I see her here.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Oh...
text: Not too happy to pick up Jimmy's attention, Brendan gets
text: his change and starts out.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice seeing you. Come on, Ray.
text: Ray, his back to his brother when he spoke, turns and
text: starts after him. Jimmy stares after them as they go.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Can I ask you something, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why do you hate that kid so bad?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It's not hate, man. But come on, don't
dialog: you find that mute little fucker a little
dialog: spooky?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Not Silent Ray. Brendan.
text: Jimmy looks over at Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice kid. Uses sign language with his
dialog: brother even if he doesn't have to. It's
dialog: like, so he won't feel alone. But, Jimmy,
dialog: you look at Brendan like you're two steps
text: from slicing off his nose and feeding it
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. Really?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Straight up.
dialog: 19.
text: Jimmy looks back out the window at the receding brothers,

text: diamonds and rusty playgrounds. OVER it all, a 911
text: Operator answers a call:
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: 9-1-1, police services. What is the
dialog: nature of your emergency?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: There's like this car with blood in it
dialog: and, ah, the door's open -
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: What's the location of the car?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: Uh, Sydney Street in the Flats. By Pen
dialog: Park. Me and my friend found it.
text: The AERIAL VIEW PASSES OVER Pen Channel, the abandoned
text: drive-in screen on one side of the park and then Pen Park
text: itself. A littered, depressing site.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Son, what's your name?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: (to someone else)
dialog: He wants to know her name.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Your name. What's your name?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: We're so fucking out of here. Good luck.
text: CLICK. We've OVER the Sydney Street entrance to the park.
text: There's a car down there, door open, front tires against
text: the curb. As we CONTINUE PAST it and INTO the mostly
text: abandoned houses across the way...
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Dispatch, this is unit thirty-three.
dialog: We're going to need a crime scene tech or
dialog: two and you might want to notify
dialog: homicide.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Have you found a body, thirty-three?
dialog: Over.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN (V.O.)
dialog: No, but looks of this car, we'll find one
dialog: sooner or later.
scene_heading: EXT. SYDNEY STREET -- DAY
text: Blue sawhorses stamped °BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT® cordon
text: off the scene. The crime scene services van is parked
text: further down. Sean Devine pulls up in an unmarked, gets
text: out. He's met by his partner Whitey.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Hey, bad boy. This should be the city's
dialog: but...
dialog: (points)
dialog: Park's reservation land. State
dialog: jurisdiction, not city. If the body's in
dialog: there, it's our case.
text: Police are already walking through the underbrush.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: How much evidence you think they've
dialog: destroyed so far?
text: As they start toward the car, one of the cops adds local
text: color as we hear him talk to his buddies.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: The Parker Hill vic, right?
text: Walked into the E.R. at M.G.H. on his own, steak knife
text: sticking out of his collarbone, asking the nurse where
dialog: they keep the Coke machine round this bitch.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: She tell him?
text: They all laugh, but Sean. It's too goddamn early.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What do we got on the car so far?
speaker_heading: CSS TECH
dialog: We found the reg in the glove box. Owner
dialog: is Katherine Marcus.
text: Sean reacts hard to the name.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You know her?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maybe. Might be the daughter of a guy I
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CSS TECH
dialog: We found a wallet and license ina
text: backpack on the floor. She was nineteen.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Fuck. That's her.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Is it a problem? You close with the guy?
text: Sean waves it off. He's staying on the case.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: When we were kids. Now? Just a hello
text: around the neighborhood.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Nineteen... Fuck, man. He's in for a
dialog: world of hurt.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CECILIA'S CHURCH -- ON NADINE MARCUS -- DAY
text: Her hands pressed together, dressed in a white dress with
text: a white veil. Walking up the aisle in a procession of
text: twenty other children. First communion.
scene_heading: JIMMY AND ANNABETH
text: Stand with their other daughter, Sara. Look back to watch
text: their daughter come up the aisle. As Nadine's about to
text: pass them, Annabeth whispers:
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Do not make her laugh.
text: As Nadine passes, she chances a look over at her father.
text: He waves from his hip, wiggles his eyebrows. Nadine
text: smiles huge. Annabeth digs an elbow into his ribs.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What?
text: As she continues to the altar, Jimmy looks back over his
text: shoulder. Really hoping to see Katie arrive at the last
text: minute. But she's not going to make it.
speaker_heading: CSS TECH (V.O.)
dialog: Door was ajar when we found it.
dialog: Headlights on. You got blood on the
text: driver door speaker...
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CAR (SYDNEY STREET) -- DAY
text: Sean looks the car over, puts the initial crime together.
speaker_heading: CSS TECH
text: More blood on top of the steering wheel
text: and around a bullet hole punched through
text: the driver's seat back at shoulder level.
text: As more police arrive to search, Sean looks at a fresh
text: dent in the driver's door, past to the weeds, takes a
dialog: stab.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Perp stood outside the car. The Marcus
text: girl slams him with the door. Perp gets a
text: round off, hits her in the shoulder,
text: maybe the biceps? She runs for it.
dialog: (points into park)
text: Through those trampled weeds.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CECILIA'S -- DAY
text: As Nadine solemnly receives her first communion.
text: Annabeth, near tears, leans into Jimmy, whispers in his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Our baby. My God, Jimmy, our baby.
dialog: 23.
text: Jimmy puts his arm around her, kisses the side of her
text: head. As she leans into him a little more...
scene_heading: FLASHBACK --— CELLAR
text: Young Dave curled up whimpering on a pile of rags.
text: Looking up in terror as a DOOR BANGS open at the top of
text: the stairs. And as feet start ominously down...
speaker_heading: DAVE BOYLE
text: The man, waking up with a start in his bed.
scene_heading: INT. BOYLE APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- DAY Michael sits at
text: the table eating cereal.
text: Celeste is at the counter flipping through the last of
text: three different newspapers. She looks up as Dave enters,
text: yawning, just rolled out of bed. He goes to the
text: refrigerator without an apparent care in the world.
dialog: CELESTE Dave...
text: He looks over, clocks the look on her face. He steps
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (low)
dialog: There's nothing in the papers. I checked
dialog: three times.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It was late. Real late.
text: He kisses her forehead. She manages a smile.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Morning, Mikey. You up for hitting some
dialog: whiffle ball?
scene_heading: INT. PEN PARK -- DAY
text: A nylon triangle hangs from a branch. Just under a
text: footbridge over Pen Channel. The CSS Tech pinches it off
text: with a pair of tweezers. It's got blood on it.
text: Sean and Whitey crouch by the arch. There's a woman's
text: shoe there along with several similar footprints.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: I'd say she might've hid here a bit.
text: Killer shows and she bolts to the other
text: side, takes off running again.
text: Sean looks out to where the water in the channel widens
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Better call some divers while we're at
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CECILIA'S -- DAY
text: The kids flow outside through the front of the church,
text: the adults following behind.
text: Nadine spots her father, makes a break for him.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Daddy, Daddy!
text: Jimmy scoops her in his arms.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Baby!
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: This dress itches.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: It's itching me and I'm not even wearing
dialog: it.
text: Jimmy looks over his shoulder, smiles at Annabeth and
text: Sara. They beam back. A moment of perfect happiness,
dialog: until...
text: A state POLICE CRUISER SLAMS around the corner of
dialog: Buckingham Avenue.
text: Jimmy whips around, matches as it goes wide into the left
text: lane of Roseclair, rear TIRE SLAPPING the median strip,
text: SIREN SLICING the morning air.
text: It's followed an instant later by a black unmarked,
text: cutting the ninety-degree turn at forty miles an hour.
text: Two more cop cars zip under the overpass, take the
text: entrance road into Pen Park. Jimmy lowers Nadine to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 25.
text: And he knows, feels it in his blood with a sudden mean
text: certainty, a sense of things falling miserably into
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Katie...
scene_heading: EXT. ROSECLAIR ENTRANCE (PEN PARK) -- DAY
text: Looks like a riot waiting room.
text: Cops, in the bushes, cops at the sawhorses, cops
text: everywhere. K-9 German shepherds being walked out of a
text: van. The crowd of onlookers growing.
text: Jimmy steps up, is spotted by ED DEVEAU who's opening a
text: bag of M&Ms with his teeth. As a POLICE HELICOPTER BUZZES
dialog: by.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What's up, Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They got Sydney blocked off, Crescent,
dialog: all the way to Dunboy. Boo Bear Durkin
text: said he saw frogmen going into the Pen.
dialog: Why you all decked out?
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: So what the hell you doing here?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just curious I guess.
text: Jimmy spots the clot of cops around a car, moves
text: laterally for a better view. He gets it, sees it's
dialog: Katie's.
text: Jimmy starts forward, pushes through one end of the
text: sawhorse, is almost there before two cops block him. As
text: they babble official speak...
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my daughter's cart
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS (PEN PARK) -- DAY
text: Sean looking for something, anything. Whitey steps over.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We got dogs sniffing something by the old
dialog: drive-in screen. Want to take a walk
dialog: over?
text: Sean nods. His WALKIE-TALKIE SURGES TO LIFE.
speaker_heading: WALKIE (V.O.)
dialog: Trooper Devine.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Yeah, go ahead.
speaker_heading: WALKIE (V.O.)
dialog: We got a guy out on Sydney, says he's the
dialog: father of the girl.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Shit...
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: You got a psychologist on scene yet?
speaker_heading: WALKIE (V.O.)
dialog: En route.
speaker_heading: WALKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He's asking for you, Devine. Says he
dialog: knows you.
text: Sean looks to Whitey who just shrugs.
speaker_heading: WALKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: He's not taking no for an answer. And
dialog: he's got some guys with him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What guys?
speaker_heading: COP
text: Scary-looking guys.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The Savage brothers. Christ.
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: I'm on my way.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSECLAIR ENTRANCE (PEN PARK) -- DAY
text: Jimmy's there with three of the Savage brothers: NICK,
text: VAL and Kevin. His brothers-in-law. Jail-yard stares and
text: hair triggers. They shout across the barrier at the cops.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: That's our niece in there, you dumb prick
dialog: pieces of shit!
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Hey. We're doing our job.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: All due respect, the doughnut shop's that
dialog: way.
text: Jimmy standing a little alone, watching. Finally:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Val, ease up! Nick. Nickie. Take Kevin
dialog: and go to Drew Pigeon's. Talk to his
dialog: daughter and her friend. Katie was out
dialog: with them last night.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Kevin, let's go!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And hey, these girls are friends. Don't
dialog: get hard on them, but get answers.
text: As Nick and Kevin head off, Sean arrives, greeting Jimmy
text: with as big a smile as he can muster.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Jimmy, hey, man.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Is she in there, Sean?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We don't know. All we're doing right now
text: is looking.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: So let us in. We can help look.
text: Sean doesn't even look at Val, just keeps his eyes on
dialog: Jimmy.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sorry. As soon as I know anything, you'll
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's my daughter's car.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I know. I --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (panic rising)
dialog: My daughter's car. It's got blood in it.
dialog: They brought fucking dogs in. Why do you
dialog: got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Because we're looking. Okay, Jimmy? Right
dialog: now all she is is missing. Okay?
text: As Jimmy nods, Sean's WALKIE CRACKLES TO LIFE right.
speaker_heading: RADIO (V.O.)
dialog: Trooper Devine, we got something.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Say again.
speaker_heading: RADIO (V.O.)
dialog: Sergeant Powers said you need to get in
dialog: here. Uh, ASAP, like right now.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Your location?
speaker_heading: RADIO (V.O.)
dialog: The drive-in screen. And, man, it's a
dialog: fucking mess.
text: Sean looks back at Jimmy who's just about coming out of
text: his skin. Sean looks to the cops.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Don't let him through.
text: As Sean hurries off, Jimmy steps back alongside Val.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You still got those bolt cutters
dialog: in your trunk?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Guy's gotta make a living, Jim.
text: Jimmy goes the other way, Val following.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. BOYLE APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Celeste washes dishes, scrubbing away like it means
text: something. A portable TV on the counter.
text: Suddenly: the TV newsroom.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: We interrupt to bring you a breaking
text: story. A massive search is under way for
text: a woman missing in the Buckingham Flats.
text: A news chopper POV. The car and park and police below.
text: Celeste watches transfixed, soap dripping from her hands.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: All we know so far is that there are
text: signs of foul play in a car found
text: abandoned outside Pen Park. Police
dialog: have...
text: As the anchor drones, Celeste goes to the window, takes a
text: vertiginous look into the yard below.
text: Dave is playing ball with Michael. As they laugh and pal
text: around, Celeste looks momentarily ill.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVE-IN SCREEN -- DAY
text: Steps lead down to a door on the side of the screen. CSS
text: flashbulbs pop. Whitey looks in, jots notes. An assistant
text: MEDICAL EXAMINER is down on his knees looking at
text: something. Plus a platoon of uniformed troopers and
dialog: Boston PD blues.
text: A BABY-FACED COP stares away from the action, being
text: comforted by his partner as Sean passes on his way in.
speaker_heading: BABY-FACE
dialog: I never saw anything like it. Man, this
dialog: is... this is...
text: Sean sees the blood, already circled, on the steps
text: leading down. A path is made for him. As he reaches the
text: door, Whitey looks back, meets Sean's gaze, looks ten
dialog: years older.
text: Sean's view widens as he sees between the ME and CSS
text: tech. A body is scrunched there, the space between the
text: walls no more than three feet wide.
dialog: 30.
text: Katie Marcus sits with her back against the wall on the
text: right, her feet pushed up hard on the wall to the left.
text: Like a fetus in some horrific womb.
text: A torn sock hangs around her left ankle, a simple black
text: shoe with a flat heel is on her right foot. Her jacket is
text: torn, her pants mud-stained.
text: Blood is everywhere. Like a red rain, it's in her hair,
text: dots her cheeks, stains her clothes in red strings.
text: Katie's knees are pressed to her chest, her right elbow
text: propped on her right knee, a clenched fist up by her ear
text: trying to keep some awful sound at bay. Her eyes are
text: clenched shut as tight as her fist.
dialog: Stop it, just stop it, the body says. Stop it, please.
text: Sean steps in, crouches. Whitey fills the space behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: That her?
text: As gently as he can, Sean uses his forefinger to move
text: back a heavy strand of hair. He looks at Katie a moment.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We'll have the father do a positive at
text: the morgue.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
text: Blood's from a split on the crown of her
text: head. She was beaten with some kind of
dialog: stick. But that didn't kill her. She was
text: shot a second time. Looks like a .38.
text: Sean hasn't really heard any of it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What the fuck am I going to tell him. Hey
dialog: guess what, Jimmy? God said you owed
text: another marker. He came to collect.
text: Sudden SHOUTS from outside, the K-9 DOGS BARK like mad.
text: Sean springs up. As he and Whitey turn outside.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: DRIVE-IN SCREEN
text: Eight uniforms and two plainclothes converge on Jimmy and
text: Val as they burst from the trees. Val goes down snarling
text: almost right away. But Jimmy's too quick.
text: He's almost to the screen when he stumbles. A young
dialog: trooper, all head and high school tight-end, body-tackles
text: him, lands on top of him. As he pins Jimmy's arm back...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey! Hey! It's the father. Just pull him
dialog: back.
text: As Sean turns back to the screen:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sean! Look at me, Sean!
text: Sean looks back at him. Jimmy arches up under the young
text: cop's weight. Another cop helps hold him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You find her? Is it her? Is it?
text: Sean is motionless. He holds Jimmy's eyes with his own,
text: locking them until Jimmy's surging stare sees what Sean
text: has just seen. And he knows it's over, his worst fear
dialog: realized.
text: And Jimmy screams. Love and rage in equal quantities. It
text: shreds the birds from the trees. It ECHOES into the Pen
text: Channel. Ropes of spit shoot from his mouth. Screaming.
text: Sean turns away, looks back in at Katie. It's awful.
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE -- HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Jimmy sits in a straight-back wooden chair. Waiting, head
text: back, hands folded. He looks up at FOOTSTEPS.
text: Annabeth is shown in by a young officer. Jimmy rises.
text: She's still wearing her lavender dress from the
text: communion. She steps into his arms, presses her face into
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No one said anything. Right?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What do you mean, baby?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You haven't seen her yet, right? It might
dialog: not be her, right?
text: Jimmy doesn't answer, doesn't know what to say. Annabeth
text: looks up at him. Desperate, wretched with hope.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jimmy... Jimmy, please. Please.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Please what, honey? What?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Oh, please, Jimmy. No. No.
text: Sobbing, she crumbles into him.
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE -- DAY
text: PUSH IN ON Katie. She lies on a metal table. Her eyes are
text: closed and she's missing a shoe.
text: Jimmy enters from the other way. Sean a step behind him.
text: Jimmy stops short, opens his mouth to speak, but nothing
text: comes out. Sean puts a hand on the small of his back.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah, that's her. That's Katie. That's my
dialog: daughter.
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE -- CAFETERIA -- DAY
text: Sean sits across from Jimmy and Annabeth. A beat of
text: surreal silence before Whitey arrives with four coffees.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Fresh-brewed.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We need to work a timeline. It's the
dialog: details, the little things that can make
dialog: a case. Things you forget after a day or
dialog: two.
text: Annabeth nods that she understands. Jimmy's a little in
text: shock. Lost a moment, then he looks to Sean.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You ever think how one choice can change
dialog: your life?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I heard Hitler's mother almost aborted
dialog: him but bailed at the last minute. You
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What do you mean, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Say you or me got in that car instead of
dialog: Dave Boyle.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What car?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I'm losing you here, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: If I'd got in that car, life would be a
dialog: different thing. My first wife, Marita,
dialog: Katie's mother? She was beautiful. Regal.
dialog: You know the way some Latin women can be?
dialog: And she knew it. You had to have balls to
dialog: even go near her. And I did. Eighteen
dialog: years old, the two of us, and she was
dialog: carrying Katie. Here's the thing, Sean,
dialog: if I had gotten in that car, I most
dialog: likely would've ended up a basket case. I
dialog: never would have had the juice to ask out
dialog: Marita and we never would've had Katie.
dialog: And Katie, then, would never have been
dialog: murdered. You see what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You ever see Dave around?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: He married my cousin. Celeste.
text: Sean nods again. Whitey finally gets things on track.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What time did Katie get home from work
dialog: yesterday?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
text: Around four-thirty.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Anything unusual? Out of the ordinary
dialog: about her?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No. She sat with me and the girls while
dialog: we ate. She was having dinner with her
dialog: friends.
text: Whitey checks his pad.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Katie talked to Nadine about her
text: Communion, then she was on the phone in
text: her room a bit, and then, about eight,
dialog: she left.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Do you know who she talked to?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Would you mind if we subpoenaed the phone
dialog: company records to that line?
text: Annabeth looks over at Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Mr. Marcus, you spent a good part of
dialog: Saturday with your daughter at the store,
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yes and no. I was mostly in back.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You remember anything odd? A
dialog: confrontation with a customer?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. She was herself. She was happy. She --
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, nothing.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: The littlest thing is something right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: When she was little, right after her
dialog: mother had died, I had just gotten out of
dialog: prison and I could never leave her alone.
dialog: Whether she ended up crying or not, she'd
dialog: get this look. Like she was preparing to
dialog: never see you again. For a few seconds on
dialog: Saturday, she looked at me that way.
text: Whitey starts to write this down.
dialog: His shock
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, it was just a look.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: It's info. I collect it until a few
dialog: pieces fit. Little things. You say you
dialog: were in prison?
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just asking.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sixteen years ago. Two years at Deer
dialog: Island for robbery. Is that going to help
dialog: you catch my daughter's killer? I mean,
dialog: I'm just asking.
text: dissolving, Jimmy stares hard at Whitey.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Okay, let's forget it and get back to the
dialog: point. Okay?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The point.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Outside that look Katie gave you, was
dialog: there anything else?
text: Jimmy takes his convict-in-the-yard stare off Whitey,
dialog: sips some
text: coffee, does his genuine best to think.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Um, this kid... No, that was this
dialog: morning.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What? Remember, little things.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Neighborhood, kid, Brendan Harris, came
dialog: in this morning, asked if Katie was
text: around, like he expected to see her. But
dialog: they barely knew each other.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You're sure? Could they have been dating?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why are you so sure?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey, Sean, what the fuck? You're going to
dialog: grill me? A father knows.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Mrs. Marcus? Who was she seeing?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No one right now. As far as we know. I
dialog: mean... knew.
text: The past/present tense is all it took. As Annabeth fights
text: back tears, Jimmy squeezes her hand.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'll answer everything you got tomorrow,
dialog: but we got to go. We got two girls
dialog: waiting at home wondering where their
dialog: sister is.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: There'll be a trooper downstairs to drive
dialog: you home. If you think of anything, give
dialog: us a call.
text: Whitey hands Jimmy his card. Jimmy nods good-bye, helps
text: Annabeth away. Sean and Whitey watch as they head off.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: He said you almost got in some car when
dialog: you were kids. What was that about?
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We, shit, well, there was this car. Me
dialog: and Jimmy and a kid named Dave Boyle were
dialog: playing in front of my house. And this
text: car came up the street and took Dave
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Abduction?

text: Guys pretended to be cops. Convinced
dialog: Dave to get in the car. They had him for
text: four days before he managed to get away.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: They catch the guys?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: One died, the other got busted about a
dialog: year later and went the noose route in
dialog: his cell.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Your buddy, Marcus. Moment I laid eyes on
dialog: him, I knew he'd done time. They never
dialog: lose the tension, you know? It settles in
dialog: their shoulders.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He just lost his daughter, man. Maybe
text: that's what settled in his shoulders.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: No. That's in his stomach. Notice how he
dialog: kept grimacing? Seen it a million times.
dialog: The shoulders, though, that's prison.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK -- CELLAR BULKHEAD
text: As Young Dave desperately pounds. Trying to get out.
scene_heading: EXT. TENDERLOIN DISTRICT -- NIGHT
text: Along the Mystic River. Dave Boyle walks, hands thrust in
text: his pockets. Prostitutes blend in the shadows of
text: doorways, lean into the windows of IDLING CARS. Some take
text: a half-step in the streetlight to show Dave what they
dialog: got.
dialog: 38.
text: But he continues forward, not interested. Last of all, a
text: kid, a boy, fifteen at the most. Lighting a smoke, he
text: looks up, smiles around the cigarette.
text: Dave stops. The kid's eyes suddenly widen in recognition
text: and he bolts. Dave follows a few steps, but the kid's
text: already disappeared into the darkness.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I just want to talk to you!
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOUSE -- KATIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Two uniformed TROOPERS search. Under the mattress,
text: through drawers. We hear GIRLS CRYING in the next room.
text: They look up, embarrassed, as Jimmy looks in.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You guys almost done?
speaker_heading: TROOPER #1
dialog: Almost, sir.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Find anything?
speaker_heading: TROOPER #1
dialog: Her bankbook. Did you know she closed her
dialog: account two days ago? Withdrew seven
dialog: hundred dollars?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. No I didn't.
text: As the troopers go back to work and Jimmy walks away...
scene_heading: EXT. THREE-DECKER (BUCKINGHAM AVENUE) -- NIGHT
text: Storefronts shut down across the street. A rumbling
text: stillness has taken over the area.
text: Jimmy steps out on the porch of his three-decker. He sits
text: on the steps. Closing his eyes, he leans back, listens,
text: as the tears of ANNABETH AND HIS DAUGHTERS drift down.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Jimmy...
text: Jimmy doesn't hear it at first.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, aim.
text: Jimmy opens his eyes. Standing at the bottom of the steps
text: is Dave. It takes Jimmy a blink or two to recognize him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey, Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I wasn't going to talk to you tonight,
dialog: but I was out for a walk and saw you
dialog: sitting here.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So you know, me and Celeste, the whole
dialog: neighborhood, if you need anything,
dialog: anything, we're here.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Appreciate it, Dave.
text: A moment. Dave manages a little smile, a wave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'll leave you alone.
text: As Dave starts away.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dave...
text: Dave stops, looks back hopefully.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know how it is. Irish family.
dialog: Catholics. How it'll be tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: House full of people all day.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. All Annabeth has are those ham-
dialog: fisted brothers of hers. If Celeste could
dialog: come over and give her a hand...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sure, Jimmy. You got it.
text: Dave gives another little wave, starts on his way.

dialog: detectives.
speaker_heading: FRIEL
dialog: Powers, where are we so far?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Time of death roughly one-fifteen to one-
text: thirty A.M. No sign of sexual assault.
dialog: Cause of death most likely the gunshot
text: wound to the back of the head, not the
text: trauma from the beating she took. B.P.D.
text: officers are on a house-to-house along
dialog: Sydney to see if anyone heard anything.
speaker_heading: FRIEL
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We're waiting on ballistics... The lack
text: of footprints pisses me off. It rained.
dialog: Still, she left some, but the perp?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FRIEL
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: She and her friends were bar-hopping.
dialog: Four places. We're interviewing everyone
dialog: might've seen or talked to them.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: One other thing. Backpack in her car had
text: pamphlets on Las Vegas and a list of
dialog: Vegas hotels.
speaker_heading: FRIEL
dialog: Doesn't sound like much.
dialog: (looking at Sean)
dialog: What do you say, Devine?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We'll get the guy, sir.
text: Friel nods, heads out.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Four years of college and that's all you

dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It made him happy, didn't it?
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOME -- KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Annabeth and Celeste at the stove, cooking bacon and
dialog: eggs.
text: Neither talks, but they're happy for each other's
text: company. A HUBBUB of VOICES from the hallway, up which
text: Jimmy walks.
text: Jimmy trades smiles with Celeste, then looks at Annabeth.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You need anything, baby? I can work the
dialog: stove a bit.
text: Annabeth shakes her head, but doesn't look at him.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: No, I'm fine.
text: Jimmy looks at Celeste as if to say: Is she?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: We got things covered, Jimmy.
text: Celeste watches as Jimmy looks at his wife. He reaches,
text: wipes a bead of sweat off Annabeth's cheek with his
dialog: finger.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Look at me.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I can't. Jimmy, if I look at you I'll
dialog: lose it and I can't lose it with all
dialog: these people here... Okay?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay, baby, okay.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I just don't want to lose it again.
text: Celeste wishes she could crawl off, feels like she's

scene_heading: INT. MRS. PRIOR'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: An old lady, a busybody. She has one eye on the TV, the

speaker_heading: MRS. PRIOR
dialog: I heard a car hit something.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hit what, ma'am, another car?
speaker_heading: MRS. PRIOR
dialog: Oh no, not loud like that.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Like hitting the curb?
speaker_heading: MRS. PRIOR
dialog: Yes, maybe. And then it stalled and
dialog: someone said, 'hi.'
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Someone said, 'hi'?
speaker_heading: MRS. PRIOR
text: Hi. And then there was a loud crack.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Did you ever look out the window, Mrs.
dialog: Prior?
speaker_heading: MRS. PRIOR
dialog: Yes, maybe. No. I was in my dressing
text: gown by then. I don't stand in the window
dialog: in my dressing gown.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The voice that said, 'hi,' was it male or
dialog: female?
speaker_heading: MRS. PRIOR
dialog: Female, I think.
text: Sean looks at Whitey.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sounds like she knew the shooter.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY
text: A throng already gathered. Celeste comes out to fill
text: coffee cups. She looks across the room at Dave who's
text: sandwiched between some of the Savage brothers. He sees
text: her, smiles wanly. Very out of his element. And Celeste
text: can feel his aloneness. As she smiles back...
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. Jimmy gets it. It's his father-in-
text: law, THEO SAVAGE, a case of beer on each shoulder.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Theo.
text: Jimmy takes one of the cases, as Theo steps inside.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: How's my daughter? How's Annabeth holding
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She's trying, Theo.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: (re: beer)
dialog: Let's get these on ice. You got some

scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOUSE -- PANTRY -- DAY
text: Jimmy shakes a bag of ice into a beer cooler; Theo
dialog: watches.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: How you handling this so far?
text: Jimmy looks up at Theo, not really in the mood.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Gonna hurt like hell when it does. When
dialog: my Jane died? I was no good for six
dialog: months. But my kids were all grown up. I
dialog: had that luxury. You, you got domestic
dialog: responsibilities?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Domestic responsibilities?
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Yeah, you know, you gotta take care of my
dialog: daughter and those little girls. They got
dialog: to be your priority now.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You figured that might slip my mind,
dialog: Theo?
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Just needed to be said is all. You'll
dialog: carry on. 'Cause you're a man. I said to
dialog: Annabeth, your wedding day, said you got
dialog: yourself a real old school man there --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: Like they put her in a bag.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's what Katie looked like when I saw
text: her in the morgue. Like someone put her
text: in a bag and then had beaten the bag with
dialog: pipes.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Yeah, well, I, uh --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Janey died in her sleep. All due respect
dialog: and shit, but there you go. She went to
text: bed and never woke up. Peaceful.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: You don't need to talk about Janey --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: My daughter though? Someone put a gun to
dialog: her. She was murdered. And right about
dialog: now they'll be starting the autopsy.
text: Laying out scalpels and chest spreaders.
dialog: And you want to talk to me about my
dialog: domestic fucking responsibilities?

scene_heading: INT. PIGEON HOUSE -- EVE PIGEON AND DIANE CESTRA -- DAY

dialog: know.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Who was she dating?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We already told the Savages.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The Savage brothers?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: They were here yesterday.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Well, try us out, who was she dating?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: No one special.
text: Sean plays a hunch.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You guys had a good-bye dinner, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (busted)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: She was leaving town, wasn't she? Going
dialog: to Las Vegas.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: She closed her bankbook, had hotel phone
dialog: numbers.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: She wanted out of this dump. She wanted
dialog: to start a new life.
dialog: 46.
text: At "life" they start crying again.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: A nineteen-year-old girl doesn't go to

speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Brendan.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Brendan Harris?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Brendan Harris. Yeah.
speaker_heading: FATHER

speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You got an address?
scene_heading: EXT. MARCUS HOUSE -- BACK PORCH -- DAY
text: Jimmy sits on the deck. Sits by himself under the
text: clothesline stretched across the porch. Sits beneath the
text: flapping clothes. The sounds of the WAKE drift out as he
text: stares up at the sky.
text: Dave steps out. Unaware of Jimmy, he steps to the rail,
text: lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey, Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (turns; surprised)
dialog: Hey, Jimmy. Sorry. Came out for a smoke.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, no, man. Sit down.
text: Dave sits down alongside Jimmy, backs to the siding.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I haven't had a chance to talk to you all
dialog: day. How you doing?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How you doing?
text: Jimmy shrugs. He sees that Dave's right hand is swollen.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What happened to your hand?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This? I was helping a buddy move a couch.
text: Slammed it into the doorjamb.
text: Jimmy tilts his head, looks at the badly-scraped
text: knuckles, the bruised flesh between the fingers.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: The ways you can manage to hurt yourself,
dialog: right?
text: Jimmy looks into his face, forgets his hand.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It's good to see you, man.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How are our girls holding up?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: They're okay, I guess.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Celeste is a godsend. Thank her for me,
dialog: okay?
text: Dave nods. They sit there in silence a moment.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's nice. Just sitting here.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Jimmy jerks a thumb over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I couldn't take it anymore. Trying to
dialog: find room in the fridge for all the food
dialog: we're going to be throwing out in a few
dialog: days.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's a lot of waste, huh?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But I can't let the things that happen
dialog: the next few days get fucked up. Because
dialog: then that's all anyone'll remember about
dialog: her. Because, Katie, man, one thing you
dialog: could say about her since she was little,
dialog: that girl was neat.
text: Dave looks like he's going to cry out of sympathy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
text: That first night out of the joint, after
dialog: Marita died, I was more afraid of my
dialog: little daughter than I ever was of being
dialog: in prison. Fuck...
text: Dave looks pained as the tears roll down Jimmy's cheeks.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I loved her the most, because when we sat
dialog: in the kitchen that first night, we were
dialog: the last two people on Earth. Forgotten
dialog: and unwanted. And, Dave, I swear, it's
dialog: starting to piss me off. I haven't cried
dialog: yet for her. My own daughter and I can't
dialog: even cry. Fuck...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jim?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You're crying now.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (realizing) )
dialog: Damn...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Want me to leave you alone?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, Dave. Just sit here a minute if
dialog: that's cool.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sure, Jim. That's cool.

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT -- ESTHER HARRIS

speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: When was the last time you saw Katie
dialog: Marcus?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You don't think I hurt her, do you?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: She isn't hurt, Brendan, she's dead.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I didn't kill her.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: So again, when's the last time you saw
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Friday night. About, like, eight or so?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: About like eight, Brendan, or at eight?
text: If it's settled in Jimmy's stomach, it's settled in
text: Brendan's whole body.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: About eight. We had a couple of slices at
dialog: Hi-Fi. Then she had to go meet Eve and
dialog: Diane.
text: Brendan looks down. Esther crushes out her cigarette in a
text: pile in the ashtray. Something still burns, a thin stream
text: of smoke, corkscrewing up. As she lights another.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Brendan, Jimmy Marcus doesn't like you.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't know. But he told Katie he never
dialog: wanted her seeing me or any other Harris.
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: What? That thief thinks he's better than
dialog: this family?
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: He's not a thief.
speaker_heading: ESTHER
text: He was a thief. Scumbag burglar. Daughter
dialog: probably had the same bad gene. Count
dialog: yourself lucky, Brea.
text: Brendan withers under the harsh words.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Katie had brochures for Las Vegas. We
dialog: heard she was going there. With you.
text: As Esther rolls her eyes at the thought, Brendan nods his
text: head. Yes. Esther flinches.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: We were going to leave today. Get married
dialog: when we got there.
text: Brendan wipes the tears before they can fall.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, that was the plan, right?
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: You were going to leave me? Without a
dialog: word?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Ma, I --
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: Just like your father. Huh?
text: At that moment, the front door opens and Silent Ray and
text: his friend JOHN O'SHEA enter, skateboards under their

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: This is my brother Ray and his friend
dialog: John.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Hey, boys.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey.
text: Ray doesn't respond.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: He don't speak. Father couldn't shut up,
dialog: but his son is a mute. Oh, yeah, life's
dialog: fucking fair.
text: Ray's hands fly at Brendan and Brendan nods back.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah, they're here about Katie. Go watch
dialog: TV or something.
text: As the boys ramble out.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Where were you between twelve-thirty and
dialog: two this morning?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Asleep.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: I can confirm he closed his door at ten
dialog: and showed up for breakfast at nine. I
dialog: can't confirm he didn't climb out the
text: window and down the fire escape.
text: Brendan just stares at the floor.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Brendan, we're going to ask you to take a
dialog: polygraph. You up for that?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (nods; then)
dialog: I loved her so much. I, I won't ever feel
dialog: that again. I mean, it doesn't happen
dialog: twice, right?
text: He looks up, pain in his eyes you want to duck from.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It doesn't happen once, most cases.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: It's quiet. Sounds like the crowd is gone. Celeste tidies
text: in the kitchen. Busy work really. Wiping down the

text: Jimmy enters, is surprised to see her.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What are you still doing here?
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: I convinced her to take a pill. Girls are
text: asleep, too.
text: Jimmy's in here for a reason. He pours himself a shot of
text: whiskey. Celeste watches him. With a wry smile.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Could I get one of those?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: For the road. Then home.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I can stay over if you want. Sit up with
text: Annabeth if she wakes up.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. You've done enough.
text: Jimmy hands her her shot, raises his.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: To you and Dave. For being here for us.
text: They knock back their shots. Celeste sets her glass down.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I'll come by tomorrow. First thing.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Good night.

text: pour another shot, decides not to. As he screws the cap
dialog: back on --

scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Sean sits on the sofa looking through a shoe box of old

dialog: were kids.
text: As he stares, BLEED IN the sound of KIDS LAUGHING, the
text: sound of a CAR ROLLING, STOPPING. The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hello?
text: No answer. A FLASH of a WOMAN'S HAND on the other end.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Christ. Say something, Lauren.
text: He waits, thumbs a picture of his wife. Finally:
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm tired of wishing things made sense.
text: Tired of caring about one dead girl
dialog: because there'll be another one after
dialog: her. And sending killers to jail is just
dialog: sending them home. To the place they've
dialog: been heading all their dumb, pathetic
text: lives. And the dead are still dead.
text: No response. Sean squeezes his eyes shut.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, I can't do this tonight. I can't
dialog: do it.

scene_heading: INT. BOYLE APARTMENT -- MICHAEL BOYLE -- NIGHT

dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Because sometimes the man wasn't a man at
dialog: all. He was the boy. The boy who'd
text: escaped from wolves. An animal of the
text: dusk. Invisible. Silent. Living in a
dialog: world others never saw, a world of
text: fireflies. Unseen except as a flare in
dialog: the corner of your eye. Vanished by the
dialog: time you turned your head toward it.'
scene_heading: FLASHBACK -- WOODS
text: Young Dave runs through the trees. Escaping. Looking like
text: a boy, but sounding like an animal.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Dave looks over at Michael who's now fully asleep. Dave
dialog: continues,
text: softer now, even more to himself.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I just need to get my head right. Catch a
dialog: nice long sleep and the boy will go back
text: to his forest. Back to his fireflies.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Is he asleep?
text: Dave looks up, sees Celeste in the doorway. Dave nods,
text: joins Celeste in...
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How's Jimmy and everybody?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's weird, took something like this for

speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: There's still nothing in the paper, Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: About what?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
dialog: hurt the guy as bad as I thought. And he
dialog: was a mugger; he's not going to the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Right. Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it? I
dialog: mean, Katie Marcus is dead, and that

speaker_heading: KATIE (V.0.)
dialog: Later, Daddy...
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: JIMMY (V.O.)
dialog: I know in my soul I contributed to your

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)

text: He finds it, hands Sean a list of about 100 names.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: Could be.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: He'd be a guy to talk to. He knows you,
dialog: won't treat us like cops, clam up for no
dialog: good reason.
scene_heading: EXT. THREE-DECKER (EAST BUCKINGHAM) -- DAY
text: The door opens and Dave starts down the front steps with
text: Michael. He stops short as a black unmarked pulls up.
text: Sean and Whitey get out. Sean recognizes Dave.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Dave Boyle. What's it been? Seven, eight
dialog: years?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, Sean.
text: Stepping forward, Sean shakes his hand. Dave grimaces.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my son. Michael.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey, Michael. I'm Sean, an old buddy of
dialog: your dad.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You still with the Staties?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah. Homicide now. Actually, this is my
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Sergeant Powers. How you doing?
text: Whitey sticks out his hand. Dave shakes it, again trying
dialog: not to wince.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Dave, you got a minute, we'd love to ask
dialog: you a couple quick questions.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Actually, I got to walk Michael to
dialog: school, but I could be back in a few
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Tell you what, we'll walk with you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Uh, sure.
text: They start walking.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I hear rents are rising.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: They cut my dad's old house up into
dialog: condos.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Me and Michael walked by there the other
dialog: day. There's got to be a way to stop
dialog: them. Friend of mine said the other day,
dialog: Sean, he said, what this neighborhood
dialog: needs is a good fucking crime wave.
dialog: That'd send property values back where
dialog: they belong.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Girls keep getting murdered in Pen Park,
dialog: Mr. Boyle; you might get your wish.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dave. Call me Dave.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You said the 'f' word, Dad.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Walk up on ahead, Michael. Us guys have
dialog: to talk.
text: Michael sighs, takes a few steps ahead.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's up, Sean?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You heard about Katie Marcus?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah. I was at Jimmy's all day yesterday.
dialog: Celeste's there now.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Who's Celeste?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: My wife.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How's Jimmy doing?
dialog: Dave's getting a bit frazzled with all the little
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hard to tell. You know him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The reason we came by --
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I saw her. Katie. I don't know if you
dialog: know that. At McGill's. The night she
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Well, yeah, Dave, that's why we're here.
text: They were at a couple of bars that night.
dialog: Your name showed up on a list of people
dialog: who were in McGill's.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We hear she and her friends put on quite
text: a show. Dancing on the bar. They were
dialog: pretty drunk, huh?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, but it was harmless. They weren't
dialog: stripping or nothing. They were just,
dialog: nineteen, you know?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What time did they leave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I left at one. They left maybe fifteen
dialog: minutes before me.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: So we'll say twelve-forty-five?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sounds about right.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You see anything unusual that night?
dialog: Anyone?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Guy watching the girls? Guy with black
dialog: hate in his eyes? Woman hater?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. If they hadn't danced on the bar, it
dialog: would've been business as usual, you
dialog: know?
text: Sean nods. They've reached the school.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: See you later, Dad.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Got your milk money?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Michael runs off to join his friends. An odd moment as
text: Dave watches the laughing, happy kids.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: God, I hated school.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Huh? Yeah, me, too.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: I forgot to ask, sir. Where'd you go
dialog: after you left McGill's?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Uh, home.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Home by one-fifteen would you say?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Roughly. Sure.
text: An almost embarrassed silence until...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Good seeing you, Dave. Grab a beer
dialog: sometime?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, Sean, I'd like that.
text: Sean and Whitey start back down the sidewalk. Dave
text: watches them go. Sean waves once over his shoulder and
text: Dave finds himself waving back even though Sean can't see
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. STARBUCK'S -- DAY
text: Whitey and Sean exit with coffee.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Starbuck's. You believe this crap? Same
dialog: as Dunkin' Donuts, except five times the
dialog: price.
text: As they sip, something else is really bothering them.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You take away money or love or hate as
dialog: possible motives, you're not left with
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If this Marcus thing was random, I mean,
dialog: shit...
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Tell me about it. But the old lady,
text: Prior, she didn't hear a scream. She
dialog: heard a gunshot, and before that, a 'hi.
dialog: Which means either the Marcus girl is
dialog: pretty goddamn friendly or she knew him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: But she didn't just stop. She turns into
dialog: the curb. Not too fast or she would've
text: hopped it. Foot comes off the clutch, she
dialog: stalls.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: She says hi, guy shoots her.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: She slams her door into him, makes a run
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: But what makes her swerve without hitting
dialog: the brakes?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Something in the road.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Maybe. Look, Marcus girl couldn't have
dialog: weighed more than one-ten. How hard could
dialog: she have hit the guy to get a head start
dialog: into the park?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Either he wasn't back on his heels or, he
dialog: doesn't weigh so much himself.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: Which explains the footprints. Three of
dialog: hers. None of his.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It did rain... Brendan Harris couldn't be
dialog: much more than one-fifty.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You honestly think that kid has it in
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Your pal, Dave, though. He's a slim guy.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How'd we get to him?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We're getting to him now.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Whitey, he's just a guy who was in the
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: The last place she went, Sean, the last
dialog: place. There's something wrong about that
dialog: guy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you see his hand?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah... You seriously want to take a look
dialog: at Dave Boyle?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Just a little one.
scene_heading: EXT. REED & SONS FUNERAL HOME -- DAY
text: Jimmy gets out of his car, walks around and pops the
text: trunk. He pulls out a dress wrapped in plastic film. As
text: he heads for the entrance...
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. REED & SONS FUNERAL HOME -- OFFICE -- DAY
text: One of the "SONS" sits across the desk from Jimmy. The
text: dress is draped over the chair beside him. The Son fills
text: out a form with a gold pen. Jimmy looks far away.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: I'd suggest two sets of visiting hours.
dialog: From three to five and then seven to
dialog: nine.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah, that's fine.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Good. Have you thought about flowers?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Good. And the notice?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The notice?
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Yes. The obituary. We can take care of it
dialog: if you'll just give us the basic
dialog: information.
text: Jimmy reaches out, straightens a fold in the dress.
speaker_heading: SON (CONT'D)
dialog: If you'd prefer donations in lieu of
dialog: flowers, things like that. I can --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (looks over)
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: My daughter.
speaker_heading: SON
text: Um, downstairs. In the basement.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'd like to see her.
dialog: 64.
text: The Son blinks back at Jimmy, looks a little unnerved.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME -- BASEMENT -- KATIE MARCUS -- DAY
text: lying on a stainless steel table, a sheet pulled up under
text: her chin. Her hair clean and combed, her face dusted with
text: makeup. Eyes closed, but no longer clenched tight.
text: The Son stands in the doorway, shifting nervously as
text: Jimmy steps up, stands over his daughter.
text: Jimmy gets down on his haunches, his eyes even with
text: Katie's face. He rests his chin on his forearm, looks at
text: his daughter a long moment. Finally, softly, gently:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm going to kill him, Katie. I'm going
dialog: to find him before the police do and I'm
text: going to kill him.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Did you say something, Mr. Marcus?
text: Jimmy answers without looking back.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The notice. It should read: ‘Katherine
dialog: Marcus, beloved daughter of James and
dialog: Marita, deceased, stepdaughter of
text: Annabeth, and sister to Sara and Nadine.
text: As the gold pen flies in the Son's hand...
scene_heading: EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE/BUCKINGHAM AVENUE -- DAY
text: Whitey and Sean get out of their car. At the same moment,
text: Dave is exiting. He stops short, forces a smile.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You guys again?
text: Whitey's smile isn't as forced.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We're like two bad pennies.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You dropping in on Jimmy?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Did you have some kind of, what, break in
dialog: the case?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Just paying our respects. Where you off
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.
dialog: I'm going to get some. See you in a
dialog: minute.
text: As Dave moves past them, Whitey does his best Columbo.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What happened to your hand, by the way?
text: Dave stops short, manages a twisted grin.
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW Celeste looking down
text: on them, listening.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Huh? Oh, garbage disposal. It was jammed
dialog: and I stuck my hand down there. Then it
dialog: started up again. Stupid, huh?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Painful.
speaker_heading: PORCH
text: Dave nods, continues on his way. Whitey
text: and Sean watch him.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Garbage disposal. Bullshit.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, well, it doesn't mean he killed
dialog: anybody either. Come on.
text: As they start up the stairs...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
text: Her breath starts to come in heaves. She looks like a
text: bird in a cage.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS HOME -- ENTRYWAY -- DAY
text: As Annabeth answers the door to reveal Sean and Whitey.
text: Sean holds out a cigarette, smiles.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Heard you could use one.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: (takes it)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Sean scrapes his lighter to life. As she leans in:
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I quit ten years ago. You believe this?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey, whatever you need right now.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Yeah... come in, I'll get Jimmy.
text: As they start down the hall, Celeste is headed out the
text: other way. In a hurry.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Got a couple errands I gotta run. Be back
dialog: in an hour or so.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: You don't have to come back, Celeste.
dialog: I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Celeste Boyle?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sean Devine. I'm a friend of Dave's. From
dialog: way back.
text: He sticks out his hand. She shakes it reluctantly.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Nice to meet you. Well, I gotta go.
dialog: 67.
text: She squeezes past down the hall, headed for the door.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Bye-bye.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Bye.
text: And she's out the door. As Annabeth continues forward.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Damnit.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What?
text: A look passes between them.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Better go get it.
text: As Sean heads off after Celeste...
scene_heading: EXT. MARCUS HOME -- FRONT PORCH -- DAY
text: As Celeste steps out, Sean is right behind her.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Celeste...
text: She looks back in pure terror.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Could I ask you a quick question?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What time did Dave come home on Saturday
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It's a little thing. We need to run
dialog: timelines on anything involving Katie.
dialog: I'm sure Dave told you he saw her at
text: McGill's on Saturday night.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You think Dave killed Katie?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I didn't say that, Celeste. Hell, why
dialog: would I even think it?
text: Celeste tries to laugh it off.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We could figure what time she was on the
dialog: road if we knew what time Dave got home.
dialog: That's all. It's five minutes from
dialog: McGill's to your place, Katie left
dialog: fifteen minutes before Dave did. See what
dialog: I mean?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I was asleep.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Saturday night, when Dave got home. I was
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh... Well, thanks anyway.
text: As she hurries off...
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS KITCHEN -- JIMMY MARCUS -- DAY
text: looking as hard as we've seen him look.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Bullshit.
text: He's sitting at the kitchen table with Annabeth and
text: across from Sean and Whitey.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No. He was dating Katie, Jim. They were
dialog: going to elope to Las Vegas. We found
dialog: reservations under their names with
dialog: United.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Brendan Harris confirmed it.
text: Jimmy shakes his head, trying to understand.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Remember what you said? How she looked at
dialog: you for a few seconds on Saturday? Like
dialog: she was preparing to never see you again?
text: Jimmy drills Sean with a look.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You're a hundred percent positive?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: He passed a poly with flying colors.
dialog: Plus, he seemed, to me, like he really
dialog: loved her.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fuck...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Jimmy, I'm just curious, man. Why are you
dialog: so dead set against the kid? He said
dialog: Katie told him you'd disown her if she
dialog: ever dated a Harris.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I knew his father. They called him ‘Just
dialog: Ray.'
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: There were so many guys named Ray in the
dialog: neighborhood. Crazy Ray Bucheck, Psycho
dialog: Ray Dorian. Ray Harris got stuck with
dialog: Just Ray because all the cool nicknames
dialog: had been taken.
dialog: (big sigh)
dialog: Anyhow, we never got along too good. I
dialog: flat-out didn't like him.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: And then he cut out on his wife when she
dialog: was pregnant with that mute kidof hers
dialog: so, I don't know, I figure theapple
dialog: doesn't fall far from the tree and I
dialog: don't want Brendan or any other Harris
dialog: seeing Katie or any other daughter I got.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I don't believe we're talking about Just
dialog: Ray Harris.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: How about this, Mr. Marcus. We've been
text: talking to witnesses, canvassing people
dialog: who might've been in the bars and we've
dialog: run into more than a few people, who were
dialog: questioned before us by one or more of
dialog: the Savage brothers.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So the Savage brothers are not policemen,
dialog: Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Some people won't talk to the police.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Just so we're clear, and with all due
dialog: respect, this is our case.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: How long what?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How long would you say till you put
dialog: Katie's killer in jail? I need to know.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Are you bargaining with us?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Bargaining?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Are you giving us a deadline?
dialog: (off no answer)
dialog: We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Marcus. If
dialog: that's okay?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Find her killer, Sergeant. I'm not
dialog: standing in your way.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. STATE POLICE BARRACKS -- DAY
text: Sean and Whitey head in, both feeling the effects of a
text: long day. We walk and talk them inside.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: About the last thing we need right now
dialog: are Marcus and the Savage brothers
dialog: putting the fear of God into the
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Those brothers, man. We grew up terrified
text: of them. Eleven months apart. Like they
dialog: were running a loose cannon factory.
text: They're interrupted by a LAB TECH.
speaker_heading: LAB TECH
dialog: Hey, guys, ballistics are in on the
dialog: Marcus murder.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah? Got a match?
speaker_heading: LAB TECH
dialog: Uh huh. You're gonna fucking love it.
scene_heading: INT. STATE POLICE BARRACKS -- LAB -- DAY
text: A split-screen shows the grooves cut into two bullets.
speaker_heading: LAB TECH
dialog: It's a perfect match. Gun was a .38
text: Smith. Part of a lot stolen from a gun
dialog: dealer in New Hampshire in 1982. The same
dialog: gun that killed Katherine Marcus was used
text: in a liquor store holdup in '84. Right in
dialog: Buckingham.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The Flats?
speaker_heading: LAB TECH
dialog: Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
text: I pulled the file. It was a two-man job.

speaker_heading: LAB TECH (CONT'D)

dialog: That's where the bullet got pulled.
scene_heading: EXT. PEN CHANNEL -- NIGHT
text: Ugly even in moonlight, the sluggish current lapping
text: toward the harbor locks.
text: Celeste sits in her car, parked against the rotted
text: pilings, staring out across the channel at Pen Park
text: beyond. East Bucky rises like a landfill beyond, but
text: Celeste's eyes fall somewhere in-between.
text: On the silhouette of the derelict drive-in movie screen.
text: Celeste's eyes are red. She's been crying. And she looks
dialog: like she wants to die.
scene_heading: INT. HARRIS APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Celeste isn't the only one who's desolate tonight.
text: Brendan Harris sits on the floor, his back against the
text: wall. He stares at the bulging suitcase stowed just under
dialog: his bed. He's never going to Las Vegas now. Least not
dialog: with Katie.
text: Finally, he closes his eyes, drops his chin to his chest
dialog: and rocks a bit. Something comforting in that.
text: The door opens as Silent Ray enters. Wearing his
text: rollerblades, using his hockey stick as a staff. As he
text: wobbles over and site on the bed, Brendan stands, wipes
text: the tears from his face. Ray "signs" something to his
dialog: brother.
text: Ray "signs" again. Brendan gets angry.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Mom said that? That I'm better off?
text: Ray "signs" something. Brendan gets in his brother's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I loved her. You know what that's like?
dialog: Huh?
text: Ray recoils, shakes his head. Brendan turns away,
dialog: ashamed.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry...
dialog: 73.
text: Ray taps on the bedpost so that Brendan will look back
text: over. Then he "signs" a final time.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, you're wrong. I won't feel it again.
dialog: Not ever.
scene_heading: INT. LOONEY LIQUORS -- NIGHT
text: Feisty LOWELL LOONEY, about 80 years old, points up at a

speaker_heading: LOWELL

text: Sean and Whitey stand across from him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Scary, huh?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Scarier than a glass of milk maybe.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Take me through it. So these two guys...
speaker_heading: LOWELL
text: In rubber masks. Came through there.
text: Lowell points back at a doorway covered by a black
dialog: curtain.
speaker_heading: LOWELL (CONT'D)
text: That's the storeroom. There's another
text: door back there that leads to a loading
dialog: dock. I always keep it locked so they
dialog: must've had a key.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: A key? You think it was an inside job?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
text: Had to be. One of them, at least, worked
dialog: for me at some point. Only reason they
dialog: fired that warning round was because they
dialog: must've known I kept this under the
dialog: counter.
text: Lowell pulls out a sawed-off shotgun.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And you told the police that at the time?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Oh, sure. They went through my employment
dialog: records. Questioned everyone who used to
dialog: work for me. Never made an arrest.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You still have those employment records?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Somewhere in a box in the back. But I can
dialog: tell you who did it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Guy I fired about two weeks before.
dialog: Sonuvabitch came in a few days after the
dialog: robbery. Had this fucking goddamn grin on
dialog: his face. And I just knew. But tell a
dialog: grin to a jury, right?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You remember his name?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: I look senile to you? Name was Ray
dialog: Harris. They used to call him Just Ray.
text: Sean and Whitey look at each other.
speaker_heading: LOWELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You say the same gun was used in another

speaker_heading: CELESTE

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: CELESTE

text: Celeste wants to run screaming, but...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: They're undead, but I think maybe there's
dialog: something beautiful about it. Maybe one
dialog: day you wake up and you forget. What it's
dialog: like to be human. Maybe then it's okay.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What the fuck are you talking about,
dialog: Dave?
text: Dave looks back at her, smiles a dark smile.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (looks away)
dialog: I don't -- Where'd you come up with that?
speaker_heading: DAVE

text: I don't think anything. I'm confused.
dialog: Even your friend Sean --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: He's not my friend. Case you haven't
dialog: figured that out yet.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: He asked me about you. What time you got
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What did you tell him?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I said I was asleep.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Good thinking, baby.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Christ, Dave! Just tell them about the
dialog: mugger! Please...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The mugger. I see how your mind's
dialog: working. I do. I come home with blood on
dialog: me the same night Katie's murdered. I
dialog: must have killed her.
dialog: 77.
text: Celeste just looks at him. Horrified. And Dave starts to
text: laugh. Laughs hysterically. Celeste is horrified. She
text: opens her mouth to say something, but nothing comes out.
text: Finally, as Dave's laughter starts to trail...
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha... Henry.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What? Henry?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Henry and George, Celeste. I never told
dialog: anyone before, but those were their
dialog: names. Isn't that fucking hilarious? At
dialog: least that's what they called themselves.
dialog: But they were wolves and Dave, Dave was
text: the boy who escaped from wolves.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm talking Henry and George. They took
dialog: me for a four-day ride. And they buried
dialog: me in this ratty old cellar with a
dialog: sleeping bag, and, man, Celeste, did they
dialog: have their fun. And no one came to help
dialog: old Dave then. Dave had to pretend to be
text: someone else.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You mean all those years ago? When you
dialog: were a boy?
dialog: (touches him)
dialog: Dave...
text: Dave jerks away from her touch.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dave's dead. I don't know who came out of
dialog: that cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't
dialog: Dave!
dialog: (calms )
dialog: The thing is, it's like vampires, once
dialog: it's in you, it stays.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What stays?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Did you know there were child prostitutes
dialog: in Rome Basin?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.
dialog: I'm warning you. I can't trust my mind.
dialog: It's official: Celeste has never been more afraid in her
dialog: whole life.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going out. I just need to get my head
dialog: around it.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Okay...
text: And then he goes. HOLD ON Celeste. As the front DOOR
text: CLICKS shut, it might as well be a gunshot.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE BARRACKS -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
text: As they pull up across from Sean's car. Another long day
dialog: by the boards.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I just think the gun sends us in a
dialog: different direction.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: I don't see it that way.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What does Just Ray Harris's gun have to
dialog: do with Dave Boyle?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You know how these things get passed
dialog: around. Just Ray Harris may have blown
text: town, but his gun never did.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I say we talk to Brendan Harris again.
dialog: First thing in the morning.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story?
dialog: Huh? And the wife's definitely scared.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: They're hiding something, but Dave's
dialog: about as much a killer as I guess Brendan
dialog: Harris is.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Boyle fits the profile a fucking T.
text: White, mid-30a, marginally employed,
dialog: sexually abused as a kid. You serious? On
dialog: paper the guy should be in jail already.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No, Katie Marcus was not sexually abused.
dialog: In that equation, sexual emission is part
dialog: of the deal.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You were friends when you were kids.
dialog: You're a fucking liability.
text: Sean takes offense.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He's not my friend. Turns out you're
dialog: right? I'll have my cuffs off my hip
dialog: faster than yours.
scene_heading: EXT. MARCUS HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Jimmy sits on the front porch, thinking. He looks up at
text: someone walking down the sidewalk. It's Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You're out late.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You, too.
text: Jimmy nods. It is what it is. Dave leans against the
text: porch, looks about.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice night, huh?
dialog: The words
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I guess... I started sitting out here the
dialog: last few years. Waiting for Katie to come
dialog: home, you know? It would get to be
dialog: midnight and I'd tell Annabeth 'I think
dialog: I'll go sit on the porch for awhile.
dialog: Weird thing was, it always seemed to
dialog: bring her home.
text: sit out there for a beat.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I saw her, you know.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You saw Katie Saturday night?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Never got around to telling you.
text: Jimmy's eager for some final word on his daughter.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You talk to her?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. I just nodded hello at one point.
dialog: Next time I looked up she was gone.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: She looked...happy.
text: Jimmy nods, wipes an unexpected tear from his eye.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Got some more walking to do. Good night.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 81.
text: Dave continues on his way.
scene_heading: INT. STATE POLICE BARRACKS -- HOMICIDE PEN -- DAY
text: Incredulity as Sean stares at Whitey.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You stole his car?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: (smiling)
text: His car was officially towed.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: From the front of his house?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: Oh no. The car was found abandoned in
text: Rome Basin along the parkway. Lucky for
dialog: us the parkway's state jurisdiction. Some
dialog: kids must've jacked it, took it for a
dialog: joyride.
text: Getting angry, Sean lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why'd you do it?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: After I dropped you off last night, I
dialog: decided to talk to Boyle myself. Put a
dialog: little fear in him. When I got to the
dialog: house, I looked in his car, just to see
dialog: what he had in there.
text: Sean's shaking his head, not really listening until:
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I found blood.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot
dialog: more. Type O. Same as Katie Marcus.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Wait a minute. Katie Marcus never got in
text: anyone's trunk. She stalled her car, got
text: chased through the park until she died in
dialog: the park.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: I think it's enough to ask the man a few
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: For what? Your search of the cars's going
dialog: to get tossed out.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: No. Stolen and abandoned in state
dialog: jurisdiction. For insurance purposes and
dialog: in the best interest of the owner --
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You did a physical search and filed a
dialog: report.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Bingo. Now do you want to talk to him or
dialog: should I send him home?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Dave's here?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Been sitting in the box for an hour. I
dialog: had two of my ugliest troopers pick him
dialog: up first thing.
text: Hand slamming down on Plymouth roofs. Fists pounding on
text: bulkheads. Feet on the cellar steps. BANG! BANG!
scene_heading: INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY
text: Dave sits looking hung-over, annoyed and pissed at Sean
text: in particular. Sean leans back by the door. Whitey sits
text: in the other chair across from Dave.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Look, Mr. Boyle, we know you didn't get
dialog: that swollen hand sticking it down a
dialog: garbage disposal.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah? How do you know that?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Why's your wife acting like she's afraid
dialog: of you? Huh? She know what really
dialog: happened to your hand?
dialog: This is a cooler, tougher Dave than we've seen before.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How about a Sprite or something?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Tell us what really happened Saturday
dialog: night, Mr. Boyle.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I already did.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You lied.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Your opinion. Which I guess you're
dialog: entitled to.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: You think this is funny?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over, and
dialog: not only was my car stolen, but now
dialog: you're telling me you won't release it to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Tell us how the blood got in your car.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What blood?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Let's start with the front seat.
text: Dave finally looks a little rattled. He looks to Sean.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You think I could get that Sprite, Sean?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 84.
text: As Sean reaches for the door, Dave smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I get it. You're the good cop. How about
dialog: a meatball sub while you're at it?
text: Any signs of being rattled are gone. Is Dave playing
text: them? Sean lets go of the doorknob, leans back to where
dialog: he was.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Ain't your bitch, Dave. Looks like you'll
dialog: have to wait.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You're somebody's bitch, though. Aren't
dialog: you, Sean?
text: There's a crazy leer in Dave's eyes, a preening
dialog: cockiness.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The blood on your front seat, Dave.
dialog: Answer the Sergeant.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We got a chain-link fence in our back
dialog: yard. Me and my kid play Whiffle ball
dialog: every afternoon after school and he's
dialog: getting pretty good. Most of the balls
dialog: are on the other side of the fence. So I
text: climb it. Except I slip on the top and
dialog: slice myself where the links curl in.
dialog: (pats his ribs)
text: Right here. Bled like hell. Ten minutes
dialog: later, I had to pick up Michael. It was
dialog: probably still bleeding when I got in the
dialog: seat. Best I can figure.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: And what blood type are you?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: B negative.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (SMILES)
dialog: Hey, that's the match we got.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, there you go.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: Not quite. The blood in the trunk was not
dialog: B negative.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I don't know anything about any blood in
dialog: my trunk.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: No idea how a half pint of blood got in
dialog: your trunk?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: This is not the way you want to go, Dave.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: How's it going to look in court? You
dialog: don't know how someone else's blood got
dialog: in your trunk.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Fine, I suppose. You filed the report.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What report?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: The stolen car report.
text: Whitey and Sean both get the same sinking feeling.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: The car wasn't in my possession last
dialog: night. Whatever the car thieves used it
dialog: for, you should find out. Because it
dialog: sounds like they were up to no good.
text: A long silence. Whitey's fucked. Sean looks at the floor,
text: shakes his head ever so slightly.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Things looking any better on that Sprite?
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION -- SIDE ROOM -- TWO WAY MIRROR -- DAY
text: Sean and Whitey now on this side. Dave still sitting on
dialog: the other.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You got too fucking smart. Car's
dialog: inadmissible. His lawyer can say anything
text: in it was put there by the car thieves.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: I can break him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Break him? He just kicked our asses in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Yeah. But you still think old buddy Dave
dialog: wouldn't hurt a fly?
text: A moment as they both think.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's the gun, Whitey. We bust this open
dialog: on that gun.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Maybe. Okay.
text: Sean looks through the two-way at Dave.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What about Dave?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Fuck it. Kick him loose.
scene_heading: EXT. HEADSTONE LOT (ADJACENT TO CEMETERY) -- DAY

text: Jimmy finally stops before one that is simple and white.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That one.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Very good. Nice and simple.
text: As the Salesman jots down some info, Val Savage arrives.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Hey, Jimmy.
text: Jimmy turns to see him. They step away from the Salesman.
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Been out asking around, like you said to.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Thanks, man.
text: Jimmy taps his fist into Val's. Val taps back.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: It ain't 'cause you did two years for me,
dialog: Jim. And it ain't 'cause I miss your
dialog: brain running things, either. Katie was
dialog: my niece, man.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Maybe not by birth or nothing, but I
dialog: loved her.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know, man. What's up?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Cops are all over this. Doing their job
text: for once. They're smothering the bars,
dialog: street trade, everything. Every hooker
dialog: I've talked to, every bartender, they've
dialog: already been questioned. I mean, the law
text: has descended.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What about just Ray's kid? You find out
dialog: anything there?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Kid's a mouse by all accounts. No trouble
dialog: to anyone. Eve and Diane said he loved
dialog: her, Jim. Said she loved him.
text: Jimmy stews on this a moment.
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Want me to take a run at him?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, no, Val. Hold off for the time being.
dialog: Anything else?
text: Val hesitates, holding something back.
dialog: Val waits

dialog: beyond.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You want to spit something. What is it?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I heard Sean and his fat-head partner
dialog: went by Dave Boyle's.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dave was at McGill's that night. They
dialog: probably questioned him like everyone
dialog: else.
dialog: a beat. That's not it.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I heard something else. This morning.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: VAL
text: Two Staties came by. In uniform.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Probably forgot to ask him something.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: No. They took Dave with them when they

scene_heading: INT. HOMICIDE PEN -- DAY

dialog: First child, Brendan Seamus born in 1983.
dialog: Same year Just Ray is indicted in a scam
dialog: to embezzle subway tokens. Charges
dialog: dropped, but he's fired. Worked odd jobs
dialog: after that, including clerk at Looney
dialog: Liquors. Questioned in that robbery,
dialog: questioned in another, same year;
dialog: Blanchard Liquors in Middlesex County.
dialog: Released on lack of evidence.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Beginning to become known though.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: He's getting popular. A known associate,
dialog: one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond in the
dialog: 1985 heist of a rare comic book
dialog: collection.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Comic books? You go, Raymond.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: A hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh, excuse me.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: Raymond returns said literature unharmed.
dialog: Does a year solid inside. Comes out of
dialog: prison with a wee chemical dependency
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But gets honest work to support the
dialog: habit, right?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
text: Apparently not. Picked up by a joint
dialog: Major Crime Unit/F.B.I. sting for
dialog: trafficking stolen goods across state
text: lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Our boy's got style.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: He's got a boatload of grief, too. Stole
dialog: the truck in Rhode Island, drove it into
dialog: Massachusetts.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hence the federal interstate rap.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Hence, they got him by the balls.
dialog: (flips page)
text: But he does no time. Not a day.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: He rolled on someone.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Looks that way. After that, nothing. He's
dialog: clean. Until August 1989. Poof, he
dialog: disappears.
dialog: They consider it all a beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: One, he's dead. Two, he's in Witness
dialog: Protection.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Three, he went deep underground then just
dialog: popped back in the neighborhood to kill
dialog: his son's 19-year-old girlfriend. I mean,
dialog: come on. We got nothing.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We got a guy who was a prime suspect in a
dialog: robbery eighteen years ago during which
text: the murder weapon was used. Guy's son
dialog: dated the victim. I'd say we got a lot.
text: Whitey flips through the file. Sean realizes something.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Anything in there about Just Ray's known
dialog: associates?

speaker_heading: WHITEY

speaker_heading: BURDEN
text: He didn't walk. He rolled. Boston

speaker_heading: BURDEN
dialog: What the fuck was the name?
dialog: (tries to remember )
text: Him and three other guys knocked off the

dialog: Jimmy Marcus. Kid was like nineteen or
dialog: twenty. Slick as hell, man. Ran a crew,
dialog: never got arrested.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Did Ray Harris testify in open court?
speaker_heading: BURDEN
text: Never made it to court. Marcus dummied up
dialog: on who he'd been working with. D.A. was
text: afraid he might not be able to convict.
dialog: So he cut a deal for two years inside,
text: couple more suspended.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So Jimmy Marcus never knew Ray Harris
dialog: ratted him out?
text: Burden looks at the two of them a beat, smiles.
speaker_heading: BURDEN

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What did he say happened?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: That he was mugged. That he bashed the
text: mugger's head on the street. That he
dialog: might've killed him. But there was
dialog: nothing in the paper.
text: Tears start to run down her face. She presses her

text: As he moves off...
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We were talking about your father’s gun.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I guess we were misinformed. You talk to
dialog: your father much?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Never. Said he was going out for a drink
dialog: and he never came back.
text: Brendan looks like he's in pain.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Your mother never filed a missing persons
dialog: report. How came?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Because he isn't missing. He sends money
dialog: every month.
text: Sean and Whitey exchange a surprised look.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: He sends money?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Five hundred dollars, every month. Like
text: clockwork.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: From where?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Postmark says Brooklyn.
text: Whitey picks up a pad of paper, starts to scribble.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How do you know it's him?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Who else would send it? My mom says
dialog: that's how he was. Do something shitty
dialog: then try to make up for it.
text: Whitey hands Sean the pad. It’s years times months times
text: $500. The underlined answer is $80,000.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why you asking me if my father had a gun?
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You know why, kid.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No, I don't.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The gun that killed your girlfriend was
dialog: the same gun your father used in a
dialog: robbery eighteen years ago.
text: Something dark starts working through Brendan's brain.
text: Some new and sudden knowledge. Sean sees it.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to tell me about it?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: My father didn't have a gun.
text: Sean slaps the desktop, jerking Whitey to attention.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You are fucking lying!
text: But Brendan doesn't react. He's gone somewhere else.
text: Somewhere grim and hard.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Can I go now? Or are you gonna charge me
dialog: with Katie's murder?
scene_heading: EXT. CRESCENT AVENUE -- DAVE BOYLE -- DAY

scene_heading: FLASHBACK -— PLYMOUTH
text: Pulling up across from Young Dave before he can finish

dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Val Savage at the wheel. Dave's new best friend.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Dandy Dave Boyle, how they hanging,
dialog: brother?
text: Dave squats down to see Val eye-to-eye.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, Val? What're you up to?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I'm starving. Was looking for someone to
dialog: grab a bite to eat with, maybe a beer?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: What do you say? How about a boy's night
dialog: out in the middle of the day? We'll hit a
dialog: place I know across town.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'll have to get home at some point.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Don't we all. Come on, hop in.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: First round's mine.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Now you're talking!
text: And for the second time in his life, Dave gets inside a
text: CAR he shouldn't. As Val GUNS IT away...
scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S DESK -- DAY
text: Brendan's gone. Sean and Whitey are bleary, having huffed
text: and puffed through the contents of the cardboard box.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The kid was lying about the gun. Don't
dialog: you think?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Absolutely. Told you three times already.
dialog: What about the father? What do you think
dialog: about him?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I think, just possibly now, that Just Ray
text: is still alive.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Eighty grand. Who's going to send that if
dialog: it's not the father?
dialog: 99,
text: Sean sticks his head in his hands, groans in frustration.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go home. Have a drink. Let it go for
dialog: awhile.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: Sean looks into the box. All that's left is a cassette
text: tape. He pulls it out.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Anything good on the 9-1-1 call?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Thought you listened to it.
text: Sean sighs, sticks the tape into a player on his desk.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: 9-1-1, police services. What is the
dialog: nature of your emergency?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: There's like this car with blood in it
dialog: and, ah, the door's open --
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: What's the location of the car?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: Uh, Sydney Street in the Flats. By Pen
dialog: Park. Me and my friend found it.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Son, what's your name?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: (to someone else)
dialog: He wants to know her name.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Your name. What's your name?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: We're so fucking out of here. Good luck.
text: The connection breaks. Sean turns off the tape machine.
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: Well, that breaks the case wide open.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Let's at least get a burger.
text: Sean nods. Standing, he grabs his Glock and holster out
text: of his top drawer. They start out; Sean freezes.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Her.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: The kid on the tape.
text: Sean hits rewind, play.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Son, what's your name?
speaker_heading: BOY (V.O.)
dialog: He wants to know her name.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He said, ‘her name.'
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Right. Dead girl, you refer to her as a
dialog: she.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But how does the kid know that? She'd
dialog: dead in the park. How does he know the
text: blood in the car came from a woman.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Play it again.
scene_heading: INT. BAR (CHELSEA) -- SUNSET
text: A dive backed up against the river. A few old-timers, a
text: few pool tables. Dave and Val sit in a booth. There are
text: four empty shot glasses and a nearly empty pitcher of
dialog: beer.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: This one time back in the day, right? We
dialog: take off this stamp collector. Rob him,
dialog: tie him up and go. Me, my brother Nick
dialog: and this kid Carson Leverett who couldn't
dialog: tie his own fucking shoes if you didn't
dialog: show him.
dialog: 101.
dialog: Dave laughs; this is really funny.
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
text: So we're coming down the elevator and
dialog: we're wearing suits so we fit in. And
text: this old lady gets on and starts freaking
text: out. So I turn to Nick and he's looking
dialog: at Carson because the fucking bonehead's
text: still got his Ronald Reagan mask on.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And you guys didn't notice?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Little shit like that happened on jobs
dialog: all the time. That's why Jimmy was so
dialog: missed. He saw the whole field, man.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why do you think be went straight?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: One word pure and simple... Katie.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I like the night too much. Day's just
dialog: something you sleep through. Another
dialog: shot?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I should slow down. Till we eat.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Come on, don't go pussy on me.
text: Before Dave can answer, Val is on his way to the bar.
text: A passing headlight flashes white in Dave's face. As he
text: blinks, a silhouette comes through the door. As the door
text: shuts and Dave's vision clears, he realizes it's Jimmy.
text: Jimmy nods at Dave and then goes to Val at the bar. Says
text: something in his ear. Val looks back at Dave and nods.
text: The two of them head over carrying three shots and a
text: bottle. Jimmy sits in across from Dave while Val slides
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How's it going?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm a little drunk. You gain some weight?
dialog: You look bigger.
text: Jimmy smiles, passes out the shots.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: To our children.
text: They down the shots. Jimmy immediately pours another
dialog: round.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I always liked this bar.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. No one bothers you.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: That's important. No one bothering you in
dialog: this life. No one fucking with you or
dialog: your loved ones. Right, Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Absolutely.
dialog: It's the funniest thing Val ever heard.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: This guy's a hoot. He can get you going.
text: Jimmy smiles at Dave, but it's pure frost.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Oh yeah. My man, Dave.
scene_heading: INT. HARRIS APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Seething purpose, Brendan enters, pulls a kitchen chair
text: over to the butler's pantry. Standing on the chair, he
text: looks up a beat at the slatted ceiling.
text: He reaches up and presses with his right palm. A section
text: of slats lifts up and away revealing an opening in the
text: ceiling. Brendan looks up a beat, reaches into the black.
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: INSERT -- HIDING PLACE
text: Brendan's hand looks like it's playing an imaginary
text: keyboard as it bounces and gropes in the dust and wood
text: chips for something that is not there. His father's gun.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: As he realizes he's not going to find it.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No...
text: He returns the slat to its place, steps off the chair. He
text: brings the chair back to the kitchen table and site down
text: on it. Sits down so he's facing the door in the center of
text: the apartment. And as Brendan waits..
scene_heading: INT. BAR (CHELSEA) -- NIGHT
text: Dave's having trouble focusing. Jimmy and Val seem like
dialog: they've forgotten he's here.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Remember we took Ray Harris here that one
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sure. Good old Ray.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: He was a hoot, too. Most people called
dialog: him 'Just Ray,' but I called him Ray
text: Jingles.
text: As Dave tries to concentrate, Val leans into him.
speaker_heading: VAL (CONT'D)
dialog: This guy, right? He carried like ten
text: bucks in change in his pocket, in case he
dialog: had to make a phone call to Libya or some
dialog: fucking place.
text: Val laughs, lights a cigarette. As the smoke climbs up
text: into Dave's face, he looks across at Jimmy who watches
text: him with a flat, determined expression.
text: As Jimmy smiles, Dave swallows, takes a deep suck of air.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You all right?
dialog: 104.
text: Dave holds up a hand as it surges up inside him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh shit...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm going to be sick.
text: A flicker of a look between Val and Jimmy. Val slides
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Use the back door. Huey don't like
text: cleaning it off toilet rims.
text: Val grips Dave's shoulders, turns him and heads him off
text: for a door at the far end of the bar.
speaker_heading: DOOR
text: As Dave pushes through...
speaker_heading: DOOR
text: Bursting open. But, we're in...
scene_heading: INT. HARRIS APARTMENT
text: And Silent Ray is arriving home with John O'Shea in tow.
text: Brendan watches from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Hey, Ray. Come in here a second.
text: Ray comes in. John stops in the doorway holding a duffel
text: bag. Brendan pulls a second chair out with his foot.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sit down, Ray.
text: Ray catches a vibe, looks a little suspicious, but he
dialog: sits.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Who do you hate?
dialog: 105.
text: Ray stares back at him.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, who?
text: Ray "signs" an answer.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No one? Who do you love?
text: Ray looks down at his shoes, then up at Brendan. Finally,
text: he points a finger at his brother.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You love me?
dialog: (as Ray nods)
dialog: What about Ma?
text: Ray looks down again, shakes his head. "No."
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. You love me so much, I want to hear
dialog: you say it.
text: Ray looks back up, confused.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you can speak. So say you love me.
text: Ray looks back over his shoulder at John.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't look at him, look at me. Now say
dialog: it, say you love me.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR (CHELSEA) -- NIGHT
text: Out back. One light over the door. And we're TRACKING
text: BACK WITH Dave as he stumbles through the weeds. Drops to
text: his hands and knees at the edge of the Mystic River.
text: We're BACK BEHIND as he heaves, empties his stomach into
text: the dirty water. Finally, he lurches to his feet, wipes
text: his mouth with the back of his hand.
text: He takes a few deep breaths, feels better. And when Dave
text: finally turns around, Jimmy and Val are standing there.
text: One on either side of the door, the light bulb burning
text: between them. Dave grins.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, guys. Come to make sure I didn't
dialog: fall in?
scene_heading: INT. HARRIS APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Ray sitting across from Brendan, freaking out a little at
dialog: his brother's request.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Come on, say you love me.
text: Finally Ray stands, holding his middle finger in
text: Brendan's face and then turns to go.
text: Brendan is on him in a flash. He grabs Ray by the hair
text: and jerks him back. Ray flies over the kitchen table,
text: slams into the wall and hits the floor.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You love me so much you kill my fucking
dialog: girl friend?! Huh?
text: That gets John O'Shea moving. Motoring for the door. But
text: Brendan's all over him. Grabbing him by the scruff of the
text: neck, he bounces him off the door, spins him around.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: My brother never does anything without
dialog: you, O'Shea! Never!
text: Brendan punches him twice in the face, breaking his nose.
text: John hits the floor, curls into a ball spitting blood.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm coming back.
text: He kicks John, heads back for Ray who's just standing.
text: Brendan slaps him so hard he reels into the sink. Brendan
text: grabs him by the shirt. Tears and blood stream down Ray's
text: face. Brendan throws him to the floor.
text: Spreading Ray's arms, Brendan kneels on him.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Speak, you fucking freak or I swear I'll
dialog: kill you! Speak!
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: STAIRWELL
text: As Sean and Whitey enter. They freeze at:
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (0.S.)
dialog: Say her name! Katie! Say it or you die!
text: As they start hard up the steps.
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Ray shakes his head as Brendan looms. There's a LOUD
text: COUGH behind them. Brendan looks over his shoulder to see
text: John O'Shea on his feet, Ray Senior's gun in his hand.
dialog: Aimed.
text: But as the front door bursts open, John wheels, finds
text: himself pointing the .38 point blank at Sean. Sean's hand
text: is on his Glock, but it's still holstered.
text: He stops short; Whitey filling the door behind him. As
text: Sean blinks down the barrel... Whitey's eyes flicker past
text: to Brendan and Ray.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Kid, you need to point that gun at the
dialog: floor. Okay?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (re: Sean's gun)
dialog: That's a Glock, right?
text: Sean nods as time stands still and his life flashes.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: You wanna draw on me? Come on.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No. I don't want to hurt a kid. And it
text: looks like someone else beat me to it.
text: John remembers. Looks quite deadly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Brendan fucking punched me. Broke my
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: We'll arrest him for it if you want. Haul
dialog: his ass to jail.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't want him arrested. I want him
dialog: fucking dead.
text: As the .38 sweeps away back toward Brendan, Sean reaches
text: out, claps a hand over John's wrist. BOOM! The GUN
text: DISCHARGES into the wall as Sean strips it away, knocking
text: John to the floor.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Motherfucker.
text: Whitey kneels to cuff John who's now crying like a baby.
text: Sean walks forward toward Brendan. Brendan slides off his
text: brother, just sits on the floor looking up at Sean. Sean
text: shrugs, almost apologetically.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We know.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What? What do you know?
text: Sean looks back at John, down at Ray, then back to
text: Brendan. Sean finally shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. MYSTIC RIVER -- NIGHT
text: Jimmy puts his arm around Dave's shoulder, leads him
text: along the river. Val walks a few paces behind.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Let me tell you about Ray Harris. He was
dialog: a buddy of mine. Used to visit me in
dialog: prison. Used to check up on Marita and
dialog: Katie and my mother and see if they
dialog: needed anything. But he also put me in
dialog: prison. He ratted me off.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Shit. That's terrible.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: My wife had cancer.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I remember, man. I --
dialog: They stop.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ray Harris robbed me of being with her. I
dialog: know we all die alone, but I could have
dialog: helped her with the dying. Not the death,
dialog: but the dying. You see what I'm saying?
text: ‘Dave takes a half step away, faces Jimmy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why are you telling me this?
text: Jimmy points. Far below the Tobin Bridge, at a rotted
text: cluster of pilings, a small boat with an outboard motor
text: tied up.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I made Ray kneel down right over there
dialog: and I shot him twice. Once in the chest,
text: once in the throat. We were both crying
dialog: when I did it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, Jimmy, I don't --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: Ray begged. Pregnant wife.
dialog: Little Brendan. Said he knew me. Said I
dialog: was a good man... How about you, Dave? Do
dialog: you think I'm a good man?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What is it you think I did, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: As I sunk Ray in the river, I could feel
text: God watching me. Shaking his head. Not
dialog: mad, just, I guess the way you'd get when
dialog: a puppy shits on your rug.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You think I killed Katie, don't you?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don't talk, Dave.
text: Panic rising, Dave sees Val holds a gun in his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, no, no. I killed someone, but it
dialog: wasn't Katie.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Is this the mugger story?
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: He wasn't a mugger. He, he was a child
dialog: molester. He was having sex with this kid
dialog: in his car. He was a wolf; he was. a
dialog: vampire.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK -- PARKING LOT
dialog: The child prostitute we saw Dave try to talk to. Getting
text: into a car with a man. The kid's head disappears below
text: the dash. And then Dave is there.
text: Dave hauls the man from the car, his pants down around
text: his knees as Dave pounds his head on the pavement. The
text: boy jumps out the passenger side, runs away.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Of course, Dave, sure. You killed a child
dialog: molester.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, well, me and the boy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh, the molested kid helped you?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

scene_heading: FLASHBACK -- WOODS
text: Young Dave running but sounding like an animal.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, no, forget that. My head gets fucked
dialog: up sometimes. I --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Your wife thinks you killed Katie. And
dialog: you'd rather have her believe that than,
dialog: what, you killed a child molester? Most
dialog: people really don't mind when a child
dialog: molester dies, Dave. Why didn't you just
dialog: tell Celeste the truth?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I, I don't know. Maybe I thought I was
dialog: turning into him. I didn't kill Katie!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And I didn't hear of any dead guys being
dialog: found lately.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: I put him in the trunk of my car. Dumped
text: his body in the woods --
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Letting this bag of shit explain, Jim?
dialog: You kidding me?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Shut up, Val...

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Me and my son, me and Celeste, there's so

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Make them right now. Start now. Admit
dialog: what you did.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No more lies, no more secrets, I want to
dialog: go home to Celeste. I want to feel
dialog: Celeste.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. Good. Right after you do your time.
dialog: I did mine. Do yours. Admit what you did.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The boy...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: One more time about the boy and I will
dialog: open you up.
text: Jimmy holds a wicked-looking buck knife. Dave dry heaves.
text: Jimmy nearly does himself. Even Val looks confused as
text: Jimmy blinks out toward the river.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I was done. I thought I had
dialog: left killing people and dumping them in
text: the river behind.
dialog: (turns to Dave)
dialog: Admit what you did and you'll live. Say
dialog: it out loud and you'll breathe. You'll go
dialog: to jail, but I will give you your life.
text: Finally, Dave decides it's a way to save his life, maybe
dialog: even a way to ease Jimmy's grief.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I did it.
text: Jimmy closes his eyes, lowers the knife. Val can't
dialog: believe what he's watching.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That night in McGills, she reminded me of
dialog: a dream I've had.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What dream?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: A dream of youth. I don't remember having
dialog: one. And she was the dream of it, and I
dialog: just snapped.
text: Jimmy opens his eyes again. He's trembling.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So it was the dream, then?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The dream, yeah. You'd know what I mean.
dialog: If you'd got in that car instead of me.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (hardens )
dialog: But I didn't get in the car, Dave. You
dialog: did.
text: We're CLOSE ON them. And then Dave gets a funny look on
text: his face. A funny face and then he looks down.
text: Looks down in time to see Jimmy's hand pulling the knife
text: back from his guts. Blood gushes down onto Dave's jeans.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
text: Dave looks back at Jimmy, who turns, sends the knife
text: sailing into the Mystic. Jimmy looks back over.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We bury our sins here, Dave. We wash them
dialog: clean.
dialog: 114.
text: Dave suddenly drops, finds himself sitting in the tall
text: weeds. Hands trying to hold his guts in. He looks up,
text: watches as Val hands the gun to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: VAL
text: He's moving his lips. See his fucking
dialog: lips moving?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I got eyes, Val.
text: Finally, Dave's words come out in a whisper.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I wasn't ready.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Like I said. You do this part alone.
text: And Jimmy raises the GUN, places the barrel against
text: Dave's forehead. And as Dave closes his eyes...
text: THE MEMORY BULKHEAD BURSTS OPEN AND... A MUZZLE FLASH
speaker_heading: TAKES US TO:
speaker_heading: WHITE SKY
dialog: And we PAN DOWN to find ourselves ON...
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK (GANNON STREET) -- DAY

text: sips his bourbon from a pint.
text: A car pulls up across the street. Sean. He walks over.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Annabeth said you might be here.
dialog: (re: bourbon)
dialog: Tough night?
text: Jimmy nods.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
text: Me, too. Saw a bullet with my name on it.
dialog: 115.
text: Jimmy holds up the pint. Sean takes it, swallows a long
text: pull. As he hands it back...
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We got them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Got who?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Katie's killers. Got them cold.
text: It's trying to get in, but it hasn't sunk yet.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Killers? Plural?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Kids, actually. Ray Harris's son, Ray
text: Junior, and a kid John O'Shea. They
dialog: confessed a couple hours ago.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No question?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: They don't know. They were playing with a
text: gun. Saw a car coming so one of them lies
text: down in the middle of the street. Car
text: swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie. O'Shea
dialog: says they meant to just scare her, but
text: the gun went off. She hit him with the
text: door and ran. They chased her so she
dialog: wouldn't tell no one.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And the beating they gave her?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Ray Junior had a hockey stick.
text: Jimmy looks around. It's sinking now. Sean crouches down
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Go easy, Jim. Take a breath.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me. I got a call from Celeste
text: Boyle. She was hysterical. She said
dialog: Dave's missing. Said you might know where
dialog: he is.
text: Jimmy looks at Sean, but can't find any words.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to talk to him. Boston police
dialog: found the body of a guy this morning. In
text: the woods behind McGill's.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: A guy?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: A pedophile with three priors. They want
dialog: to talk to Dave about it.
text: Jimmy lurches up past Sean. Trying to get a grip.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When was the last time you saw Dave,
dialog: Jimmy?
text: Finally, standing there in the middle of the street...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Last time I saw Dave? Dave Boyle?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, Dave Boyle.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It was twenty-five years ago. Going down
text: this street in the back of that car.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for busting Katie's killers, Sean.
dialog: Really. Maybe if you'd been a little
dialog: faster though?
text: It's so goddamn awful. They look at each other a sad
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You going to send Celeste five hundred a
dialog: month, too?
text: Eyes brimming, Jimmy looks back up the street. Sean does
dialog: the same. Right where they were when Dave was driven
dialog: away.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes I think, I think all three of
dialog: us got in that car. And all this, it's
dialog: just a dream.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: A dream, sure.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: In reality we're still eleven-year-old
text: boys trapped in a cellar. Imagining what
dialog: our lives would have been if we'd
dialog: escaped.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Maybe you're right. Who the fuck knows?
text: Jimmy turns and starts walking down the street. Sean just
text: watches after him. Watches as Jimmy walks down the same
text: street, disappears the same way Dave did.
text: Sean's CELL PHONE RINGS. Finally, he answers.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hello?
text: No answer. HIGHWAY sounds from the other end. Sean knows
dialog: who it is, finally knows what to say...
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry... I need you to know that. I
dialog: pushed you away.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: I'm sorry, too. It's been so messed up.
dialog: Loving you, hating you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come home.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: You change the locks or anything?
text: Sean smiles with a sudden sense of surprise and relief.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Everything's just the way you left it.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: Nora.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: LAUREN (V.O.)
dialog: Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Nora...
text: And Sean starts to walk toward his car, still talking on
text: the phone, laughing. And as the SOUND FADES OFF, we HOLD
text: ON the sidewalk, on the names written so long ago.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: FOOT TRAFFIC
text: On the sidewalk. People lining up. And we TILT UP TO the
text: Buckingham Day Parade. Floats, color guard, politicians
dialog: in convertibles. Over it all...
speaker_heading: JIMMY (V.O.)
dialog: I killed the wrong man. This is what I've
dialog: done and I can't undo it.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (V.O.)
dialog: Shhh, Jimmy. Shhh.
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Annabeth steps up to Jimmy, starts to unbutton his shirt.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to hear your heart.
text: She places an ear to his chest. Jimmy nearly can't
text: breathe under his burden. We hear the PARADE OUTSIDE.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Last night, when I put the girls to bed,
dialog: I told them how big your heart was.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Annabeth --
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I told them how much you loved Katie.
dialog: Because you created her and sometimes
dialog: your love for her was so big, your heart
text: felt like it was going to explode from
dialog: loving her.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Please stop.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: I told them their daddy loved them that
dialog: much, too. That he had four hearts and
text: they were all filled up and aching with a
dialog: love that meant we would never have to
dialog: worry.
text: Annabeth pulls off her own shirt, presses herself to him.
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I told them their daddy would do whatever
dialog: he had to for those he loved. And that is
dialog: never wrong. That can never be wrong. No
dialog: Matter what their daddy had to do.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You knew?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Celeste called looking for you. Told me
dialog: about Dave. Told me what she told you.
dialog: Said she was worried something might
dialog: happen.
text: She kisses his throat, starts to undo his belt.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why didn't you call?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Because they're weak.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Who's weak?
speaker_heading: ANNABETH
dialog: Everyone. Everyone but us. We will never
dialog: be weak. And you. You could rule this
dialog: town.
text: A beat as Jimmy stares at her. And then he kisses her.
dialog: Hungry for this woman. His woman. Passion builds
text: precipitously. As she returns it, between breaths:
speaker_heading: ANNABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: And, Jim? After? Let's take the girls
dialog: down to the parade. Katie would've liked
dialog: that.
dialog: 120.
text: Jimmy lifts her up. She hooks her legs around him.
scene_heading: EXT. PARADE -- DAY
text: It streams along. Sean stands watching with his wife
text: Lauren and his baby daughter. A float passes by filled
text: with children who shout, laugh and wave.
text: All except for one who's lost, sad, haunted. The child's
text: eyes find Sean's for just an instant and then he's gone.
text: Sean snaps from the sudden trance, looks across the
text: street at Jimmy, Annabeth, their daughters and a few of
text: the Savage brothers. Waving at the parade, happy and
text: strong.
text: Suddenly aware of being watched, Jimmy's head swivels.
text: His eyes lock on Sean's. Jimmy gives Sean the smallest
dialog: smile.
text: And Sean points a "finger gun." Drops his thumb on the
text: imaginary hammer.
text: And as Jimmy's smile widens...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog:
