scene_heading: FADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD
text: Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in
text: and out answering calls.
speaker_heading: 1ST OPERATOR
dialog: This is the Morning Post... The City
dialog: Room? Just a moment, I'll connect
dialog: you.
dialog: (plugs in call)
speaker_heading: 2ND OPERATOR
dialog: Morning Post... Sports Department?
dialog: Just a moment --
dialog: (plugs in call)
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To
text: Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind
text: switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to
text: switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A
text: waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the
text: switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it
text: again from the city room which stretches on beyond
text: switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an
text: office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big
text: clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY
text: as he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of
text: a crossword puzzle.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to
text: behind him. The office boy looks up.
speaker_heading: OFFICE BOY
dialog: What's a seven-letter word for --?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Don't ask me! If I knew any seven-
dialog: letter words, I'd be something better
dialog: than a reporter!
text: He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Hey! Down! Down!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT ELEVATORS
text: as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds
text: on it. It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in. The
text: door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes
text: up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce
text: carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT TABLE
text: office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come
text: into the scene.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Hello, Skinny. Remember me?
speaker_heading: OFFICE BOY
text: (looks up; then a
dialog: glowing smile)
dialog: Hildy Johnson!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD
text: Hildy approaches the switchboard.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (to operator)
dialog: Hello, Maisie.
text: The first operator looks up.
speaker_heading: MAISIE
dialog: Hello -- Hildy! You coming back?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, just visiting. Tell me, is the
dialog: lord of the universe in today?
speaker_heading: MAISIE
dialog: He is -- and in a very bad humor. I
dialog: think somebody stole one of his crown
dialog: jewels. Shall I announce you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, never mind -- I'll blow my own
dialog: trumpet.
scene_heading: THREE SHOT BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR
text: Hildy turns to Bruce.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I won't be more than ten minutes, I
dialog: promise you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Even ten minutes is a long time to
dialog: be away from you.
text: We hear a giggle off scene.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY
text: He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What did you say, Bruce?
text: Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back
text: at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City
dialog: Room.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I said -- uh -- I said even ten
dialog: minutes -- is a long time -- to be
dialog: away from you.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard
dialog: it, but I just wanted to hear it
dialog: again. I can stand being spoiled a
dialog: little. The gentleman I'm going to
dialog: have a chat with did very little
dialog: spoiling.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: I'd like to spoil him just once.
dialog: Sure you don't want me to go in with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: My job, Bruce. I started it -- and
dialog: I'll finish it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I suppose you're right -- but if it
dialog: gets rough, remember I'm here.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I'll come a-running, pardner.
text: She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into
text: the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it
text: for her. Hildy smiles.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Thanks, Bruce.
text: She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her.
text: The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares
dialog: after Hildy.
scene_heading: MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM
text: Hildy starts to walk through City Room.
scene_heading: TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY
text: as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk,
text: because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor.
text: The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts
text: down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of:
text: "Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes
text: straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own
text: greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop"
text: "Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and
text: gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his
text: desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him
text: as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he
text: sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a
text: middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at
text: a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy
text: comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Hello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to
dialog: the Lovelorn"?
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle!
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Point of information -- what does a
dialog: girl say on meeting her divorced
dialog: husband? OR:
dialog: (What does a girl do,
dialog: etc.)
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: (illustrating)
dialog: My advice is duck and cross with
dialog: your right.
text: Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the
text: room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition
text: which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the
dialog: City Room.
scene_heading: INT. BURNS' OFFICE LONG SHOT
text: as she opens the door. Burns is shaving with an electric
text: razor and Louie is holding the mirror up in front of him.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BURNS
text: shaving, Louie holding the mirror.
speaker_heading: LOUIE
dialog: A little more round the chin, Boss.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without
dialog: looking up, says:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's
dialog: no way to talk to your wife -- even
dialog: if she's no longer your wife.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Hello, Hildy!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Hello, Walter.
dialog: (to Louie)
dialog: Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine
dialog: king?
speaker_heading: LOUIE
dialog: Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm
dialog: retired. I'm one of you fellas now --
text: a newspaper man.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Editorials?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Get going, Louie. I got company.
text: The door flies open and Duffy comes busting in.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Walter!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I'm busy, Duffy.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Well, you're not too busy to know
dialog: that the Governor hasn't signed that
dialog: reprieve!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: And that means Earl Williams dies
dialog: tomorrow morning and makes a sucker
dialog: out of us!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You're crazy. Where's Mac?
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: He's on my phone. He just called me.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: They can't do that to me!
text: He grabs the phone on his desk:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Give me that call on Duffy's wire!
dialog: Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the
dialog: Governor? -- What do you mean, you
dialog: can't locate him?
dialog: (apparently pleading
dialog: to the one man in
dialog: the world who can
dialog: help him)
dialog: Mac, you know what this means. We're
dialog: the only paper in town defending
dialog: Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow
dialog: we're washed up! Find the Governor
dialog: and when you find him tell him we
dialog: want that reprieve!... Tell him I
dialog: elected him and I can have him
dialog: impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac --
dialog: I know you can. I always said you
dialog: were the greatest reporter in the
dialog: country and now you can prove it.
dialog: Get going! Attaboy!
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Duffy,
dialog: sarcastically)
dialog: The greatest reporter in the country!
dialog: First I gotta tell him what news to
dialog: get! Gotta tell him how to get it --
dialog: then I gotta write it for him
dialog: afterward! Now if you were a decent
dialog: City Editor --
text: CLOSE SHOT DUFFY AND BURNS
text: with Louie and Hildy in the b.g.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in
dialog: name only. You do all the hiring
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too.
dialog: Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a
dialog: civil tongue in your head.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I don't like to interfere with
dialog: business, but would you boys pardon
dialog: us while we have a little heart-to-
dialog: heart talk?
scene_heading: DUFFY AND LOUIE
dialog: (together)
dialog: Well -- But I gotta --
text: They look at Burns.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Scram, you guys.
text: They start to go.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You won't miss anything. You'll
text: probably be able to hear him just as
dialog: well outside as here.
dialog: They go.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Mind if I sit down?
text: Hildy sits.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT DUFFY AND LOUIE
text: going out of the door. They cast an interested look back and
text: linger a second. Over scene comes Burns' voice.
speaker_heading: BURNS' VOICE
dialog: I said scram!
text: They close the door hurriedly.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: May I have a cigarette, please?
text: Burns reaches into his pocket, extracts a cigarette and tosses
text: it on the desk. Hildy reaches for it.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Thanks. A match?
text: Burns delves into pockets again, comes up with matchbox,
text: tosses it to Hildy, who catches it deftly, and strikes the
dialog: match.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: How long is it?
text: Hildy finishes lighting her cigarette, takes a puff, and
text: fans out the match.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: How long is what?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You know what. How long since we've
dialog: seen each other?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks --
dialog: then Bermuda... Oh, about four months,
dialog: I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BURNS
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (slyly)
dialog: Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing
dialog: me in your dreams?
text: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT THE TWO
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (casually)
dialog: No -- Mama doesn't dream about you
dialog: any more, Walter. You wouldn't know
text: the old girl now.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (with conviction)
dialog: Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any
dialog: time --
text: He grows lyrical and, rising from his seat, is about to start
text: toward her, as he continues:
scene_heading: BURNS AND HILDY
dialog: (together)
dialog: -- any place, anywhere --
text: He sits.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (half-pityingly)
dialog: You're repeating yourself! That's
dialog: the speech you made the night you
dialog: proposed.
dialog: (she burlesques his
dialog: fervor)
dialog: "-- any time -- any place --
dialog: anywhere!"
text: CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BURNS
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (growling)
dialog: I notice you still remember it.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I'll always remember it. If I hadn't
dialog: remembered it, I wouldn't have
dialog: divorced you.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you
dialog: hadn't done it.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Done what?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow
dialog: lose faith in himself. It almost
text: gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's
dialog: what divorces are for.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned
dialog: idea that divorces are something
dialog: that last forever -- till 'death us
dialog: do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't
dialog: mean anything today. It's only a few
dialog: words mumbled over you by a judge.
dialog: We've got something between us nothing
dialog: can change.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I suppose that's true in a way. I am
dialog: fond of you, Walter. I often wish
dialog: you weren't such a stinker.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Now, that's a nice thing to say.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, why did you promise me you
dialog: wouldn't fight the divorce and then
dialog: try and gum up the whole works?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, I meant to let you go -- but,
dialog: you know, you never miss the water
text: till the well runs dry.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: A fellow your age, hiring an airplane
dialog: to write:
dialog: (she gestures above
dialog: to indicate sky-
dialog: writing)
dialog: 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember
dialog: my dimple. Walter.! It held things
dialog: up twenty minutes while the Judge
text: ran out to watch it.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, I don't want to brag, but I've
dialog: still got the dimple -- and in the
dialog: same place -- I just acted like any
dialog: husband who doesn't want to see his
text: home broken up.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What home?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What home? Don't you remember the
dialog: home I promised you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Oh, yes -- we were to have it right
dialog: after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Was it my fault? Did I know that
dialog: coal mine was going to have another
dialog: cave-in? I meant to be with you on
dialog: our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: All I know is that instead of two
dialog: weeks in Atlantic City with my
dialog: bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a
dialog: coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age
dialog: sixty-three -- getting food and air
dialog: out of a tube! You don't deny that.
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat
dialog: the whole country on that story.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, suppose we did? That isn't
dialog: what I got married for. What's the
dialog: good of -- Look, Walter, I came up
dialog: here to tell you that you'll have to
dialog: stop phoning me a dozen times a day --
dialog: sending twenty telegrams -- all the
dialog: rest of it, because I'm --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you
dialog: what. You come back to work on the
dialog: paper and if we find we can't get
dialog: along in a friendly way, we'll get
dialog: married again.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What?!!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I haven't any hard feelings.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Walter, you're wonderful in a
dialog: loathesome sort of way. Now, would
dialog: you mind keeping quiet long enough
dialog: for me to tell you what I came up
dialog: here for?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (rising, reaching for
dialog: his hat)
dialog: Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch
dialog: and you can tell me everything.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (also rising)
dialog: I have a lunch date. I just want --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You can break it, can't you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, I can't.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sure you can. Come on.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Don't tell me what to do! We're
dialog: divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're
dialog: not my husband and you're not my
dialog: boss! And what's more, you're not
dialog: going to be my boss.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Just what I said. That's what I --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You mean you're not coming back to
dialog: work here?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: That's the first time you've been
dialog: right today. That's what I --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (still interrupting)
dialog: You've had a better offer, eh?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You bet I've got a better offer.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, go on and take it. Work for
dialog: somebody else! That's the gratitude
dialog: I get for --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I know, Walter, but I --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: What were you when you came here
dialog: five years ago? A little college
dialog: girl from a School of Journalism! I
dialog: took a little doll-faced mugg --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't
dialog: been doll-faced!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Why should I? I thought it would be
dialog: a novelty to have a face around here
dialog: a man could look at without
text: shuddering.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Listen, Walter --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (going right on)
dialog: I made a great reporter out of you,
dialog: Hildy, but you won't be half as good
dialog: on any other paper, and you know it.
dialog: You need me and I need you -- and
dialog: the paper needs both of us.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, the paper'll have to learn to
dialog: do without me. And so will you. It
dialog: just didn't work out, Walter.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: It would have worked if you'd been
dialog: satisfied with just being editor and
dialog: reporter. But no! You had to marry
dialog: me and spoil everything.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I
dialog: proposed to you!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, you practically did! Making
dialog: goo-goo eyes at me for two years
dialog: till I broke down. And I still claim
dialog: I was tight the night I proposed. If
dialog: you'd been a gentleman you'd have
dialog: forgotten all about it. But not you!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (speechless)
dialog: You -- you --
text: She grabs something and chucks it at him. He ducks. The phone
dialog: rings.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Hildy)
dialog: You're losing your eye. You used to
dialog: be able to pitch better than that.
dialog: (he reaches for phone)
dialog: Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well,
dialog: what can I do for you?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT DUFFY
text: seated at his desk, talking into phone.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: What's the matter with you? Are you
dialog: drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney!
text: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
dialog: Burns into phone:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sweeney! You can't do that to me!
dialog: Not today, of all days! Jumping
dialog: Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well,
dialog: I suppose so... All right. If you
dialog: have to, you have to.
dialog: (he hangs up)
dialog: How do you like that? Everything
dialog: happens to me -- with 365 days in
dialog: the year -- this has to be the day.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sweeney.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Dead?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Not yet. Might just as well be. The
dialog: only man on the paper who can write --
dialog: and his wife picks this morning to
dialog: have a baby!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HILDY
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Sweeney?
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: Well, after all, he didn't do it on
dialog: purpose, did he?
text: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I don't care whether he did or not.
dialog: He's supposed to be covering the
dialog: Earl Williams case and there he is --
dialog: waiting at the hospital! Is there no
dialog: sense of honor left in this country?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (practically)
dialog: Well, haven't you got anybody else?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: There's nobody else on the paper who
dialog: can write! This'll break me, unless --
text: (he stares at Hildy;
text: then a light breaks)
dialog: Hildy!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You've got to help me, Hildy.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Keep away --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: It'll bring us together again, Hildy --
dialog: just the way we used to be.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time --
dialog: any place -- anywhere!"
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger
dialog: than anything that's happened to us.
dialog: Don't do it for me! Do it for the
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Get away, Svengali.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: If you won't do it for love, how
dialog: about money? Forget the other offer
dialog: and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks
dialog: a week.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: All right -- thirty-five, and not a
dialog: cent more!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Please! Will you just --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Great grief! What's that other paper
dialog: going to give you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I'm not working for any other paper!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Oh! In that case, the raise is off
dialog: and you go back to your old salary
dialog: and like it. Trying to blackjack --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Look at this!
dialog: (pulling her glove
dialog: off her left hand)
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP HILDY
text: She gets glove off left hand and holds up an engagement ring
dialog: for him to see.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Do you see this? Do you know what an
dialog: engagement ring is?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BURNS
text: He looks at ring, swallows, then:
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
dialog: Burns and Hildy.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I tried to tell you right away but
dialog: you started reminiscing. I'm getting
dialog: married, Walter, and also getting as
dialog: far away from the newspaper business
dialog: as I can get! I'm through.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (himself again)
dialog: Get married all you want to, Hildy,
dialog: but you can't quit the newspaper
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You can't sell me that, Walter.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Who says I can't? You're a newspaper
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: That's why I'm quitting. I want to
dialog: go some place where I can be a woman.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I know you, Hildy, and I know what
dialog: it would mean. It would kill you.
speaker_heading: CLOSER SHOT
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (bitterly)
text: A journalist! Peeking through keyholes --
dialog: running after fire engines -- waking
text: people up in the middle of the night
dialog: to ask them if they think Hitler's
dialog: going to start a war -- stealing
dialog: pictures off old ladies of their
dialog: daughters that got chased by apemen!
dialog: I know all about reporters -- a lot
text: of daffy buttinskies going around
text: without a nickel in their pockets,
dialog: and for what? So a million hired
dialog: girls and motormen's wives will know
dialog: what's going on! No, Walter, I'm
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Where'd you meet this man?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Bermuda.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Bermuda... Rich, eh?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Not what you'd call rich. Makes about
dialog: five thousand a year.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What's his line?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: He's in the insurance business.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: The insurance business?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (on the defensive)
dialog: It's a good, honest business, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I
dialog: can't picture you with a guy who
dialog: sells policies.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets
dialog: the office when he's with me. He
dialog: doesn't treat me like an errand-boy --
dialog: he treats me like a woman.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: He does, does he? How did I treat
dialog: you -- like a water buffalo?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I don't know about water buffaloes,
dialog: but I know about him. He's kind and
dialog: sweet and considerate. He wants a
dialog: home -- and children.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Say, sounds more like a guy I ought
dialog: to marry. What's his name?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, I'll give you a hint. By
dialog: tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs.
dialog: Bruce Baldwin.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: The quicker the better. Well -- I
dialog: finally got out what I came in to
dialog: tell you.
dialog: (she extends her hand)
dialog: So long, Walter, and better luck
dialog: next time.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: I wish you everything I couldn't
dialog: give you, Hildy.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Thanks...
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Too bad I couldn't see this guy first.
dialog: I'm pretty particular about whom my
dialog: wife marries.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (laughing)
text: Well, he's waiting in the anteroom
dialog: for me now.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Say, could I meet him?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do
dialog: any good.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You're not afraid, are you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Afraid? I should say not!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: All right then, come on and let's
dialog: see this paragon.
dialog: (gets hat)
dialog: Is he as good as you say?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Better.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT OFFICE
text: Burns has his hat. They start toward the door.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Then what does he want with you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Now you got me.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Nothing personal. I was just asking.
text: At the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: After all --
text: He stops as he realizes she's not there. The door opens.
text: Hildy comes out.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You wouldn't believe this, Walter,
text: but Bruce holds the door open for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: No kidding?
scene_heading: INT. CITY ROOM FULL SHOT
text: Reporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter
dialog: scene.
scene_heading: TRUCKING SHOT
text: as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in
text: contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups
text: are silent as they watch the two.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (trying to keep pace)
dialog: And he takes his hat off when he's
text: with a lady.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (shouting)
text: And when he walks with a lady, he
dialog: waits for her!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (stops)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry.
text: Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says,
text: under his breath, to Maisie:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Have Duffy call me in the restaurant
dialog: in twenty minutes.
text: Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the
text: iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens
text: the gate and holds it for Burns.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Allow me.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (walking right through)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Hildy follows him out.
scene_heading: INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT
text: as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On
text: the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy".
text: Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his
text: hand, shakes it and says:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I can see right away my wife picked
dialog: out the right husband for herself.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BRUCE
text: Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER
text: The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping
text: his hand vigorously.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: There must be some mistake. I'm
dialog: already married.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (you never saw a more
dialog: surprised man)
dialog: Already married!
dialog: (turning to Hildy
dialog: o.s.)
dialog: Hildy, why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP HILDY
text: She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling
dialog: nevertheless.
scene_heading: MEDIUM SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (again seizing
dialog: messenger's hand)
dialog: Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: But my name --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (as he enters scene)
dialog: Mr. Burns!
text: Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Yeah? You'll have to excuse me --
dialog: I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here.
dialog: Just leave your card with the boy.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND BURNS
text: Bruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his
text: attention. Burns turns on him:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look --
dialog: (he points o.s.)
dialog: -- there's the boy. Take your card
dialog: and leave it with him.
text: He turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his
text: sleeve and pulls at it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Mr. Burns --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (wheeling around)
dialog: I've just told you I was busy with
dialog: Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm Bruce Baldwin!
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at
text: this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce:
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You're Bruce Baldwin?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (accusing to messenger)
dialog: Then who are you?
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: (falteringly)
dialog: My name's Pete Davis.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is
dialog: no concern of yours and after this
dialog: I'll thank you to keep out of my
dialog: affairs!
text: The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks
text: back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP HILDY
text: She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is
text: compelled to smile at Walter's behavior.
text: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND BRUCE
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (reaches for Bruce's
text: hand but grabs the
dialog: umbrella and begins
text: shaking the handle
dialog: up and down)
dialog: This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and
dialog: I'm sorry about the mistake.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (he tries to shift
dialog: the umbrella, calling
dialog: Burns' attention to
dialog: it, and offers his
dialog: hand instead)
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Oh, I thought there was something
dialog: funny... You see, Bruce, you don't
dialog: mind if I call you Bruce, do you?
dialog: After all, we're practically related --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (completely unnerved
dialog: by this time, and
dialog: you can't quite blame
dialog: him)
dialog: Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You see, my wife -- I mean, your
dialog: wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had
dialog: led me to expect that she was marrying
text: a much older man.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (this is the final
dialog: crusher)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: But I see, she didn't mean old in
dialog: years. You always carry an umbrella,
dialog: Bruce?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy
dialog: this morning.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I
dialog: hope? A man ought to be prepared for
dialog: any emergency.
text: Burns looks down. Bruce, in unconscious responses, helplessly
text: lifts his foot up and we see the rubber.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Attaboy!
dialog: (taking Bruce's arm
text: and leading him toward
dialog: elevator)
dialog: Come on, Bruce.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (going along, but
dialog: worried)
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Where are we going? I'm going to buy
dialog: you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: (a helpless look back
dialog: at Hildy)
dialog: No -- she didn't.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.
dialog: (as the elevator is
text: about to pass, he
dialog: calls)
dialog: Down!
dialog: (practically shoving
dialog: Bruce in)
dialog: After you, Bruce!
dialog: (as Bruce disappears
text: inside he turns toward
dialog: Hildy)
dialog: Come on, Hildy, my treat!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BURNS NEAR OPEN ELEVATOR
text: We don't see the passengers. Hildy comes into scene.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I suppose I can't call this off
dialog: without creating a scene -- but
dialog: remember, it's your last fling.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: How do you like that? Here I am being
dialog: nice to you and your sweet-heart and
dialog: that's the thanks I get!
text: He jumps into the elevator -- in a second he hops out.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (very sweetly -- he
dialog: almost sings it)
dialog: Oh -- after you, Hildy!
text: With a look of disgust Hildy gets in. Burns follows and the
text: door slams on them.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP OFFICE BOY
text: He looks after departed elevator and whistles. Then he grins
dialog: all over.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT CLOSEUP - A BEAMING WAITER
text: HE GRINS ALL OVER AND SAYS:
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Don't tell me it's you, Hildy!
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK and discloses our three at a restaurant
text: table. Nothing swanky -- a place like Jack Blake's in New
dialog: York, say.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (beaming at waiter)
dialog: Nobody else.
text: She extends her hand. The waiter takes it; they shake.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: How's everything, Gus?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I can't complain.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (studying menu)
dialog: Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef
dialog: sandwich -- rare. And some coffee.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Shall I put a little rum in the
dialog: coffee? It's a nasty day.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Good idea. How about you, Hildy?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (discarding menu)
dialog: Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess.
dialog: And coffee.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Little rum in yours, too?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I guess so.
text: Bruce looks at her. She hurriedly changes her mind.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No -- just coffee, Gus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (crestfallen)
dialog: Just coffee.
dialog: (to Bruce)
dialog: And you, sir?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (putting menu down)
dialog: Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And
text: a glass of milk.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Milk?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (thinks he hasn't
dialog: heard)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: (shaking his head as
dialog: he writes it down)
dialog: Milk.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: And don't put any rum in it, Gus.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - GUS
text: Gus gives him a look and goes.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRIO AT TABLE
text: Burns surveys the others quizzically.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (a sigh)
dialog: Well, so you're getting married
dialog: tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're
text: taking the four o'clock train to
dialog: Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (it's the Puritan in
dialog: him)
dialog: Taking the train today -- and being
dialog: married tomorrow?
text: He whistles.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (rising to the bait)
dialog: Oh, it isn't like that.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (reassuring Mrs. Grundy)
dialog: It will be perfectly all right,
dialog: Walter. Mother is coming with us on
dialog: the train.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Mother? But your mother --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No. My mother.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (he gets it and
dialog: underlines it)
dialog: Oh. Your mother -- well, of course,
dialog: that relieves my mind.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (to Bruce)
dialog: Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still
dialog: wanting to protect me?
text: She gives Burns that too-sweet look.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (apparently taking
dialog: this at face value)
dialog: I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy,
dialog: but you can always count on me.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - FEATURING BRUCE AND HILDY
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (a little cookily)
dialog: I don't think she'll need you very
dialog: much -- I aim to do most of the
dialog: protecting myself.
text: He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him.
scene_heading: THREE SHOT - HILDY, BRUCE AND BURNS
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, I'll tell you one thing, old
dialog: man, she never looked at me the way
dialog: she's looking at you.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I might have, Walter, but you were
dialog: never there.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Anyway, I'm glad you two are going
dialog: to be happy and have all the things
dialog: I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy
dialog: is about the best reporter in the
dialog: country -- and that goes regardless
dialog: of sex. But all she really ever wanted
dialog: was a home.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, I'll try to give her one.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I know you will, Bruce. Are you going
dialog: to live with your mother?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Just for the first year.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: That'll be nice. A home with mother.
dialog: A real honeymoon. In Albany, too.
dialog: Ow!
dialog: That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a
text: kick under the table from Hildy.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Mighty nice little town, Albany.
dialog: They've got the State Capitol there,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Yes, I know...
dialog: (he chuckles)
dialog: Hildy, will you ever forget the night
dialog: you brought the Governor back to
dialog: your hotel room and found me taking
dialog: a bath? She didn't even know I was
dialog: in town...
text: His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again.
text: Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Well, here we are.
text: He begins serving them.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (trying to pick up
dialog: again after a second)
dialog: How's business, Bruce?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance
dialog: town. Most people there take it out
dialog: pretty early in life.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I don't blame them.
text: Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns,
text: lets out a startled "ouch".
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must
dialog: have slipped.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (a pained expression
dialog: belies his words)
dialog: That's all right.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I sometimes wish I'd taken out
dialog: insurance -- but, of course, now it
dialog: doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it
dialog: would have been the smart thing to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, I honestly feel that way. I
dialog: figure I'm in one line of business
dialog: that really helps people. Of course,
dialog: we don't help you much when you're
dialog: alive -- but afterward -- that's
dialog: what counts.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I see what you mean.
dialog: They fall to.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - HILDY
text: She sips her coffee and acts surprised.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Gus, this --
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - GUS
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (winking)
dialog: Good coffee, isn't it?
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - HILDY
text: She smiles and winks back, and takes another sip.
dialog: GROUP SHOT AT TABLE
text: Gus starts to go.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You've forgotten my milk.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oh. The milk. Yes.
text: He leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He
text: likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Here's luck to the bride and
dialog: bridegroom.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (lifts cup)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (looking for something
dialog: to respond with --
dialog: apologetically)
dialog: He hasn't brought my milk yet.
text: A bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns.
speaker_heading: BUS BOY
dialog: They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: They would!
text: Boy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of
text: coffee, which he then takes off with him.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (looking after him)
dialog: You know, Hildy, he's not a bad
dialog: fellow.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (looking at him
dialog: maternally)
dialog: You're so nice, Bruce, you think
dialog: everybody else is.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, he's not the man for you. I can
dialog: see that. But I sort of like him.
dialog: Got a lot of charm.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: He comes by it naturally. His
dialog: grandfather was a snake.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: If anybody had told me I'd be sitting
dialog: at lunch with him -- but he swept me
dialog: right off my feet.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: That's what he did to me. Swept me
dialog: right off my feet -- and left me
text: lying on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT
text: Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Get this -- get Sweeney off that
dialog: yarn and out of town on a two weeks'
dialog: vacation -- and right away... All
dialog: right, Duffy, keep your shirt on.
dialog: Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't
dialog: know it yet. But she'll be there. I
dialog: promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie
dialog: to stick around.
text: He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds
text: himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk.
text: He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he
text: finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he
text: comes out of the booth.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE
text: Gus is entering the scene.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Your milk, sir.
dialog: He serves Bruce.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: And I brought you another cup of
dialog: coffee, Hildy.
text: Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns'
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Thanks, Gus.
text: She takes a sip and almost chokes.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Too hot?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (gasping for breath)
dialog: No. It's strong.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: But I like it that way.
text: Gus goes, smiling.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: Say, what's happened to Burns? He
dialog: looks sunk, doesn't he?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: He certainly -- hic -- does!
text: Burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before
text: jumping off a roof, and sits down.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Anything the matter?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Just Sweeney again. One of my best
dialog: reporters.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: His wife had twins and he went out
dialog: to celebrate and got as drunk as a
dialog: lord. They can't even find him.
dialog: (he sips his coffee)
dialog: I tell you, drink is the ruin of
dialog: this nation.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (sipping hers)
dialog: You said it.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl
text: Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: It's simple. A poor little dope who
text: lost his job went berserk and shot a
text: cop who was coming after him to quiet
dialog: him down.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: If he's nuts, why doesn't the State
dialog: just put him away?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Because it happened to be a colored
dialog: policeman.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (for Bruce's benefit)
dialog: The colored vote happens to be very
dialog: important to the Mayor of this town.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Especially with an election coming
dialog: up in a few days.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Are you sure Williams is not all
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: All you've got to do is talk to him.
dialog: But the Mayor would hang his own
dialog: grandmother to be re-elected.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: But couldn't you show the man wasn't
dialog: responsible?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - BURNS
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (there's a sly
dialog: expression on his
dialog: face)
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HILDY'S VOICE
dialog: You could run an interview that would
dialog: prove it. Remember the interview I
dialog: wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved
dialog: his life.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (slapping hands
dialog: together)
dialog: Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You
dialog: could save that poor devil's life.
dialog: You could -- but --
dialog: (the enthusiasm dies
dialog: away)
dialog: -- you're going away. I forgot.
speaker_heading: THREE SHOT
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: How long would the interview take?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Oh -- an hour for the interview.
dialog: Another hour to write it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: We could take the six o'clock train,
dialog: Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This
dialog: is a trick to get your sympathy. No,
dialog: Walter, I've been waiting for
dialog: something like this -- but I wasn't
dialog: sure when you'd spring it. If you
dialog: want to save Earl Williams' life,
dialog: you can interview him yourself. You're
dialog: still a good reporter. Bruce and I
dialog: will be on that four o'clock train --
dialog: and thanks just the same.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I'm an editor. I know what ought to
dialog: be written, but I can't write it the
dialog: way you could. It needs a woman's
dialog: heart --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Bruce)
dialog: You see what I had to put up with?
dialog: She never trusted me! You argue with
dialog: her -- otherwise you're going on a
dialog: honeymoon with blood on your hands!
text: Bruce gulps.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: How can you have any happiness after
dialog: that? All through the years you'll
dialog: remember that a man went to the
dialog: gallows because you were too selfish
dialog: to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl
dialog: Williams' face will come between you
dialog: on the train tonight -- and at the
dialog: preacher's tomorrow -- and all the
dialog: rest of your lives!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (breaking into applause)
dialog: What a performance! Bravo! Don't let
dialog: him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an
dialog: act!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What do you mean, only an act? Haven't
dialog: you got any feeling?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, it's either an act on your
dialog: part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I happen to know Sweeney was married
dialog: only three months ago. If he's got
dialog: twins this morning, I claim it was
dialog: done with mirrors.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (laughs, throws up
dialog: his hands)
dialog: All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But
dialog: I'll make you and Bruce a business
dialog: proposition.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: We're not interested.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Bruce)
dialog: Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young
dialog: man. You let Hildy do this story for
dialog: me and you can write out a $100,000.00
dialog: insurance policy for me. What do you
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't use my wife for business
dialog: purposes, Mr. Burns!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Wait a minute, Bruce. What's
dialog: commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, at his age, twenty payment
dialog: life, a little over a thousand
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: And what's the matter with a thousand
dialog: dollars?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: According to the budget, we laid out
dialog: that's more than our food bill for a
dialog: whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't
dialog: want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm
dialog: perfectly willing to use him. How
dialog: long will it take to get him examined?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I could get a company doctor in twenty
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Now you're talking!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (turning on Burns)
dialog: You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose
dialog: you examine Mr. Burns in his office.
dialog: I'll get my bag and go over to the
dialog: Press Room in the Criminal Courts
dialog: Building. You phone me as soon as
dialog: Mr. Burns has given you his check.
dialog: Then I'll go get the interview and
dialog: you phone Mother that we're taking
text: the six o'clock train.
dialog: (back to Burns)
dialog: And no tricks, Walter!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What tricks would I pull?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Oh, nothing! Of course, you might
dialog: cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute!
dialog: What would be his first payment on
dialog: that policy?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: About twenty-five hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Better make that a certified check,
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: What do you think I am -- a crook?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Yes --- and that's putting it mildly!
dialog: No certified check -- no story --
dialog: Get me?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: All right. The check will be
dialog: certified. Want my fingerprints?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (rising)
dialog: No thanks, I've still got those.
dialog: Well, I'll step into some working
text: clothes and hop over to the Press
text: Room for the background on this yarn.
dialog: It'll be kind of fun to see the boys
dialog: again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must
dialog: be certified.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: All right, dear.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got
dialog: that money?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (feeling his pocket)
dialog: The five hundred? Sure.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: On second thought, would you let me
dialog: have it? I'll get the tickets.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm
dialog: doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: But I don't gamble, Hilda!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I know a lot of men who didn't do
dialog: anything till they met Walter Burns.
dialog: Please, dear.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: All right.
text: (he pulls out his
dialog: wallet)
dialog: One -- two -- three -- four -- five.
dialog: Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I'll be careful, darling. You be,
dialog: please.
text: She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: So long, husbands.
dialog: She goes.
scene_heading: TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY
text: leaving. She weaves just a bit.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN
text: They look after her.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (smiling a little)
dialog: I never knew Hildy to be so determined
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You haven't seen anything yet.
text: Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE
scene_heading: SHOT AT TELEPHONE
text: It is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA
text: DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He
text: has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Criminal Courts Press Room... This
dialog: is Endicott... No, nothing new on
dialog: the Williams case yet boss. Well,
dialog: you bet I'm here plugging away every
dialog: minute.
dialog: (hangs up and studies
dialog: his cards)
text: Up a dime.
text: CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak.
text: Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and
dialog: McCue.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (dropping his cards)
dialog: By me.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (also dropping)
dialog: Droparoo.
text: Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards.
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: I'll call.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Three sixes. Is that any good?
speaker_heading: HILDY'S VOICE
dialog: It sure looks good from here.
text: The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON
text: framed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed
text: her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and
text: comes into the room.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT REPORTERS
text: They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene.
dialog: There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy
text: Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: HILDY
text: One at a time, boys.
text: She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk,
text: takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the
text: corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All
text: through the above action she is talking rapidly.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, I'm not back for good. I'm just
dialog: covering the Earl Williams story for
text: Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack
dialog: of something but will be all right
dialog: by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up
dialog: with Walter Burns -- far from it! As
dialog: a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight
dialog: for Albany and I'll be married
dialog: tomorrow morning. The lucky man is
dialog: Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in
dialog: the insurance business -- and when I
dialog: say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are
dialog: there any other questions?
text: Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the
text: stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a
text: fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put
text: on the new stockings.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Well, that about covers everything.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Good. Now I want to ask you fellows
dialog: a couple of questions. Did Earl
dialog: Williams know what he was doing when
dialog: he fired that gun?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: If you ask us, no. If you ask the
dialog: state alienists, the answer is yes.
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: It's a simple story. Earl Williams
dialog: works for the E.J. McClosky
dialog: Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper
text: for fourteen years. He starts in at
dialog: twenty dollars a week and gradually
text: works his way up to twenty-two fifty.
dialog: A year ago the McClosky Company goes
dialog: out of business and Williams loses
dialog: his job.
text: (waving his hand toward
dialog: Wilson)
dialog: Take it away, Fred Wilson!
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well -- Williams goes a little balmy
text: and begins making speeches on a plan
dialog: he's got to save the world. Only he
dialog: makes his speeches, usually, on a
text: very busy street and neglects to get
dialog: a license for it. Well, the cops let
dialog: him alone as much as they can because
dialog: he's harmless and they're kinda sorry
dialog: for him. But one day he decides to
dialog: hold a meeting right in the middle
text: of a Veteran's Parade and the cops
text: chase him. He gets scared and goes
text: into hiding.
dialog: (gesturing toward
dialog: Schwartz)
dialog: Come in, Dave Schwartz.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
text: His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out
dialog: with a statement that Earl Williams
dialog: is a dangerous character in the employ
dialog: of two or three foreign governments
dialog: and the police are going to get him
text: dead or alive. Somebody sends out a
dialog: tip that this guy is hiding in Molly
dialog: Malloy's joint. And this colored
text: policeman, Daniels, goes over to
dialog: pick Williams up. Williams has read
dialog: the papers, thinks the cop is going
text: to kill him and shoots first. That
dialog: is all.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Thanks, boys. That's all I want to
dialog: know.
text: Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just
text: discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts
text: the stockings in a drawer.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I know, I just want to give him a
dialog: thrill.
text: Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: All right, boys, now that everything
dialog: is settled, deal me in.
text: Hildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM.
text: INSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HILDY
text: She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial,
text: picking up cards dealt her with one hand.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me
dialog: Walter Burns.
dialog: (she studies her cards --
dialog: then, into phone)
dialog: Hello, Walter. How's the old double-
dialog: crosser?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT WALTER BURNS
text: Telephone at his ear.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Hello, my fine-feathered friend.
dialog: Thought I might be hearing from you.
dialog: What have you got to report?
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT and we see that Burns is
text: stripped to the waist. A doctor is applying a stethoscope to
text: his chest. We HOLD the picture a second: Burns listening
text: intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Going all right, eh?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Fine.
text: Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (putting hand over
dialog: mouthpiece of phone)
dialog: Doctor, will you please keep quiet a
dialog: minute? How do you expect me to get
dialog: any work done?
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in
text: front of him at the desk. Bruce grins.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: How do you expect me to get anywhere
dialog: if you're going to keep on that phone?
dialog: If you'll just give me two minutes
dialog: more --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Well, they haven't finished with me
dialog: yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt
dialog: back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of
text: condition. They found two new dimples.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG. CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT
speaker_heading: TELEPHONE
text: cards in her other hand.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: How about that check? All right, Mr.
dialog: Burns, but remember, no checkee --
dialog: no story. Well, as soon as they decide
dialog: whether you live or not will you
dialog: have that new man of mine call me
dialog: up? Yes, sir.
dialog: (she hangs up)
dialog: All right, boys. Up a dime.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT'S VOICE
dialog: Right back at you.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: (dropping his cards)
dialog: You fight it cut.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: And up a dime.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (studying a second)
dialog: I call. What you got?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (displaying her cards)
dialog: Three bullets! Any good?
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (throwing his cards
dialog: away)
dialog: Beats king up.
text: Hildy rakes in the money.
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: What are you going to do with all
dialog: that money, Hildy?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah -- you can't spend it in Albany.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Oh, I'll think of something.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: taking in door and including group. Bensinger, another
text: reporter, comes in from the corridor. He stands out from the
text: others because of his tidy appearance, and carries a book
text: under his arm.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on
dialog: the hanging?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER
speaker_heading: BENSINGER

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HILDY
speaker_heading: HILDY

text: TWO SHOT FEATURING HILDY AND BENSINGER
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: Hildy!
text: He comes over to shake hands.
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: Are you back?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, just a farewell appearance,
dialog: batting for Sweeney. I'm going into
dialog: business for myself.
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: What doing?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I'm getting married tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: Well, congratulations! Good luck!
scene_heading: THE TABLE ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Why don't you use him for a
dialog: bridesmaid, Hildy?
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Come on, Hildy, your deal.
text: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER AT HIS DESK
text: He opens a drawer, the one in which Hildy put her stockings.
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: Say, who put these stockings in my
dialog: desk?
dialog: (he turns to the group)
dialog: McCUE's VOICE I don't know, but I think they got rats in the
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
text: (makes a gesture of
text: disgust and picks up
dialog: telephone)
dialog: This is Bensinger. I just saw the
dialog: Sheriff. He won't move the hanging
dialog: up a minute... All right, I'll talk
dialog: to him again, but it's no use. The
dialog: execution is set for seven in the
dialog: morning. Get me a rewrite man.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT
text: dealing the cards.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Why can't they hang that guy at a
dialog: reasonable hour, so we can get some
dialog: sleep?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: (into phone)
text: Jake, new lead on the hanging. This
dialog: new alienist from New York -- Dr.
dialog: Max J. Egelhoffer -- is going to
dialog: interview Williams in about half an
text: hour -- in the Sheriff's office.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT AT TABLE - FEATURING MURPHY
text: Murphy reaches for the phone. Without dropping his cards, he
text: jiggles the hook.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: That must be the tenth alienist
dialog: they've had on Williams. Even if he
dialog: wasn't crazy before, he would be
dialog: after ten of those babies got through
text: psychoanalyzing him.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Gimme the desk.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Yeah? What did he ever do for his
dialog: country?
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Don't you remember? He's the guy
dialog: went to Washington to interview the
dialog: Brain Trust, and gave out a statement
dialog: that they were all sane. It created
dialog: a sensation!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER
text: He is referring to his notes as he talks:
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Here's the situation on the eve of
dialog: the hanging:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MURPHY
text: He continues playing his cards:
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (into phone)
text: This is Murphy. More slop on the
dialog: hanging.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: (into phone)
text: A double guard's been thrown around
dialog: the jail, municipal buildings,
dialog: railroad terminals, and elevated
dialog: stations to prepare for the expected
dialog: general uprising of radicals at the
dialog: hour of execution.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MURPHY
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Ready? The Sheriff's just put two
dialog: hundred more relatives on the payroll
dialog: to protect the city against the Red
text: Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a
dialog: couple of minutes.
dialog: (consults his hand)
text: Up a dime.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: The Sheriff has just received four
dialog: more letters threatening his life,
dialog: but he says nothing can interfere
dialog: with his duty.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT MURPHY
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: And to prove to the voters that the
text: Red Menace is on the level, the
dialog: Sheriff has written himself four
text: more letters, threatening his life.
dialog: I know he wrote 'em on account of
text: the misspellings.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT AT TABLE FEATURING HILDY
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows
dialog: up the Sheriff will still be crying
dialog: 'Wolf!'
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What have you got, Hildy?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Kings and sixes.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (throwing down)
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (sweeping coins in)
dialog: 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'...
dialog: Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's
dialog: knee.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: That's why I keep losing. My grandma
dialog: was a modest woman -- nobody ever
dialog: saw her knees, not even my grandpop.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE MED. SHOT
text: The doctor has gone. Burns is adjusting his shirt. Bruce is
text: sitting at the desk.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't know. This makes me feel
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Why shouldn't I make Hildy my
dialog: beneficiary? I've got nobody else to
dialog: leave it to.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I feel I ought to take care of her.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, you'll take care of her. After
dialog: all, if that doctor's right, I'm
dialog: going to live for a long time yet.
dialog: Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor.
dialog: I was a very bad husband: Hildy could
dialog: have got a lot of alimony if she'd
dialog: wanted to, but she wouldn't take
dialog: any. She had it coming to her, but
dialog: she was too independent.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, I'm independent, too.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Figure it this way: I ought to be
dialog: good for twenty-five years. By that
dialog: time, you'll probably have made enough
dialog: so that the money won't mean anything.
dialog: But suppose you haven't made good --
dialog: don't you think Hildy's entitled to
dialog: a quiet old age without any worries?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, of course, if you put it that
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (everything he has on
dialog: the ball)
dialog: And remember this, Bruce! I love
dialog: her, too.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm beginning to realize that.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: And the beauty of it is she'll never
dialog: have to know 'till I've passed on.
dialog: Maybe she'll think kindly of me ---
dialog: after I'm gone.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (a lump in his throat)
dialog: Gee, you almost make me feel like a
dialog: heel -- coming between you.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: No, Bruce, you didn't come between
dialog: us. It was all over for her before
dialog: you came on the scene. For me --
dialog: it'll never be over.
text: He turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see
text: how that goes over. It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes
text: a tear away.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as Duffy comes into the room. He advances toward the desk.
speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: (placing check on
dialog: desk)
dialog: Here's that certified check, Walter.
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: I drew out my wife's savings, and if
dialog: this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined
dialog: man!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (also sotto voce)
dialog: Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it
text: back by five.
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
dialog: (picking up check he
dialog: rises)
text: He walks over to Bruce.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified
dialog: and everything.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (also rising)
dialog: Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel
dialog: ashamed to think she hadn't trusted
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP DUFFY
text: He reacts to this sweetly solemn thought.
scene_heading: BURNS AND BRUCE
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his
text: arm around him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, she'll know some day.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
text: He releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Don't want to forget this, you know.
dialog: Might start to rain again.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away
dialog: to get that story.
text: They are at the door. Burns opens the door for Bruce.
scene_heading: SHOT FEATURING LOUIS
text: Louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a
text: newspaper. He is all alert, however. Bruce and Burns come
text: into the scene talking.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting
dialog: a good man.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Thanks a lot.
text: They pass Louis. He looks up.
scene_heading: BRUCE AND BURNS

speaker_heading: BRUCE

dialog: Well, thanks for everything.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Don't thank me. I should thank you.
dialog: So long.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: So long.
text: He turns and goes. Burns watches him.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Bruce is going out, his back toward Camera. Burns watches.

speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BURNS

speaker_heading: MCCUE

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
text: There is a whirr and crash from the gallows. They start.
scene_heading: BENSINGER AT WINDOW
speaker_heading: BENSINGER
dialog: I wish they'd stop that practicing.
text: The others drift into the scene and look out of the window.
scene_heading: INT. COURTYARD THE GALLOWS

scene_heading: INT. PRESS ROOM GROUP AT WINDOW
speaker_heading: HILDY

speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: Certified, eh? Who is it -- your

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (in phone)
dialog: But, Bruce, don't keep it in your
dialog: wallet!... Well, you see --
dialog: (she is thinking
dialog: rapidly)
dialog: -- there's an old newspaper
dialog: superstition that the first big check
dialog: you get you -- you put in the lining
dialog: of your hat. That brings you good
dialog: luck for ten years.
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: Say, I've been a reporter twenty
dialog: years and never heard any hooey like
dialog: that. Where'd you get it?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (to McCue)
dialog: I made it up just now, and who's
dialog: asking you?
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I know it's silly, honey, but do it

speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yeah! That's it!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: COP

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT THREE
text: as they go through crowd. The look on poor Bruce's face,

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: My hat!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Get his hat, somebody.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP BRUCE'S HAT
text: lying top up, in a puddle. Hand reaches in and picks it up.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT THREE
text: as hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head.
text: Another takem from Bruce.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at
text: the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits
text: at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of
text: roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of
dialog: Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is
text: only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: I couldn't plead insanity, because
dialog: you see I'm just as sane as anybody
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (puzzled and worried)
dialog: You didn't mean to kill that
dialog: policeman?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody --
dialog: it's against everything I've ever
dialog: stood for. They know it was an
dialog: accident. They're not hanging me for
dialog: that -- they're hanging me for my
dialog: beliefs.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What are your beliefs, Earl?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: They're very simple. I believe in
dialog: the Golden Rule. I'm not the first
dialog: man to die for preaching it. But if
dialog: they would only listen to it -- we
dialog: could have a fine, decent world
dialog: instead of this mass of hate that
dialog: makes man do such cruel things.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: How would you go about applying the
dialog: Golden Rule, Earl?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: I'd do away with the profit system
dialog: and have production for use only.
dialog: There's enough food and clothing and
dialog: shelter for everybody if we'd use
dialog: some sense.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (writing)
dialog: "Production for use only." Well,
dialog: maybe that's the answer.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: It's the only answer. Everything has
dialog: a use and if we let it be used for
dialog: its purpose, we could solve all our
dialog: problems. Food was meant to be eaten,
text: not stored away in restaurants while
dialog: poor people starved; clothing was
dialog: meant to be worn, not piled up in
dialog: stores while people went naked.
dialog: Doesn't that make sense?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP HILDY
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM'S VOICE
dialog: Just use things for what they were
dialog: meant, that's all.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (she studies him a
dialog: moment)
dialog: What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP WILLIAMS
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: A gun?
dialog: (he thinks -- then a
text: revealing smile breaks
dialog: out)
dialog: Why -- to shoot, of course.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Is that how you came to shoot the
dialog: policeman?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun
dialog: in my hand before and I didn't know
dialog: what to do with it. Well, when I get
dialog: stuck, I know that there's an answer
dialog: for everything in production for
dialog: use. So it came to me in a flash:
dialog: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I
dialog: shot. Simple isn't it?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Very simple, Earl.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: There's nothing crazy about that, is
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, Earl, not at all.
dialog: (she indicates the
dialog: flowers)
dialog: Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (reverently)
dialog: Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (pointing to picture
dialog: pinned on wall)
dialog: Isn't that her picture?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (turning toward it)
dialog: Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
scene_heading: INSERT: PICTURE OF MOLLIE
speaker_heading: HILDY'S VOICE
dialog: If you should be pardoned, are you
dialog: figuring on marrying Mollie?
speaker_heading: EARL'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, no, she's much too good for me.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN'S VOICE
dialog: How'd you get in here?
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Sheriff Hartman has come into the scene. Hildy turns toward
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Same way you did.
dialog: (pointing)
text: Through that gate.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I gave strict orders that nobody was
dialog: to interview Williams without my
dialog: permission.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: All right, then, I'll just run the
text: story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid
dialog: to let reporters interview his
dialog: prisoner. Of course, with election
dialog: coming, that might do you a lot of
dialog: harm, but just as you say.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid
dialog: of anything. What were you going to
dialog: write about Williams?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Oh, nothing much. Just that the state
dialog: had proved he was sane -- and he
dialog: admits it himself. If you don't want
dialog: me to run it --
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go
dialog: ahead, run it. And you can say I
dialog: treated him well, too.
dialog: (turning toward
dialog: Williams)
dialog: 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got
dialog: another alienist to see you. He ought
dialog: to be here any minute. Don't go to
dialog: sleep, will you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (to Hildy)
dialog: Hildy, how'd you like a couple of
dialog: tickets for the hanging?
speaker_heading: HILDY
text: (in a low voice so
dialog: Williams won't
dialog: overhear)
dialog: No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (just as loud as ever)
dialog: You ought to stay over. You always
dialog: wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: That's awful kind of you, Sheriff.
dialog: I've got to get started on my
dialog: interview. See you later.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Don't forget about production for
dialog: use.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I won't, Earl.

speaker_heading: ENDICOTT

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Baldwin -- his name is.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: I give that marriage six months.
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Hildy won't be able to stay away
dialog: from a paper any longer than that.
dialog: Did you see her eyes light up when
dialog: she came in here? Like an old fire
dialog: horse.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: She says she's gonna write fiction.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Well, if she's gonna write fiction,
dialog: there's nothing like being a reporter.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: I'll give ten to five that marriage
dialog: won't last six months. Hildy's a
dialog: newspaper man. She's got headlines
dialog: in her veins -- the way we all have
dialog: or we'd be out of these lousy jobs.

speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What are you sore about, sweetheart?
dialog: Wasn't that a swell story we gave
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MOLLIE

speaker_heading: BENSINGER

dialog: She oughtn't be allowed in here!
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP MOLLIE
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: I never said I loved Earl Williams
dialog: and was willing to marry him on the

dialog: my being his soul-mate and having a

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT
text: looking up at her.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: You've been sucking around that cuckoo

dialog: sweetheart.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP MOLLIE
text: She blows up.
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: That's a lie! I met Mr. Williams
dialog: just once in my life when he was
text: wandering around in the rain without
text: his hat and coat on, like a sick
dialog: dog, the day before the shooting. I
dialog: went up to him like any human being
dialog: would and I asked him what was the
dialog: matter, and he told me about being
dialog: fired after working at the same place
dialog: for fourteen years, and I brought
dialog: him up to my room because it was
text: warm there.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HILDY
text: She is typing away, stops to look over at Mollie, then
text: resolutely turns away, studies her stuff, and begins typing
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: MURPHY'S VOICE
dialog: Aw, put it on a phonograph!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT MOLLIE AND OTHERS
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: Just because you want to fill your

dialog: scandal, you got to crucify him and
dialog: make a stooge out of me!
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (to Mollie)
dialog: Got a match?
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: (heedless)
dialog: I tell you he just sat there talking
dialog: to me -- all night. And never once
dialog: laid a hand on me. In the morning he
dialog: went away, and I never saw him again
dialog: till that day at the trial!
text: The boys laugh.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP MOLLIE
text: She lashes out at them.
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: Go on, laugh! I'd like to know some
dialog: curses bad enough for your greasy
dialog: souls! Sure, I was his witness --
dialog: the only one he had. Yes -- me --
dialog: cheap little Mollie Malloy! I'm
dialog: everything the District Attorney
dialog: said I was. And still I was the only
dialog: one with guts enough to stand up for
dialog: him! I told the truth and the District
dialog: Attorney knows it! That's why you're
dialog: persecutin' me! Because Earl Williams
dialog: treated me decent and not like an
dialog: animal -- and I said so!
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (finally irritated)
dialog: Go into your dance! This is the Press
dialog: Room. We're busy.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Why don't you go and see your boy-
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (winks at the others)
dialog: But you'll have to hurry up -- he

speaker_heading: MOLLIE

speaker_heading: WILSON

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: (fencing)
dialog: Of course, I sort of promised them I
dialog: would give out a statement when I
dialog: got through here. You don't mind?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (not liking it)
dialog: Well, I don't know if that's ethical.
dialog: You see, all statements are supposed
dialog: to come from me.
speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: (he'll bargain)
dialog: We'll have to satisfy them. What
dialog: would you say to giving them a joint
dialog: interview? I could give them some of
dialog: the psychological aspects of the
dialog: case and you could give them the
dialog: legal aspects.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (he buys)
dialog: A joint interview, eh? That might be
dialog: all right. We could have our pictures
dialog: taken together, Doctor.
speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a
dialog: very good picture, though.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: It doesn't matter. The publicity's

speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (just a spectator up
dialog: to now)
dialog: Are you gentlemen all through with

speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were

dialog: will you kindly extinguish the lights?
text: The Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on
text: the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face.
speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: You know you are to be executed, Mr.
dialog: Williams. Who do you feel is
dialog: responsible for that?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: The system. But I'm not afraid to

speaker_heading: HILDY

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT SCHWARTZ
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: This is Hildy Johnson...
dialog: (to Schwartz)
dialog: Oh, I can give it up all right.
dialog: Without a single quiver. I'm going
dialog: to live like a human being -- not
dialog: like you rats.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I
dialog: didn't mean "dear." That was just
dialog: habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself,
dialog: Walter. I've got some news for you...
dialog: Yes, I got the interview, but I've
dialog: got some news that's more important.
text: The others are listening, suspecting a scoop.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Better get a pencil out and write it

dialog: (then with a sudden

dialog: Get this, you double-crossing
dialog: chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any
dialog: interview and there ain't gonna be
dialog: any story... Huh? That certified

dialog: twenty minutes. And if I ever see
dialog: you again, it's going to be just too
dialog: bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know
dialog: what I'm angry about, do you? If you
dialog: come over I'll be very glad to tell

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Hear that? That's the interview I
dialog: wrote... Yes, I know we made a
dialog: bargain. I just said I'd write it --
dialog: I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.
dialog: Yes, it's all in little pieces now,

text: She hangs up.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT FEATURING HILDY

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: And that's my farewell to the
dialog: newspaper game. I'm going to live a
dialog: normal life and have a home.
text: She reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which
text: she puts into bag.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I'm going to be a woman, not a

dialog: worry about their new teeth -- and
dialog: the minute I catch one of them even

dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (stopping midway to

dialog: I'll take it.
dialog: (she comes over to

dialog: What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't
dialog: you understand English? -- Why, your
dialog: language is shocking, Mr. Burns --
dialog: positively shocking! I don't mind
dialog: because I was married to you and
dialog: know what to expect, but suppose
dialog: Central is listening in... Oh, did
dialog: you hear that, Central? We ought to
dialog: report him, don't you think?... Oh,
dialog: fooey on you!
text: She pulls the phone out of the wall, walks toward window and

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.

speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Yes, sir.

speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: So -- now I say to you: 'Earl

dialog: you point your gun at me.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

dialog: Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: (insistently)
dialog: Point the gun at me!
text: Williams does so.
speaker_heading: EGELHOFFER
dialog: Then what did you do?
text: Williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger.
text: Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (pathetically)
dialog: Now can I go, please?
text: There is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling:

dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Schwartz calling.
dialog: (to the Mayor)
dialog: How about it, Your Honor? Any
dialog: statement on the Red uprising
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: What Red uprising?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: There'll be no Red uprising!
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Gimme rewrite --
dialog: (to the Mayor)
dialog: The Governor says the situation calls
dialog: for the militia.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: You can quote me as saying that
dialog: anything the Governor says is a tissue
dialog: of lies.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, Jake. Here's a red-hot
dialog: statement from the Governor. He claims
dialog: that the Mayor and the Sheriff have
text: shown themselves to be a couple of
text: eight-year-olds playing with fire.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP SHERIFF AND MAYOR
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ' VOICE
dialog: Quote him as follows: "It is a lucky
dialog: thing for the city that next Tuesday
dialog: is Election Day, as the citizens
dialog: will thus be saved the expense of
dialog: impeaching the Mayor and the Sheriff."
dialog: That's all -- call you back.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT SCHWARTZ
text: He hangs up and starts out.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Nice to have seen you, Mayor.
text: He exits, whistling.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: We've got to go somewhere private,
dialog: Pete. I've got to talk to you straight
text: from the shoulder.
text: They start out.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT SHERIFF AND MAYOR
text: As they start for the door it opens. As they exit Hildy
text: enters, almost crossing them but not quite noticing them as
text: she starts pounding her hands together and pacing up and
dialog: down Press Room.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT MAYOR AND SHERIFF
text: as they start down the hall, CAMERA TRUCKING WITH THEM.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (beside himself)
dialog: Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a
dialog: few hours before you make any
dialog: decisions. I'll get results. I'm
dialog: doing everything humanly possible.
dialog: I've just sworn in four hundred
dialog: deputies.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt
dialog: this administration?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (pleadingly)
dialog: I'm getting them for twelve dollars
dialog: a night.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic
dialog: uncles of yours?
dialog: (gesturing)
text: Out shooting everybody they see for
dialog: the fun of it?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (with dignity)
dialog: If you're talking about my brother-
dialog: in-law, he's worked for the city
dialog: fifteen years.
text: They come to the door of the Sheriff's office. Hartman opens
text: door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Hartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him
text: portentously.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Pete, you're through!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What do you mean -- through?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I mean I'm scratching your name off
dialog: the ticket Tuesday and running
dialog: Czernecki in your place. It's nothing
dialog: personal. And, Pete -- it's the only
dialog: way out. It's a sacrifice we all
dialog: ought to be glad to make.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (David to Jonathan)
dialog: Fred!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my
dialog: Sentimental side.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Fred, I don't know what to say. A
dialog: thing like this almost destroys a
dialog: man's faith in human nature.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I wish you wouldn't talk like that,
dialog: Pete.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Our families, Fred. I've always looked
dialog: on Bessie as my own sister.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (wavering and desperate)
dialog: If there was any way out...
text: As a phone rings:
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: There is a way out. I've got Williams
dialog: surrounded, haven't I? What more do
dialog: you want?
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello... Yes... Hello!
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing!
dialog: This is a man-hunt -- not a
dialog: banquet!... The twelve dollars
dialog: includes everything!!
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: That gives you an idea of what I'm
dialog: up against!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (hotly)
dialog: We're up against a lot more than
dialog: that with that nutty slogan you
dialog: invented: 'Reform the Reds With a
dialog: Rope'.
text: Sheriff winces.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Williams ain't a Red, and you know
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Well, there's a lot of Communistic
dialog: sympathizers around --
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I know it! But they've got nothing
dialog: to do with this case! Do you realize
dialog: there are two hundred thousand votes
dialog: at stake and unless we hang Earl
dialog: Williams we're going to lose 'em?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: But we're going to hang him, Fred.
text: He can't get away.
text: A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: What do you mean he can't get away?!
dialog: He got away, didn't he?
text: Knocking louder.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Who's out there?
speaker_heading: VOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS)
dialog: Is Sheriff Hartman in there?
text: Sheriff starts for door.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Ah! For me!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR
text: Sheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and
text: ineffectual man named Pinkus is there.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
text: (as he opens door,
dialog: disclosing Pinkus)
dialog: I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (coming in)
dialog: You're certainly a hard fellow to
dialog: find, Sheriff.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (taking a document
dialog: from his pocket and
dialog: proffering it to
dialog: Sheriff)
dialog: I'm a messenger at the State House.
dialog: This is from the Governor.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: What's from the Governor?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
text: The reprieve for Earl Williams.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: For who?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (amiably)
text: Earl Williams. The reprieve.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: W-wait a minute.
text: Getting his bearings.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (bursting forth)
dialog: The Governor gave me his word of
dialog: honor he wouldn't interfere. Two
dialog: days ago!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: And you fell for it, Pete. It
dialog: frightens me what I'd like to do to
dialog: you.
dialog: (to Pinkus)
dialog: Who else knows about this?
text: The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read
dialog: the thing.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
text: They were all standing around when
dialog: he wrote it. It was after they got
text: back from fishing.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (to Sheriff)
dialog: Get the Governor on the phone!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: You can't get him on the phone. He's
text: out duckshooting now.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you
dialog: like that. A guy does nothing more
dialog: strenuous for forty years than play
dialog: pinochle -- he gets elected Governor
dialog: and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (thrusting the document
dialog: at the Mayor)
dialog: Read it! Insane, he says.
dialog: (shaking a finger in
dialog: Pinkus' face)
dialog: He knows very well that Williams
dialog: ain't insane!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Yeah. But I --
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Pure politics!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: An attempt to ruin us!
text: The phone rings. Hartman starts for it.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: We got to think fast before those
text: lying reporters get hold of this.
dialog: What'll we tell 'em?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Tell 'em the party is through in
dialog: this State on account of you.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Ah, Fred --
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello... this is Hartman --
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (apoplectic)
dialog: And you can tell 'em as an
dialog: afterthought that I want your
dialog: resignation now!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (from the phone)
dialog: Sssh. Wait, Fred.
dialog: (excitedly, into phone)
dialog: What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: They got him!
dialog: (back to phone)
dialog: Wait a minute -- hold the wire.
dialog: (to the Mayor)
dialog: They got Earl Williams surrounded --
text: the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Tell 'em to hold the wire.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I did.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hold the wire.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Cover up that transmitter!
text: Sheriff does so. Mayor faces Cooney.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Now, listen! You never arrived here
dialog: with this -- reprieve. Get it?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (blinking)
dialog: Yes, I did, just now. Don't you
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: How much do you make a week?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: How much do you make a week? What's
dialog: your salary?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Forty dollars.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No -- don't out me off.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: How would you like to have a job for
dialog: three hundred and fifty dollars a
dialog: month. That's almost a hundred dollars
dialog: a week!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Who? Me?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Who do you think!
text: Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a
dialog: milder manner.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Now, listen. There's a fine opening
dialog: for a fellow like you in the City
dialog: Sealer's office.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: The City Sealer's office!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: You mean here in the city?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (foaming)
dialog: Yes, yes!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (at phone)
dialog: Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm
dialog: in conference.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (a very deliberate
dialog: intellect)
dialog: No, I couldn't do that.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: I couldn't work in the city. You
dialog: see, I've got my family in the
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: But you could bring 'em in here!
dialog: We'll pay all your expenses.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (with vast thought)
dialog: No, I don't think so.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: For heaven's sake, why not?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: I got two kids going to school there,
dialog: and if I changed them from one town
dialog: to another, they'd lose a grade.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain
dialog: one! And I guarantee that they'll
dialog: graduate with highest honors!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (lured)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen?
dialog: Hurry up, Fred!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Now what do you say?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: This puts me in a peculiar hole.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: No, it doesn't.
dialog: (hands him the reprieve)
dialog: Now, remember: you never delivered
dialog: this.
dialog: (rushing him to the
dialog: door)
dialog: You got caught in the traffic, or
dialog: something.
dialog: (opening door)
dialog: Now, get out of here and don't let
dialog: anybody see you.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: But how do I know...?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Come in and see me in my office
dialog: tomorrow. What's your name?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Pinkus.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (taking out his wallet)
dialog: All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've
dialog: got to do is lay low and keep your
dialog: mouth shut. Here!
dialog: (he hands him a card)
dialog: Go to this address. It's a nice,
dialog: homey little place, and they'll take
dialog: care of you for the night. Just tell
dialog: 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty
dialog: dollars on account.
text: He pushes money into Pinkus's hand and pushes him through
text: the door. Pinkus goes.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone,
dialog: desperately)
dialog: Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you
dialog: in a minute!
text: The door opens again and Pinkus comes back in.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: You forgot to tell me what a City
dialog: Sealer has to do.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
text: (turning hastily toward
dialog: Pinkus)
dialog: I'll explain it tomorrow!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Is it hard?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (pleadingly, into
dialog: phone)
dialog: Just one second --
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: That's good, because my health ain't
dialog: what it used to be.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (pushing him out the
dialog: door)
dialog: We'll fix that, too.
text: (he closes the door
dialog: after him)
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone -- one
dialog: more plea)
dialog: Just -- one -- second!
text: He turns to the Mayor with a gesture of appeal. The Mayor
text: closes the door and turns to Hartman.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (huskily)
dialog: All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Shoot to kill, I said.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I don't know, Fred. There's that
dialog: reprieve if they ever find out.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Nobody reprieved that policeman he
dialog: murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, Olsen... Listen...
dialog: (his voice is weak)
dialog: Shoot to kill... That's the orders
dialog: pass the word along... No! We dont
dialog: want him! And listen, Olsen, five-
dialog: hundred bucks for the guy that does
dialog: the job... Yes, I'll be right out
dialog: there.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Well, I hope that's the right thing
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Now take that guilty look off your
text: face, Pete -- and stop trembling
text: like a horse.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (mopping his brow)
dialog: If we didn't have election Tuesday
dialog: I'd have this on my conscience.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT
text: Louie comes from the direction of the stairs and crosses
text: toward door to Press Room. He pauses a moment, puts his hand
text: in his pocket, pulls out some bills, counts them and opens
text: the door.
scene_heading: INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT
text: Hildy is still pacing, pounding her hands together and
text: glancing every so often at the clock on the wall. Suddenly
text: she crosses to her phone, picks up transmitter --
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Will you try --
speaker_heading: LOUIE'S VOICE
dialog: Hildy.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (wheeling towards
dialog: door)
dialog: Louie!
text: She drops the phone and hurries towards him.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Have you got my dough?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with
dialog: it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut
dialog: your throat if you try any tricks!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: All right, all right. You can't blame
dialog: a guy for tryin', can you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Come on with that money!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: First you got to sign a receipt.
text: (he pulls out a receipt)
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Where's the money?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right
dialog: here.
dialog: (he picks out money
dialog: and counts)
dialog: One hundred -- two hundred -- three
dialog: hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty.
dialog: Now sign.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (grabs money and signs)
dialog: Here!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Thanks. So long, Hildy!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (grabbing him)
dialog: So long, nothing! Where's Bruce
dialog: Baldwin's wallet?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: None of that innocent stuff, you
dialog: double-crossing hyena! You stuck
dialog: Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon
dialog: on a phony charge that he swiped
dialog: your watch, and you frisked his
dialog: wallet! Now, give me that wallet or
dialog: I'll stick you in jail and it won't
dialog: be on any phony charge either! It'll
dialog: be for life!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't
dialog: know what you're talking about --
dialog: but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
text: He takes Bruce's wallet out.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (grabbing it)
dialog: You know it is!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I didn't frisk him. He must have
dialog: dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't
dialog: know whose it was.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No -- and you don't know that your
dialog: cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin
dialog: arrested again -- do you?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What -- already? Why, the dame left
dialog: only a minute before I did!
text: He suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door.
text: Hildy chucks something at him. It just misses as he ducks
text: out of the door.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Hildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes
text: another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to
dialog: dial.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: 27th Precinct Station House?
text: Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window.
text: She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive
text: and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He
text: carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been
text: playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (pointing gun at her)
dialog: Drop that phone --
text: Hildy drops the phone back on the hook.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (supporting himself
dialog: by holding on to
dialog: edge of desk)
dialog: You're not going to phone anybody
dialog: where I am.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (bracing herself)
dialog: Put down that gun, Earl.
text: He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You're not going to shoot me, Earl.
dialog: I'm your friend, remember? I've got
dialog: to write that story about your
dialog: "Production for Use".
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Yes -- that's right. Production for
dialog: use.
text: Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Earl, you don't want to hurt your
dialog: friends, do you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Don't move!
text: Hildy stops.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Maybe you're my friend and maybe
dialog: you're not -- but don't come any
dialog: nearer. You can't trust anybody in
dialog: this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I
dialog: could shoot you from here.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Sure you could, Earl -- but you
dialog: wouldn't want to do that, would you?
dialog: You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: No, no, you're right. I don't want
dialog: to kill anybody. All I want to do is
dialog: be let alone.
text: Hildy sneaks another step forward.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Earl, there's just one thing I ought
text: to clear up for the interview.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: What's that? Only -- you're getting
dialog: too near. I don't trust anybody.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I don't blame you, Earl.
dialog: (another step forward)
dialog: If I were in your place I wouldn't
dialog: trust anybody, either.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Keep away!
text: He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a
dialog: faint "click!"
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: I guess I used all the shells.
speaker_heading: CLOSE TWO SHOT
text: He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for
text: support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side
text: of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more
text: tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Earl, you must never do that again.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go
dialog: through another day like this.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (more her old self
dialog: now)
dialog: Well, maybe you think I could!
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in
text: her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades.
speaker_heading: EARL'S VOICE
dialog: I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin'
dialog: the fella that when he handed me the
dialog: gun.
text: Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the
text: lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light
text: from the areaway.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Don't talk too loud.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
text: (babbling on as she
dialog: moves about)
dialog: Wakin' me up in the middle of the
dialog: night -- talkin' to me about things
dialog: they don't understand. Callin' me a
dialog: Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's
dialog: got nothin' to do with bombs. It's
dialog: the philosophy that guarantees every
dialog: man freedom. You see that, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Sure I do, Earl.
text: Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: I wish they'd take me back and hang
dialog: me. I done my best.
text: He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands
text: for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half
text: carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him
text: in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!
text: Another phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the
text: receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP HILDY AT PHONE
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (into second phone)

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce,
dialog: the minute I turn him over to the
dialog: paper I'll be right down. Bruce,
dialog: don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I
dialog: can't, don't you realize?
text: There is a click from the phone. He has hung up. Hildy
text: dejectedly hangs up the phone. There is the sound of knocking
text: on the door. She springs up.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: taking in door. Hildy glares apprehensively, then crosses to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (cautiously)
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: MOLLIE'S VOICE
dialog: It's me, Mollie Malloy! Let me in.
text: Hildy carefully unlocks the door. Mollie bounds in like a
text: wildcat and seizes her.
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: Where are they gone? You know where
dialog: they are?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Wait a minute, Mollie.

text: CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: They got him surrounded some place --

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Mollie, they haven't got him. You
dialog: gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to
dialog: do something!
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: What do you mean?
text: There is a sound -- a groan -- as Williams starts to come
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: (spinning around)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Quiet, Mollie!
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: There's somethin' funny going on

speaker_heading: MED. SHOT

scene_heading: CLOSEUP EARL AND MOLLIE

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: HILDY

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Sure, Mollie, you never looked better

speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: (turning from phone)
dialog: Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks
dialog: good. An old lady just called the
dialog: detective bureau and claims Williams
dialog: is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've
dialog: looked every other place. Want to go
dialog: out on it?
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Aw, nuts with chasing around any

dialog: already.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: I say we don't go out any more. Let

speaker_heading: CLOSEUP HILDY
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest

dialog: lazy to go after it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT GROUP
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: It's easy for you to talk. You're

speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: Okay.

dialog: Forget it.
dialog: (he hangs up)
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What's the matter with you boys?
dialog: Afraid it might rain? If you want to
dialog: go, I'll cover this end.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound
dialog: pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are
dialog: you trying to scoop us or something?
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Something smells around here. If you
dialog: ask me Mollie gave her the story on
dialog: how Williams got that gun.
dialog: (turning on Mollie)
dialog: Did you smuggle that gun into
dialog: Williams, Mollie?
speaker_heading: MOLLIE
dialog: I didn't do nothin'.
speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: (crossing to Mollie)
dialog: Come clean, Mollie.
text: Wilson, Endicott and Murphy follow McCue toward Hildy.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Better let us in on it, Mollie.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Aw, why don't you let her alone?
dialog: She's ill!
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Oh, you two are pals now -- I think
dialog: you're right, Endicott. Mollie did
dialog: give her some kind of story.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We
dialog: better hold onto 'em both.

dialog: Mother, I can explain everything.
dialog: I'll go with you in five minutes and --
scene_heading: MRS. BALDWIN

speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Hold on to her, Jimmy -- she's in
dialog: with Hildy on this.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MRS. BALDWIN

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Who you holding out on? Come clean,
dialog: or we'll make you wish you had --
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: as the rest of the reporters surround Hildy menacingly.
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: (to Hildy)

speaker_heading: WILSON

speaker_heading: HILDY

scene_heading: MOLLIE AND REPORTERS

dialog: for the door.
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Look out! Close that door! etc.,
dialog: etc.
text: They split, some of them heading her off at door, others

speaker_heading: MCCUE
dialog: You ain't gettin' out o' here!
speaker_heading: ENDICOTT
dialog: Now, where is he?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Where you hidin' him?
speaker_heading: MOLLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLIE

dialog: I mean it!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You drooling idiot! What do you mean,
dialog: you're getting out! There are three

text: under the same old gang and with

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (the fire upon her)
dialog: I'd like to think.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, think it then, because it's

speaker_heading: HILDY

speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You've kicked over the whole City

dialog: And you stand there belly-aching

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What do I know about Williams?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN

speaker_heading: HARTMAN

text: Burns comes into scene.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (easily)
dialog: I can explain that, Hartman. When

dialog: Earl Williams I thought it might be
dialog: dangerous and I gave her a gun to
dialog: defend herself.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very
dialog: interesting. This happens to be the
dialog: gun that Earl Williams shot his way
dialog: out with!
speaker_heading: REPORTERS AD LIB
dialog: What? What's that? Etc...
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (advancing on Sheriff)

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I'll give you three minutes to tell

dialog: He went over to the hospital to call

speaker_heading: BURNS

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Sheriff)

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns,
dialog: you're guilty of obstructing justice
dialog: and so is the Morning Post. I'm going
dialog: to see that the Post is fined ten
dialog: thousand dollars for this.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: You'll see nothing of the kind,
dialog: Sheriff.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: We'll just start by impounding the

speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: You will, eh? Well, we'll see about
dialog: that.
dialog: (to deputies)
dialog: All right, boys. Take it.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal
dialog: offense.
dialog: (to deputy nearest

dialog: And you'll be an accessory!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: We'll take a chance on that, Burns.

speaker_heading: HARTMAN

dialog: Hello, girlie -- gimme Cooley. Quick!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Hartwell, you're going to wish you'd

text: The Mayor comes into scene.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Fine work, Pete! You certainly
dialog: delivered the goods. I'm proud of
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (holding the phone)
dialog: Look kind o' natural, don't they,
dialog: Fred?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (happily)
dialog: A sight for sore eyes!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (rolling in catnip)
dialog: Aiding an escaped criminal! And a
dialog: little charge of kidnapping I'm
dialog: looking into.
dialog: (into phone; suddenly)
dialog: But that's the jail! There must be
dialog: somebody there!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Well! Looks like about ten years
dialog: apiece for you birds!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Does it? You forget the power that
text: always watches over the Morning Post.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Your luck's not with you now!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Cooley?... I caught Williams single-
dialog: handed -- we're going to proceed
dialog: with the hanging per schedule!
text: He wiggles the hook for another call.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Mayor)
dialog: You're going to be in office for
dialog: exactly two days more and then we're
dialog: pulling your nose out of the feed
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Give me the District Attorney's
dialog: office.
dialog: (to Burns)
dialog: I'll tell you what you'll be doing --
dialog: making brooms in the State
dialog: penitentiary.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell.
dialog: Come over to my office, will you?
dialog: I've just arrested a couple of
dialog: important birds and I want to take
dialog: their confessions.
text: He hangs up. Burns makes a sudden lunge for the Morning Post
text: phone and cries into it.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: All the lawyers in the world aren't
dialog: going to help you!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: This is the Morning Post you're
dialog: talking to!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (enjoying himself)
dialog: The power of the press, huh!
text: He laughs. Pinkus, the Governor's messenger, plentifully
text: stewed, reels in the door. He approaches the Mayor and Sheriff
text: who have their backs to him.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (at the Mayor)
dialog: Bigger men than you have found out
dialog: what the power of the press is...
dialog: President!... Yes -- and Kings!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (woozy; handing Sheriff
dialog: the reprieve over
dialog: his shoulder)
dialog: Here's your reprieve.
text: The Mayor and Sheriff spin around.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (in a panic)
dialog: Get out of here!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: You can't bribe me!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: Get out of here, you!
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: I won't. Here's your reprieve.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: I don't want to be City Sealer. I
dialog: don't like seals anyhow. They smell.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Who is this man?
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (to an officer)
dialog: Throw him out, Frank.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (seizing Pinkus with
dialog: her free hand)
dialog: Who was bribing you?
text: Burns also seizes Pinkus who is being pulled out of shape.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: They wouldn't take it.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: You're insane!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: What did I tell you? An unseen power!
dialog: (to Pinkus)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Silas F. Pinkus.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The
dialog: idea of coming here with a cock-and-
dialog: bull story like that!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Wait a minute!
dialog: (to the officers)
dialog: Let go there!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Sheriff and Mayor)
dialog: Murder, uh?
speaker_heading: HILDY
text: Hanging an innocent man to win an
dialog: election!
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: That's a lie!!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I never saw him before!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (to Pinkus)
dialog: When did you deliver this first?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Who did you talk to?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: They started right in bribing me!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Who's 'they'?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (indicating the Mayor
dialog: and Sheriff)
dialog: Them!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: That's absurd on the face of it, Mr.
text: Burns! He's talking like a child.
speaker_heading: BURNS
text: Out of the mouths of babes.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
text: He's insane or drunk or something.
dialog: Why, if this unfortunate man,
dialog: Williams, has really been reprieved,
dialog: I personally am tickled to death.
dialog: Aren't you, Pete?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Go on, you'd kill your mother to get
dialog: elected!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: That's a horrible thing to say, Miss
dialog: Johnson, about anybody!
dialog: (to Burns)
dialog: Now, look here, Walter, you're an
dialog: intelligent man --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Just a minute.
dialog: (to Pinkus)
dialog: All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have
dialog: your story.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Well, I been married for ten years
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Skip all that.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Take those handcuffs off our friends,
dialog: Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (springing to obey)
dialog: I was just going to!
text: He gets the key from the officer.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Walter, I can't tell you how badly I
dialog: feel about this. There was no excuse
text: for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (unlocking the
dialog: handcuffs)
dialog: I was only doing my duty. Nothing
dialog: personal in it.
dialog: They are set free.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You guys better quit politics and
dialog: take in washing.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (looking over the
dialog: reprieve)
dialog: Sheriff, this document is authentic!
text: Earl Williams has been reprieved,
dialog: this Commonwealth has been spared
dialog: the painful necessity of shedding
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Save that for the Tribune.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (to Pinkus)
dialog: What did you say your name was --
dialog: Pinkus?
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: That's right.
text: He shows the Mayor a locket.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: Here's the picture of my wife.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
text: A very fine-looking women.
speaker_heading: PINKUS
dialog: (mysteriously angered)
dialog: She's good enough for me! And if I
dialog: was to go home and tell my wife --
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus,
dialog: and as long as I am Mayor --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Which ought to be about three hours
dialog: more, I'd say.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Just until we can get out a special
dialog: edition asking for your impeachment.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: And your arrest. You'll each get
dialog: about ten years, I think.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr.
dialog: Burns, you might run into a thumping
dialog: big libel suit.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: You're going to run into the Governor.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (trying to brush it
dialog: off)
dialog: Now, my old friend the Governor and
dialog: I understand each other perfectly.
speaker_heading: HARTMAN
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: And so do I!
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (with superb contempt)
dialog: So do you what, you hoodoo!
dialog: (to Pinkus, suavely)
dialog: And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come
dialog: with us, we'll take you over to the
dialog: Warden's office and deliver this
dialog: reprieve.
text: The Sheriff, Pinkus and the Mayor go out of scene.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Wait till those two future jailbirds
dialog: read the Morning Post tomorrow.
text: Walter turns to Hildy and they suddenly smile at each other.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: How was that for a tight squeeze?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Don't tell me you were worried!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Worried! I was petrified. Weren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Uh-uh. As long as we were in there
dialog: together pitching -- they couldn't
dialog: lick us. Well, it's been a lot of
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: In a way.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I mean -- working together. Just
dialog: like the old days. The things we've
dialog: been through, Hildy.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: We've certainly been in some swell
text: jams.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Remember the time we broke into the
dialog: D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi
dialog: Randell's diary?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Yeah. What about the time we hid the
text: missing heiress in the sauerkraut
dialog: factory? Six scoop interviews!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Yeah - but that time we stole Old
text: Lady Haggerty's stomach off the
dialog: Coroner's physician. We proved she
dialog: was poisoned though, didn't we?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: We sure did, but we had to go in
text: hiding for a week.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only
dialog: chaperon was the poor old lady's
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Don't remind me. That's how we
dialog: happened to --
text: She breaks off. There is a moment's pause.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be
text: making love to another man's fiancee.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: That's all right, Walter. It's as
dialog: much my fault as yours.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (glancing at the clock)
text: Bruce is making the nine o'clock
dialog: train. I told him you'd be on it --
dialog: unless you want to write this story
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, if it's my last story, I'd
dialog: like it to be a good one. But -- I
dialog: guess I can't, Walter.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for
dialog: me to decide. Of course, you could
dialog: make a later train and still be in
dialog: Albany tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: He's going to have you the rest of
dialog: his life, Hildy. Can't you give me
dialog: another hour?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: I don't know what to do, Walter.
speaker_heading: BURNS
text: Flip a coin.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: All right.
dialog: (takes coin from her
dialog: bag)
dialog: Heads I go -- tails I stay to write
dialog: the story. Ready?
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BURNS
text: gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Ready.
text: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
text: She flips and catches the coin. She holds it tightly clasped
text: in her hand, afraid to look. They stare at each other a
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Well -- what is it?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (almost breaking)
dialog: What's the difference? I'm going to
dialog: write that story -- and you know it!
text: She puts the coin away without looking at it. Burns rushes
text: to her, tries to take her in his arms.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Hildy!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (furiously)
dialog: Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Then why are you doing it?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven

speaker_heading: BURNS

speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: And what a way to quit. While you're
dialog: still champion! That's the way to
dialog: leave, Hildy!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving,
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting
dialog: for you in Albany.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: No, he won't. I wired him that I
dialog: wasn't coming.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BURNS
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Where'd you wire him?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: On the nine o'clock train. That's
dialog: the one he took, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs
dialog: a wife who can give him a home --
dialog: and affection -- and peace. I couldn't
dialog: do that for him, Walter. I'm what
dialog: you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd
dialog: give up her soul for a story!... Is
dialog: that job still open?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper --
dialog: and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We
dialog: tried it.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful!
dialog: Only you expected it to be like other
dialog: marriages. It can't be like other
dialog: marriages -- we're different! We're
dialog: a different world. Look at what we
dialog: went through today. I wouldn't trade
dialog: that for any honeymoon in the world.
dialog: I bet you wouldn't, either.
speaker_heading: HILDY
text: A fine honeymoon, with a murderer
dialog: right in the boudoir! And that other
dialog: honeymoon in a coal mine!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: That's what makes it romantic. Every
text: other married couple goes away on a
dialog: honeymoon and for two weeks the bride
dialog: knows just where the groom is, and
dialog: vice versa. But us -- you never know
dialog: where I am and I'm not sure where
dialog: you are. That's Romance!
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, maybe I'd like to know just
dialog: once!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Hildy, if that's what you want, all
dialog: right. We'll even go to -- how about
dialog: Niagara Falls?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: (jumping)
dialog: Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't
dialog: mean that?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sure I do. And I'll tell you something
dialog: else -- I'd like a baby.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Walter!
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Sure, I can't last forever. I want a
dialog: son I can train to take my place on
dialog: this paper.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What would you do if it was a
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Well, if she looked like you -- Say!
dialog: My brains and your looks -- that
dialog: mightn't be such a bad combination.
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: What's the matter with my brains?
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: What's the good of arguing about
dialog: something that probably doesn't exist?
dialog: Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you.
dialog: What do you say?
speaker_heading: HILDY
dialog: Well, I'd like to be lady-like and
dialog: think it over.
speaker_heading: BURNS
