scene_heading: WAR ON DRUGS. NANCY REAGAN. CRACK. DARYL GATES. CRIPS &amp;
text: BLOODS. Everything from KNIVES to PISTOLS to ASSAULT RIFLES.

scene_heading: 2 EXT. BROWN HOUSE - COMPTON - NIGHT 2
text: A bucket pulls up in front of a shitty-looking BROWN HOUSE
text: with ugly bars on the windows and doors. A rusted swing-set
text: leans sideways on the dirt/grass they call a front lawn.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: COMPTON, CA 1986
text: Inside the car is ERIC WRIGHT, 21, but you know him as --
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: ERIC WRIGHT AKA EAZY-E
text: A man who is completely in his element -- comfortable and
text: poised, ready for anything.
text: He hops out of the car, moves quickly to the TRUNK -- pops it
text: open and reaches inside. With an electric screwdriver, Eazy
text: unscrews a CERWIN-VEGA sub-woofer. Grabs a bulging BROWN BAG
text: out of the speaker... and a 9mm -- SLAMS the trunk.
text: ON THE ROOF, a LOOKOUT clocks Eazy as he walks up to the
text: front door of the decrepit house...
text: Eazy KNOCKS BY CODE. A dude, TONE (20s), opens a slat in the
text: door. Gauges Eazy, EYES SKEPTICAL.
speaker_heading: TONE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Eric! Man, we been through this
dialog: shit a thousand times.
text: Multiple DEADBOLTS UNLOCK and an irritated Eazy enters --
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the use to having this dumb
dialog: ass knock if I gotta tell you my
dialog: name anyway?
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: 3 INT. BROWN HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 3
text: It's not what you'd call "cozy." The carpet is torn up,
text: stained, cigarette-burnt. Walls covered in TAGS. A PITBULL
text: stares menacingly from the kitchen.
text: In addition to Eazy and Tone, there are THREE other people
text: spread around the room: one GIRL lounges on a vinyl couch,
text: eyes glazed; another girl, TASHA, loudly SCRAPES soul food
text: onto the pitbull's plate; and a JITTERY DUDE steady keeps an
text: EYE out the WINDOW, tense, occasionally clocking --
text: EAZY spreads the CONTENTS of the BROWN BAG before them on a
text: long TABLE: three FREEZER BAGS each containing 10 ounces. He
text: looks up, ALL BUSINESS.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Now where the money at?
speaker_heading: TONE
dialog: Man, you heard what happen? My best
dialog: runner got cracked. They sent his
dialog: young ass to Y.A. --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: The fuck that got to do with me?
text: Tone turns to Tasha in the kitchen, nods.
speaker_heading: TONE
dialog: Tasha, get this dude a 40.
text: TASHA opens the fridge, grabs a 40oz. --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Do I look thirsty to you?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where my ends at?
text: -- hands it to Tone who CRACKS it open. Drinks...
speaker_heading: TONE
dialog: Why you so ruthless, Eric, damn!
dialog: You don't want nothin' to drink?
dialog: What you want --
dialog: (re: the girls)
dialog: -- you want some pussy?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Yep. But not from these strawberry
dialog: bitches you got right here.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: TONE
dialog: So you just gonna disrespect my
dialog: house like that, Cuz?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Dumb ass, this a dope house! It's
text: already disrespected.
speaker_heading: JITTERY DUDE
dialog: (re: Eazy's drugs)
dialog: Well fuck it then -- You gonna have
dialog: to let us hold on to that right
dialog: there.
text: ON THE COUCH, the GIRL grabs a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN FROM UNDER A
text: PILLOW. Levels it at Eazy, face grimaced, hard, strung out.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Yeah, do what you gotta do --
dialog: `Cause I got my homies parked
dialog: across the street from your momma's
dialog: house. I don't show up. They show
dialog: out...
text: Eazy just stares right back at them. The tension's like a
text: pressure cooker about to burst. Until --
text: A WHISTLE echoes in from outside (THE LOOKOUT) --
text: Suddenly, everyone notices a deep RUMBLING coming from
text: outside. Jittery Dude steps back from the window, eyes wide --
speaker_heading: JITTERY DUDE
dialog: Oh, shit --
text: Because there's a MASSIVE ARMORED VEHICLE rolling down the
text: street toward them. 6 TONS of steel, with a 14-foot BATTERING
text: RAM mounted on the front. LAPD emblazoned on the side.
speaker_heading: JITTERY DUDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuckin' Batter-Ram!
text: Everyone in the room FLIES into action, STASHING the WEAPONS
text: and the MONEY into hidden STASH SPOTS all over the HOUSE:
text: Behind fake-panel LIGHT SWITCHES, hidden HATCHES beneath the
text: FLOORBOARDS, in a fake-panel inside the FRIDGE. It's some
text: serious MACGYVER SHIT.
text: Eazy grabs his ROCKS, BEE-LINES for the BACK of the HOUSE,
text: eyes wide, amped on adrenaline as the RUMBLING ESCALATES to
text: an almost UNBEARABLE LEVEL --
text: CRASH!!! The 14-foot BATTERING RAM PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL.
text: DEBRIS FLIES EVERYWHERE. The RAM keeps coming until --
dialog: 4.
text: The GIRLS SCREAM! The ARMORED VEHICLE REVERSES, the BATTERING
text: RAM POLE YANKING THE ENTIRE WALL OUT WITH IT, leaving a
text: MASSIVE RAGGED HOLE where we can see --
text: SQUAD CARS SWARMING INTO THE AREA,
text: COPS FLOODING TOWARD THE
text: HOUSE -- lots of YELLING as they
dialog: PIN everyone to the floor, it's too
text: late, nobody can escape; nobody but
dialog: --
text: EAZY-E kicks out a KITCHEN window, squeezes through, hits the
text: dirt on the side of the house. Sprints past --
text: A PITBULL! The GROWLING DOG hustles for Eazy as a FLASHLIGHT
text: hits Eazy's back, a COP giving chase!
text: As they race across the back yard, the Pitbull diverts to the
text: cop, who panics. He's about to get mauled until --
text: ANOTHER COP pops around the corner! Blasts the dog with a
text: FIRE EXTINGUISHER, filling the air with a dense cloud of
dialog: expellant, as --
text: Eazy hops on a fence, hits the garage roof and jumps in a
text: neighbor's yard. Gone. He lives to slang another day...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: But the SOUNDS OF CHAOS carry over, infiltrate the inky
text: black: SIRENS HOWLING. PEOPLE SHOUTING. HELICOPTERS BUZZING.
text: DOGS BARKING. A mad medley that continues into --
scene_heading: 4 INT. VERNA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - COMPTON - DAY 4
text: A PAIR OF OVERSIZED HEADPHONES, worn by ANDRE YOUNG. Better
dialog: known as Â­-
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: ANDRE YOUNG AKA DR. DRE
text: Eyes closed, lying on his bed, slight smile pursing his lips,
text: he bobs his head as --
text: WE HEAR WHAT HE HEARS, treated to the beautiful mind of Dre.
text: THE SOUNDS OF CHAOS are evaporated, seemingly synthesized
text: into the dope melody Dre's peacefully bobbing his head to...
text: WE HEAR the multi-tracks of the song -- levels go up and down
text: based on Dre's subtle FACIAL REACTIONS to the various sounds.
text: He singles out INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS, and as he does, WE HEAR
text: them, highlighting some sounds, decreasing others: BASS,
text: DRUMS, PIANO, VOICE... It's pure instinct, pure joy. Until --
dialog: 5.
text: BAM-BAM! A fist on a locked door. The music stops as Dre
text: removes his headphones. We now see --
text: DRE'S ROOM, populated with turn tables -- one side spinning
text: the record he's listening to -- DJ station and a vast sea of
dialog: LPs (sure there's Parliament, but also Duke Ellington)
text: scattered around the room. A music junkie's paradise.
text: On the other bed, his brother TYREE (17) chills as Dre opens
dialog: the door to find --
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: What happened?
text: VERNA GRIFFIN, 36, his Mother, and she can smell bullshit a
text: mile away. He flashes his smooth, easy, magnetic Dre-smile.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: What happened with what?
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: Andre, boy, don't play with me. Do
dialog: you even care how it makes me look?
dialog: Call in favors to get your
dialog: thoughtless ass an interview? And
dialog: you can't even show up?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: (sighs, realizing)
dialog: Sorry, I just been so focused on
dialog: this DJing that I forgot --
text: She frowns, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: You have a child, Andre. And
dialog: spinning records ain't payin' none
dialog: of the bills around here right now.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: That ain't even true, momma. I get
dialog: paid --
text: He pulls out a sad little wad of bills, waves it in her face.
text: Quick as lightning, she SNATCHES it away from him --
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: Fifty dollars? Damn, you a
dialog: billionaire!
text: -- THROWS it back at his chest.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: It's a start --
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: Andre, you know the rules around
dialog: here. In this house, you gonna work
dialog: or go to school. I don't care if
dialog: you gonna be a janitor --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: -- long as I own the company. Yeah,
dialog: I know.
text: Dre fumes, gather the bills off the floor, heads for the
dialog: kitchen --
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: But you don't own the company.
dialog: Lonzo does.
text: -- but Verna stays hot on his heels --
speaker_heading: VERNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you think we're done here?
text: Dre keeps going, MUTTERS under his breath -- She grabs his
text: shoulder, SPINS him around, strong. Gets in his face.
speaker_heading: VERNA (CONT'D)
dialog: You got somethin' to say to me!?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: You don't care what I'm fighting
dialog: for.
dialog: I already know what I wanna do with my life, and it
dialog: definitely ain't sittin in a cubicle takin' orders on some
dialog: stupid ass job.
text: Verna's eyes FLASH -- WHAP! She SLAPS HIM IN THE FACE --
text: Dre steps back, puts his hand to his cheek. Verna's reeling
text: as much as he is. She tries to compose herself.
speaker_heading: VERNA
dialog: People used to tell me I was too
dialog: young when I had you -- Said I
dialog: wouldn't be shit, said you wouldn't
dialog: be shit. Now I been workin' my ass
dialog: off to get us here and I refuse to
dialog: let you throw it all away.
text: Dre holds Verna's gaze a moment longer, then turns and calmly
text: walks back past her, into his room. He picks up his
text: headphones, pull-out car stereo. Heads for the door, opens
dialog: it...
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: VERNA (CONT'D)
dialog: (regret)
dialog: Andre --
text: But he's already closed the door behind him.
scene_heading: 5 INT./EXT. VERNA'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 5
text: Dre bounds over to a battered BLUE &amp; WHITE DATSUN B-210
text: parked in the DRIVEWAY, regret settling in. He looks up to
text: see Tyree ambling closer, carrying a bundle of errantly-
text: selected clothes, a crate of records.
speaker_heading: TYREE
dialog: Grabbed some of your stuff, man.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Good lookin' out.
text: Dre takes the clothes. Tosses them in the back.
speaker_heading: TYREE
dialog: When you comin' back?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: I don't know. Gotta figure some
dialog: things out.
speaker_heading: TYREE
dialog: Can I come with you?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You been fightin' for your own room
dialog: this whole time and now you wanna
dialog: come with me?
text: They share a CHUCKLE. Then --
speaker_heading: TYREE
dialog: You know she's just want the best
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: I know, T. I want the best for me
dialog: too -- that's way I gotta go.
text: Him and Dre have special brother-to-brother embrace. Then Dre
text: hops into his car.
speaker_heading: DRE (CONT'D)
dialog: When I get set up right, I'mma have
dialog: you come with me. Don't worry about
dialog: it. It's gonna be sooner then you
dialog: think.
dialog: 8.
text: Tyree sullenly nods.
text: Dre triggers the ignition, MUSIC BLASTING, and PEELS away --
speaker_heading: DRE (CONT'D)
dialog: Call you later.
scene_heading: 6 INT./EXT. DRE'S CAR - COMPTON - MINUTES LATER 6
text: Dre rolls along in that ugly-ass Datsun. It's still early,
text: but the STREETS are starting to FILL UP. Dudes in doorways,
text: on the corners, clocking him as he passes. An LA SHERIFF'S
text: DEPT. SQUAD CAR slides past, disappears around a corner.
text: WE HEAR a HELICOPTER SOUND, as WE GO WIDE --
scene_heading: 7 EXT. LOS ANGELES - WAY UP IN THE SKY - DAY 7
text: Flying high over the city, it's quiet up here, only the sound
text: of WIND. BELOW, we see the tight grids of SOUTH LOS ANGELES,
text: and the densely-packed TRAFFIC heading north along the 110
text: FREEWAY, as it angles toward the SKYSCRAPERS of DOWNTOWN L.A.
text: We move NORTH and there's DODGER STADIUM plunked at the
text: southern tip of ELYSIAN PARK, and the LA RIVER twisting
text: snakelike up into GRIFFITH PARK --
text: And NORTHWEST past the mountains of Griffith, descending into
text: the VALLEY, where we suddenly DIVE DOWN into WOODLAND HILLS
text: and settle upon the low-slung sprawl of --
scene_heading: 8 INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - TAFT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 8
text: We track backward through a school bus full of STUDENTS.
text: Almost exclusively black and Latino kids. Late 80's fashions.
text: All the way in the BACK ROW we settle on O'SHEA JACKSON, who
dialog: we now know as --
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: O'SHEA JACKSON AKA ICE CUBE
text: Raiders cap pulled low over a shoulder-length Jheri curl.
text: Hunched over, wearing a soon-to-be-iconic FROWN of
text: concentration, he SCRIBBLES LYRICS into a NOTEBOOK:
text: "BORED AS HELL AND I WANNA GET ILL. SO I WENT TO THE SPOT
scene_heading: WHERE MY HOMEBOYS CHILL --"
text: The ROAR of a powerful sports car snaps Cube's concentration.
text: He gazes out the school bus window to see that --
text: In stark contrast to those on the bus, just beyond the glass
text: is a sea of WHITE STUDENTS. They hang out, shoot the shit in
text: their nice clothes, hop into their nice cars. It's a club
text: that Cube isn't a part of and it's clear that he can feel it.
dialog: 9.
text: He frowns, looks back down at his notebook as the bus pulls
dialog: away from Taft High...
scene_heading: 9 INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - LATER 9
text: The BUS cruises Southbound on Crenshaw. And compared to the
text: Valley, it looks like BEIRUT out there: Graffiti tags, liquor
text: stores everywhere, boarded-up shops, DUDES loitering,
text: drinking, slanging. Crip throws a rock and hits the bus.
text: FIND CUBE sitting halfway back, still doing his thing,
text: writing rhymes, minding his own.
text: NEAR HIM, a few KIDS goof around, flash GANG SIGNS out the
text: window at the passing CARS, PEDESTRIANS, not noticing --
scene_heading: A10 INT./EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS A10
text: Pulling out of a side street onto Crenshaw, we see two hard-
text: looking O.G. BLOODS. As the bus passes, they CLOCK THE KIDS
text: flashing SIGNS. They can't believe it. Driver Grits his
text: teeth. SPEEDS OUT after the bus --
scene_heading: 10 INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - MOMENTS LATER 10
text: The bus rolls to a stop. Before any KIDS can get off -- the
text: O.G. Bloods' truck pulls in front of the bus, blocking the
text: road. Passenger hops out.
text: Noticing, the BUS DRIVER goes to shut the doors, but he's too
text: late -- O.G. Blood gets on, strides past the BUS DRIVER --
text: glock 9mm in hand.
speaker_heading: BUS DRIVER
dialog: Hey what's going on? --
speaker_heading: O.G. BLOOD
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Blood!
dialog: (Addresses the whole bus)
dialog: You young muthafuckas wanna die
dialog: today?!
text: Everyone on the bus falls SILENT. By the shocked expression
dialog: on the kids' faces, they have no clue how or if they're gonna
dialog: get out of this alive.
speaker_heading: O.G. BLOOD (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: HUH!?
text: He makes his way back to the WANNABE KIDS near the
text: expressionless Cube. Sensing shit is about to jump off, Cube
text: slowly reaches for the WINDOW next to him, starts SLIDING IT
text: OPEN. He edges closer to the window, grabs his NOTEBOOK,
text: fully prepared to jump the fuck out that window.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: O.G. BLOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: You little Crab ass niggas could've
dialog: got this whole bus shot the fuck
dialog: up! We saw that bullshit you was
dialog: throwing up out the window! Hit me
dialog: up now!
speaker_heading: WANNABE KID 1
dialog: Didn't mean nothin' by it -- just
dialog: playing around.
speaker_heading: O.G. BLOOD
dialog: That's yo muthafuckin problem,
dialog: Blood! This shit ain't nuthin' ta
dialog: play wit! It's real in the field,
dialog: nigga! Shit's life and death! I
dialog: kill Crips for breakfast, Blood! So
dialog: keep yo' mothafuckin hand down when
dialog: you see me, Understand?!
speaker_heading: WANNABE KID 1
dialog: Yes.
text: The O.G. Blood looks over his shoulder, scowls at all the
text: terrified faces staring back at him.
speaker_heading: O.G. BLOOD
dialog: What you little muthafuckas need to
dialog: do is start gangbang them got damn
dialog: books! Learn some shit better then
dialog: what we doing! If not, I might be
dialog: the one that kill yo' dumb ass!
dialog: Remember me! This that Crenshaw
dialog: Mafia, Blood!
text: And with that, the O.G. Blood tucks his gun, and calmly exits
text: the bus -- leaving behind the stunned kids.
text: Their truck pulls away into traffic.
text: Cube grab his books, get up to exit the bus along with a few
text: others, but not before glancing over at the kids, who sit
text: there sweating, shell-shocked.
text: Cube shakes his head at the wannabes. No way he's going out
dialog: like that.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY 11
text: Cube walks along the streets, Pee Chee folder and notebooks
text: in hand, books under his arm as --
dialog: 11.
text: We're given tour of the sights and sounds of South Central.
text: The pervasive shudder of LAPD CHOPPERS TAUNT OVERHEAD, DOGS
text: BARKING, as an LAPD SQUAD CAR CRUISES MENACINGLY PAST like a
text: shark in festive waters.
text: Up ahead, BLOCK DUDES loiter on a neighbor's untended grass.
speaker_heading: BLOCK DUDE 1
dialog: Aw shit, here come Doug E. Fresh!
speaker_heading: BLOCK DUDE 2
dialog: Hell naw, that's Kurtis mothafuckin

speaker_heading: ICE CUBE

text: They smile, give Cube a pound as he passes. Yell after him.
speaker_heading: BLOCK DUDE 1
dialog: Why you never hang out no more?
speaker_heading: BLOCK DUDE 2
dialog: I think it's that Valley school.
dialog: Nigga too good for us.
text: But Cube just smiles, looks back at them --
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Nah, I already know how to
dialog: gangbang. I'm just tryin' to learn
dialog: how to make some of this white
dialog: people money.
speaker_heading: BLOCK DUDE 2
dialog: I feel you, Cuz. I need some white
dialog: people money too.
speaker_heading: ICE CUBE
dialog: Well take yo' ass to school
dialog: sometimes.
text: The Dudes laugh as Cube continues on. Keeps moving.
text: UP AHEAD, he sees Dre's DATSUN parked across the street. No
dialog: question where Cube's headed.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: A12 INT. JINX'S HOUSE - EVENING A12
text: Cube walks through the LIVING ROOM, where Dre's girlfriend,
text: LAVETTA, is feeding their baby TYRA (2) --
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Where Dre at?
text: She points to the back room.
scene_heading: 12 INT. JINX'S HOUSE - JINX'S ROOM - NIGHT 12
text: JINX'S ROOM, dirty but very hip-hop. JINX, 17, is digging
text: through a crate of RECORDS, and offering them up to DRE, who
dialog: waves most of them away because --
text: DRE'S IN THE ZONE, doing his thing on the turntables, mixing,
text: SCRATCHING. And whatever it is sounds DOPE. Next-level shit.
text: Cube enters -- Lets the SONIC ACROBATICS BOOMING from Dre's
text: turntables marinate on him a minute.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: What you mixin'?
text: Dre, lost in the music, doesn't respond -- Jinx holds up two
scene_heading: ALBUM COVERS: The Ohio Players' FUNKY WORM and The
text: Headhunters' GOD MADE ME FUNKY. Doesn't make sense, yet --
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: (blown away)
dialog: Ohio Players and the Headhunters..?
dialog: (to Dre) That's the shit!
speaker_heading: JINX
dialog: Crazy, right!
text: Dre finally notices Cube's in front of him --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Wuddup, Cube! Got them rhymes?
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: You know it.
text: Cube flashes the SHEET OF LYRICS from school at Dre, notices
text: the trash bag full of clothes on the floor.
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stayin' a while?
speaker_heading: JINX
dialog: Yup. His momma kicked him out for
dialog: that mouth.

speaker_heading: CUBE

speaker_heading: DRE

speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Damn straight.
speaker_heading: DRE

speaker_heading: CUBE

dialog: The fuck you lookin' at?
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Nothin'. Just goin' home --
speaker_heading: CRASH COP 1
dialog: Get over here! Now!
text: Hesitant, Cube complies. Used to getting jacked by the

text: are in: hands on the hood, legs back.
text: One of the other Crash Cops pulls out his WALKIE --
speaker_heading: CRASH COP 2

text: Requesting backup on Van Wick

speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: How you figure we in a gang? `Cause
dialog: we black?
text: BAM! Crash Cop 1 shoves Cube against the car, kicking his
text: legs apart, a hand on the back of his head. Cube's NOTEBOOKS
dialog: hit the pavement -- Get trampled.
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo watch my notebooks!
speaker_heading: CRASH COP 1
dialog: Where the rocks at, Cuz?
speaker_heading: BLOCK DUDE 1
dialog: Ain't no rocks! Y'all muthafuckas

speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Officer, can you please explain why
dialog: you jackin' us?
speaker_heading: CRASH COP 2
dialog: We don't have to explain shit!
text: Block Dude 1 HOWLS in pain as Crash Cop 2 viciously SQUEEZES
text: his interlocked knuckles. Crash Cop 1 shoots a look to
dialog: Uniform Cop 2: Settle down, dude!
text: TWO MORE SQUAD CARS SCREECH onto the scene. Four UNIFORMED
text: POLICE climb out, to make an even bigger deal out of nothing.
text: Cube's Dad, HOSIE, appears up on the porch, pissed.
speaker_heading: HOSIE JACKSON
dialog: Hey! What the hell's goin' on out
dialog: here? Those boys all live on this

dialog: (re: Cube)
dialog: Officer, that's my son!
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP 2
dialog: Get back inside, ma'am!
text: But she starts coming down the steps toward the Cop -- He
text: UNSNAPS his holster, hand grasping his pistol.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: DORIS JACKSON
dialog: I just wanna know what's going on --
text: The COP jams a FINGER inches away from Doris' face!
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP 2

text: Doris' mouth drops open. The disrespect is incredible.
speaker_heading: ICE CUBE

speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP 1
dialog: You think we give a fuck? This

speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP 2
dialog: All right, they check out. We got
dialog: cards on all of `em already.
dialog: (to Cube and Co.)
dialog: Stay out of trouble.
text: The cops pile back into their cars leaving behind the stunned

speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Thanks for the tip, homie.
text: The Security Guard frowns as he allows them into --
scene_heading: 15 THE MAIN FLOOR 15
text: MUSIC PUMPING, we FOLLOW EAZY and REN into the CLUB, which is
text: PACKED, people partying their asses off. Everyone's here:
scene_heading: REGULAR FOLKS, BLOODS, SKINNY GIRLS, BIG GIRLS, DEALERS,
text: ATHLETES. A true hood cross-section.
text: AS WE MOVE through the place, we see CUBE, JINX and TYREE
text: standing near the wall: JINX and TYREE are busy clocking the
text: GIRLS, but CUBE is studying a ripped-out page of LYRICS.
text: ON STAGE, wearing purple satin jackets with WORLD CLASS
text: WRECKIN CRU on the back, DRE spins some `80s R&amp;B while his
text: boy, YELLA, leans down, hollers at a GIRL in the crowd.
text: Dre spots someone moving through the mass of people --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yo, Yella, man -- Lonzo comin'!
text: Yella quickly moves to the record crate, starts sifting
text: through them to look like he's busy as --
text: LONZO WILLIAMS, club PROMOTER and Dre's BOSS approaches. He
text: leans over to Dre:
speaker_heading: LONZO
dialog: Gonna make sure nothin's poppin'
dialog: off outside. Keep them fat asses
dialog: shakin'. None of that rap bullshit,
dialog: you hear? I want people thinkin'
dialog: `bout pussy not pistols. (then) And
dialog: Yella, I saw you talkin to my lady.
dialog: Keep your fuckin hands to yourself.
text: Lonzo shoots Yella a look, then disappears from the stage.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Why you fuckin with that nigga's
dialog: girl, man?
speaker_heading: YELLA
dialog: Why not?
text: Dre chuckles, immediately searches the crowd, locking eyes
text: with CUBE. Dre gives him a NOD, and Cube takes a breath,
text: heads toward the Stage -- Moment of truth.
dialog: 17.
text: IN THE BACK, EAZY and REN are surrounded by ladies. But
text: Eazy's attention is clearly --
text: ON STAGE. Cube appears next to Dre, who's cuing up a new
text: record. He stops the music, grabs the mic:
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Compton! I got my homie -- he's
dialog: about to get his rhyme on for
dialog: y'all! Give it up for Ice
dialog: muthafuckin' Cube!
text: Dre hands the mic to Cube as the crowd eyeballs him with
dialog: suspicion and restraint. They're clearly not gonna give him
text: respect til he earns it. Cube steels himself, clenches his
text: jaw, puffs out his chest. And time turns eternal before --
text: DRE drops the needle on Steve Arrington's funked-out WEAK AT
dialog: THE KNEES (hardcore NWA fans will recognize this track as the
text: original sample for GANGSTA GANGSTA).
text: Cube starts rapping, his voice powerful, thick with attitude:
speaker_heading: ICE CUBE
dialog: Here's a little somethin' about a
dialog: nigga like me. Never shoulda been
text: let out the penitentiary. Ice Cube
dialog: would like to say, That I'm a crazy
text: muthafucka from around the way.
dialog: Since I was a youth, I smoked weed
dialog: out, Now I'm the muthafucka that ya
dialog: read about. Takin a life or two,
dialog: that's what the hell I do. Don't
dialog: like how I'm livin', well fuck you!
text: After only a few lines, the crowd's CHEERING. HOLLERING.
text: Dancing. An infectious vibe.
text: And we DRIFT back to Eazy, standing with Ren, feeling the
text: fuck out of this music, pensive look on his face. Something
dialog: crystallizing as we --
scene_heading: 16 INT. DOO-TO'S CLUB - LATER 16
text: Yella spins a number for the crowd, who seem less energized
text: now that Cube's off stage. To the side, LONZO chews out Dre --
speaker_heading: LONZO
dialog: I'm this close to firin' your
dialog: monkey ass! You tryin' to start a
dialog: riot up in here?! You know I don't
dialog: want that hardcore shit played in
dialog: my club, but I turn my back and you
dialog: do that shit anyway..?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: I'm just tryin' to keep you in
dialog: business. Open your eyes. They went
dialog: crazy to that shit --
speaker_heading: LONZO
dialog: You're up on that stage `cause I
dialog: put you there. You're a bad ass DJ,
dialog: I'll give you that, but you don't
dialog: listen and I'm gettin' real tired
dialog: of arguing all the time. You know
dialog: it's plenty DJs out there who'll
dialog: play what I want `em to play. Guys
dialog: that don't bite the hand that feeds
dialog: 'em. Now you take a backseat to
dialog: that shit.
text: He glares at Dre before taking leave. Dre watches him go,
text: body coiled tight. Jaw clenched.
speaker_heading: YELLA
dialog: Don't trip off him, homie.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Man, Lonzo ain't got no vision.
text: Dre nods, yeah-yeah, but his eyes have landed on EAZY across
dialog: the room --
speaker_heading: DRE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit -- Check out this nigga.
dialog: Yo, take over for a minute.
text: Yella nods, commands the decks. Watches as Dre heads to --
scene_heading: A17 THE BACK OF THE CLUB A17
text: EAZY's kicking it with REN, talking up several GIRLS. But
text: when Eazy sees Dre approaching, he smoothly shoos them away.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Dr. Dre, how you been doin'?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: What up, E? Been a minute.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: You know. Out here on the grind --
dialog: Nice jacket.
text: Dre looks down at the purple satin.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: It's the uniform. I make it work.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: You remember Ren from Kelly Park,
dialog: right?
text: Ren and Dre give each other a respectful nod.
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Wuddup, Dre.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Heard you been spendin' a lot of
dialog: time at your auntie's house. How's
dialog: the couch life?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: It's fucked up. I'm too tall for
dialog: that shit. Plus I got my woman and
dialog: baby livin' there. It's hard. But
dialog: everybody can't do what you do.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Yeah, but what I do is playin' out,
dialog: fast. Muthafuckas are gettin'
dialog: locked up and laid down out here
dialog: left and right. Time to make a few
dialog: changes.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yeah. Change ain't bad. Shit, I'm
dialog: tryin' to make a few changes my
dialog: self.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: What you mean?
text: Dre pauses, considering how to proceed...
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Man, you should think about dumpin'
dialog: some money into this music shit. I
dialog: got some ideas --
speaker_heading: YELLA (ON THE MIC)
dialog: Yo!
text: Dre turns to find Yella up on stage in the DJ booth, mouthing
text: "LONZO," as he points into the crowd. Dre follows Yella's
text: finger, spots Lonzo slowly moving through, greeting people as
dialog: he goes.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Shit I gotta get back up there.
dialog: Let's talk about this later. Think
dialog: about it...
dialog: 20.
text: Eazy just smiles, nods, as Dre heads off...
scene_heading: 17 EXT. DOO-TO'S CLUB - LATE AT NIGHT 17
text: Dre exits the club, usual crate of records in hand --
speaker_heading: TYREE (O.S.)
dialog: Do I know you!?
speaker_heading: DUDE (O.S.)
dialog: What!?
dialog: Dre turns to find --
text: TYREE, all up in the face of some DUDE.
speaker_heading: TYREE
dialog: Nigga, you heard me!
text: Tyree shoves the dude -- Dre's eyes light up! That's my
text: brother! He drops his crate of records, bumrushes the Dude
text: and COLD-COCKS HIM. The Dude just drops, dazed.
text: Dre turns to Tyree, adrenaline pumping.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: What he do!?
speaker_heading: TYREE
dialog: Muthafucka over here lookin' at me
dialog: like he know me!
dialog: Dre can't believe it -- That's it?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Tyree, you gotta stop doin' this
dialog: shit, man!
text: The down Dude slowly gets onto his knees, stumbles to his
dialog: feet just as --
text: WHOOP! WHOOP! An L.A. Sheriff's Dept. SQUAD CAR rolls into
text: the lot, lights on Dre, Tyree and the Dude. In a hurry, the
text: two OFFICERS are out of the car, approaching the guys --
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: We told everybody to clear this
dialog: parking lot! What's going on!?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: We got this, Officer --
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: I didn't ask you what you got! Get
dialog: the fuck home!
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: I am home.
text: Officer 1 gets right in Dre's face, nose to nose.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: If you don't start walking --
text: But Dre just stands his ground, head cocked to the side,
text: defying the Officer. In a flash --
text: BAM! Dre finds his face planted into the hood of the squad
dialog: car! Cuffs slapped on! Same for Tyree and the Dude as we --
scene_heading: 18 EXT. COMPTON POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING 18
text: DRE emerges from the Police Station, police property bag in
text: hand, to find EAZY waiting for him beside a fresh `63 IMPALA
speaker_heading: LOWRIDER.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: They got you for carrying records?
dialog: That's some gangsta shit, Dre.
text: Dre smiles, chuckles -- He's clearly beyond exhausted.
speaker_heading: DRE
text: Cops will throw a nigga in jail for
dialog: anything.
text: At Eazy's car, Dre and Eazy pound hug.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Lonzo just left you here, huh?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Guess he's sick of bailing my ass
dialog: out.
text: Dre kneels down on the pavement, takes his shoelaces from the
text: police property bag and casually starts lacing his sneakers.
text: But Eazy clocks a couple POLICE OFFICERS eyeballing him and
text: Dre. Clearly, he's not comfortable here. Hops into the car.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Mind gettin' your funny lookin' ass
dialog: in the car before they arrest you
dialog: for some other dumb shit?
dialog: 22.
text: Eazy gestures like, we in front of the police station! Dre
text: realizes. My bad. Hops in. Keeps lacing his sneakers...
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: Man, I was thinkin' about what you
dialog: said last night.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yeah, and..?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: It's interestin' --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Interestin'? Tell me this, how long
dialog: you think that shit you doin' gonna
dialog: last, huh? You ever heard of a
dialog: happy ending in that game?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Shit, man, this all comin' from the
dialog: nigga I just bailed out.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Listen, if you can slang dope, you
dialog: can slang records. You got a mind
dialog: for this shit, E.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Okay so what then -- That nigga
dialog: last night? Is that what we doin'?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: What, Cube? Nah, he in a group
dialog: right now, got some other business
dialog: goin' on. But I got this group
dialog: called H.B.O. from the east coast.
dialog: Dope voices, and Cube wrote a song
dialog: for `em that's crazy.
dialog: Eazy considers for a long moment as we --
scene_heading: 19 INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - DAY 19
text: Dre sits in front of a huge MIXING BOARD, adjusting the
text: levels on a hard-driving BEAT.
text: A small CREW of Kangol-wearing RAPPERS (HOME BOYS ONLY, aka
text: HBO) are gathered around, reading pages we recognize as
text: CUBE'S LYRICS with befuddled expressions.
speaker_heading: HBO 1
dialog: What the fuck is "Gankin"? And
dialog: what's a "6-4"?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CUBE (O.S.)
text: It's a car. A `64 Impala.
text: Everyone turns to look at CUBE, off to the side, annoyed.
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Gankin's when somebody jacks you.
dialog: Ain't a big deal. Just sounds
dialog: better that way.
text: Another HBO dude chimes in --
speaker_heading: HBO 2
dialog: I dunno, too much cussin' to get
dialog: radio play. And honestly, nobody
dialog: gives a fuck about Compton --
text: Dre interrupts from the board, no back down in him.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Y'all got somethin' to say about
dialog: Compton? Cause we might have a
dialog: problem up in this bitch.
text: Nobody says a thing. Deafening silence. Then:
speaker_heading: DRE (CONT'D)
dialog: Then do the lyrics. We losin' time
dialog: and I'm losin' patience.
text: The vibe is tense, unpleasant. Finally:
speaker_heading: HBO 1
dialog: This ain't us. I ain't fuckin' with
dialog: this Jheri curl bullshit --
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Fuck you then. Wearing a Kangol
dialog: don't make you L.L. Cool J nigga,
dialog: remember that.
text: HBO 1 CRUMPLES the Lyrics sheet into a ball.
speaker_heading: HBO 2
dialog: Yeah. Now what?
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: What you wanna do, mark ass nigga?
text: Cube and the HBO dudes square up, swelling and huffing --
text: Without hesitation, Eazy gets up, stands beside Cube. Dre
text: whips off his headphones and flanks Cube from the other side.
text: These dudes have each other's back, ready to throw down.
dialog: 24.
text: The HBO clowns start exiting, talking shit.
text: Eazy wanders back over to the couch, plops down, sighs:
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Well there goes the talent. Don't
dialog: know a whole lot about the music
dialog: game, but we can't start a label
dialog: without talent.
text: The three of them chuckle. Eazy sighs, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I put up my money -- I held
dialog: up my side of the deal, Dre. When
dialog: you gonna deliver your side?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Well shit, why don't you get on the
dialog: mic and try it?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: What? Fool, I ain't no rapper.
dialog: Off Eazy's unsure look --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You already spent the money.
dialog: Don't you get it? Man, this song is
dialog: all about you! This song is about
dialog: Eazy-muthafuckin'-E! Now get in
dialog: the booth. Let me deliver my side
dialog: of this shit.
scene_heading: 20 INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - LATER 20
text: ON EAZY, self-conscious in the booth, light beaming on him.
text: Dre gets up from the board, DIMS THE LIGHTS way down low --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Fuck you doin'?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Just lemme produce. Get
dialog: comfortable, man.
text: Eazy takes a breath, huddles over the mic. He puts his Locs
text: sunglasses on, pulls his baseball cap low -- so low you can
text: barely see him (which is exactly the point).
text: Dre sits behind the board with Cube. STARTS UP THE BEAT and
dialog: cues Eazy --
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: (dry, flat)
dialog: Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4 -
dialog: -
text: Cube winces. Dre STOPS the track.
speaker_heading: DRE
text: Hit that first beat hard. CRUISE-in
text: down the street. CRUISE-in.
text: When Eazy tries it again, it almost sounds worse --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4 -
dialog: -
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: That ain't it...
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Get that dry-ass Jheri curl outta
dialog: here, maybe I can concentrate.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: You kickin' me out?
text: Dre looks at Cube. Nods. Go.
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aiight. I'm just sayin'...
text: Cube exits. Then --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Just gimme the words.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Nigga what?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Say that shit with me -- CRUISE-in -
dialog: -
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: (animated)
dialog: Dre, you know this shit is
dialog: hopeless, right?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: That! See how you just said that
dialog: shit? Like you believe it!
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: `Cause I do.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: So say this shit like you believe
dialog: it. Like it's muthafuckin' Sunday
dialog: and you cruisin' down the street in
dialog: that dope-ass 6-4. Feel that shit,
dialog: like its ya own words.
text: The frustration on Eazy's face is apparent.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: You really gonna make me do this,
dialog: huh?
text: Yup. Eazy frowns. Takes a moment to compose himself...
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: Aiight, fuck it. Let's do this.
text: Dre starts the track again -- ONLY THIS TIME, HE DOES SO ONE.
text: COMPONENT. AT A TIME. BUILDING THE SONG AS IF FROM SCRATCH.
dialog: EAZY vibes with it. Can't fuckin' help it. Shit is dope.
text: Finally, once THE BEAT IS FULLY REALIZED, Dre CUES him --
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4.
text: Dre grins. Much better. Stops the track.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Hell yeah! That shit was tight.
dialog: Only 59 more lines, E. But we gonna
dialog: get through it. Hit that next line -
dialog: -
text: Eazy groans, pulls his hat even lower, as we --
scene_heading: 21 INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - MANY HOURS LATER 21
dialog: There's a sense of ceremony here. Cube, Eazy, YELLA, REN,
text: Jinx, DOC and few girls wait with palpable anticipation as --
text: DRE PUSHES PLAY on the freshly completed TRACK. It starts
text: THUMPING from the speakers: It's BOYZ N THA HOOD.
text: Pride and a sense of purpose swell in each and every one of
text: them as LONZO POPS IN. Listens, skeptical.
text: The song stops and no one says a word. They know this is
dialog: something special. Finally:
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: YELLA
dialog: Lonzo, what you think?
speaker_heading: LONZO
dialog: That some waste of time shit right
dialog: there and trust me, it ain't gonna
dialog: work. Won't get no radio play.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You never know-- We might do a
dialog: radio version and take it up to
dialog: KDAY and see what happens.
speaker_heading: LONZO
dialog: This reality rap is never going to
dialog: work, Dre. You need to hurry up and
dialog: rap this shit up and finish that
dialog: slow jam I had you working on. I'm
dialog: serious, Dre! Hurry up with this...
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yo, I don't know about working on
dialog: this slow stuff anymore. After this
dialog: I'm going to work on songs with
speaker_heading: DOC.
text: Reveal DOC in the background.
speaker_heading: LONZO
dialog: It's not a request, Dre.
text: Lonzo scowls at Dre, exits in a huff. Yella goes to Dre, eyes
dialog: wide with excitement --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yo, if Lonzo don't like it, you
dialog: know that shit is dope.
text: They pound. Everyone LAUGHS. Truth.
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Damn, Dre -- You just turned a
text: hustler into a rapper.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Now this right here..? This some
dialog: ruthless shit for real. Dre, you a
dialog: muthafuckin' genius. And Cube, you
dialog: got more of them stories to tell?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Homie, I got rhymes for days. But I

scene_heading: 22 INT. MACOLA RECORDS - LOS ANGELES - DAY 22
text: BOYZ IN THA HOOD is PLAYING OVER --
text: A STACK of VINYL RECORDS moves through a PRESS. A machine
text: STAMPS a RED LABEL onto the MIDDLE. CLOSE ON the RED RUTHLESS
scene_heading: LABEL -- BOYZ N THA HOOD.
text: IN THE RECEIVING AREA, EAZY picks up a couple BOXES of
text: RECORDS. He PAYS for them, and hauls them away.
scene_heading: 23 INT. RECORD STORE - CENTRAL AVE - COMPTON - DAY 23

speaker_heading: BOYZ continues OVER --
text: Eazy emerges from a RUN-DOWN HOUSE, jogs across the street to

text: Some local TEENAGERS are partying, drinking and listening to
text: BOYZ N THE HOOD wax. And that shit has the party bumpin'.
text: A sense that this song is going VIRAL, in a contagious, pre-
dialog: internet sort of way --
scene_heading: 26 EXT. ROADIUM SWAP MEET - LOS ANGELES - DAY 26
text: BOYZ continues as Eazy brings TWO BOXES of RECORDS to a SWAP
text: MEET BOOTH operated by STEVE YANO. Yano excitedly collects
text: the two boxes, hands over some cash. Deal done. Before Eazy
dialog: can even bounce, some KIDS bumrush Yano for copies --
scene_heading: 27 INT. K-DAY RADIO STATION - LOS ANGELES - DAY 27
text: BOYZ slowly fades, iconic KDAY Disc Jockey GREG MACK spinning
text: the TRACK over the airwaves of Los Angeles. He grins, bobbing
dialog: his head, digging this shit for real.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: GREG MACK
dialog: 1580 KDAY, this is Greg Mack --
dialog: Mack Attack. That was "Boyz n tha

dialog: of Compton. Sounds like he's about
dialog: 15 years old --
text: He glances over to the TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD, which suddenly
text: LIGHTS UP like crazy, with dozens of CALLERS.
speaker_heading: GREG MACK (CONT'D)
dialog: -- I know you like it. It's been
dialog: the most requested record on this

scene_heading: 28 INT. MACOLA RECORDS - RECEIVING AREA - DAY 28
text: Eazy pays for another couple boxes of records. Grabs them --
speaker_heading: JERRY HELLER (O.S.)
dialog: I heard your record.
dialog: Eazy turns to find --
text: JERRY HELLER, a middle-aged guy in a velvet track suit. His
text: face is craggy, seasoned, wise. He's got terrible posture,
text: but lively, hyper-alert eyes. He extends his hand to Eazy.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Jerry Heller.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Eric Wright.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Pleasure to meet you. Would it be
dialog: possible to have a word with you,
dialog: Eric?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: About what?
scene_heading: 29 INT. MACOLA RECORDS - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 29
text: Jerry at his desk, Eazy on the ratty couch. Eazy lets his
text: eyes wander around the shabby office. The sad furniture, the
text: old and irrelevant posters on the walls.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I thought your record was good.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Just good? Why you call me in here
dialog: then --
text: Eazy gets up and heads for the door --
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No-no-no, hang on. (beat) I thought
dialog: it was exceptional. Please, sit
text: back down.
text: Eazy indulges Jerry. Sits back down and stares, cold,
text: unreadable. Jerry rubs his eyes, frustrated, his regular
text: spiel isn't having its usual effect.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's try this again. As a music
dialog: manager, let me tell you what I can
dialog: do for you, Eric --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Maybe I'm the one who can do
dialog: somethin' for you.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You think because I don't have some
dialog: flashy office, that means I don't
dialog: know what I'm talking about? Elton
dialog: John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: You manage anybody this decade?
text: Jerry leans on his elbows on the desk, cocks his head at
dialog: Eazy. The balls on this kid.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Let me tell you what I see. Lotta
dialog: raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But
dialog: if you think anyone's gonna talk to
dialog: you, if you think anyone's gonna
dialog: let you into the building where you
dialog: might talk to somebody -- somebody
dialog: who matters -- you're crazy.
text: Eazy frowns, looks away --
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what I do for you. I will
dialog: make you legit. I will take you
dialog: into that building. I will protect
dialog: you. I will block out all the noise
dialog: of this business and we can build
dialog: something big.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: But you're gonna have to believe in
dialog: me like I believe in you. If you
dialog: don't think you can do that...
text: Eazy doesn't budge. Satisfied, Jerry continues --
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You got more music for me?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: I got everything you need.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Good, cause you're gonna have to
dialog: follow this up. So what does N.W.A.
dialog: stand for anyway?
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: No Whites Allowed?
text: Eazy looks at Jerry. Cold as ice.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: "Niggas With Attitudes."
text: The smile is wiped off Jerry's face immediately.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. SKATELAND RINK - COMPTON - NIGHT 30

text: The sound of FOOTSTEPS as Ren, Yella, Cube, and Eazy exit the

speaker_heading: DRE (CONT'D)
text: He got into a fight near Leimert
text: Park. A big mothafucka fell on top

text: Eazy moves closer. Slowly, he places a hand on Dre's head.

dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Gonna be aiight, Dre... We with

dialog: Your brother looked up to you. And

speaker_heading: VERNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm proud of you... So proud of

speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Aw fuck...
text: Because they all just noticed TWO THINGS: 1) there are DOZENS
text: of rabid FANS gathered outside, and 2) there are also A SHIT-
text: LOAD OF POLICE, holding back the FANS. The GROUP is spotted
text: by some COPS, who peel off and head STRAIGHT FOR THEM --
speaker_heading: ICE CUBE
dialog: Here we go y'all...
text: The COPS are immediately ON them, grabbing, frisking,
text: CUFFING, and DRAGGING them all toward a PADDY WAGON which has
text: materialized outside.
text: And as soon as the CROWD sees their beloved NWA being hauled
text: away, they go NUTS, and start throwing BOTTLES and ROCKS at
text: the COPS, who DUCK and SWERVE to avoid the projectiles.
text: The CROWD starts CHANTING, at a deafening volume --
speaker_heading: CROWD

scene_heading: FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE --

text: Jerry watches a NEWS REPORT on the riot at the Detroit show.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What the fuck were you guys
dialog: thinking? They can hold us libel
dialog: for inciting a riot! No one cares
dialog: that the police started it...
text: Dre, Ren and Yella start paying attention as Eazy switches
text: channels. Finds another report about the riot. And another.
text: And another. Images blurring by of the concert.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whether you like it or not, you are
dialog: a political group. Never give these
dialog: assholes a reason to hurt you. Next

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 1
dialog: How do you explain insighting a
dialog: riot in Detroit? What do you have
dialog: to say about that?
speaker_heading: EAZ
dialog: We didn't insight shit.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You just got a snapshot of how
dialog: Americans honestly feel.
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: We didn't create that.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 2
dialog: Your songs glamorize the lifestyle
dialog: of gangs, guns and drugs.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: My art is the reflection of my
dialog: reality. What do you see when you
dialog: go outside of your door. I know
dialog: what i see.
speaker_heading: YELLA
dialog: And it ain't glamorous.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: And by the way, the hood gets AKs
dialog: from Russia and cocaine from
dialog: Columbia.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: We don't even have passports. Check
dialog: the source.
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Who is responsible for that?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 3
dialog: You are experiencing a metoric
dialog: rise. How can you explain that
dialog: artits like Axl Rose from Guns and
dialog: Roses are wearing your tshirts and
dialog: hats?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Isn't it obvious. Real recongnize
dialog: real.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: WE must of struck a nerve.
text: Journalist 4 quickly interjects --
text: The guys let that lie a moment as other JOURNALISTS speak up.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 4
dialog: Will you be more careful about what
dialog: you say, and how you say it?
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Nope.
dialog: Everyone LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Hell no. Last I heard, this is
dialog: America and we got Freedom of
dialog: Speech. Pretty sure that includes
dialog: rap music. Exercisin' our Free
dialog: Speech across this whole damn
dialog: country, openin' people's eyes. Far
dialog: as I'm concerned that's our job.
text: The Journalists take that in, impressed by Cube's media savvy
text: and forthright demeanor. Cube points to another JOURNALIST.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 4
dialog: So Cube, what's a guy from Compton
dialog: do when he starts making real money
dialog: like this?
text: Laughter from the assembled. Not from Cube. Silence. Then:

scene_heading: 67 INT. DOUBLETREE SUITES - PHOENIX - NIGHT 67
text: CUBE walks down the hotel hallway, stops in front of a door.
text: He KNOCKS, but there's no answer. He notices the door is
text: PROPPED open with the dead-bolt, so he pushes inside --
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: 68 INT. DOUBLETREE SUITES - JERRY'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS 68
text: Cube enters the dark room. At the far end of the room,
text: there's a DESK, with a lone LAMP illuminated, casting weird,
text: creepy shadows across the room.
text: And JERRY HELLER sits behind the desk, his face mostly
text: obscured in shadow. Cube grins, bemused, because this tableau
text: is clearly deliberate, a dramatic show of power.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's nice to see you, Cube.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Well I can barely see you, Jerry.
dialog: What's with all this Godfather
dialog: shit?
text: Jerry ignores the comment, rises from behind the desk,
text: carefully places a stapled sheaf of PAPERS on the desk.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I know you've been very eager to
dialog: sign a contract with Eric's
dialog: company, Ruthless Records.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: It's your company too, right? You
dialog: and Eric. All for one, one for all.
text: Jerry sighs, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That's incorrect. It's not my
dialog: company. I work for you. I've made
dialog: that clear from the beginning.
text: Cube just nods, like, yeah right. Picks up the thick
text: contract, pages through it. It's full of dense legalese.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Alright, cool. So I can take this
dialog: one, show it to a lawyer or
dialog: somethin'?
text: Jerry stares at him for a beat. Places his hands on the desk.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Cube, lawyers get paid to make
dialog: trouble. That's what they do --
dialog: create problems where problems
dialog: don't exist.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: But I have no idea what it says. At
dialog: least let me take it to show my
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I can assure you, it's all
dialog: standard. You can read it now, if
dialog: you like.
text: Cube's expression darkens. He clenches his jaw.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Jerry, you know I can't understand
dialog: this legal shit. None of us can.
dialog: That's why we need to show it to a
dialog: lawyer--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Cube, I thought you knew? Everyone
dialog: else signed already. You're the
dialog: only one who hasn't.
text: Cube flips to the last page. The Signatory page. Sure enough,
text: there's EAZY's signature, DRE's, YELLA's, and REN's. Cube can
text: only shake his head with confusion, disappointment.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: What the fuck..?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Look. Cube. This is a great thing.
dialog: This is what you always wanted your
dialog: whole life. And there's also this.
text: Jerry lays a CHECK on the desk in front of Cube, made out to
text: O'SHEA JACKSON. And it's for $75,000. Cube can't help it, his
text: eyes go wide. It's more money than he ever dreamed of.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Damn. (beat) Thanks, man.
text: He reaches for the check, but Jerry pulls it back.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Soon as you sign this contract, the
dialog: money is all yours.
text: Cube freezes. Realizes he's being shaken down.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: That's my money anyway, Jerry. I
dialog: earned it. I wrote a lot of hit
dialog: songs. I been on tour for months.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Performing. Gettin' arrested and
dialog: shit. And you gonna try to gank me?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Give me my money, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You're kidding me, right? Who do
dialog: you think pays for everything? All
dialog: the hotel rooms, the parties, the
dialog: transpo? You think that's free?
text: Cube closes his eyes. Takes a deep breath. He must literally
text: will himself to not implant his fist in Jerry's face.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Why all this now, Jerry? Back in
dialog: the beginning, if you thought we
dialog: were so good, why didn't you just
dialog: give us contracts then?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even
dialog: a great talent can crash and burn.
dialog: Too much ego, too much excess, too
dialog: many expectations -- it tends to
dialog: ruin things. You oughta keep that
dialog: in mind.
text: Cube stares hard. Knows exactly what Jerry's implying.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: I'm gonna ask one more time. Are
dialog: you sayin' I can't have the money I
dialog: earned, unless I sign this
dialog: contract, right now, without
dialog: showin' it to anybody?
text: Jerry just crosses his arms, looks at Cube, says nothing.
speaker_heading: CUBE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye, Jerry.
text: He turns and walks out of the room --

text: Face crumpled with anger, Cube approaches. Drops his bags.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Y'all signed that Ruthless contract
dialog: without a lawyer?
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Yeah -- And we got paaaaaid!
speaker_heading: YELLA
dialog: For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a
dialog: fuck what's in that contract!
text: Dre and Ren chuckle at Yella's candor.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You ain't signed?
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Hell naw I ain't signin' that
dialog: bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a
dialog: little fucked up that Jerry won't
dialog: let us show it to nobody? That seem
dialog: honest to y'all? If he offered us
dialog: seventy-five thousand, he probably
dialog: owes us double that.
dialog: (to Ren)
dialog: Thought we talked about this, dude?
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: It is what it is... I don't trust
dialog: Jerry but I trust Eric.

speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: What up with Doc and Suge?

dialog: talent. Everybody wanna get into
dialog: the act...
text: Dre exits, looking discouraged. And we understand why when an
text: equally despondent Cube exits the bus and begins to move away
text: from the crew. Dre catches up to him --
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that
dialog: shit, homie..? Keep making
dialog: history..?
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Naw man, not like this. I'd rather
dialog: be broke then get fucked -- Why did
dialog: you sign that shit, Dre?
speaker_heading: DRE

text: They pound hug and Cube heads off. Hops into T-Bone's ride.
dialog: 73.
text: BACK WITH DRE, considering the scene as everyone drives away,
dialog: going in separate directions:
text: Cube leaves with T-Bone... Yella leaves with Ren... Eazy
text: leaves with Jerry... And D.O.C. leaves with Suge...
text: Dre finds himself all alone, confronting a new reality.
scene_heading: A71 INT./EXT. T-BONES CAR - MOMENTS LATER A71
text: Cube rides in the passenger seat, pretty low at this point.
text: No money, no group. JINX MOUTH IS RUNNING, but Cube's in a

speaker_heading: JINX
dialog: Can't believe you left the group,
dialog: man. What you gonna do now? Guess
dialog: we gotta start working on some solo
dialog: stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?!
text: As the car pulls up to a stop light, Cube looks over, spots a
text: beautiful YOUNG LADY in a nice jeep on rims. She's looks back
text: over at him, their eyes locked. Is this love at first sight?
text: After a few magical moments. Cube finally speaks.

dialog: How you doing? My name O'Shea.
dialog: What's yours?

dialog: puts everything on Eazy. They can
dialog: have it.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: How do you feel about that Kim? Is
dialog: he making a big mistake?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I don't think so-- after hearing
dialog: everything that happened, I
dialog: would've left too. Now he has the
dialog: chance to showcase all his talents.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Well, I believe in you Cube, so
dialog: I'll tell ya what: there's not a
dialog: lot of money in this right now, but
dialog: if this first record hits, I'll
dialog: make it up to you on the next one.
text: Cube gets up and shakes Bryan's hand.

speaker_heading: BRYAN TURNER
dialog: Who're you gonna get to produce?

speaker_heading: D.O.C.

scene_heading: 75 INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 75
text: Eazy enjoys dinner with a lovely, put-together young woman,
dialog: TOMICA. She's nobody's groupie. She's serious, and smart.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: This place is nice. Wow, I didn't

text: Eazy nods, knows she's right. His eyes catch a SEXY WOMAN

dialog: 81.
text: He turns back to Tomica, who just saw the whole thing... but
text: she's not mad. She's grinning confidently, seen it before,
dialog: doesn't sweat stuff like this.
speaker_heading: TOMICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, she had a nice ass. But she

speaker_heading: BRYAN TURNER
dialog: It's the new NWA record. I wanted

text: Everybody gives YELLA the look.
speaker_heading: REN
dialog: Mothafucka got us! What we gonna

dialog: Help you with something?
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Who's asking?
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: It's a real nice house.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Who are you? Are you with Suge
dialog: Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube?
text: The Man doesn't answer. Instead, he just gazes upon the

speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Have yourself a good night, Jerry.

text: He immediately LOWERS it.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Jesus Christ, Eric. You can't

text: Eazy follows Jerry into the kitchen as Jerry pulls some
text: leftovers from the fridge. Slides them over to Eazy. But Eazy
text: isn't interested. Instead, he pulls out a bag of weed. Rolls
text: a joint, lights it. Takes a long drag -- Exhales a lot more
dialog: than just smoke...
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hey. You gotta tell me what's going
dialog: on. I can tell when something's --
text: Eazy leans on the counter. Finally looks at Jerry.
speaker_heading: EAZY

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You're not gonna do that.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: I didn't come over here to ask you -

speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)

dialog: us. We don't hit back, it's over!
dialog: Done! Put a fork in this shit!
text: Jerry closes his eyes, takes a breath. Tries to keep his tone
text: relaxed, so that he can, in turn, relax Eazy.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Eric. Listen to me. I never said we
dialog: won't hit back. But this isn't
dialog: Compton. We don't hit back with
dialog: bullets. We do it with lawyers. We
dialog: drain those assholes.
text: Eazy calms down a little bit.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: I don't care about the money,
dialog: Jerry. Ain't about the money.
text: Jerry puts a fatherly hand on Eazy's shoulder. Looks at him.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Of course it is. You're smarter
dialog: than those criminals. You wanna
dialog: kill somebody? Then you'll be in
dialog: prison, forever. No more family. No
dialog: more Ruthless. No more anything.
text: Eazy stares back at Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you kill this man. His problems

speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Are you Anti-Semitic?
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: What? I thought this interview was
dialog: about the Rodney King trial?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: The J.D.L. has recently gotten
dialog: involved, saying that the lyrics
dialog: regarding your former manager Jerry
dialog: Heller --
dialog: But Cube's too smart to fall for this crap.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti-
dialog: Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a
dialog: question -- do they condone Jerry's
dialog: behavior when it comes to my
dialog: situation? Him trying to get me to
dialog: sign a contract without legal
dialog: representation?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Well, you get me that answer and
dialog: then we can continue on this topic.
dialog: Until then, let's talk about the
dialog: beating of an unarmed motorist --
dialog: Rodney King and the trial of 4
text: guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem
dialog: to be Darryl Gates' standard issue -
dialog: -
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: But it isn't just the Jewish
dialog: community. The Korean grocer
dialog: community have also accused you of
dialog: racism, mostly because of your song
dialog: "Black Korea" --
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Come on, man. That don't even make
dialog: no sense. Black Korea is just a
dialog: warning. That's it. I'm a
dialog: journalist, just like you!
dialog: Reporting on what's going on in the
dialog: hood. But the difference is that
dialog: I'm brutally honest about it. Cause
dialog: sugar coating will get you
dialog: diabetes.
text: A couple of members of the Nation of Islam are quietly seen

dialog: a foothold --
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: What's your relationship with the
dialog: Nation of Islam?
text: Cube just smiles, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: There my brothers. That question
dialog: alone just proves how unprepared of
dialog: a "sandbag reporter" you really
dialog: are. You wanna talk about Anti-
dialog: Semitism? Then it's "Black Korea,"
dialog: and now you wanna talk about the
dialog: Nation of Islam? Seriously, man.
dialog: What's your agenda? You can't focus
dialog: on one thing? Ask me something
dialog: interesting. I'm not an elected
dialog: official. I'm an artist. You
dialog: haven't asked me one damn question
dialog: about music. I'm America's
dialog: conscience. I represent the good,
dialog: the bad and the ugly. What you
dialog: represent?

scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: SIX MONTHS LATER

text: Dre sits in the epicenter of it all, motionless, lost. It's

speaker_heading: DRE

text: The vibe is positive and laid back, but as we look at Dre's
text: face we can tell what he's thinking: something's missing.
text: Dre turns to the MOOG Keyboard situated on the side of the
text: board and starts noodling with a melody. It's almost
text: familiar. But not quite.
dialog: 102.
dialog: Then he hits it: Da do dee dah dee dah dah dee do deee...
dialog: Just like that, we've witnessed the birth of AIN'T NUTHIN'

text: The MUSIC IS BUMPIN'! There's a party going on somewhere in
dialog: this house, but not in this room. We're close up on a pair of
text: blue Chuck Taylors with a pair Dickies and boxers draped on
text: them. As we pull back, we realize that some LUCKY BASTARD is
text: GETTING HEAD from a SEXY WOMAN with nice curves.
text: As we pull back further, we can't even see who the Lucky
text: Bastard is because another AMAZING FEMALE is sitting on his
text: face, MOANING and smoking a blunt. Just as we attempt to
dialog: register what's going on --
text: We track another SPECTACULAR FEMALE in a two-piece bikini.
text: She grabs the blunt from her, hits it and walks out to the
text: balcony. She blows out the smoke and passes it to one of the
text: HOMIES who's already rolling up more blunts from the pound of
text: weed sitting on the table in front of him.
text: From there we crane down, passing the DJ rig on the second
text: floor balcony. Even the DJ has GIRLS around him, a blunt in
text: his mouth, and a drink in his hand.
text: We crane down further to the bottom floor where MORE GIRLS in
text: BIKINIS get sprayed by GUYS with SUPER SOAKERS and CHAMPAGNE
text: BOTTLES. It's an impromptu "wet T-shirt" contest.
text: As we pull back across the pool, a few more TOPLESS GIRLS
dialog: jump in and we realize we're at one of those famous Dr.
text: Dre/Death Row pool parties. People everywhere. Sex in the
text: air. Freezer-bags stuffed with high-grade weed are being
text: passed out to everybody by Snoop Dogg himself.
text: We catch a glimpse of two nice looking LADIES walking over to
dialog: the bar. We will come to know one of them as NICOLE. But
dialog: first--
text: IN THE GAZEBO, we find Dre smoking a blunt and playing
text: DOMINOES with D.O.C., laughing, blowing off some much-needed
dialog: steam. Until --
text: Dre's eyes settle on Nicole, who's different from the rest.
text: She's not drunk, or dancing, or flirting. She's beautiful,
text: but in an understated way. When her friend gets up and walks
text: away, Nicole turns, like she senses Dre's gaze. Looks right

dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You look like you're ready to go.
speaker_heading: NICOLE

speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You're not having fun?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Oh no, it was fun. I had a lot of
dialog: fun. But now it's starting to get a
dialog: little wild.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yeah, it does get crazy around here
dialog: sometimes.

dialog: Hi, I'm Andre.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (NICOLE)
dialog: I know.

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I don't know, maybe another time
text: and another place. But not now.
text: And with that, a visibly tipsy Warren G walks over, trying to

speaker_heading: WARREN G
dialog: Yo Dre, we're can I dump this shit?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Do it look like I give a fuck right
dialog: now? Can't you see I'm tryin' to
dialog: make a Love Connection?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: No, he's trying make a friend
dialog: connection.

speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: You want me to help you?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: No, seems like you need to get back
dialog: to your game. I'll talk to you

text: Everybody SCATTERS, tripping over each other, falling on the
dialog: lawn, because let's not forget everyone is WASTED.

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: But this is how we've always done it.
dialog: You have a lot on your plate Eric,
dialog: there's no need to add to it --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills,
dialog: my checks. I mean look, my name's
dialog: right there.
text: Eazy grins at Jerry, points to his name on the checks.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I just wish we could do it here. I
dialog: don't want anything to get
dialog: misplaced or lost --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can
dialog: handle it.
text: Eazy picks up the pile of papers and heads for the door.
text: Jerry stares after him, visibly shaken --
scene_heading: 123 INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - NIGHT 123
text: Tomica watches on as Eazy finishes READING the immaculately-
text: organized PAPERS she's laid out for him. He puts them down.
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: You had to know the truth sometime.
dialog: Now you do.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Cube tried to warn me. So did Dre.
dialog: And I didn't listen. I fucked up.
text: And we stay with Eazy a moment, reeling, pissed....
scene_heading: 124 INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 124
text: Eazy walks into their familiar meeting place to find Jerry
text: slumped at the table.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Where the fuck have you been? I've
dialog: been calling you --
text: Jerry glances down at the PAPERS in Eazy's hand, sees the
text: flat look on Eazy's face... and gets it.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So what was it, the groupie? The
dialog: executive assistant? Did she even
dialog: go to college? Come on. You're
dialog: smarter than that, Eric --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.
dialog: It's about you. And you really
dialog: gotta stop acting like you never
dialog: did anything wrong.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Look, I know you're upset. But I'd
dialog: strongly advise you to take a
dialog: breath, let me look at the
dialog: paperwork --
text: Eric lets out a low, rumbling laugh.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Jerry, for real? You can stop
dialog: givin' me advice. As of, like, now.
dialog: I'm getting NWA back together. It's
dialog: happening. But you ain't gonna have
dialog: nothing to do with it this time.
text: Jerry's voice starts to RAISE in volume, desperation growing.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Why would you say something like
dialog: that? You're not thinking straight.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know what's best for you, and for
dialog: Ruthless, and we've built a trust
dialog: over years of hard work. That trust
dialog: is our foundation, Eric.
text: Eazy laughs again, but this time... the laugh deteriorates
text: into a ragged, hacking COUGH. Jerry watches, concerned --
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay? You don't look --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Trust. God damn, that's a word. Let
dialog: me tell you somethin', Jerry. Trust
dialog: is a muthafucka.
text: Jerry is now full-on YELLING at Eric, who remains calm.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Look, if what I've done is so
dialog: illegal, why have I never been sued?
dialog: I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a
dialog: motherfucker, how come nobody's come
dialog: to collect? This is business. This is
dialog: how it works. It's not always pretty,
dialog: but all of it, everything I've put
dialog: into this company, my whole LIFE for
dialog: all these years, it's for you, Eric.
dialog: Eazy absorbs this. Then --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: You're fired, Jerry.
text: Jerry, who is now beet-red, starts to BELLOW with rage --
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Goddammit, Eric! This is not how we
dialog: do things! This is a business and I
dialog: won't let you --
text: But Eazy's already out the door. Enraged, Jerry wipes his arm

scene_heading: 125 INT. DRE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 125
text: Long gone are the days of the infamous Dr. Dre pool parties
text: as Dre and Nicole relax by the pool. Dre's huge, early-model

speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Hello?
text: After a short pause, a familiar, gravelly voice comes on.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: EAZY'S VOICE
dialog: Wassup Andre, it's Eric.

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: 126 INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS 126

speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yeah. Okay.

speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Just makin' tracks.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: That Snoop record you did was big.
dialog: 850,000 copies in the first week?!
dialog: Congratulations on the success of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Good lookin' out.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Well look, I know you're busy, but
dialog: I talked to Cube, and we were,
dialog: like, talkin' about some...
dialog: possibilities.
text: Dre gets up, walks around the edge of his pool, processing.
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: And by the way, if you ain't heard--
dialog: I ain't fuckin' with Jerry Heller
text: no more. Nigga's fired.
text: Something in those words causes Dre to soften... a bit.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Really. Well it's about time. He's
dialog: the reason why we broke up.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Listen man, I know everything got
dialog: messed up and went the wrong way. I
dialog: wish it didn't. I wish we can go
dialog: back to the days of Skateland when
dialog: we were all just young, hungry and
dialog: ferocious. The world's most
dialog: dangerous group. Before all the
dialog: money and fame got between us.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yeah me too-- cause I'm not proud
dialog: of all the shit I did, either.
text: Eazy looks vaguely relieved Dre said that.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: So you think maybe, we can make
dialog: somethin' happen?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Yeah, that's sounds cool -- Let's
dialog: stay in touch.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Fair enough.

text: hurtling toward the hulking edifice of CEDARS SINAI --
scene_heading: 129 INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - DAY 129
text: Eazy lies in a propped-up hospital bed, watching TV. He
text: doesn't look ill, just annoyed with the situation. Tomica
text: sits in a chair beside him, flipping through a magazine.
text: A young DOCTOR walks in, carrying a chart. He looks troubled,
text: preoccupied. His eyes dart from Tomica... to Eazy.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: You gonna say something? Is it a
dialog: respiratory infection -- pneumonia?
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes, well, it is those things...
dialog: and more, I'm afraid... We ran a
dialog: full blood battery and -- (beat)
dialog: Mr. Wright, I'm sorry but you've
dialog: tested positive for the HIV virus.
text: Tomica reflexively stands, her hand over her mouth. Eazy
text: squints, smiles, looks at the Doctor like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Get the fuck outta here.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: The normal T-cell count is anywhere
dialog: between 500 and 1500. Right now,
dialog: your T-cell count is... 14.
text: Tomica just stands there, mouth agape, speechless. Eazy's
text: smile slowly fades to a look of pure dread.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: But I ain't no faggot.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mr. Wright, there are actually
dialog: quite a few ways that the virus can
dialog: be transmitted --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: It's wrong. No way. Test me again.
dialog: Test my shit again --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We've actually run the test five
dialog: times, with five different
dialog: samples... and the results remain --
text: Tomica suddenly lets out a choked CRY, runs from the room.
text: Eazy watches her go, overwhelmed, confused... and then, all
text: at once, he gets it. Voice trembles a little.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Tomica. She's pregnant. Oh fuck.
dialog: Does that mean she --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No. Not necessarily. But we'll need
dialog: to test her, too.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: So what do we do? What's the
dialog: treatment? Let's get started.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: I got work to do. How long's it
dialog: gonna take to get me healthy again?
text: The Doctor looks at Eazy, struggles a bit. He pulls up a
text: chair, sits down next to the bed.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mr. Wright. You need to understand.
dialog: You're very, very sick --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: But I don't even feel that bad...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: With treatment, and palliative
dialog: care, we can probably keep you
dialog: comfortable for... maybe six
text: months. At the very most.
text: Panic washes over Eazy in a flood --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Comfortable? What you mean
dialog: comfortable? Six months!?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR

dialog: 135.
speaker_heading: RON SWEENEY (ON TV)
dialog: Eazy started getting sick about a
dialog: month ago but hadn't shown signs of
dialog: improvement, so he checked into the
dialog: hospital. They ran extensive tests
dialog: and as a result we found out
dialog: that... he has what he has...
scene_heading: 132 EXT. CEDARS - COURTYARD - DAY 132
text: Outside the hospital, we see PEOPLE have started to GATHER.
text: About a dozen or so. They stand there quietly, shuffling
text: around, staring up at the Hospital --
scene_heading: 133 INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY 133
text: Tomica sits in a chair pulled right beside Eazy's bed. They
text: hold hands, look at each other. They've both been crying.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Just glad you're okay. You and the
dialog: baby.
text: Tomica takes his hand, kisses it, cries.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: No. We can beat this. Together.
text: Eazy nods reassuringly, but you can see in his eyes he
text: doesn't believe it. Eazy's PHONE rings. He answers it.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Yo.
speaker_heading: REN'S VOICE
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Eazy! What the fuck, cuz? People
dialog: been sayin' some crazy shit. Like
dialog: you got AIDS or somethin'? Can you
dialog: believe that? Muthafuckin' Eazy-E
dialog: got AIDS? Niggas be starting too
dialog: many rumors, huh?
text: SILENCE. Ren is hit with the reality as Eazy TURNS OFF the
text: phone -- Sticks it in the bedside table drawer. It's pretty
dialog: clear he's never gonna turn it on again.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: Who was that?
text: Eazy doesn't respond, just lies there, despondent.
dialog: 136.

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: It's for you.
text: He grabs the phone, leans it on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: What up.
text: Dre's face contorts with confusion as he listens...
scene_heading: 135 INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - NIGHT 135
text: Tomica and Yella stand by Eazy's bedside. Eazy looks drained,
text: depressed. Various members of Eazy's FAMILY are also present.
text: Yella holds a CASSETTE in his hand.
speaker_heading: YELLA
dialog: It's Bone Thugs' new LP. It's good,
dialog: Eric. It's gonna be huge when it
dialog: drops. Everybody thinks so. Want me
dialog: to play it for you?
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Put it on the table. I'll listen
dialog: later. Thanks for stoppin' through.
dialog: Hit you when I get outta here.
text: Yella nods sadly, places the cassette on the bedside table
text: and exits. Handwritten on the cover, it says BONE.
scene_heading: 136 INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY 136
text: Tomica sits holding Eazy's hand, staring at him with haunted
text: eyes. RON SWEENEY stands in the background, along with Eazy's
text: Family. Someone else is there now, too. A PASTOR.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: I can't. That's not the way it
dialog: should happen. It's not right --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Please. It's gotta happen, baby.
dialog: I'm having my surgery tomorrow, so
dialog: it has to happen now. Because I
dialog: might not. Wake up.
text: Eazy's clearly struggling to come to terms with this.
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: Don't say that.
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: It's true, Tomica. I gotta make
dialog: this right. Ron says it's the only
dialog: way to protect everything I built.
text: Tomica looks to Ron, who nods. She stares off into space,
text: slowly shaking her head. Her life has become a nightmare.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: It's so... fucked up --
speaker_heading: EAZY
dialog: Hey. Listen to me. It doesn't
dialog: matter what people think. They
dialog: don't know. They don't understand.
dialog: There's no other way. Please. I
dialog: know it's not the way you pictured
dialog: it. You deserve better.
text: He reaches out, puts his hand on her stomach.
speaker_heading: EAZY (CONT'D)
dialog: But if we don't do this, I won't be
dialog: able to protect either of you.
text: After looking deep into Eazy's eyes -- He needs her.
speaker_heading: TOMICA
dialog: Okay. I love you, Eric.
text: Ron steps forward, followed by the FAMILY, who gather around
text: Eazy's bed. Finally, the PASTOR, who smiles kindly at them.
speaker_heading: PASTOR
dialog: Are we ready?
text: Tomica and Eazy nod their heads yes. The Pastor reaches out,
text: holds Tomica's hand in one hand, Eazy's hand in the other.
speaker_heading: PASTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Tomica Woods, do you take Eric
dialog: Wright to be your lawfully wedded
dialog: husband, to have and to hold...
text: Tomica tries not to cry, but it's impossible. The tears flow,
text: and all she can do is wipe them away. Eazy won't stop looking
text: at Tomica. Like she's the last thing he'll ever see.
dialog: 138.
scene_heading: 137 EXT. CEDARS - COURTYARD - NIGHT 137
text: Outside the Hospital, the VIGIL has grown in size. There's
text: now about a HUNDRED PEOPLE standing outside. Holding candles.
text: Many of them are crying. Holding pictures of Eazy.
scene_heading: 138 INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - LATER 138
text: DRE quietly enters the room, nobody in there except him and
text: Eazy. He walks to the bed. Looks down at his friend, whom he
text: hasn't seen in four years: Eazy's eyes are closed, a
text: RESPIRATOR doing his breathing for him.
text: NOTE: The BONE TAPE is still sitting, untouched, on the
text: bedside table. Eazy never got a chance to listen to it.
text: Dre stands there, staring down, in this extended, surreal
text: moment. He bends down, so his mouth is close to Eazy's ear.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Yo, Eazy. Wanna tell you somethin'.
dialog: I know you can hear me. I know
dialog: you're still in there --
text: We PULL BACK, so WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT DRE IS SAYING. And we
dialog: won't hear it, because that's between Dre &amp; Eazy.
text: After a few moments, Dre stands up straight. Whatever he had
text: to say to Eazy, he's finished now. He walks to the door --
text: On his way out, he passes TOMICA as she's coming in. He looks
text: at her. Then he looks at the ring on her finger. Walks away,
dialog: without saying a word...
scene_heading: 139 INT. CEDARS - OUTSIDE EAZY'S ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER 139
text: A phalanx of POLICE guards the front entrance, preventing the
text: MOB OUTSIDE from getting in.
text: OUTSIDE EAZY'S DOOR, find CUBE sitting in a chair. He spots
text: DRE walking out, looking glazed. Cube gets up. They stand
text: there looking at each other.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: S'up Dre?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Good to see you, Cube.
text: It's been awhile. Lot of water under the bridge. They finally

dialog: 139.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: You see him? How he look?
speaker_heading: DRE
text: He looks the same -- like Eric just
text: sleeping. But he's in a coma. Got a
dialog: machine breathing for him --
text: Cube frowns, looks at the ground, pained.
speaker_heading: CUBE
dialog: Can't see him like that, man. This
dialog: is bad. I asked one of his homies
dialog: to call me when he wakes up.
text: Dre nods, doesn't push it. He understands. As they exit
text: together, they pass the Police Guards, in tight formation by
text: the door, protecting the Hospital. Protecting Eazy.
scene_heading: 140 EXT. CEDARS - COURTYARD - LATER 140

scene_heading: THE CONFERENCE ROOM

speaker_heading: SUGE
dialog: What's the urgency, Dre?
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: I'm out, man. I'm out of Death Row.
speaker_heading: SUGE
dialog: You're not making any sense. Death

dialog: same. You can't just up and go.
text: Dre does not avoid Suge's gaze. He looks right at him.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Gonna do my own thing now. Start

dialog: myself. It's time, Suge.
speaker_heading: SUGE
dialog: You're one stupid muthafucka. You

speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: What we created? Ha -- Well you can
dialog: have it.
speaker_heading: SUGE
dialog: You ain't takin nobody with you.
dialog: Death Row stays Death Row. And if
dialog: you even think about touching my

speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (9/15/14) 141.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: Do what you gotta do. I'm still
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SUGE
dialog: You're not gettin none of it.
speaker_heading: DRE
dialog: I don't give a fuck-- You can't put
dialog: a price on peace of mind. So you
dialog: can keep the artists, the money,
dialog: the masters and the bullshit. I'm
