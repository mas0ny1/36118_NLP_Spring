scene_heading: 1. EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING. DAY
text: School’s out for the day. Students file out of the building, some alone, some in
dialog: small groups.
text: ALYOSHA SLEPTSOV (12) and MISHA KUZNETSOV (12), obviously pals, leave the
text: school, carrying their backpacks. They reach the edge of a large wooded ravine
text: that splits the area into two and take leave of each other with a complicated
text: handshake that includes finger signs and fist bumps, and culminates with the boys
text: poking each other in the shoulder. Then, MISHA heads along a path that skirts the
text: ravine towards some high-rise buildings, while ALYOSHA takes another trail
text: straight down into the ravine.
scene_heading: 2. EXT. RAVINE. DAY
text: The trail takes ALYOSHA to a paved footpath sparsely edged by street
text: lights and benches standing next to trash cans. ALYOSHA walks a little
text: way along the footpath, then takes another trail that veers off to the side.
text: He makes his way through bushes and tall thickets of deadwood, and finally
text: reaches a riverbank. He follows the river for a while, then ducks back into the
text: thicket and returns to the paved footpath, which veers sharply up a hill towards
text: some high-rises nearly identical to those on the opposite edge of the ravine.
scene_heading: 3. EXT. SLEPTSOVS’ BUILDING. COURTYARD. DAY
text: ALYOSHA walks past a high-rise building with multiple entrances. He turns and
text: approaches one of the entrances, presses a plastic key fob against the lock on the
text: metal door, pulls the door open, and disappears into the dusky entrance. The door
text: closes slowly on its automatic hinge, clunking loudly as it catches on the magnetic
dialog: lock.
scene_heading: 4. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ALYOSHA’S ROOM (VIEW FROM THE WINDOW).
speaker_heading: BLUE HOUR
text: Overcast evening. Below the seventh-floor window, woods stretch as far as the eye
text: can see under a dirty sky. A large satellite communication antenna looms over the
text: forest in the center of the shot, its dish angled straight up, ‘observing’ the sky. The
text: clouds above reflect the red light atop the antenna.
scene_heading: 5. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ALYOSHA’S ROOM. BLUE HOUR
text: ALYOSHA is sitting on a chair at his desk set up right under the window. As if ina
text: trance, he stares with unseeing eyes at some distant fixed point on the horizon. He
text: is alone in his room, supposedly doing his homework: his sixth-grade physics
text: textbook is propped up ona desktop book stand before him; a grid notebook is
text: open to a blank page; a pen is clasped loosely in his hand. A little off to the side, on
text: the corner of the desk, sits a bulky laptop with a Batman sticker on its closed lid.
text: Besides the desk, the room is furnished with a closet, wall bars for working out,
text: anda bed. An Incredibles poster is taped directly to the wallpaper above the bed.
text: The door to the room is slightly ajar.
text: The doorbell trills out in the hallway, jolting ALYOSHA out of his reverie. He peers
text: at the textbook and begins to write in his notebook.
text: His mother ZHENYA (36), a well-groomed and shapely young woman, peeks into
text: the room. She is dressed in a t-shirt and workout pants.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: They’re here to look at the place. Tidy up your room.
scene_heading: 6. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ENTRANCE HALL. BLUE HOUR
text: ZHENYA glances at herself in the entrance hall mirror, straightens her hair, and
text: opens the door to reveal three people: a female REALTOR (very young looking 45), a
text: middle-aged BUSINESSMAN, and a YOUNG WOMAN (27).
speaker_heading: REALTOR
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Evening!
text: With a blinding smile, she ushers them inside.
text: ALYOSHA closes the door to his room and returns to his desk.
scene_heading: 7. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. KITCHEN THAT OPENS INTO A BALCONY. BLUE
speaker_heading: HOUR
text: With a quick glance at the kitchen, ZHENYA, the REALTOR, the BUSINESSMAN,
text: and the YOUNG WOMAN enter the glass-paneled balcony. The BUSINESSMAN
text: opens one window pane, pokes out his head, and looks down.
speaker_heading: REALTOR
text: It’s a great neighborhood. Clean air, a metro station opening
text: soon, a shopping center nearby...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (jumps in)
text: Anew church, just recently built.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: (closes the window)
dialog: That’s good. What about the neighbors?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: They’re quiet.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Why are you selling?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: We're getting divorced.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: No worries.
scene_heading: 8. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. HALLWAY. BLUE HOUR
text: The REALTOR, ZHENYA, the BUSINESSMAN, and the YOUNG WOMAN exit the
text: kitchen into the hallway.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: OK, what’s next?
speaker_heading: Dn
speaker_heading: EALTOR
dialog: Bedroom.
text: The BUSINESSMAN and the YOUNG WOMAN disappear into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: (from the bedroom)
dialog: How big is it?
speaker_heading: Dn
speaker_heading: EALTOR
dialog: Hundred and fifty.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: And the living room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REALTOR
dialog: Two hundred and thirty-six. Come look.
text: The BUSINESSMAN and the YOUNG WOMAN re-emerge into the hallway and enter
dialog: the living room.
scene_heading: 9. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. LIVING ROOM. BLUE HOUR
text: The BUSINESSMAN and the YOUNG WOMAN enter the living room, look around,
dialog: and nod.
text: The YOUNG WOMAN crosses over to the window and looks over the
dialog: neighborhood below.
scene_heading: 10. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ALYOSHA’S ROOM. BLUE HOUR
text: As ZHENYA, the REALTOR, the BUSINESSMAN, and the YOUNG WOMAN enter his
text: room, ALYOSHA ignores them studiously, leaning over his desk and writing in his
text: notebook, his tongue sticking out with the effort.
text: ZHENYA approaches him and nudges him lightly on the back of the head.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Say hello to our guests.
speaker_heading: ALYOSHA
dialog: (not turning around)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: He’s 12, about as untamed as they get.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Areal man then.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: Yeah, right. Cries at the drop of a hat.
speaker_heading: ALYOSHA
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Don’t “Mom” me. How many times do I have to tell you?
text: ALYOSHA gets up and leaves the room.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
speaker_heading: (to the REALTOR)
dialog: Remind me, how many square feet in total?
speaker_heading: REALTOR
dialog: (uncertainly)
dialog: Twelve hundred and ten...
text: She looks at ZHENYA for confirmation. ZHENYA nods.
scene_heading: 11. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK. BLUE HOUR
text: ZHENYA (dressed in a track suit) jogs along a path through the park.
scene_heading: 12. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. KITCHEN THAT OPENS INTO A BALCONY. NIGHT
text: ATV atop the fridge is playing a reality show, with the sound turned down lw.
text: ZHENYA is sitting at the table with a glass of wine in her hand, scrolling through her
text: iPhone 4. The front door lock clicks as someone opens the door and enters.
text: ZHENYA shows no reaction. A few moments later, BORIS (42) appears in the
text: kitchen door.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Hey. Taking a break?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What do you care?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Never mind.
text: He opens the fridge, looks inside, then closes it and steps away to lean his butt
text: against the countertop next to the sink.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: So, did anyone come?
text: ZHENYA nods without looking up from her phone.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Said they had to think about it.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: I see.
text: He looks down at his feet, clad in white IKEA slippers. He pushes himself away
text: from the countertop with his arms, returns to the kitchen door, and pulls it closed.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: What about you... Did you think about it?
text: ZHENYA lifts her exhausted eyes to his face.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: (returns to the countertop)
dialog: You know... You are his mother, after all...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I’m so sick of your crap...
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: He needs his mother more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Actually, at his age, he needs his father more. Though maybe
dialog: not the kind of father you've been.
text: She takes a gulp of wine.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: He loves summer camp. He'll love the children’s home too.
dialog: Same thing.
text: BORIS heaves a deep sigh and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: And next thing you know, he'll be draft age. Better start
dialog: getting used to it. Well, what did you think, you could pull
dialog: the ol’ hump and dump, and move on? Shit everywhere and
dialog: leave the woman to clean it all up? No. I’m moving on too.
dialog: That’s equality for you.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: They’re going to pester us to death...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Who’s going to pester you to death? You can pester with the
dialog: best of them yourself.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Juvy officers, social workers, I don’t know, child
dialog: psychologists... Protective services, for fuck’s sake.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: So take him, and no one will bother you.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: They'll be going after you more. You're his mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Oh, so it’s me you're worried about? How nice. Juvy
dialog: officers... They'll be only too happy. It’s like pulling a baby
text: from a fire. His home, his family, all gone, but he is safe and
dialog: sound. All thanks to the heroic efforts of child protective
dialog: services.
text: She gets up from the table and steps out into the balcony, leaving her phone
dialog: behind.
text: In the balcony, ZHENYA throws one of the windows wide open, retrieves a pack of
text: cigarettes and a lighter from the windowsill, lights up, takes a deep drag, and
text: blows the smoke out of the window.
text: Still leaning against the countertop, BORIS cracks open a cabinet under the sink,
text: sees an empty wine bottle next to the trash can, and closes the cabinet again. After
text: amoment’s hesitation, he crosses over to the table, and his hand shoots out to
text: quickly push the home button on ZHENYA’s phone. The phone lights up with the
text: password screen: it’s locked. BORIS leaves the phone where it is, turns away, and
text: joins ZHENYA in the balcony, stopping just across the threshold.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Maybe you should talk to your mother one more time?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Right. Better yet, you talk to yours. We'll call a psychic, do a
dialog: séance.
dialog: (flicks ash out of the window)
dialog: I already talked to her. Don’t need any more of that, thanks.
text: BORIS heaves another sigh and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: If the Beard finds out...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Ah, so that’s what you're so afraid of! Silly me, I thought you
dialog: were worried about your child. Would be a hoot, though, if
dialog: they canned you from your precious job. I bet they would,
dialog: too. For sending your own son to the orphanage. How un-
dialog: Christian of you. How un-Orthodox. The Beard will never
dialog: stand for it. That'll be hilarious! What are you going to do
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Listen to you! So decisive!
text: (takes a frenetic drag on her cigarette)
dialog: What are you staring at? Quit gnashing your teeth!
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: (after a pause, quietly)
dialog: I’m so sick of your shit...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Bastard.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: When do we tell him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: We? What do you mean, “we”? You tell him. Tell him
dialog: whenever you want.
dialog: (flicks the cigarette out of the window)
dialog: Do it now, if you want. Wake him up and tell him.
text: She returns to the kitchen, steps over to the table, drains the wine from the glass
text: in one gulp, and walks out of the kitchen with a look of nonchalance, leaving the
text: door, which opens out into the hallway, wide open.
scene_heading: 13. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: ZHENYA walks down the hallway and enters the bathroom. We hear her urinate,
text: flush the toilet, and wash her hands.
text: She emerges from the bathroom and returns to the kitchen, closing the door
text: behind her this time.
text: Out in the hallway, the door closes to reveal ALYOSHA, who had been hidden
text: behind it, dressed in a tank-top and underwear. He must have been standing there
text: all through his parents’ conversation. His face is streaming with tears; he seems to
text: be shrinking into the wall.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA (0.S., FROM THE KITCHEN)
dialog: That's it, case closed. Don’t bring this up with me again.
dialog: Got it? In fact, don’t talk to me at all. I can’t stand the
dialog: sight of you or the sound of your voice anymore. When
dialog: are you moving out already? If you’re too cheap, I'll pay
dialog: for the movers myself! Why are you still hanging
dialog: around here? It’s over, you understand? Over!
text: ALYOSHA drags himself dejectedly back to his room and closes the door.
speaker_heading: BORIS (0.S.)
dialog: I have the same right as you...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA (0.S.)
dialog: Yes, yes, you have the right! You'll get yours, one way or
dialog: another!
text: She flings open the kitchen door, walks quickly down the hallway, iPhone in hand,
text: and disappears into the bedroom.
scene_heading: 14. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. KITCHEN. NIGHT
text: Alone in the kitchen, BORIS looks at the knife block sitting on the countertop,
text: matte metallic knife handles protruding invitingly from it. He retrieves a large
text: knife, places it on the countertop before him, then, after a slight pause, opens the
text: bread box, takes out a loaf, crosses over to the fridge to retrieve some lean sausage
text: wrapped in cling wrap, and makes himself a sandwich. He chews it absent
text: mindedly, staring at a fixed point ahead.
scene_heading: 15. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: BORIS turns off the kitchen light, walks down the hallway, and disappears into the
text: living room. Inside the room, he switches on the light and closes the glass living
text: room doors that had stood wide open until now. A short time later, he turns off the
text: light and lies down on the couch. It squeaks audibly underneath him.
scene_heading: 16. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. KITCHEN. DAY
text: Morning. The kitchen TV is playing a morning talk show. ALYOSHA, washed and
text: dressed, is sitting at the kitchen table, poking at fried eggs on his plate with a fork.
text: A mug filled with tea stands next to the plate. ZHENYA, wearing a bathrobe but
text: already in full makeup, is leaning with her butt against the countertop, flipping
text: through her iPhone.
speaker_heading: ALYOSHA
dialog: don’t want any more.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Finish it. What am I supposed to do, throw it out?
speaker_heading: ALYOSHA
dialog: ’m not hungry.
text: ZHENYA glares at him, her head lowered.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Drink your hot chocolate. What's up with you? Are you sick?
speaker_heading: ALYOSHA
dialog: ’m not sick.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: 
dialog: Fine, leave it, I’ll clean it up.
text: ALYOSHA slides out of his chair and leaves the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: No “thank you”?
speaker_heading: ALYOSHA
dialog: (from the hallway)
dialog: Thank you.
text: ZHENYA puts her phone down on the countertop, crosses over to the table,
text: retrieves the plate of unfinished eggs, takes it to the trash can, and tips the
text: remaining eggs away. She opens the dishwasher and slides the plate inside.
scene_heading: 17. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ENTRANCE HALL. DAY
text: Dressed in a hooded jacket, ALYOSHA pulls on his shoes, swings his backpack over
text: his shoulder, opens the front door, and steps outside. The female talk show host's
text: voice wafts in from the kitchen, along with the clattering of dishes as ZHENYA
text: loads the dishwasher.
scene_heading: 18. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ BUILDING. STAIRWELL. DAY
text: ALYOSHA closes the door behind him and walks past the elevator and down the
dialog: stairs.
text: For a long while, he runs down the stairs, hopping noisily and enthusiastically
text: over two or three steps at a time.
dialog: 10
scene_heading: 19. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ BUILDING. FIRST FLOOR LANDING. DAY
text: ALYOSHA reaches the first floor and bursts out of the building entrance, red-faced
text: and with his jacket flung open. The metallic door closes slowly behind him on its
text: automatic hinge, and the magnetic lock closes forcefully.
scene_heading: 20. INT. BORIS’ CAR. MOSCOW RING ROAD. DAY
text: Behind the wheel of his low-cost foreign car, BORIS is languishing in the Moscow
text: traffic. The car radio is tuned to an abrasively energetic morning show ona Russian
text: pop station. The program is dedicated to the looming end of the world predicted by
text: the Mayan cakndar. The anchors’ mindkss chatter gives way to a Russian dance hit
text: from late summer 2012. BORIS taps nervously on the wheel, completely out of time
text: with the song.
scene_heading: 21. EXT. MOSCOW RING ROAD. DAY
text: The traffic is moving at a crawl.
scene_heading: 22. EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY
text: BORIS parks on the sidewalk in Moscow’s business area, literally squeezing his car
text: into a tight spot between two other vehicles. His bag slung over his shoulder, he
text: walks quickly towards the building, then breaks into a jog.
scene_heading: 23. INT. SALES OFFICE. DAY
text: BORIS exits the elevator, passes through wide glass doors with the words SALES
text: OFFICE written in gold against a blue background above, and hurries down an
text: aisle between cubicle partitions. He ducks into his own cubicle, drops into the
text: chair at a desk holding a monitor, keyboard, and headset with microphone, boots
text: up the computer, then takes the bag from his shoulder, puts it into a desk drawer,
text: and pulls on the headset.
scene_heading: 24. INT. SELF-SERVE CAFETERIA. DAY
text: One wall of the cafeteria is decorated with a large, colorful painting of Jesus
text: feeding the multitudes with two fish and five loaves of bread.
text: BORIS walks along the self-serve line, placing food on his tray.
text: He pays at the register and heads towards a specific table, already occupied by
text: another man (COWORKER, 45) with a tray.
scene_heading: 25. INT. SELF-SERVE CAFETERIA. TABLE. DAY
text: BORIS and the COWORKER eat their lunch without removing the plates from their
text: trays. The COWORKER stares at his smartphone lying on the table next to his tray
text: as he eats. BORIS is lost in thought.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: (after a long pause)
dialog: Do you think the world is really going to end?
speaker_heading: COWORKER
dialog: Definitely.
text: (chews his food carefully and pokes at his teeth with his tongue)
dialog: How’s work? Any leads?
dialog: 11
text: BORIS shrugs uncertainly.
speaker_heading: COWORKER
dialog: The Lord taught us to share.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Fine, I'll have something for you by tonight. Maybe.
speaker_heading: COWORKER
dialog: It’s a win-win, trust me.
text: BORIS picks up his glass of fruit juice and takes a sip.
scene_heading: 26. INT. BEAUTY SPA. TREATMENT ROOM. DAY
text: Naked from the waist down, ZHENYA is lying face up on the waxing tabk at the spa.
text: A young female COSMETOLOGIST (30) in a white lab coat applies hot wax to
text: ZHENYAs pubic area with a spatula: one strip, then another, and another... She
text: tears off the strips, and ZHENYA yelps.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Ouch!
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Oh, come on.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: It hurts! Really!
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: It hasn’t even grown back yet! You can take it.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: So get this... Last night, my ex...
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: Got himself all worked up, worried.
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Good. Let him worry.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: So miserable, poor thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: He should be miserable. They’re great at making a mess, but
dialog: when it comes to cleaning it up...
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You think he’s worried about the kid? Right. That'll be the
dialog: day! He’s got debts hanging over his head. Terrified he'll get
dialog: booted from his job because of the divorce. Can you believe
dialog: it? Their boss man is this radical Orthodox Christian type, a
dialog: total bible-thumping whack job.
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Lift your leg. A fundamentalist!
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Exactly. Full-on beard down to here, tailored traditional
dialog: shirts, nice shoes, Brioni suits...
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: That’s one classy fundamentalist.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You can say that again. Has them all under Christian Sharia
dialog: over there. Only ever hires family men with children, all
dialog: baptized Christians, of course. The New Year office party
dialog: always falls on a fast. So naturally, not a bite to eat, and all
dialog: very understated. Oh, and we spent a couple of vacations on
dialog: pilgrimage tours of monasteries.
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Yeah, I remember, you told me. So what, sounds fun. Exotic.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Yeah, right. I was bored to death.
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Other leg.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: At least the money is good. Anyway, I can see he’s getting
dialog: really worried now.
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Could they really fire him?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Who the hell knows. I hope so.
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: But what about child support?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Ouch! Are you trying to maim me?
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: Okay, okay, calm down.
text: The COSMETOLOGIST squeezes some soothing oil into her palm and rubs it into
text: the freshly waxed areas.
speaker_heading: COSM
text: Flip over.
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
text: ZHENYA flips over onto her stomach. The COSMETOLOGIST lathers hot wax into
text: her butt crack.
speaker_heading: COSM
dialog: A friend of mine has this
dialog: sports.
dialog: Z
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: COSM
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
dialog: boss who’s into, get this: extreme
speaker_heading: HENYA
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
dialog: Yeah. He is always taking them kayaking, or skydiving, or
dialog: ski jumping...
dialog: Z
dialog: Ski jumping sounds cool.
speaker_heading: COSM
speaker_heading: HENYA
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
dialog: I don’t know. My friend busted her knee the first time. Spent
dialog: half a year in a cast. Goodbye tendons!
dialog: Z
dialog: Yikes.
speaker_heading: COSM
speaker_heading: HENYA
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
dialog: She says some of her coworkers even bought doctor’s notes
dialog: online: you know, to say
dialog: they had a weak heart or high
dialog: blood pressure, or whatever...
dialog: Z
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: COSM
dialog: He fired them! Said, if yo
dialog: Damn...
speaker_heading: COSM
speaker_heading: HENYA
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
dialog: ure sick, go to the hospital.
speaker_heading: HENYA
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ETOLOGIST
dialog: So prayers and monasteries aren’t so bad - it could be much
dialog: ‘worse.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Yeah, I guess. Though as far as I’m concerned, vacation
dialog: means the sea, the beach, a nice hotel... all inclusive!
speaker_heading: COSMETOLOGIST
dialog: You have good taste.
scene_heading: 27. INT. BEAUTY SPA. HAIR SALON. DAY
text: ZHENYA is sitting in a salon chair in front of a mirror, swaddled in a black sheet up
text: to her neck. A female STYLIST (40), scissors and comb in hand, is tinkering with
dialog: her hair.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: (obviously continuing their conversation)
dialog: And how does your new guy feel about all this?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Fine. He’s actually very progressive, you know?
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Well, he’s rich and healthy... Why not be progressive?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: Knock on wood.
text: ZHENYA pokes a hand out from under the sheet, leans slightly forward, and
text: knocks on the shelf under the mirror.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Don’t worry, I don’t have the evil eye.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I’m not even really superstitious. It’s sort of a habit, you
dialog: know, just in case.
text: The STYLIST nods, brushing ZHENYA’s hair.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Is he divorced? Got any kids?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: He’s been divorced for three years. Has a grown-up
dialog: daughter. She’s studying abroad. In Portugal, I think. Works,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: How old is he?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: Forty-five.
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: STYLIST
text: Good age. But he looks younger.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: He does tai chi, doesn’t smoke, almost never drinks...
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Now I’m really getting jealous. How is he getting along with
dialog: your boy? So, I'll even it out in the back?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Yeah, go ahead. He’s not... I feel like the boy hates my guts.
dialog: And he won't even hear of meeting the guy. The older he
dialog: gets, the more he becomes like his father. He’s even starting
dialog: to smell like him.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Secondary sex characteristics. He’s growing up. What did
dialog: you expect? That he’d stay your little angel forever?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: He was never a little angel. He’s always been so prickly.
dialog: Almost ripped me in two during labor - he didn’t want to
dialog: come out. Took a full day.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Oh goodness gracious... I've got my own stupid cow, too. I
dialog: look at her and it pains me to see it: she’s just like her
dialog: daddy... I hope he’s drunk himself to death by now in that
dialog: goddamned slum of his. But she’s not into that, | mean, she
dialog: doesn’t drink. I told her outright: I’ll kill you if you ever do.
dialog: No, I’m talking about her personality. Actually, it’s not even
dialog: her dad she’s like: more like his mother. And that’s one
dialog: major bitch, let me tell you.
text: With a swift motion of her hand, the STYLIST captures a lock of ZHENYA’s hair
text: with the comb and uses her scissors to trim the ends.
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: How old is your daughter, I’ve forgotten?

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Thank God for that, at least.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: I don’t know what she plans to live on. No profession, no

dialog: while you still can then. And she says, you don’t need an
dialog: education to be in Parliament. And that’s that. What can I

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: CLIENT

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Our rates changed.
speaker_heading: CLIENT
dialog: When? Just now?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Day before yesterday.
speaker_heading: CLIENT
dialog: That’s when I made the appointment. The website said
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You know, I don’t deal with the website.
speaker_heading: CLIENT
dialog: Well, you know, I want to speak to your manager.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Sure, go ahead.
speaker_heading: CLIENT
dialog: Don’t talk to me like that!
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Hello... Yes, I see. I’ll be right there.

scene_heading: 30. INT. BEAUTY SPA. DAY

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Good afternoon! How can I help you?
speaker_heading: CLIENT
dialog: I need you to explain to me, my dear, why your website lists

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: 18
dialog: Which services did you purchase?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: A haircut. With Filippova.
speaker_heading: CLIENT
dialog: When I made the appointment the other day, your website

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I’m very sorry. Our rates have gone up, and the website has

speaker_heading: ZHENYA

speaker_heading: ZHENYA

dialog: Except my mom, when I was little. But she was so cold to

speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (without opening his eyes)
dialog: Still alive and well, I hope?
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Alive. And yes, generally well. We almost never talk. Every
dialog: time I call, we end up fighting. Later, I can’t even figure out
dialog: what started it.
text: She takes a sip of her wine.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I didn’t even know what love meant until I met you. I never
dialog: loved my husband. And there wasn’t really anyone before
dialog: him. Even with him, I got pregnant by accident. He was so
dialog: happy, kept asking me to marry him. Said everything was
dialog: going to be okay because we were together. But I didn’t
dialog: want any of it. I was so scared... Scared to get an abortion,
dialog: scared to keep it... | really didn’t want a kid. When I went
dialog: into labor, I thought I was going to die. They had to take me
dialog: to the ICU. And when they brought him to me afterwards, I
dialog: couldn’t even look at him. | felt outright disgusted. My milk
dialog: never even came in. But then, life went on, things settled
dialog: down and we fell into this inertia...
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (without moving or opening his eyes)
dialog: Without love. Life should never be loveless.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: To this day, when I look at him, or even think about him, like
dialog: now, for example, I have this feeling that I made a mistake
dialog: which I can’t fix. | blame him, I blame myself... All I want is
dialog: to be happy. I’m an evil bitch, right?
text: ANTON opens his eyes, turns his head, and looks at her.
speaker_heading: ANTON

speaker_heading: HENYA
dialog: ate last night myself. Didn’t check

dialog: And I can’t reach his phone. Has he called you?
dialog: No.
dialog: Oh God...
speaker_heading: BORIS
speaker_heading: HENYA
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Don’t get hysterical. We'll find him, he'll be fine. We should

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I already spoke to Misha. He hasn’t seen him either,
dialog: yesterday or today.
speaker_heading: BORIS

speaker_heading: ZHENYA

speaker_heading: BORIS

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BORIS

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Oh, gee, I don’t know. Why don’t you come home and see for

speaker_heading: BORIS

speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Do you understand that no one has heard from him in over

speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: 
text: He could be coming up in the elevator as we speak. Or
dialog: walking home right now, I don’t know... 1 think you’re
dialog: overreacting. He probably did something bad: got an F, or
dialog: lost his tablet... And now he’s afraid of how you'll react, so
dialog: he’s staying away.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You mean it’s all my fault again?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: You don’t even know whether or not he’s been home. Most
dialog: likely, he was there last night. Hello?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Well, I’m calling the cops. And you can stay at work and keep

text: ZHENYA is sitting at the table, her face free of makeup and her hair tied back into a

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE

dialog: stop.
text: The POLICE OFFICER nods and leaves without even a glance at ZHENYA.
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Well, what can I tell you... | see no evidence of criminal
dialog: activity.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What do you mean, “criminal activity”?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Well, you know, sometimes parents will do away with their
text: kid, then file a missing person’s report.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: And you thought that’s what I’d done?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: We always start out with that theory. But what you have
text: here is a runaway. Happens all the time: 12 years old,
dialog: rebellious age, hormones out of control. Give him a few
dialog: days, he’ll be back. Of course we could go to the precinct,
dialog: spend a few hours ona detailed deposition. Probably not
dialog: today though: we would need your husband to be present as
dialog: well. But in any event, this case is unlikely to go beyonda
dialog: preliminary inquiry.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You said there’s no evidence of criminal activity. But what if
dialog: he was kidnapped? Because | can’t imagine where he could
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: I’m sure he’s just bumming around the neighborhood. He
dialog: won't last long. He’s used to a comfortable life. And you have
dialog: a comfortable life here. You can’t even imagine the kinds of
dialog: conditions kids come back to. Because the streets are worse
dialog: than any home, no matter how shitty. Now, as fora possible
dialog: kidnapping. Here’s how the system works: first, we conduct
dialog: a preliminary inquiry, which includes interviews with the
text: parents, relatives, friends, possible witnesses, and so forth.
dialog: We are short on resources, plus we have other cases to
text: investigate: murders, rapes, assaults, robberies, and so
dialog: forth. So the preliminary inquiry could take a few days. If
dialog: the runaway hasn’t turned up by then, and if we have
dialog: grounds, by which I mean evidence, then we open a missing
dialog: person’s case. Then, if the case investigation presents more
dialog: grounds, meaning more evidence - suspicion of murder,
text: kidnapping, and so forth - it becomes a criminal case. But
dialog: that’s up to the Investigative Committee. You can imagine
dialog: how long that takes and the mountain of paperwork it
dialog: requires. By then, the runaways have normally come back
text: and run away all over again.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: So you're just going to do nothing?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: I’m giving you a realistic picture. We are obligated to act.
dialog: And we will. But in this specific case... The system does not
dialog: have the resources or the time to chase after every kid.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I see. This case is going straight in the trash. So what am I
dialog: supposed to do? Sit around waiting for him to come back?
dialog: What if he doesn’t come back?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Statistics don't lie. In the overwhelming majority of cases,
text: teenage runaways come back after a week, ten days at the
dialog: most. But let me offer you some advice: if you want
dialog: somebody to actually look for him, and if you want them to
dialog: start as soon as possible, go online, find the missing child
dialog: search team website, and give them a call - they’ll tell you
dialog: what info they need. It’s staffed with volunteers, working
dialog: their asses off round the clock. No bureaucracy anda
dialog: streamlined, highly effective response protocol. How do I
dialog: know? Past experience of working together, with good
dialog: results. Anyway, here’s my phone number.
dialog: (hands her his card)
dialog: I have yours. We'll be in touch.
text: The DETECTIVE tucks the sheet of paper he was writing on into the folder and
text: rises from the table.
text: ZHENYA examines the card he handed her.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: 30
dialog: And that’s it?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: For now.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: The drowning man’s rescue is in his own hands, is that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
text: His own hands, and his feet, his head, and most importantly,
dialog: his heart.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Unbelievable.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Trust me, had you gotten any other detective, they'd have
dialog: been much more assertive with you, and much less helpful,
dialog: to put it mildly. It’s not that I’m such a nice guy. I’m just
dialog: trying to save time: my own, yours, and the search team’s.
dialog: The sooner you contact them and the sooner they get
dialog: started, the sooner they will find your little slacker hanging
text: out on the street or at the mall somewhere, or most likely
text: hiding out at a friend’s house while their parents are away
dialog: for a few days and they've got the place to themselves. So
dialog: get moving. Or wait. Your choice. That's it, | have to go now.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: But if he’s at a friend’s house, why didn’t he tell me?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: That’s a question only you can answer.

scene_heading: 57. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. LIVING ROOM. BLUE HOUR
text: BORIS enters the living room to find ZHENYA and the male search team
text: COORDINATOR (35) sitting across the table from each other. The COORDINATOR is
text: writing in his notepad A large color photo of ALYOSHA lies on the tabk in front of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BORIS
speaker_heading: (to the COORDINATOR)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: (to ZHENYA)
dialog: Sorry, got stuck in traffic.
text: ZHENYA ignores him.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: (to Boris)
dialog: Take a seat. Come on, let's get to work. My name is Ivan. I'm
dialog: the search team coordinator.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: (takes a seat at the table)
dialog: My wife told me on the phone.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Excellent. Then let's get started. Or more accurately, let's
dialog: continue. Let me tell you what's going to happen, so you
dialog: have fewer questions later on. I will be asking you detailed
dialog: questions about your son, Alyosha.
dialog: Meanwhile, my team is interviewing your neighbors and
text: possible witnesses: on the street, outside the building, in the
dialog: local stores...
text: The young woman in camo pants who was talking to the neighbor enters the living
text: room, smartphone in hand.
speaker_heading: LENA
speaker_heading: (to the COORDINATOR)
dialog: Nothing of interest from the neighbors.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Nothing at all?
dialog: 32
speaker_heading: LENA leaves.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: No one saw or heard him, today or yesterday. Can't
dialog: remember anything specific. More of our people have
dialog: arrived. We set up a command post behind the building (?)
dialog: and brought the fliers.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: You printed them out? Excellent.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: I'll keep canvassing the building.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Yes, stay on it.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: So depending on what the canvassing yields, we will focus
dialog: on specific locations and objectives. You and I are going to
dialog: finish up here and head on to the precinct to see the
dialog: detective in charge - rarely happens, by the way, even in
dialog: Moscow, so you really lucked out there. He promised to give
dialog: us access to the security cameras. This is a big deal, and
dialog: could really simplify our task. Next. It’s getting late, and the
dialog: boy will need a place to spend the night. Since it’s not
dialog: exactly spring outside, we'll be searching entrance lobbies
dialog: and stairwells. We'll ask the detective for the entry codes, I
dialog: expect he'll cooperate. So let’s start from the beginning.
text: He checks his notepad.
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
text: Alyosha Sleptsov, 12 years old, looks 10, no distinctive
text: features, healthy, approximately 51”, dark blond hair, last
text: seen wearing blue jeans, red hooded jacket, blue backpack,
dialog: white sneakers (?). Two days ago, left for school at the usual
dialog: time, and by the looks of things, hasn’t been home since. His
dialog: cell phone is unreachable, but we will keep dialing it
dialog: anyway. Now, I need you to tell me: what are the boy’s
dialog: interests? Hobbies, sports, dreams of building a space
dialog: station, traveling the world, and so on?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: He doesn’t have any hobbies. And he’s not interested in
dialog: sports, either. I guess he spends most of his time at home.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: You guess. Ah. I see. At home: that means on the computer.
dialog: His laptop is on his desk, right?
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Yes, but we try to limit his online time.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Especially you.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Let’s keep personal issues out of this. Can we access the
dialog: computer?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Excellent. You have access to his email, social network
dialog: accounts, phone numbers and addresses of his buddies and
dialog: girlfriends?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: He only has one friend, I guess. Misha Kuznetsov.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Guessing again. Fine.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Thave all his user names and passwords. And he does only
dialog: have one friend: Misha. I mean, in real life. As far as the
dialog: social networks...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: I see. Any close relatives he could have gone to see?
dialog: Grandmas, grandpas, uncles and aunts, cousins?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: No one on my husband’s side. On my side, just my mother.
dialog: She lives outside Moscow.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: But it’s probably been about three years since we last
dialog: visited. I doubt the kid remembers.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: The kid. I see. I do hope you called the grandmother? And
dialog: she said she hadn't seen the boy, correct?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I can’t reach her. Actually, things between us are... you
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: What do you mean, you can’t reach her?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: First she wouldn't pick up the phone, and now it says “the
dialog: number you dialed is unavailable.” Her connection was
dialog: always shoddy...
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Her connection is fine. She’s the one who’s “shoddy”.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Grandma’s quite a character, then. I see. Did you try the
dialog: neighbors?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I don’t have any of their numbers.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: It’s her summer home, her plot, her house, her neighbors...
dialog: It’s best to stay out of it, to avoid a heap of trouble.
text: ZHENYA shrugs.
text: BORIS chortles.
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Could she be hiding Alyosha? Say, if he asked her to?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I don’t think so...
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: She’s capable of anything. Stalin in a skirt!
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: That’s enough. How would he even get there? We only ever
dialog: drove there. And my mother wouldn't exactly be happy to
dialog: see him. You know how she is.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: What if they’ve been talking in secret? Isn’t it possible? She’s
dialog: a real trouble maker. Damn, I thought he’d seemed
text: withdrawn lately. She must’ve been filling his head with
dialog: nonsense this entire time!
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: But she doesn’t love him. She doesn’t love anyone.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Loves, doesn’t love... She’s using the kid against me. And
dialog: against you, too.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: (cuts them off)
dialog: Anyway. You have to go see the grandmother right away.
dialog: Where exactly does she live outside Moscow?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Ather summer home. All year round.
speaker_heading: BORIS
text: It’s towards Kiev. Hard to explain. The turnoff from the
dialog: highway is difficult to spot...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Do you havea car?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: How long is the drive?
speaker_heading: BORIS
text: About three hours. Maybe two and a half.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: OK, here’s what we'll do. Give me the contact info for all his
text: friends and acquaintances, including his homeroom
dialog: teacher’s number - I hope you have it? Excellent. Also, all his
dialog: user names and passwords. I’ll take the laptop; we'll go
dialog: through it at our headquarters and then decide on the next
dialog: step. And you, the both of you, get your car and go see dear
dialog: old granny. Lena will go with you: she’s a highly skilled
dialog: operative. Or rather, she’ll follow you in her own car.
dialog: Meanwhik, keep trying to reach the grandmother. When you
dialog: get there, check everything carefully, don’t overlook
dialog: anything, and call me right away to tell me how it went, no
dialog: matter what happens. Can you handle that? Someone will
dialog: stay here, in case the boy comes back.

text: BORIS’ car speeds along the dark highway, followed by an all-terrain vehicle
text: driven by LENA.
scene_heading: 59. INT. BORIS’ CAR. HIGHWAY. NIGHT
text: Ominous music is playing on the radio.
text: ZHENYA keeps dialing her mother’s number, but to no avail.
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Oh for God’s sake...
speaker_heading: (to BORIS)
dialog: Can’t you turn this off? Please? I have a headache.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: There’re some pills in the glove compartment.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Turn it off.
text: BORIS hesitates, then switches off the radio.
text: They drive in silence for a long time.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Do you think he’s there?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Where else could he be? Think about it.
text: (glances in the rearview mirror at LENA’s car following
dialog: closely behind)
dialog: Fuck, he really knows how to make life difficult! Perfect
dialog: timing too, the little shit.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What if something terrible’s happened to him?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Don’t think like that. He’s fine. He’ll get what’s coming to
dialog: him though, I'll see to that.
text: ZHENYA digs through her purse and fishes out her cigarettes.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: You can’t smoke in here anymore.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Right, terribly sorry. You've got a pregnant woman to
dialog: chauffeur around now, how could I forget? I'll blow it out
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: No, I said you can’t.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Or you'll do what? Throw me out of the car?
text: She lights up spitefully.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: 37
dialog: I see your headache has gone.
text: He rolls down all the windows, puts the fan on high, and switches the radio back
text: on, turning the volume all the way up. It’s now playing a different tune.
text: The wind roars through the car, beating against their faces and tearing at their
text: hair. An air current knocks the ash from the tip of ZHENYA’s cigarette. After only a
text: few drags, she tosses it out of the window, and pushes the window button on the
text: passenger door. The glass doesn’t budge: BORIS has locked the windows in the
dialog: open position.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Close the windows!
text: BORIS grins, staring at the road.
text: ZHENYA leans back in her seat and covers her face with her hands.
scene_heading: 60. EXT. FIELD. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT
text: BORIS’ car turns off the highway, windows rolled up and the radio now silent, and
text: LENA’s all-terrain vehicle follows it down a barely paved two-lane road with half
text: the street lights broken. The road cuts through expanses of fields fringed by
dialog: woods.
scene_heading: 61. EXT. WOODS. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT
text: Leaving the fields behind them, the two cars enter the woods, which soon grow
text: increasingly sparse, giving way to the concrete fencing of summer home
dialog: communities.
scene_heading: 62. INT. BORIS’ CAR. SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY. NIGHT
text: BORIS’ car pulls up to the summer home community’s automatic metal gates.
text: LENA’s vehicle stops a few feet to the right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Great, they put up a gate. What do we do now? Ram it?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: The side door is open.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: We just leave the car here?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Well, what do you suggest?
text: She opens the door and climbs out of the car. BORIS switches gears and backs
text: away from the gate. His headlights illuminate ZHENYA and LENA, who has joined
text: her outside. BORIS parks the car so as not to block the gate.
scene_heading: 63. EXT. SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY. SIDE DOOR. NIGHT
text: ZHENYA, BORIS, and LENA, who is armed with a long black flashlight, leave their
text: cars outside the gate and enter the community through the side door in the gate.
dialog: 38
scene_heading: 64. EXT. SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY. STREET. NIGHT
text: For a long while, ZHENYA, BORIS, and LENA walk along a sparsely lit, deserted
text: street bordered by fences of all shapes and sizes surrounding even more diverse
text: summer homes. None of the houses are particularly grand, and the lots
text: surrounding them are small, just a little over a tenth of an acre. All the windows
text: appear to be dark. Suddenly, an enraged dog begins to rattle his chain in an
text: agitated frenzy from behind yet another fence.
scene_heading: 65. EXT. SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY. ZHENYA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE. FENCE.
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: ZHENYA, BORIS, and LENA are standing in front of the garden gate of a tall, solid
text: wooden fence badly in need of a coat of paint. All they can see of the house beyond
text: the fence is the ridge of its roof and the brick chimney. ZHENYA presses the
text: doorbell next to the gate, and they hear a distant, muffled trill coming from
text: somewhere deep in the house. Silence. ZHENYA leans on the doorbell for a few
text: long moments. They hear no movement on the other side of the fence.
speaker_heading: BORIS
text: She won't open up. Probably raising the barricades as we
dialog: speak. She’s such a...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Enough. You make her sound like a complete monster.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Is there any other way in?
speaker_heading: BORIS
text: Only over the fence.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: We don’t have a key.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: I see.
text: LENA examines the gate, then walks along the fence and rounds the corner.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Where is she going?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: How should I know?
text: ZHENYA rings the bell again and phones her mother at the same time. No
dialog: response.
text: Suddenly, they hear crunching and cracking sounds, followed by the dull thump of
text: something hitting the ground on the other side of the wall.
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: LENA (0.S.)
dialog: Son ofa... Fuck.
text: She reaches the gate and after a few seconds of fiddling with the lock, opens it
text: from the inside.
scene_heading: 66. EXT. SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY. ZHENYA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE. FRONT
scene_heading: YARD. NIGHT
text: ZHENYA is standing outside the front door to her mother’s house.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Mom! Open up, it’s me!
text: Behind the door, all is silent.
text: LENA and BORIS circle the house from opposite directions. The dark rectangle of a
text: shed looms in the corner of the plot. LENA shines her flashlight into the windows
text: of the house. Suddenly, in one of the windows, the spotlight lands on a woman’s
text: pallid face, which immediately disappears back into the darkness.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: She’s in there!
text: LENA wheels around and walks quickly back to the front door.
text: ZHENYA hammers on the door with her fist.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Mom, open up! Alyosha is missing!
scene_heading: 67. INT. ZHENYA’S MOTHER'S HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT
text: A small oil lamp is burning under an icon on a shelf in the corner. ZHENYA is sitting
text: ona chair at the table. Her MOTHER (65) removes a tea kettle from the stove,
text: carries it to the sink, and fills it.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: I nearly had a heart attack. First the doorbell starts ringing
text: in the middle of the night, like there’s a fire. Then I hear
text: someone climbing over the fence. Oh, dear Lord in heaven...
dialog: And I can’t find my phone. What am I supposed to do?
text: She turns off the faucet, replaces the kettle on the stove, takes a box of matches,
text: and lights the gas burner under the kettle.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You could’ve at least warned me.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I’ve been calling you nonstop. And don’t tell me you didn’t
dialog: hear the phone.
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: As God is my witness.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I know you. First you wouldn't pick up, then you turned it
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I haven't seen it since this morning. Can’t imagine where it’s
dialog: got to. I must have lost it. Ah, to hell with it.
text: Zhenya’s MOTHER takes four tea bowls from a shelf, places them on the table,
text: then takes a seat and stares closely at ZHENYA.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Tell me this, my dear: I just can’t figure out why you thought
dialog: your boy was here. I can’t even remember the last time I
dialog: spoke to him. Or to you. Thank the Lord.
text: (turns towards the icon in the corner and crosses herself)
dialog: And I don’t regret it for a second. Not even a little. What’s
dialog: that goddamned ape of yours doing skulking around
dialog: outside? May God forgive me... Didn’t you say you were
dialog: getting a divorce?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Your god and your devil are cut from the same cloth.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What'd you say? What cloth? You watch your mouth, girl.
dialog: Don’t be getting all smart. And quit waggling your head at
dialog: me. This is your mother you are talking to. Have some
dialog: respect. Or else scram, and don’t let the door hit you on the
dialog: way out. I didn’t invite you here. Nothing but trouble since
dialog: you were born. Do you know what you look like now?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Awhore, that’s what.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What do you want, huh? A teat to suck on? Here. Always
dialog: mom-this, mom-that...

scene_heading: YARD/ATTIC. NIGHT
dialog: 41
text: In the front yard, LENA is climbing up a straight ladder to the attic, holding her
text: flashlight. BORIS is on the ground, holding the ladder steady. LENA opens the bolt
text: with a click, pushes open the door, and peeks inside, shining her flashlight around
text: the attic. It illuminates the opposite slope of the roof, the ceiling beams, some
text: small bits of trash — and nothing else. LENA locks the bolt and climbs down the
dialog: ladder.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: OK, we’re done with the house. Let’s check the shed.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: He’s not here, I can feel it. He never was.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: We'll check everything.
scene_heading: 69. INT. ZHENYA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT
text: BORIS enters the kitchen, walks over to the table, and sets down an ancient-model
text: cell phone. LENA stops in the doorway. ZHENYA looks inquiringly at BORIS, who
text: shakes his head in response.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: So have you poked around every nook and cranny? No sign
dialog: of him, huh? I don’t know why you even thought...
text: She takes the phone from the table and pushes a few buttons.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: The battery is dead, of course. Where did you find it?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Under your bed.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Must’ve fallen. Well at least you found it. Sit down, have
dialog: some tea. I don’t have anything to sweeten it, though. Just
dialog: some honey, but it’s all crystallized.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: No, thanks Mom, we’re going soon.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Well aren’t you polite. You two don’t seem all that torn up
dialog: about Alyosha going missing... Must’ve made this sob story
dialog: up to get me feeling sorry for you, is that it?
text: She looks from ZHENYA to BORIS and back again, then looks LENA up and down
text: with a mix of suspicion and disgust.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: 42
dialog: You picked the wrong one to mess with. I see right through
dialog: you. You said you were getting a divorce. Thought you could
dialog: saddle me with your fucking spawn, huh? Think again!
dialog: (makes an obscene gesture)
dialog: I’ve told you before, and I'll tell you again: I’m not looking
dialog: after him.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Do you get any company here, other than your TV?
text: Zhenya’s MOTHER pointedly ignores him and continues to look at ZHENYA.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Didn’t I tell you, back when you were knocked up, to come
dialog: to your senses? You ignored then. And I told you: the day
dialog: will come when you'll come crawling to your mother, but it
dialog: will be too late.
dialog: (raps a finger on the table)
dialog: Now, you reap what you sow. There’s your future.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Mom, what the hell are you saying? Have a little shame! At
text: least in front of strangers.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Don’t you lecture me. I have nothing to be ashamed of. This
dialog: is my house. Snooping around here in the middle of the
dialog: night, like thieves, and with your appraiser, too... Trying to
dialog: make a fool of me. I’m not signing the house over to you,
dialog: don’t even think about it. I’m leaving it to God.
text: The tea kettle on the stove begins to whistle. Zhenya’s MOTHER gets up and
text: switches off the gas.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I have nothing to feed you. Making ends meet on just my
dialog: pension. With no help from you, not one bit. I’d die waiting.
dialog: You wouldn't spare a nail for my casket.
scene_heading: 70. INT. BORIS’ CAR. HIGHWAY. BLUE HOUR
text: Predawn twilight. BORIS and ZHENYA drive along the highway in a deathly
text: silence. He is staring at the road ahead, exhausted, while she sleeps, leaning away
text: from him towards the window, her hands folded over her belly. The car bounces
text: slightly on a pothole. ZHENYA wakes up and looks at BORIS.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Where are we? How much longer?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Another 40 minutes, I think.
dialog: 43
text: BORIS turns on the radio.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Put on some music, will you?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: She gets more and more paranoid every year. And all that
dialog: hatred... Awful.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Like you're bursting with love, huh?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Why are you defending her?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Because she’s right.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: About what? That you can’t wait for her to croak?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Watch your language. She’s right that she warned me not to
dialog: get involved with you, not to have the baby, not to be stupid.
dialog: But stupid I was. I listened to you instead. “Everything will
dialog: be okay,” you said, “as long as we're together...” Now you tell
dialog: me, how is it that you, who wooed me with promises of love
dialog: and happiness, and showered me with flowers, in the end
dialog: brought me nothing but pain and disappointment? Just an
dialog: insufferable, shit-filled life.
text: She watches his profile as he clenches his jaw, staring at the road.
speaker_heading: 44
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You know, I never loved you. I just couldn’t live with her
dialog: anymore. And | couldn’t get free of her on my own. But I did
dialog: with you. I used you. At least that’s what / thought. And all
dialog: the while, you were using me, you needed a family. | would’ve
dialog: been fine without you. Really. I just needed somebody to
dialog: move in with. You were simply convenient. Had you not
dialog: gotten me pregnant... That clouded my judgment. I shouldn’t
dialog: have listened to you: I should’ve gotten the abortion, and
dialog: that would’ve been that.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: You should have. You're right, it would have been better.
dialog: For everyone.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You don’t say! So what’s changed? Are you a different
dialog: person? Didn’t you just knock up another young idiot so you
dialog: can drag her down to hell with you? And if your dick still
dialog: works in 10 or 12 years’ time, you'll do it all over again, I
dialog: know it. Poor girl, I feel sorry for her. You ruined my life. Do
dialog: you understand that? Thank God I finally met a good man,
dialog: someone who doesn’t need anything from me except me.
text: BORIS stomps on the brake, turns off onto the shoulder, and stops the car.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What happened? Did we break down?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Yes, we broke down. Get out.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: No, I’m serious.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: So am I. Go fuck yourself.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What?
text: He leans over her and pushes the passenger door. It swings open.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Get out, or I'll kick you out.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Go ahead! That’s the one thing you haven’t done to me yet.
dialog: I’m not going anywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Fuck off!
text: He lifts his hand, his eyes blazing terribly, but instead of hitting her, simply
text: clenches his fist until his knuckles turn white.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Fine, I’ll get out. You bastard.
text: ZHENYA climbs out of the car.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Don’t forget, your son is missing!
text: She slams the door shut with all her might.
text: BORIS speeds off abruptly and drives away without looking back.
speaker_heading: BORIS

dialog: Fucking idiot! Bitch!
scene_heading: 71. EXT. HIGHWAY. BLUE HOUR

scene_heading: 72. EXT. RAVINE. DAY
text: Early morning. Walking in a dense line, the search team is combing the ravine

scene_heading: 73. INT. POLICE PRECINCT. DAY
text: Morning. The DETECTIVE is sitting a desk in front of a computer. BORIS and the
text: COORDINATOR are standing behind him. All three are watching footage from the
text: external security cameras. BORIS is dressed in a waterproof outdoor jacket and
text: laced-up boots.
text: The monitor shows a very long view of the building entrance. The door opens, and
text: ALYOSHA bursts out of the building, wearing his jacket and a backpack on his
text: back. He skips along the side of the building until he disappears from view. Several
text: more people walk one after another in the same direction. (Possibly a second
dialog: camera (?!).
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: And that’s it. None of the other cameras picked him up. Not
text: on the way to school, not around the mall, which is like a
dialog: magnet to those kids...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: There’s a food court there. And it’s a nice place to hang out.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
dialog: .-not on the way to the bus stop or the taxi depot, if, say, he
text: was headed towards the metro, hoping to get to a train
dialog: station somewhere. There are a few possibilities. He either
text: turned down a street with no cameras - and there are
dialog: plenty of places like that - or he was careful to stay out of
text: camera range, which is less likely. Or somebody took him.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: What do you mean, “took him”?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
text: Kidnapped him.

dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: This is no joking matter.
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: No, but... that’s impossible...
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Unfortunately, it does happen.
speaker_heading: (to the COORDINATOR)
dialog: What have you got?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Nothing from the canvassing yesterday. Of course a lot of
dialog: time has lapsed. By our standards. Time to open a missing
dialog: person’s case. Maybe even a criminal one.
text: The DETECTIVE nods.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: We handed out the fliers: took them to the emergency room,
dialog: highway patrol, the stores; asked shopkeepers to keep them
dialog: by the registers. We haven’t put any up yet. A runaway
dialog: would see those and hole up somewhere, then we'd never
dialog: find him.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Naturally.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: We spent half the night combing the stairwells, any place he
dialog: might have known the entry code to and spent the night.
speaker_heading: (to BORIS)
dialog: He really doesn’t have a lot of friends.
dialog: (to both)
dialog: We are about to go talk to his best friend. Didn’t get to do it
dialog: yesterday, for reasons beyond our control. Looks like they
dialog: have a secret spot, “the base” they call it. We found
text: references to it on Alyosha’s computer. Any clue as to where
dialog: it might be?
text: BORIS shrugs.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Leave me 20 or so of your fliers. I’ll hand them out around
dialog: the precinct.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Of course.
text: BORIS’ phone rings. He checks the screen, excuses himself, and steps off to the
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Hi...

dialog: 48
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I miss you, baby. Are you coming tonight? You promised.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: I’m afraid I can’t, honey. I have to keep searching.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: What about me? What about your work? You said they’re
dialog: very strict over there.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: I took some personal time.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Mmm. From work and from me?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Please don’t be silly. You know what’s going on.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I just feel so lonely... You are there, I am here... It won’t
dialog: always be like this, will it?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Of course not. Please stop doing this to me.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: When are you coming over?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: I don’t know yet. I'll call you.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Soon, baby, soon. OK, I have to go.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Don’t hang up. I want to hear what’s going on over there.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Stop it. You’re putting me in an uncomfortable position.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Why? Do you have something to hide?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: No, honey, of course not.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I’m sure you're hiding something. Is your ex there, too?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: No, no, she’s not. Don’t be silly. I love you.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I love you too. We love you.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: And I love you both. OK, bye, baby.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Bye, sweetie. I can’t wait to see you.
text: MASHA holds the phone to her ear for a few more seconds to make sure BORIS has
text: hung up, then ends the call and turns to the old woman reading a magazine.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Let’s go, Mom.
speaker_heading: MASHA’S MOM
dialog: (closes the magazine)
dialog: You hungry?
text: MASHA nods and heaves herself slowly up from the bench.
speaker_heading: MASHA’S MOM
dialog: (rises and helps MASHA to her feet)
dialog: You are so gentle with him, like a little kitten.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Mom, let me deal with him my way...
speaker_heading: MASHA’S MOM
dialog: Was I meddling? Of course you deal with him your way. I’m
dialog: only looking out for you. My mother taught me, and I’m

speaker_heading: MASHA

text: ZHENYA is asleep on ANTON’s bed, cradling a pillow.
text: Freshly shaven and full of pep, ANTON enters the bedroom, perches on the bed,
text: and gently wakes ZHENYA.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Get up. Time to go. I made breakfast.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Huh? Oh, right, right...
text: She sits up in bed and squints at him sleepily.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: What time is it? Did anyone call me?
text: She takes her iPhone from the bedside table and looks at the screen.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: I'll come with you, if you don’t mind.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: (lifts her face from the iPhone)
dialog: No, I don’t mind. But don’t you have to go to work?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Work can wait. They’re people too, they’ll understand.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Right, I have to call what’s his face, the coordinator... My
dialog: God, it’s so late! I set the alarm.
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: I turned it off. You needed to get some sleep.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Hello, Ivan? This is Alyosha Sleptsov’s mother.
scene_heading: 76. INT. COORDINATOR’S CAR. DAY
text: The COORDINATOR is driving a high all-terrain-vehicle through the neighborhood,
text: following BORIS’ car.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Yes. Any news?
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (a little taken aback)
dialog: No. You?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: We haven't found him yet. We'll keep looking.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: You see, what happened was...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: I really don’t have the time.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Yes, yes, I’m sorry. Tell me, is there anything / can do? I can’t
dialog: just sit around...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Get on the phone, call every single hospital in the area. We
dialog: are looking for any unidentified boy between the ages of 10
text: and 13, brought in by the cops or an ambulance. Even if he
dialog: doesn’t fit the description, we need to check in person. If
dialog: you find anyone who fits these parameters, contact me
dialog: immediately, preferably by text, and I'll send over a team to
dialog: take a look.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: We can go ourselves. We have a car.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Excellent. But let me know anyway. I’ll send over one of our
dialog: veteran operatives to go with you, they'll know what to do
dialog: and what to say. If you find more than one boy, it’s best to
dialog: send several teams. OK, we'll be in touch.
text: He hangs up and parks the car next to BORIS in a small parking lot outside the
dialog: school wall.
dialog: 51
scene_heading: 77. EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
text: BORIS and the COORDINATOR climb out of their cars, enter the school yard, and
text: head towards the building.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: Why do you only want to talk to Misha Kuznetsov? Why not
dialog: notify the entire school?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Same reason we haven't papered the town with fliers. If he
dialog: knows people are looking for him, he'll dig in, and we'll
dialog: never find him.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: What if he and Misha are in cahoots?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Of course at this age they are already pretty good liars, but
dialog: nowhere near as good as adults. We'll get the truth out of
dialog: him. I'll be the only one asking questions. This is not up for
dialog: discussion.
text: They enter the school building.
scene_heading: 78. INT. SCHOOL. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE. DAY
text: In the Principal’s office, the COORDINATOR is speaking to MISHA. BORIS is sitting
text: ona chair nearby. The female PRINCIPAL (50) is also present.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: When was the last time you saw him?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Um... three days ago, I think...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Tuesday? The twenty-fifth?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MISHA
text: Here, at school.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: What did you do after school?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Nothing. We both went home.
dialog: 52
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Where do you normally hang out?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Um... outside the building... | don’t know...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Where else?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Um... nowhere...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: OK, fine. Probably at the mall?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: No, our parents won't let us.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: So what, you just play in the sandbox all day like little
dialog: babies?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: No. We're not babies. We play soccer at the hockey rink...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Do you have a bike?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: And where do you and Alyosha normally cycle to?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Just, uh... outside the building...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Listen, Misha, if you know where he is, but you promised
dialog: not to tell, that’s fine, don’t tell us. We'll find him anyway. Or
text: he will show up on his own when he gets tired of living
dialog: outside. What matters is that you know your friend is safe,
dialog: alive and well. And we old people can run around in circles
dialog: looking for him, we don’t mind. It’s like hide-and-seek,
dialog: right? Is this a game you two are playing?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: No. I don’t know where he is. I swear.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: OK. I believe you. Well, where could he be? I know you two
dialog: have your “base”. I might not know where it is, but | know
dialog: it’s out there. You talked about it on Facebook. If you really
dialog: don’t know where he is, but you think he might be there, you
dialog: have to tell us where it is. Your friend might be in danger.
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: See, son, we will find it anyway. But what if we’re too late?
dialog: What’s more important to you: your friend or some secret
dialog: spot? You'll find a hundred other secret spots. Even if you
dialog: swore some sort of an oath, you wouldn’t be breaking it. It
dialog: doesn’t count when you're saving a friend. He needs your
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: Um... our base is in the woods.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Is ita dugout? A tent?
speaker_heading: MISHA
text: No, an abandoned building. It’s in the basement...
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: How do you get there: on foot or by bike?
speaker_heading: MISHA
dialog: It’s far on foot, but you could do it. We usually take the
dialog: bikes.
scene_heading: 79. EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE WOODS. DAY

scene_heading: 81. EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING. DAY
text: The search team’s minivan and all-terrain vehicles pull up to an abandoned
text: building concealed by the woods.
text: The operatives file out of their cars and prepare for their search. Most of them
text: look experienced and well-equipped, except for a few newbies like BORIS.
scene_heading: 82. INT. ABANDONED BUILDING. BASEMENT. DAY
text: Armed with flashlights and radios, wearing a mix of construction hard hats and
text: military helmets, the search team searches the basement. BORIS is among them.
text: (They could be using portable fluorescent lamps. (?)) In one corner, they find
speaker_heading: 54
text: several wooden board pallets; two disintegrating armchairs spilling their springs
text: and foam; a wooden crate doubling as a table and covered with a piece of
text: cardboard; empty soda bottles; crushed McDonalds boxes; and on one peeling wall,
text: a poster of a vulgar half-naked woman, eyes rolled back in affected ecstasy.
text: On one of the pallets, BORIS finds a tattered child-sized jean jacket. He picks it up,
text: examines it, and turns to peer into the darkness at the search team operatives.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: This is his jacket.
text: Aradio hisses and clicks in the dark as one of the operatives immediately gets the
text: COORDINATOR on the line.
speaker_heading: OPERATIVE
dialog: (into the radio)
dialog: Ivan, we've found a jean jacket. The father is sure it’s his.
dialog: Over.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR (0.S.)
dialog: Copy that. So we definitely have to comb the entire building
dialog: and surrounding area.
scene_heading: 83. EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING. DAY
text: The COORDINATOR is standing over a map of the area spread on the hood of one
text: of the cars and talking to his team.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Remember to mark down and report dangerous or
dialog: questionable spots, but never go near them on your own.
dialog: We have experts for that. Let’s not add to the misery by
dialog: getting hurt. If anyone does have an accident, though, we
dialog: suspend the search and focus all efforts on helping our
dialog: friend. First off, contact the coordinator. The only person
dialog: qualified to administer medical help is the doctor, this
dialog: gentleman here.
text: The COORDINATOR points at one of the operatives, who raises a hand in response.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: If the runaway has limited mobility when you find him, do
dialog: not move him. Talk to him, calm him down, and wait for the
dialog: doctor. That’s it. Now, lock and load, people! Figuratively, I
dialog: mean; don’t take that as literal instructions.
scene_heading: 84. INT. ABANDONED BUILDING. DAY
text: The search team is painstakingly combing through the debris that fills the post-
text: apocalyptic innards of the building.
scene_heading: 85. EXT. HOSPITAL. DAY
dialog: 55
text: ZHENYA and ANTON pull into a parking lot in ANTON’s car. LENA, still wearing

speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Hello. Could you help us?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hello. What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: We are from the search and rescue team. We’re looking for a
text: boy, Alyosha Sleptsov, 12 years old. This is his mother.
speaker_heading: (points at ZHENYA)
text: He ran away from home, so he might be going by a different
dialog: name. We gota tip that you admitted a child yesterday who
dialog: fits his description. We'd like to see him.
text: The NURSE closes the ledger, slides it into a desk drawer, locks it, and stands up.
speaker_heading: NURSE
speaker_heading: (to LENA and ANTON)
dialog: You two need to step out, please.
speaker_heading: (to ZHENYA)
dialog: You, follow me.
text: ZHENYA and the NURSE walk down the hallway.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Is he OK?
speaker_heading: NURSE
text: He’s fine. Just a little tired and frightened.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Frightened of what?
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Well, the cops picked him up on the street last night, kept
dialog: him somewhere at the precinct until morning, then brought
dialog: him here, dirty and hungry...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: How could that be? They know we're looking for him. | filed
text: a missing person’s report.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: They don’t know anything. The shift changes, and that’s
dialog: that. They have no idea who the kid is, or where he came
text: from. And he’s not talking either. So they take him to the
dialog: hospital. We see this all the time.
scene_heading: 89. INT. HOSPITAL. WARD. DAY
text: The NURSE motions for ZHENYA to follow her and enters the ward, walled in by
text: partitions. One of the two beds inside is unoccupied. The NURSE stops by the
text: other bed, in which a boy is lying, facing the wall with the blanket pulled over his
text: head. The NURSE leans over the boy and shakes him lightly by the shoulder. He
text: pulls the covers from his head and turns to face them. It’s not ALYOSHA.
scene_heading: 90. EXT. WOODS. DAY
text: The sun dips below the horizon. Search teams of between five and seven people,
text: walking in a line with 15 to 20 feet between each person, continue to comb the
dialog: woods.
text: BORIS is part of one of the teams.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER (35)
dialog: Stop! Don’t get ahead of the others, and don’t fall behind!

dialog: Let’s go!
scene_heading: 91. EXT. WOODS. UNDER THE LARGE SATELLITE ANTENNA. DAY
text: BORIS’ search team is walking in a line along a concrete fence topped with coils of

scene_heading: 92. EXT. WOODS. ANTENNA STATION CHECKPOINT. DAY
text: The TEAM LEADER and BORIS are talking to a police CAPTAIN (45) guarding the
text: antenna. They hand him one of the fliers.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (examining the flier)
dialog: No, I haven’t seen him around here. No one gets inside
dialog: without a pass or a special permit. This is a restricted
dialog: facility.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER
dialog: Could I take down your personal information?
dialog: 57
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Sure, go ahead.
scene_heading: 93. EXT. WOODS. LAKE. BLUE HOUR
text: BORIS and the TEAM LEADER emerge from the woods on the shore of a lake. The

text: The radio hisses and clicks in the TEAM LEADER’s hand.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER
dialog: (into the radio)
dialog: Ivan, come in. We’ve searched the lakeshore. No trace of the
dialog: boy. Over.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR (0.S.) (ON THE RADIO)
dialog: Copy that. Get back here.
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: What about the lake itself?
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER
dialog: We don’t search for bodies. That’s up to the Emergency
dialog: Services and the police...
text: He turns around and heads back into the woods, leaving BORIS alone. BORIS
text: remains there for a long time, staring at the dark surface of the lake.
scene_heading: 94, EXT. COMMUTER DISTRICT. NIGHT
text: Late night in the city. The mobile search and rescue command post has moved
text: from the woods back to the lot near the SLEPTSOVS’ building. Most of the same
dialog: team members and gear we saw in the woods are here now. Operatives are
text: crowded outside the minivan, its doors open. The COORDINATOR is standing on
text: the door step of the minivan, towering slightly over the crowd. ZHENYA and
text: ANTON are standing at the front of the crowd; BORIS a little off to the side.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Since we have no leads and no new information about
dialog: possible search sites, we are moving on to full-scale flier
dialog: distribution. We paper everything with them: bus stops,
text: doorways, lamp posts, benches, announcement boards,
dialog: fences... Get permission from the guard or management
dialog: before posting them in stores. In other words, follow the
dialog: usual protocol. We also need a team of five people to search

scene_heading: 95. EXT. COMMUTER DISTRICT. BUS STOP. NIGHT

scene_heading: 97. INT. 24-HOUR STORE. NIGHT
text: LENA is talking to the OWNER (55) of a small 24-hour store: a barrel-bellied man
text: from the Caucasus. ZHENYA and ANTON are standing nearby.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: You have such a nice store, great foot traffic. Would it be OK
text: if we put up a flier at the entrance? A young boy is missing.
text: The OWNER looks ZHENYA and ANTON up and down.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: And who are you?
speaker_heading: LENA
text: Search and rescue team. Volunteers.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Ah. Fine, put it up. But not on the glass.
speaker_heading: LENA

scene_heading: 99. INT. HIGH-RISE BUILDING. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
text: BORIS and the COORDINATOR, holding the radio and with a flashlight at his side,
text: search the stairwell. They take the elevator to the top floor, then walk down the
text: stairs. While one searches the nooks and crannies, the other watches the stairwell.
text: They check two floors and head further down. Suddenly, the elevator starts
text: moving from the top floor.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: (to BORIS, quietly)
dialog: Stop.
text: They stop on a landing between floors and listen closely. The elevator stops
text: somewhere below them. The COORDINATOR's radio springs to life.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER (0.S.)
dialog: (on the radio)
text: Ivan, the elevator stopped on the fourth floor. Over.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: 59
dialog: Got it. We're waiting.
scene_heading: 100. INT. HIGH-RISE BUILDING. ENTRANCE LOBBY. NIGHT
text: On the first floor, the TEAM LEADER is watching floor numbers light up above the

text: The elevator starts moving, and number three blinks to life.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER
dialog: (into the radio)
text: It’s heading down.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR (0.S.)
dialog: (on the radio)
dialog: Copy that.
text: Number two lights up, followed by number one... The elevator doors open, letting
text: out two slightly tipsy YOUNG WOMEN (20).
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN 1
speaker_heading: (to the TEAM LEADER)
dialog: Oh... Hello!
text: Her friend drags her towards the exit. The TEAM LEADER watches them leave,
text: then lifts the radio to his mouth.
scene_heading: 101. EXT. HIGH-RISE BUILDING. COURTYARD. NIGHT
text: On the other side of the street, almost directly across from the building entrance,
text: another operative dressed in camo stands holding a radio. The YOUNG WOMEN
text: emerge from the building and head straight towards the operative.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER (0.S.)
dialog: (on the radio)
dialog: It’s not him. We’ll keep going.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR (0.S.)
dialog: (on the radio)
dialog: Got it. Stay in touch.
text: When the YOUNG WOMEN draw even with the operative, one of them gives hima

text: direction of another OPERATIVE (40) wearing camo and equipped with a radio,
text: standing outside the third entrance down.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN 1
text: (slows down as they reach the OPERATIVE)
dialog: Hey, it’s the little green men! What planet are you from?
speaker_heading: OPERATIVE

scene_heading: 104. EXT. COMMUTER DISTRICT. DAY
text: Early morning. Fliers bearing ALYOSHA’s photo are plastered all over the still

dialog: fences...
scene_heading: 105. INT. MORGUE. HALLWAY. DAY
text: The COORDINATOR marches briskly down a long hallway inconsistently lit with

scene_heading: 106. INT. MORGUE. COLD STORAGE. DAY
text: The COORDINATOR, BORIS, and ZHENYA stand over a body ona gurney,
text: concealed by a sheet.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: This won't be easy.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I’m ready.
text: The COORDINATOR turns his head and nods to someone.
text: A morgue technician emerges from the side somewhere, wearing a lab coat that
text: was once white, and uncovers the body.
text: ZHENYA yelps, then immediately clamps a hand over her mouth. She stares at the
text: gurney, her eyes bulging with horror.
text: The blood drains from BORIS’ face. He sways slightly, as if punched in the chest by
text: an invisible fist, his breath caught in his throat.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (holding a hand to her face)
dialog: It’s not him.
text: They are looking at the disfigured body of a child: face smashed beyond

text: reddish-black mess where the sex organs should be.
dialog: 61
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
text: Alyosha has a birthmark right there, on his chest.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: Please, take it away...
text: BORIS moves towards her, as if to catch her. She motions for him to stop.
text: The COORDINATOR nods to the morgue technician, who covers the body with the
text: sheet and rolls the gurney around the corner and into the darkness.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: The proper thing would be to run a DNA analysis, just to be
dialog: sure...
speaker_heading: BORIS
dialog: To be sure of what? It’s not him.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: We are absolutely certain it’s not him.
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: You know, sometimes people simply refuse to believe...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (raises her voice)
dialog: It’s not him. How many times do we have to tell you?
speaker_heading: COORDINATOR
dialog: Listen, you are the only ones who can request the test. The
text: cops still haven’t opened a case. Dragging it out, as usual.
dialog: 62
dialog: Your detective, it turns out, is retiring in a few days - he has
dialog: other things on his mind...
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: Quite torturing us! I told you, plain as day: it’s not him! You
dialog: hear me? It’s not him! Not him! (to BORIS) Say something!
text: She stares desperately at BORIS, then suddenly wrings her hands as tears literally
text: stream from her eyes. She suddenly looks like a little girl.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I wanted you to suffer, I wanted you to hurt, you bastard! I
dialog: would've never given him up, you hear me? Never! You
dialog: understand? I would've never given him up to anyone!
text: She lunges at BORIS, fists raised, and starts pummeling him on the chest,
text: shoulders, face... He doesn’t defend himself. Blood starts dripping from his nose.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: I will never give him up! You hear me? Never! Please God,
dialog: just let him come back!
text: The COORDINATOR drags her away from BORIS and leads her out into the
dialog: hallway.
scene_heading: 107. INT. MORGUE. HALLWAY. DAY
text: The COORDINATOR leads ZHENYA out into the hallway. ANTON dashes over, puts
text: his arms around ZHENYA, and holds her close.
speaker_heading: ZHENYA
dialog: (her face buried in his chest)
dialog: It’s not him... It’s not him...
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Thank God for that. That’s good.
text: The COORDINATOR returns to the cold storage room.
scene_heading: 108. INT. MORGUE. COLD STORAGE. DAY
text: The COORDINATOR returns to the cold storage room to see BORIS sitting on the
text: floor, slumped against the wall, head hanging down, face buried in his hands. He
text: feels the presence of another person, lifts his head, glances at the COORDINATOR,
text: then hides his face in his hands again. Blood is smeared under his nose.
scene_heading: 109. INT. SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE. ALYOSHA’S ROOM. DAY
text: BORIS and ZHENYA’s old apartment is undergoing major renovations. A
text: contractor enters Alyosha’s former room from the hallway, crosses over to some
text: bags of construction trash stacked by one of the walls, picks one up, and walks out
text: of the room. Another contractor is peeling wallpaper from a different wall.
dialog: 63
text: Eventually, he reaches the Incredibles poster, and pulls it down along with the
text: wallpaper stuck to it.
text: Outside the window, it is winter. Snow is falling over the same view of the woods
text: that stretch as far as the eye can see under a dirty sky, with the same large satellite
text: communication antenna looming over the forest, its dish angled straight up
text: ‘observing’ the sky.
scene_heading: 110. INT. MASHA’S PLACE. KITCHEN/HALLWAY. DAY
text: MASHA and her MOTHER are making dumplings in the kitchen. A text message
text: notification chimes on a cell phone in the hallway. MASHA wipes her hands and
text: walks out into the hallway to get her phone from the side table that stands under
text: the mirror by the front door. She picks up the phone, looks at the screen, presses a
text: few buttons, and carries the phone back into the kitchen.
scene_heading: 111. INT. MASHA’S PLACE. LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: From the hallway, we see a 2-year-old child walking brightly around the living
text: room with toy in hand. A TV in the living room is showing a report on the winter
text: military action in Debaltsevo, a village in Eastern Ukraine. BORIS is watching the
text: report from the couch in front of the TV, eating chips right out of the bag. He has a
text: beard and a different haircut.
scene_heading: 112. INT. ANTON’S PLACE. LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: The same report is playing on the TV. ZHENYA, with a new haircut and looking
text: like a different person, her face altered in some elusive way, is sitting with her feet
text: on the couch in front of the TV, flipping through her iPhone 6. Finally, she presses
text: a button on the side of the phone, switching off the screen, gets up from the couch,
text: and carries the gadget out of the room.
text: On the other end of the couch, ANTON doesn’t look up from the TV.
scene_heading: 113. INT. ANTON’S PLACE. BALCONY. DAY
text: Ina spacious, winterized balcony with expensive window panes, radiator, and
text: heated floor, ZHENYA is running on a treadmill. She runs for a long time.
text: Finally, she lowers the speed and slows down, then switches to a walk and stops,
text: breathing heavily. She turns off the treadmill.
scene_heading: 114. EXT. RAVINE. BLUE HOUR
text: Twilight. It’s snowing. A badly faded flier with a barely distinguishable photo and
text: text is taped to a lamp post that stands over a paved footpath down in the ravine.
text: The tape’s dirty edges are peeling off in places. The flier reads “Alyosha Sleptsov,
dialog: 12 years old, missing since September 26, 2012...”
dialog: 64
