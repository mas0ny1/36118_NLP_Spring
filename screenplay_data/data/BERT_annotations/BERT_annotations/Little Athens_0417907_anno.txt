scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about
text: eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-
text: shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.
dialog: 
text: Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and
text: tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING
text: from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and
text: not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and
text: jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can
text: of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the
dialog: sink.
dialog: 
text: He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he
text: is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and
text: exits the bathroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a
text: naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old
text: POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot
text: of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his
text: Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE
text: and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.
text: He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a
text: house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but
text: still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his
text: Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to
text: look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.
dialog: 
text: He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with
text: handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen
text: door slam shut behind him.

scene_heading: EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job. A faded
text: sign reading "ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD" stands in front.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER (O.S.)
dialog: You hear about your ex?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON (O.S.)
dialog: Jerry?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about
text: nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched
text: conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden
text: table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie
text: model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than
text: Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than
text: Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of
text: her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine.
text: Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she
dialog: has a lot on her mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to
dialog: Middletown. He left this morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: No way. How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Carter said. He got some job at some
text: company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.
dialog: 
text: Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and
text: stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the
dialog: window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Doesn't sound so bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I don't want to go to a baseball game.
dialog: You're going with Derek anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek
dialog: told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by
dialog: myself.
dialog: 
dialog: 3
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I thought Adam was hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I wish.
dialog: 
text: Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is
text: standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt
text: and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their
text: late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept
dialog: last night.
dialog: 
text: Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over
text: to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through
text: the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of
text: the mailbox that hangs next to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (banging on the window
dialog: pane)
dialog: Hey! Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4"
text: and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers.
text: Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Finally!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Office hours are nine to five.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You have a lot of credit card bills in
dialog: there, Jimmy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: (holding his hand out for
dialog: the Mail)
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: Megan hands Jimmy the Mail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You're not mad that we're stopping by like
dialog: this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It's no big deal, but let's hurry up. I
dialog: gotta go to work.
dialog: 
dialog: 4
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (explaining to Amy)
dialog: Jimmy's got like, six jobs.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment.
text: Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to
text: Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for
dialog: nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby
dialog: Bales is askin' about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Askin'? Like how?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Like how you owe him money on the Dallas
dialog: fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and
dialog: you haven't been returnin' his calls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How you hear this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer
dialog: on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out-
dialog: of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man.
dialog: Goddam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: It ain't nothin'. He's just makin'
dialog: conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: It ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's
dialog: gonna make a playground outta your asshole
dialog: like he's back in the joint, and it ain't
dialog: nothin'? And you heard all the stories I
dialog: heard, about that horse-cock, and how he
dialog: can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it
dialog: too, like when he whipped it out at
dialog: Tomlinson's party...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a
dialog: little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me,
dialog: that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes
dialog: to me. It's fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.
dialog: 
dialog: 5
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. Alright, come inside and let's do
dialog: this thing. I got work.

dialog: after them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POOL -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening
text: blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about
text: twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is
text: standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as
text: if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with
text: tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard
text: concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many
text: pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up,
text: down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to
dialog: him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic.
text: Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in
dialog: Athens that's just dirty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: At least I'm paid to be here.
dialog: 
text: Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his
text: morning swim. A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing.
text: Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone. In the
text: background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
text: Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.
dialog: 
text: EMILY, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: It's me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Emily?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: Some other girl would be calling you?
dialog: 
dialog: 6
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: How'd you get this number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: Don't you work there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: I need you to come pick me up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Are you kidding? Where are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
text: At home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: Just because. I need to stay with you for
dialog: a couple days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water.
dialog: Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd
dialog: be miserable like us. What for anyway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: It's no big deal. Just come pick me up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fine, forget it then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: Corey, come on! How many times have I
dialog: called you since you left? I wouldn't
dialog: ask, except I don't have anywhere to go.
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay
dialog: in our little dump, fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S VOICE
dialog: Fine. Thanks, then.

scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: JESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an
text: unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies
text: on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a
dialog: 
dialog: 7
text: devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food
text: containers flung in every direction.
dialog: 
text: An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica
text: stretches out her arm to silence it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still
text: half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic
text: rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: JINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living
text: room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her
text: old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway.
text: She opens the bathroom door and enters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA
dialog: Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie
dialog: right now?
dialog: 
text: Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a
text: bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if
dialog: her mother were not there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you get my message?
dialog: 
text: Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the
text: bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Jessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The
text: Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: (electronic voice)
dialog: You have one new message.
dialog: (Jina's voice)
dialog: Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say
dialog: happy birthday, since you'll be gone when
dialog: I get home. I'm driving your sister to
dialog: school and I'm leaving the car for her, so
dialog: I'll be taking the train back.
dialog: 
text: Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an
text: open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste
dialog: 
dialog: 8
text: to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to
text: pour forth from the Answering Machine.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way, you should call your sister
dialog: and stop this not-talking nonsense.
dialog: 
text: Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back
text: towards the Answering Machine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, I know how you hate long messages,
dialog: so I'll see you tomorrow...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: That's fucking bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA
dialog: Here we go again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: What about my car?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA
dialog: Jessica, your sister got into beauty
dialog: school, and she's going. Now I've got
dialog: about two hours sleep before I have to
dialog: drive her all the way the hell up there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Yeah, I heard that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA
dialog: Jess, you're still living here for free.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: On the couch!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA
dialog: Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs
dialog: it. Can't you be happy for your sister?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car,
dialog: and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a
dialog: favor and tell her how fucking happy I am
dialog: for her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JINA
dialog: If you're going to be like this, I'm just
dialog: going to bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 9
text: Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with
dialog: water.
dialog: 
text: Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads
text: "Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is
text: gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it
text: haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee
text: table and places them over her eyes.
dialog: 
text: She opens the door and exits the apartment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RON'S GYM -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small
text: bare-bones gym.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RON'S GYM, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a
text: short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the
text: pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with
text: one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other
text: hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG
text: propped prominently at the base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Jimmy. You fix the lat machine?
dialog: 
text: RON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym,
text: approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a
dialog: backdrop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright?
dialog: I gotta let you go. I can't afford two
dialog: employees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So you're keeping Melinda?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ron, that is totally fucked! I been here
dialog: way longer than her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah, but I'm running a business.
dialog: There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause
dialog: she works here.
dialog: 
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But she doesn't do anything! She just
text: sits at the front desk all day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I know that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine,
dialog: she'll look at you cross-eyed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I can't afford two employees, and she
dialog: attracts business. That's it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fucking great. Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Jimmy, don't take it personal. If you
dialog: were built like her I'd keep you.
dialog: 
text: Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker,
text: defeated. BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, a.k.a. Bobby the Bookie, an
text: enormous juicehead built like an old-school NFL linebacker, naked
text: except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is
text: leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance
dialog: at Jimmy. Jimmy would rather that Ron stay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: Bales.
dialog: 
text: Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out. With the
text: locker room empty, Bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. He's
text: tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. Jimmy would
text: prefer a beating - simple and final. Jimmy pulls his BACKPACK out
text: of his locker and begins clearing his STUFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So where you been?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What are you talkin' about? Nowhere. I
dialog: been working.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So you just don't return my phone calls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Look, they lost, I owe you some more, so
dialog: what? I'll pay you. I want to put it on
dialog: Indy tonight.
dialog: 
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I can't take any more of your bets. I
dialog: look like a spineless fucking fag.
dialog: 
text: Bobby shuts Jimmy's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is
text: now face to face with Bobby's enormous organ - a terrifying sight
text: for mortal men and reputable women. Jimmy is struck silent,
text: savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for
dialog: thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell am I supposed to do with you
dialog: Jimmy? People are talkin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know they're talkin'!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You don't know a fuckin' thing. Come by
dialog: my apartment tonight, we'll figure this
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I ain't like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ain't like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Nothin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You don't know what I know. You'll see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm working tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jimmy, I ain't about beggin'. I'm lookin'
dialog: like a fool all on account 'a you. You
dialog: owe me. You owe me. I'm gettin' sick of
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Bobby moves on to his own locker.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: WIDE across the width of the pool. COREY, wet, with GOGGLES on his
text: head, holding a WRENCH and SCREW DRIVER, and BYSTANDER #1, stand
text: over a young twenty-ish female VICTIM who lies passed out on the
text: cement. A young female LIFEGUARD is kneeling beside the Victim,
text: checking her pulse and breathing. The two SWIMMERS left in the pool
text: are climbing out. PETE, a no-nonsense grounds-keeper in his late
text: thirties, wearing cut-off shorts, a faded t-shirt and a tool belt,
text: approaches to have a word with Corey.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: She fainted.

dialog: 
text: The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the PAYPHONE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Alright, well, quit horsing around. The

text: all over the patio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: That's Jerry's unit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Jerry moved to Middletown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: He quit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He left a message. You gotta take care of
dialog: all his stuff now, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Aw, come on, Pete! I need off tomorrow!
dialog: I told you I got community service!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So you're gonna have to get everything
dialog: done today then. Get going.
dialog: 
text: Corey tears the Goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and
text: about-faces toward the pool-house. As Corey leaves, a RED-HEADED
text: IDIOT does a sloppy can-opener off the side of the pool.

speaker_heading: LIFEGUARD (O.S.)
dialog: Keith, I told you to clear the pool!

scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY PARK -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean.
text: The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young GIRLS
text: making their way across it. Prominent in the background sits an old
text: run-down yellow CAR that Jessica drove to the park.
dialog: 
dialog: 13
text: JESSICA is carrying KATIE, a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in
text: piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of
text: Jessica. Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Doesn't Carlos want his car back?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: He's letting me borrow it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Well then why were you late if you had his
dialog: car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I slept late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Were you drinking last night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: No. But thanks for asking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Were you doing drugs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Katie, I told you, drugs are for losers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: And you're not a loser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: And neither are you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: But it's okay to drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: When you're older it'll be okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: How old are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Old enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: But you're not twenty-one yet. The law
dialog: says you have to be twenty-one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Katie, can you not ask so many questions
dialog: today? I've got too much to think about.
dialog:

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Cause it's your birthday?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Happy Birthday!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run,
text: the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their

text: to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on tight or you'll get hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATIE

text: hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild-
text: mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back
text: sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance,

text: Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation,
text: recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary
text: vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to

scene_heading: EXT. POOL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
text: All three climb out of the ambulance. Harry rushes toward the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIFEGUARD
dialog: She's in here.

scene_heading: EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where
text: several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and

text: - she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Bystanders)
dialog: Can you give us some room, please?
dialog:

speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (looking up to Heather)

dialog: 
text: Harry looks the Victim over a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LIFEGUARD

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Did you see her eat anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIFEGUARD
dialog: Uh-uh.
dialog: 
text: Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate
text: carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with
text: Allison. They talk in hushed tones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I know her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah? How?

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: She started dating Steve right after we
dialog: broke up. I mean right after. I asked
dialog: him if there was another girl, and he
text: never answered. He couldn't answer,
dialog: because he was fucking that slut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: That doesn't mean they fucked.
dialog: 
text: Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be
dialog: stupid, stupid."
dialog: 
text: As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Alright, she ain't comin' around.
dialog: 
text: Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three
text: place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (instinctively)
dialog: Whoa, easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: I know what I'm doing.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is
text: again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to
text: music playing in her head. Heather's moderate driving speed is in
text: sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene.
text: At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather
dialog:

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: We'll get there.

text: houses not much more than a body length apart from each other.
text: Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a

text: tries unsuccessfully to open the door.
dialog: 
text: He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen
text: and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at
text: Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's
dialog: locked.
dialog: 
text: Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her
text: Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the
text: wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and
dialog: 
dialog: 18
text: looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house,
text: frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the
text: neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure
text: the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her
text: head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLOS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jess, I know you're coming back here. I

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: JESSICA

dialog: 
text: He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch.

scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic. Music is blaring from
text: the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in
text: the cockpit quite loud. Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped
text: around the steering wheel and the DELIVERY LIST, which is hanging

dialog: Matt?! Speak up, man, I can barely hear

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: MATT, in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut. He's wearing an
text: old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge
text: of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes
text: piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (semi-whispering)
dialog: I need some K, dude. I need it for

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Alright, alright! I got it, man, got

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, it's Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing
text: back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although
text: the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud,
text: as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What's the rush?!

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (finally confiding)
dialog: Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Really?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Easy, dude, easy. Setzer's words - it's

speaker_heading: JIMMY

scene_heading: EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out
text: of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door

text: A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the
text: passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jimmy?

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that
dialog: hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What're you, a fuckin' doctor? We need ta

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JESSICA

text: in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is
text: holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is
text: scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her

speaker_heading: AARON

dialog: 
text: WIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the

dialog: 
text: Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking

dialog: Hey, can I park here?

speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: (very friendly)

speaker_heading: HEATHER

scene_heading: EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old
text: dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard
text: surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just
text: about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his
text: early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a
text: beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average
text: build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are
text: unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly.
text: HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is
text: holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen
text: door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,
text: with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an
text: appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What's up.
dialog: 
text: Heather tries to open the screen door - it's stuck.

speaker_heading: ALLISON

speaker_heading: BERUBI

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERUBI
dialog: You got evicted?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk
dialog: for my dog, I come back, my keys don't

text: the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro
text: glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top,
text: before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto
text: the road. Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she

dialog: 
text: Finally, Carlos speaks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Did you know he was having a party?
dialog: 
text: Jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself. She
text: begins fixing her hair in the mirror.
dialog: 
text: She pulls her LIPSTICK out of her PURSE and begins to apply it as
text: Carlos watches. She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Let's go.

scene_heading: EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Wait here a second and let me talk to him.
dialog: 
dialog: 78
text: Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto

text: with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands
text: watching, not sure what to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doing?

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: No! Are you fucking listening to me?!

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron.

dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARTER

dialog: Aaron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: You're kidding. You barely even know who
dialog: he is!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, but I know Troy real good. He said

speaker_heading: CARTER

dialog: 
dialog: 82
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: What if he doesn't come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Troy said he was bringin' him. If he
dialog: doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm
dialog: not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna
text: chase Aaron across the goddam country.
dialog: 
text: Jessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what

speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)

text: average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat.
text: Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty
text: old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his
text: stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a
text: few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that
text: might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap
text: rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy

speaker_heading: LOUIE
