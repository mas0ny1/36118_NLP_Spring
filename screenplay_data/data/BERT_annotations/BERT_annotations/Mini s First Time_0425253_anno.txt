speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
dialog: 
text: The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something.
text: She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering
text: across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty
text: mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly
text: still that of a girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: - MINI (V.O.)
dialog: I know what you're thinking. Don't
dialog: bullshit me, because I do... You're
dialog: - thinking, oh dear lord in heaven,
dialog: please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge
dialog: - out my eyes with the straw in my
dialog: drink right now. I'll jam every
dialog: last kernel of popcorn into my
dialog: - mouth until I suffocate, just not
dialog: another fucking teenage coming-of-
dialog: age story.
dialog: 
text: We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that
text: awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall
text: and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a
text: "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, relax...no prom night
dialog: highjinks, no nerds becoming
dialog: popular and no Shakespeare set in
dialog: high school...I promise.
text: CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a
dialog: series of quick cuts:
dialog: 
text: A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant.
dialog: 
text: A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a
dialog: shark he and his buddies thought was dead.
text: A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm.
dialog: 
text: An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a
text: just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his
dialog: skull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)
dialog: Since it happened, everyone's
dialog: asked me how it all started.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We
text: now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed
text: Studio City hillside home.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.
dialog: 
text: TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling
text: around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)
dialog: I suppose the obvious answer is my
dialog: eighteenth birthday...
dialog: 
text: Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and
text: halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys
text: crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who
text: stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER-
text: AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)
dialog: See, I was blessed with a terrific
dialog: mom. Not only is she a lush, but
dialog: she also hates me.
dialog: 
text: Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her
text: that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The
text: blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing
dialog: for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)
dialog: A few days before the party, I
text: overhear her on the phone ordering
dialog: me a male stripper. Nothing says "I
dialog: love you" like ten inches of man
dialog: meat in your face.
dialog: 
text: Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)
dialog: And knowing dear old ma, she'll try
dialog: and nail him after the party...in
dialog: my bed.
dialog: 
text: Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes
text: dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini,
text: almost challenging her.
dialog: 
text: MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their
text: display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his
dialog: imagination.

text: birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look
text: confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey,
text: starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing
text: "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash
text: rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)
dialog: See, to understand me, you need to
dialog: understand that life, in my
dialog: opinion, is all about new
dialog: experiences. "Firsts" is what I
dialog: call them.
dialog: 
text: As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on
text: Diane's face grows stronger with every step.

speaker_heading: SURPRISE!

speaker_heading: MINI'S POV:

speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That was definitely a first, but

speaker_heading: MINI (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MINI

speaker_heading: GARSON

speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Well, it's just a little unusual
dialog: for a suicide victim to use two
dialog: methods. Her choices seemed, I
dialog: don't know how to put it...
dialog: improvisational.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: Well, maybe she wanted to drift off
dialog: before the fumes got her? She
dialog: clearly put some thought into that
dialog: outfit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Clearly...But dying from carbon
dialog: monoxide poisoning is actually
dialog: pretty painless, you just basically
dialog: pass out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: I doubt she would have had an
dialog: intimate knowledge of how car fumes
dialog: feel when you choke on them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: I suppose you're right...Also we
dialog: checked the phone records and there
text: was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It
dialog: was a hang up and when the 911
dialog: dispatcher called back a few
text: minutes later, there was no answer.

speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Any idea why she'd call 911?

text: Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report. He starts

speaker_heading: ARSON
dialog: There appears to be some question
dialog: as to the time of death. You said
dialog: you went to dinner and a movie-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Detective, not to be overly
dialog: sensitive, but do I need my lawyer
dialog: here? Because these sound like the
dialog: questions one asks when there's a
dialog: homicide investigation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just
dialog: finish this up, I've got real
dialog: homicides that need attention. How
dialog: about if I just ask you some
dialog: questions and the one's you don't
dialog: want to answer, we'll just skip?

speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Neither was her physician, he had

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Well, as you may have discovered by
dialog: now, my wife had substance abuse
dialog: problems, I'm sure there were many
dialog: drugs she took without a
dialog: prescription.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: I know, but it's an odd drug to be
dialog: taking. It's mostly given to adults
dialog: and children with Attention Deficit
dialog: Disorder to calm them. But in
dialog: people who don't need it, it has
dialog: the reverse effect, making them
text: incredibly hyper and agitated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Listen, Detective Garson, I must
dialog: admit I don't see the relevance of
dialog: these questions. Diane was an
dialog: extremely disturbed person. Haven't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Yes, but what I'm still unclear

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: And?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Well, if she was unconscious by

speaker_heading: VOLANT
dialog: Martin, don't say anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had

speaker_heading: VOLANT
dialog: Again, Detective, my client won't
dialog: be answering anything, so let's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON
dialog: I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if
dialog: he's trying to be a protective
dialog: father by covering up something
dialog: Mini did, I'd be careful. The

dialog: case as an opportunity to show the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARSON

dialog: Our cabana boy from Mexico?

speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: What a sweetie, I thought I might

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You...you...

speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: It was pretty clear Garson wasn't
dialog: gonna give up, and sooner or later

dialog: just seemed ridiculous that we'd

speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: They don't tap these lines, do

dialog: Guard!

speaker_heading: MINI

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Guard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Guard! She did it! She just

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINI

speaker_heading: MINI
dialog: While I may not have excelled in
