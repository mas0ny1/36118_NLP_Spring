dialog: July 25, 2016
scene_heading: EXT. NICHOLS WOMEN’S PRISON - DAY
text: Early spring, sparse moments of green against the sterile
text: grey of the correctional facility. Straining against the
text: bleakness, small flowers start to bloom.
text: The gate clanks open.
text: DEBBIE OCEAN, 40's, impossibly chic for having just done a
text: stint in the slammer -- suit pressed, hair shiny, struts out.
text: Her gait suggests an unpleasant if not untenable sojourn.
text: She greets the world as if it has been waiting for her,
text: allowing herself a moment of digestion -- her posture
text: relaxes, she exhales, she closes her eyes.
text: She hears before she sees the waiting engine of a classic
text: Mercedes, ‘55, baby Blue. LINUS (Matt Damon) drapes a single
text: hand on the steering wheel but it’s a forced nonchalance that
dialog: could never come close to its owner. Danny Ocean Lite.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Deb...
text: Debbie keeps walking. He cruises up next to her.
speaker_heading: LINUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’re you going?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (without looking back)
dialog: I have $35 Linus, I can go wherever
dialog: I want.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: I‘1l give you a ride.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (slows/turns)
dialog: He left you his car?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: No. Well -- he knew I loved it...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That’s not the same thing.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: (seriously/intoned)
dialog: He would have wanted me to drive
dialog: it.
text: She rolls her eyes. Hot day. Long way to walk. Deb slows.
text: So does Linus. He REVS the car in neutral.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don’t do that, ok.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Sure.
text: She crosses to the passenger’s side and climbs in.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING - TEN MINUTES LATER
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: When’s the funeral?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Tomorrow at noon.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Really nice place...
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Queens.
text: Linus changes lanes. Starts moving over toward the right...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: I-95.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: We thought -- it might be a good
dialog: idea to see your folks.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Who thought?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: You know...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Eleven of you?
speaker_heading: LINUS
text: Ten. Rusty’s in England.
text: Debbie reaches out and JERKS THE WHEEL crossing two lanes of
text: traffic. They head toward New York.
speaker_heading: LINUS (CONT'D)
dialog: That is -- dangerous!
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We're going to Manhattan.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: They're not gonna like that.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Anything else “they” want?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: As a matter of fact...
text: He doesn’t finish. Knows he spilled too much. Deb turns.
dialog: Nods.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Saul wants to tell you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Goddammit, Linus.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: He left you a note.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Danny did?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Let me see it.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Well that’s just it. In the
text: confusion with him “passing,” and
dialog: clearing out the “effects” cause
dialog: we're the ones who have to deal
dialog: with the “effects...”
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Where’s the note?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: We're not sure.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You lost it?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: It‘ll turn up.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You lost my dead brother’s note to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: I know what it said.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: LINUS (CONT'D)
dialog: It said he doesn’t want you to do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: The job.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You know about that?
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: Well not exactly. But the way he
dialog: was talking, it sounded pretty
dialog: clear...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: LINUS
dialog: He was worried about you Deb. He
dialog: doesn’t want you to go back to --
dialog: you know...
text: They have come to a stop on the George Washington Bridge and
text: all at once, Deb FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR. She steps out into
text: bumper to bumper traffic heading toward Manhattan, leaving
text: Linus stuck in the car.
speaker_heading: LINUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Deb. Wait. Please!

scene_heading: INT. BERGDORF’S - DAY
text: Debbie peruses, approaches the cosmetics counter. The
text: salesperson is consumed with a COSTUMER. Debbie subtly grabs
text: a few bottles of face cream and continues looking, developing
text: an air of impatience. Once the salesperson finishes --
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Excuse me -- I’d like to return
dialog: these.
speaker_heading: SALESPERSON
dialog: Of course. Do you have your
dialog: receipt?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (demonstrating)
dialog: No but they’re unopened, haven’t
dialog: been touched --
speaker_heading: SALESPERSON
dialog: I can’t accept a return without a
dialog: receipt --
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: They’re sealed, brand new --
speaker_heading: SALESPERSON
dialog: I understand but we have a strict
dialog: return policy and cannot accept --
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: This is ridiculous. I bought them
dialog: a week ago.
speaker_heading: SALESPERSON
dialog: Ma’am -- I need a receipt.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Fine. I'll keep them. Jesus. Can
dialog: I at least get a bag to carry it
dialog: all?

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATER
text: Debbie approaches with a Bergdorf’s bag full of products --
text: Bubble bath, face cream, lotion -- wearing an obviously
text: stolen pair of sunglasses.
scene_heading: INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY
text: A buzz around the reception desk. A clerk is checking out a

dialog: computer cases.
speaker_heading: HOTEL GUEST
dialog: We're checking out of room 2814.
dialog: Jeffery Crandall.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Around the corner at reception desk, Debbie lurks pretending
text: to read a brochure.
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK
dialog: Certainly, Mr. Crandall. We hope
dialog: you had a pleasant stay.
speaker_heading: HOTEL GUEST
dialog: Terrific.
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK
dialog: My name is Monica. If there’s
dialog: anything else I can do or arrange
dialog: transportation...
speaker_heading: HOTEL GUEST
dialog: I think we're all set.
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK

text: Debbie glances up as...
speaker_heading: THE COUPLE
text: Wheels their luggage toward the door.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK
text: The Crandall’s climb into an Uber headed toward JFK.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY
text: Debbie lounges back in a large overstuffed chair.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hi, this is Mrs. Crandall, we just
dialog: checked out of 2814. Can I speak
dialog: to Monica, please?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, hi Monica -- thanks so much.
dialog: Something has come up and we’re
dialog: going to need the room another
dialog: night.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Oh, bless you. We’re just going to

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - PLAZA —- CONTINUOUS
text: The MAID fixes pillows. She looks up as Debbie enters.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Hi. Sorry. Can you just finish
dialog: this later? I’ve just got to get
dialog: off my feet.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Of course. Sorry.
text: She gathers the rest of her things and hurries toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Wait.
text: She crosses to the maids cart and grabs a handful of
dialog: chocolates.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - HOTEL ROOM - PLAZA - LATER
text: Debbie luxuriates in a bath with all of New York out a huge

text: Closes her eyes...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRENDY CLUB. NIGHT
text: CATE late 30’s, dressed in all black at a landing, hovering
text: above her club. It’s packed with kids and sweat. She
text: glances over at the bar.
scene_heading: A FEMALE BARTENDER
text: Is pouring Grey Goose into a tumbler. She catches Cate’s eye
text: who shakes her head. The woman, chastised, replaces the Grey
text: Goose and grabs a bottle of well vodka...
scene_heading: MOVING WITH CATE
text: She scans the floor: hormones and sweat. In the far corner
text: Lebron James is towering above the throng, dancing. Cate
text: descends the stairs and crosses to one of her “Bottle Girls.”
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Did you get him yet?
speaker_heading: BOTTLE GIRL
dialog: No. I will.
text: Cate looks at her with judgement: "C’mon.” The girl grabs
text: her cell phone hurries across the floor.
text: CATE wanders toward the back of the club and spots a girl
text: smoking in the doorway to the alley. She crosses to her and
text: the girl immediately drops her cigarette, grinding it out on
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: On a break?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: How’s the line?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: It’s pretty good.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Is it down the block?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: (busted)
dialog: Not quite.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: You know I need a long line right?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: Sorry. I just got cold.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Here. Take this.
text: She removes her scarf, wraps it around the girl’s neck then
text: smiles. It’s a “get-the fuck-out-there smile,” but still a
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: Thanks.
text: ACROSS THE CLUB...
text: Lebron is seriously into the music when the Bottle Girl comes
text: up and tries to take a selfie. (The height differential is
text: problematic.) He squats lower and extends the camera...
dialog: CATE...
dialog: Watching it.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: (to her bouncer)
dialog: Make sure she pushes that out now.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Hashtag?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: How bout our address.
text: AND SHE IS MOVING AGAIN, this time toward the VIP area where
text: a YOUNG MAN is holding court with three women and a bottle of

speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They said I could.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LUIS
text: The guy at the door.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Instead of buying-off my doorman
dialog: why don’t you pay your bill from
dialog: last time?
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Ok.
text: She turns to leave and gets a text. Cate glances down while

scene_heading: INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE - MORNING

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BERGDORF’S
text: She enters the same revolving doors as she did yesterday,

speaker_heading: CURTAIN WIPE:

speaker_heading: AND SHE EXITS (TIME CUT)
text: Now dressed in a tasteful black suit with sensible shoes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A CEMETERY

scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. CEMETERY

scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL

speaker_heading: IN THE PULPIT
dialog: REUBEN (Elliott Gould) is eulogizing:
speaker_heading: REUBEN
dialog: Danny Ocean lived a rich full life.
dialog: By any measure, he was a success.
text: There is more rustling and a few eye rolls. Reuben
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: REUBEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Whether in business, not all of
dialog: which we can discuss today...
text: A few sighs of relief.
speaker_heading: REUBEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Or as a loving son, to Dennis and
dialog: Darlene.
text: Everyone turns to acknowledge DENNIS OCEAN, seated on the
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Stares straight ahead. Doesn’t glance at her father.
speaker_heading: REUBEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Or as a brother.
text: She looks up. Shakes her head: don’t you dare.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: REUBEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (stumbles)
dialog: Who -- had a sister. As --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - LATER...

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Sweetie. Oh my gosh.

dialog: You look great.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No I don’t.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Well -- you made it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Listen to me for a minute...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: It killed him, Debbie. This life --
dialog: it killed him.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He had a genetic valve disorder.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Well it didn’t help. And it’s no
dialog: good for you either. Please don’t
dialog: do this.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Whatever it is he wouldn’t tell us
dialog: you were gonna do.
text: Debbie smiles -- doesn’t respond. She leans over and kisses
text: Saul on the cheek.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY
text: Hot day. Birds. She takes off her jacket. Funny how a
dialog: graveyard can feel like the country. Basher (Don Cheadle)
text: comes up beside her.
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: ‘ello love.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You too?
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: No... Not me.
text: She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: BASHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hear it’s good though.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He told you?
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: Just said it was “somethin’.” An’
dialog: that it was pretty amazing.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He said that?
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: Mmm. He said it was insane and
dialog: you'd end up back in jail but it
dialog: was pretty brilliant.
text: Sinks in.
speaker_heading: BASHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You coming back to the house?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Nah.

speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: Sure.

dialog: One question.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: BASHER
dialog: (leans in/a wink)
dialog: Why’d you tell him, love?
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DEBBIE
text: The one question she can’t answer. It lingers with her. He

speaker_heading: CAR HORN
text: Two short beeps. Deb turns...
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: The smoked window of a black SUV lowers revealing --
speaker_heading: CATE
text: Blonde, stylish, hair perfectly messy. Her car radio fills
dialog: the graveyard.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Deb climbs in the passengers side as Cate turns down the
text: music. Cate grabs her friend’s face. Big kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Easy. I’ve been in the slammer.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Really? Hadn’t heard.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Thanks. That was stressful...
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: I’m sure.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Everybody trying to get me to go
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Kind of cheeky. They’re crooks
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No kidding.
text: Cate swings the car onto the expressway. Deb takes off her
text: shoes. Puts her bare feet on the dashboard and rubs them...
text: Deb puts her bare feet on the dashboard.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: You get the credit line?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Don’t know what it’s for.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Please don’t do that?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Do what?
text: Cate imitates her expression.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh. That’s my “just spent four-
dialog: years in jail and my partner lets
dialog: me down face.”
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: I’m not your partner yet.
dialog: (cell phone rings)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t care Jeffrey... No I don’t
dialog: want to talk to her...
dialog: (another beat)
dialog: ‘Cause it’s not her job anymore.
dialog: It was her job until she got fired,
dialog: now it’s not her job...
dialog: (listens)
dialog: She can write me five letters,
dialog: she’s not getting her job back.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because she stole from me Jeffrey
dialog: and people who steal are not
dialog: trustworthy.
text: On that, she happens to lock eyes Deb who starts to laugh.
text: Cate can’t help it smiles too. Hangs up.
speaker_heading: CATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean “normal” people who steal.
dialog: Not...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Like professionals?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Yeah. Them.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED THEATER - DAY
text: The lights switch on, illuminating a huge empty space.
text: gorgeous in its decay. Carved wood and peeling plaster.
text: gold leaf is sporadic.
text: She flips
dialog: Deb looks
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: This is great.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Try heating it.
text: on some more lights.
speaker_heading: CATE (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a room for you upstairs.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: New club?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Maybe one day.
text: around. More space than she’s seen in five years.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Did you call Kendall?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: She quit. Moved to Hawaii.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (surveying the room)
dialog: What about Paige?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: (stops)
dialog: It would honestly help if I knew
dialog: what all of this was for.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I know... I know... I’1l1 tell you
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Deb deposits her bag, crosses to Cate. Gives her a kiss on
dialog: the cheek.
dialog: She turns
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ll see ya later.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: You just got here.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I've been inside for five years.
dialog: I’m going for a walk.
text: and heads up the aisle of the theater...
scene_heading: EXT. ART GALLERY - CHELSEA - NIGHT
text: Debbie walks down a familiar cobblestone street. Though she
text: seems composed, a rage grows within her as she approaches --
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. KLAUS GUNTHER GALLERY - CHELSEA - CONTINUOUS
text: Debbie walks into mecca for the downtown art scene. KLAUS
text: GUNTHER makes Gagosian jealous. Sycophants, hipsters and a
text: lot of money. And in the center of it all stands Klaus
text: himself: undeniably handsome, just as oily, he wears a white
text: linen shirt unbuttoned to the jewlery. You should see
dialog: through this guy but you can’t. Debbie grabs a glass of
text: champagne from a waiter and crosses toward him.
speaker_heading: KLAUS
text: Is talking with a group of young women, when he spots Debbie
text: and shifts from charm to restrained terror. He makes quick
text: apologies and starts to leave...
speaker_heading: DEB
text: Blocks his path.
speaker_heading: KLAUS
dialog: (frozen)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Patron of the arts.
speaker_heading: KLAUS
dialog: I have a restraining order.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Good.
text: She steps really close to him -- an intimate moment --
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know what a shiv is?
text: He feels something sharp against his ribs. Gasps --
speaker_heading: KLAUS
dialog: Stop it --
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I made this one. Proud of it, too.
dialog: See -- it’s important not to melt
dialog: the toothbrush too much. That way
dialog: it keeps its length and the
dialog: strength. So when you stab, you
text: slice up and around.
text: Debbie drags the shiv up the front of his shirt, towards his
text: neck. To a bystander it might look like a flirtatious move
text: with a large toothpick.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Nice face. Inside you’re what we
dialog: like to call “a pretty girl” --
speaker_heading: KLAUS
dialog: I'll call the police --
text: Deb takes the shiv and slices up the front of his shirt,
text: shredding it. She pops the button on his collar, taking it
dialog: for a souvenir.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Auf Wiedersehen.
text: Debbie strides out, still purposeful, while Klaus looks on,
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE TAKE OUT
text: All fluorescence and backlit pictures of the dishes. Debbie
text: stands at the counter -- draws a long breath of General
text: Tso’s. They hand her a white plastic bag.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - LATE
text: It’s dark. A few safety lights are on. Deb enters the back
text: of the theater and crosses to a staircase on the side of the
text: stage carrying her take out.
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS LOFT SPACE
text: It used to be a rehearsal studio. Vast and open with various
text: bits of living area defined by loose furniture. It’s chic in
dialog: a very hard-to-define-kind-of-way.
speaker_heading: DEB
text: Crosses to the kitchen area, fishes through drawers for a
text: plate and decamps at the small kitchen table.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: She takes out the still-warm white containers and dumps them
text: on her plate. Can’t get to the chopsticks fast enough...
speaker_heading: CATE (0.S.)
dialog: Is that all for you?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (turning/mouthful )
dialog: Oh, hi. Want some.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: No.
dialog: 18.
text: Cate’s wearing a silk chinese robe. She crosses to the
text: table. Sits.
speaker_heading: CATE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s late.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Took a walk.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Where?
text: Deb doesn’t answer. They look at each other for a beat and
text: exchange five or six lines of unspoken conversation.
speaker_heading: CATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why would you do something like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I had to.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: No, you didn’t.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Closure?
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Bullshit. Did he see you?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Debbie takes the shiv out of her purse and shows it to Cate.
text: Toothbrush on one end, lethal blade on the other.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you “use it?”
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Just a button.
text: She puts Klaus’ button on the table. Cate laughs. They
text: share the moment. Then suddenly...
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Hey, Luis... You gotta go.
text: Cate doesn’t turn as the young man from the club enters with
text: pants but no shirt. Even more muscles. Even more ink.
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: I can wait.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: That’s ok. I’11 see you soon.
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: Seriously.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Seriously. Go.
text: Luis gets the hints and grabs his shirt, heading downstairs.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Does he have to go?
text: Cate laughs. Deb slides over the carton of orange chicken.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. EAST VILLAGE - THE NEXT MORNING
text: The place is waking up from the night before. MEN in ORANGE
text: SUITS hang off the back of trucks collecting trash.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP. DEB
text: She's wide awake. Cate’s “guest room” is a partitioned space
text: filled with boxes of bootlegged vodka. A certain larcenous

text: the met. Deb turns and heads off into the park...
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK — LATER
text: The team is already meeting when Debbie arrives. Cate
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Took the long way.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: How’s Saul?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Worried.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: We're fine.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: The girls are waiting. I got them
dialog: all ice cream.
dialog: 75.
text: Deb nods. Heads off down the path. Cate hesitates...
scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY - AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT
text: A rental car rolls through industrial detritus.
scene_heading: EXT. SHEET METAL FABRICATION
text: In the distance we see Cate talking to the owner
text: demonstrating what looks to be the outline of a box with her
text: hands. She mimes the dimensions. Roughly two by three...
scene_heading: TRUCK RENTAL AGENCY
text: Cate signs an agreement for a plain white panel truck.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING STORE - RUSTY’S BAIT AND TACKLE
text: She stands at the counter buying reels of monofilament
dialog: fishing line.
scene_heading: INT. APPLE STORE
text: Cate is in line buying six large iPhones.
scene_heading: EXT. THEATER - DUSK
text: Debbie wanders out into the fading light to see the Crown
text: Victoria parked down the block.
scene_heading: MOVING WITH HER
text: Deb crosses to the car and is just about to confront them
text: when she looks up to see...
text: Cate, rounding the corner from the other direction. They
text: pause at the car, smile at each other. Deb taps on the
text: window and they roll it down slowly.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: Hey guys. This is my friend Cate.
dialog: We’re gonna be in for most of the
dialog: night so if you want to run out and
dialog: grab a bite or something it’s fine.
text: Cate smiles. Nods.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: And if you need a bathroom just
dialog: knock on the door. There's a good
text: Lebanese place round the corner.
text: The girls turns and head toward the theater.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Where you been?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CATE
text: Odds and ends.
text: As they head inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAWN
text: Over Manhattan. Sunlight peeks over the park.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY - METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
text: The Silver Carpet cascades down the front stairs of the Met --
speaker_heading: GAME DAY --
text: The MET itself is in WARDROBE PREP --
text: WORKERS string up thousands of yards of lights --
text: FLOWERS trucked in -- roses, hydrangeas, peonies.
dialog: STAFF arrange tables and chairs --
text: The PRESS STAND is raised -- ASSISTANTS affix seat labels for
dialog: each news outlet in order of importance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CATE’S THEATER - EARLY AFTERNOON
text: A silent ritual. Everyone moves around preparing their piece
text: of the puzzle. A couple of them wear ear buds, in the zone.
scene_heading: EXT. TIFANNY’S HEADQUARTERS - MORNING
text: An armored car (BRINKS) waits with the engine running. TWO
text: GUARDS carry a large-strong box with the HARRINGTON necklace
dialog: in it.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - THE MARK HOTEL - EVENING
text: Daphne walks in dressed in heels and lingerie, hair in
text: curlers, drinking whiskey. She sits in a Director’s chair as
text: a team of make-up people go to town. A MANICURIST takes her
text: hand, another works on her feet --
scene_heading: INT. THEATER
text: Six women (Rose is missing), are dressed to the nines in
text: front of a wall mirror. Finishing touches are applied: hair
dialog: tweaks, mascara, re-applied lipstick...
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: EXT. MARK HOTEL - SAME
text: The BRINKS truck arrives in the front of the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - MARK HOTEL
text: Rose stands at the elevator doors looking up at the floor
text: indicator. As it descends toward her she grows more and more
text: nauseous, stifling a gag as the doors opens...
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - THE MARK HOTEL - MINUTES LATER
text: Daphne, now in a robe, is getting her hair sprayed, her eye-
text: shadow blended. She glances in the mirror in front of her to
text: see Rose and two men in suits behind her.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Is that it?
text: Rose nods and stands to the side. The two guards from
text: Tiffany’s move into the room, carrying a large velvet jewel
dialog: box. There is a weird ceremony to all of this: the place
text: goes quiet; the men march forward in an even cadence. Rose
text: crosses behind Daphne as the Harrington is revealed...
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: ON ROSE
text: She reaches forward and opens the top of Daphne’s robe,
text: revealing the nape of her neck. Rose puts the Harrington
text: around her neck and fastens the clasp: it sounds like
text: tumblers clicking.
speaker_heading: ROSE WEIL
dialog: Might be a little cold.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: And heavy.
text: The mirror glitters -- it’s almost celestial.
speaker_heading: ROSE WEIL
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: Ok. Let’s get this off and get you
dialog: dressed.
text: She reaches up and starts to fiddle with the clasp which
text: doesn’t seem to open.
speaker_heading: TITUS (TIFFANY GUARD)
dialog: Oh -- can’t get it off like that.
text: He steps forward pulling out a small pen like cylinder.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: TITUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Special clasp. Needs this magnet.
text: Titus crosses behind her and fits the device over the clasp.
text: He gives it a half turn and the necklace unlocks.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. ROSE
text: She is somewhere between ashen and light green. Rose takes
text: quick shallow gasps clutching the arm of the chair.
speaker_heading: ROSE WEIL
dialog: Oh that’s... Brill--iant.
dialog: (forced smile)
dialog: Let me see that again.
text: Titus, full of pride fastens the clasp, then shows the small
text: magnetic cylinder like a magician demonstrating a trick.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
text: Takes in all of this from the mirror. The necklace. Titus
text: behind her... and behind him Rose who steadies herself with
text: one hand, clutching her iPhone in the other.
scene_heading: DAPHNE’S POV. ROSE’S IPHONE (TIGHT)
text: She points it at the back of Daphne’s neck.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: The women have loaded most of a white panel truck and are
text: about to head out when Debbie gets a text.
scene_heading: CLOSER. DEBBIE
text: She turns the same color as Rose. Motions for Cate.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Not...
dialog: (tries to swallow)
dialog: ...Good.
scene_heading: THEIR POV. VERY SHAKY VIDEO
text: Of Titus’ hand turning the clasp.
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: (on the video)
dialog: “See it’s the magnet that does it.”
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT
text: Nine ball’s little sister Veronica (15 years old) is
text: capturing a Pokemon Go character on her fire escape. Her
text: phone rings, interrupting the capture.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Goddamn it.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I was about to catch a Rhyhorn,
dialog: Leslie. What do you want?
scene_heading: INT. LOFT
text: They huddle around a speaker phone.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Leslie?
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: I'll kill you.
dialog: (to her sister)
dialog: We're in a jam, sis. Need your
dialog: help.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY
text: Veronica has an array of magnets spread over the seat beside
text: her. She tries to look at the shaky video, speaking to Nine
text: Ball on the speaker phone.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I think I got it. Just a magnet
dialog: with double A battery. I'’11 give
dialog: her a positive and a negative pole
dialog: so she can flip around when she’s
dialog: using it.
scene_heading: INT. VAN
text: Cate drives. Everyone hangs on the conversation.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Awesome, V.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: Really? She fixed it?
text: Nine Ball shoots a look: “of course she fixed it.”
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: AMITA
dialog: (suddenly points)
dialog: Whoa!
text: THEIR POV. THE MET...
text: The bleachers are in place, the carpet out, spotlights
text: positioned, cameras everywhere -- it looks almost regal.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MARK HOTEL
text: The elevator doors open to reveal --
text: Daphne who looks STUNNING in a long-sleeve black velvet dress
text: that hugs every curve. A twelve foot train, and a plunging-
text: neckline frame the world's most valuable necklace.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE MET LOADING DOCK
text: The van screeches to a halt. Debbie bolts from the
text: passengers door. Veronica does the same looking for her
text: sister when she hears a loud whistle...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. CENTRAL PARK (BEHIND THE MET)
text: Veronica appears jogging through a children’s playground in
text: Stan Smiths and a vintage flower dress. She runs up to Deb
dialog: and her sister.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That shit is hectic over there.
text: Got chased by a cop.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: This is my sister, Veronica.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hey.
text: Veronica hands her the magnet.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Very tight. I owe you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Just get me a new ID.
text: And she jogs away.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What do your parents do?
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: EXT. RED CARPET - MET GALA
text: The bleachers are in place, the carpet out, spotlights pierce
dialog: the heavens.
scene_heading: CLOSER. PRESS LINE. FLASHBULBS
text: THOUSANDS of them, refracting off the silver carpet.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE --
text: The dress somehow looks more radiant on the silver carpet,
dialog: with the full-effect of the train --
speaker_heading: KLAUS
text: On her arm. Looks like just another accessory, albeit a
text: handsome one. The FLASHES go even crazier. He steps aside
dialog: to allow...
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: -- her moment in the limelight. She basks (nervously) as the
text: name “ROSE WEIL” ECHOES over the PA system --
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Is in deep BG, following Rose, following Daphne.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL (V.O.)
dialog: (into her earpiece)
dialog: You got the paste?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (replying)
dialog: Copy.
text: She is dwarfed by the Necklace’s security guards -- JUDAS and
dialog: Titus.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A HALAL CART
text: Steaming shawarma wafts through the air. The outside is
text: decorated with glossy laminated photos of their cuisine.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE HALAL CART
text: Nine Ball is set up with a full console of monitors, a work
text: station and headphones.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: EXT. FIFTH AVE - RED CARPET
text: With each arriving LIMO there is a bigger and more beautiful
speaker_heading: STAR --
dialog: Sarah Jessica Parker in Oscar de le Renta, Rihanna in
text: Alexander Wang, Taylor Swift in Prada, Kim Kardashian and
text: Kanye West in Balmain.
text: Haute Couture Mayhem -- as the cameras and crowds go wild.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON - DEBBIE
text: Exiting her limo, looking pretty damn amazing in her own
text: gown, but no one takes much notice of her. It’s a pretty
text: dress. No twelve foot train, but way better than an orange
dialog: jump suit.
scene_heading: INT. MET
text: It’s been transformed. The huge entrance hall is now the
text: grandest ballroom in the world. Debbie scans the famous
text: faces finally settling on...
speaker_heading: DAPHNE AND KLAUS
text: Now a glamorous couple. All Deb’s own doing and still it
dialog: stings.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART
text: Nine Ball eats a falafel at the same time. Cate hovers
text: behind her buttoning a chef's toque. She stares at the
dialog: monitors.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Places check --
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR - TAMMY
text: Doing final checks over the tables, speaks into her headset.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: Ready to sit --
speaker_heading: THE PARTY
text: At full steam in the Costume Exhibit --
text: The party-goers move down four mirrored hallways, passing
dialog: glass cases that show off --
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: DRESSES MADE OF JEWELS
dialog: Rubies, diamonds and emeralds from the House of Worth,
dialog: Chanel, Dior, Givenchy...
text: DAPHNE AND KLAUS...
text: Stroll through the exhibit.
scene_heading: MOVING WITH DEBBIE
text: She watches them.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE AND KLAUS
text: Utterly unfazed, they pause in front of:
text: A matte black infinity. The room looks like it extends for a
text: football field. The black sky is punctuated by FLOATING
text: JEWELS -- each their own supernova: Diamonds, sapphires,
text: rubies, emeralds, they gleam as if emitting their own light.
text: They float in space, suspended from the ceiling, each
text: describing an invisible human form. It’s like Yayoi Kusama’s
text: Infinity room but way cooler and A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. A
text: million dots of light into infinity -- a celestial wonder.
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART
text: Cate watches THE MONITOR, where Klaus Gunther leans over and
text: whispers something to Daphne who throws her head back in a
text: peel of laughter.
text: Cate doesn't react. She turns and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR (DINING ROOM)
text: On the stage at the front of the hall, a jazz quartet plays.
text: The room fills with slightly lubricated guests. Everyone
text: migrates toward their seats, appraises dresses they’ve yet to
dialog: see, people with whom they haven’t schmoozed --
scene_heading: TAMMY OBSERVES...
text: DAPHNE AND KLAUS: a suprisingly-great-first-date energy
text: between them. They move to their table --
dialog: ROSE...
text: Already sits, enjoying her second glass of wine. Daphne and
text: Klaus take their place next to her. (Top designers are
dialog: always seated next to the “designed.”)
text: CONSTANCE...
text: Does a pass by of the table -- glances down at the clasp.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: HER POV:
text: It’s sitting in the middle of Daphne’s neck like the wheel on
dialog: a safe.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Clutches the small “pen light” magnet, practicing -- working
text: it in her fingers. She drifts off into the party...
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTY...
text: Debbie hasn’t taken her eyes off of Daphne and Klaus. He
text: leans in and whispers to Daphne, half nibbling her ear.
dialog: Whatever.
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART
text: Nine Ball watches Klaus still nibbling Daphne’s ear on the
text: monitor. It’s gross even in low res video.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Okay, we're ready. Countdown -- in
dialog: 3, 2,1 --
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
text: Cate now dressed in her toque, turns to a waiter:
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Table 3: we need a vegan and a
dialog: plain broiled fish...
dialog: (as if a throw-away)
dialog: Where’s the soup for table one?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Over here.
text: She sees the bowls lined up --
scene_heading: INSERT. BOTTLE OF IPECAC
text: Cate pulls the small brown bottle from her pocket.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TIGHT ON A BOWL OF SOUP
text: We move with the steaming (now spiked) bisque through the
text: greatest party in the world. Gliding by peripherally on the
text: EDGES OF THE FRAME are glimpses of: Selena Gomez, Michael B
text: Jordan, Megyn Kelly, Laverne Cox, Neil Patrick Harris etc...
scene_heading: ANGLE. TABLE ONE
text: Where Klaus is, not surprisingly, holding court.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: KLAUS
dialog: .-.-But then again, I’ve always been
text: a keen admirer of the female form.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Huh?
text: The Soup lands in front of Daphne.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, thank God.
text: She grabs her spoon and instead of bringing cutlery to mouth
text: she reverses the process, nearly plunging into the steaming
text: bowl. Daphne is four spoons deep before she ever breathes.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT’D)
dialog: (re: her dress)
dialog: I haven't eaten in three days.
text: She wipes her soup moustache with the back of her hand and
text: plunges back in.
speaker_heading: WIDER. TABLE
text: No one else is eating. Klaus stares at Daphne’s mouthful of
dialog: soup bread --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: (yeah, dickhead, I’m
dialog: hungry)
dialog: What?
text: Judas and Titus stand on the outskirts of the Temple.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: (into headset)
text: She's in deep. Maybe half a bowl.
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART - SAME
text: Nine Ball watches the scene on her monitors --
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Alright everybody. Here it comes.
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN’S BATHROOM
text: All done up with fancy table stands offering beauty products
text: and mints and floral arrangements.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Blows into the room.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: We're up.
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR - DAPHNE’S TABLE
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: So I have three brothers right --
dialog: totally vicious growing up. They
dialog: would plan it out -- like pinto
dialog: beans the night before, then in the
dialog: morning two of them would hold me
dialog: down while -- whoa.
text: Daphne holds her stomach. The digestion is audible --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT’D)
dialog: ...Cause you know -- brothers can
dialog: be...
dialog: (audible stomach rumble)
speaker_heading: God DAMN.
text: All at once Daphne bolts from the table flailing in search of
text: a bathroom. Judas and Titus follow suit.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
text: Into her headset...
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Game on.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Makes for the bathroom as well.
scene_heading: EXT. LADIES ROOM
text: Daphne elbows a MATRON out of the way just as --
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Converges on the bathroom door. She wedges herself between
text: Daphne and Titus, who follows a step behind her.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE.
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He starts to push past her.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I beg your pardon. That’s the
dialog: ladies room.
text: She plants herself between Titus and the door...
scene_heading: NINE BALL. AT HER CONTROL PANEL
text: Looking down at her monitor. No Deb.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: That’s good... You’re right in the
dialog: blind spot.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Daphne barrels into the door, hand over mouth --
text: She flings open the door to reveal Constance about to sit on
dialog: the toilet -- all according to plan.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Oh, my --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
speaker_heading: MOVE!
text: As Daphne removes her hand, a torrent of vomit flows into the
text: toilet -- the noise is loud and painful, as if her stomach is
dialog: being excavated.
text: After several wretches, Constance soothes her, strokes
text: Daphne’s hair. The side of her cheek. The back of her
dialog: neck...
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: There, there --
text: Another wretch.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
dialog: You poor thing.
scene_heading: TIGHT. CONSTANCE’S HAND. SLOW MOTION
text: She pops the magnet out of her glove and fits it deftly over
text: the clasp. A half twist and it doesn’t move.
scene_heading: UP ANGLE. DAPHNE. FROM THE BOWL
text: She lifts into frame bilious, gasps, then disappear all over
text: again, hurling.
scene_heading: RESUME. EXTREME CLOSE UP. CONSTANCE’S HAND
text: She flips it around from the positive to the negative pole
text: and fits it over the clasp. A half turn and the SOUND OF
speaker_heading: TUMBLERS .
speaker_heading: TIGHTER
text: The Harrington comes loose falling out of frame...
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: MID-AIR. SLOW MOTION
text: As a necklace falls, Constance deftly catches it...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DIFFERENT STALL
text: Constance bolts inside, starts wiggling out of her gown...
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
text: Still looking at her bank of monitors.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Ten seconds.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
text: Grabs a bus boy who is carrying a tray of dirty dishes.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: Don’t dawdle. Get that stuff into
dialog: the kitchen.
text: And she guides him along the wall right past...
speaker_heading: THE BATHROOM
text: Where Constance exits, now wearing a server’s uniform, her
text: hair pulled back. She moves past Debbie, crosses paths with
text: the busboy and deftly slips the Harrington Necklace into his
text: pile of dirty dishes.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Takes it all in...
scene_heading: NINE BALL AND MONITORS
text: Nothing on the cameras. Then, the bus boy appears (emerging
text: from the blind spot) carrying a tray of dirty dishes. None
dialog: of the women are anywhere to be found.
text: TRACKING SHOT. WITH BUS BOY...
text: He glides down the hall on his way to the kitchen where...
speaker_heading: CATE
text: Waits for him.
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART
text: Nine ball is charting is progress on the overhead monitors.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Almost there...
text: MOVING WITH THE BUSBOY
text: As he heads toward the kitchen, then suddenly sees a friend
dialog: and_stops.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Another busboy having deposited dirty dishes, pauses to
text: gossip in the hallway.
speaker_heading: SECOND BUSBOY
dialog: Dude. Gigi Hadid? Did you see
dialog: that dress?
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: Did you see Emily Rata-whatever.
dialog: That’s insane.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Cate waits near the entrance to the loading dock looking
text: toward the door. She leans into her headset.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Where is he? What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
text: Hears the chatter on her headset.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What’s going on?
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART
text: Nine Ball leans into the monitor.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
text: They're stalled in the hallway.
dialog: Chatting.
text: TAMMY...
text: Hears it and takes off toward the kitchen. She catches up to
text: the busboy carrying a tray of dirty dishes and a hundred
dialog: million dollar necklace.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: What the hell are you doing!
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: You're not getting paid to talk.
dialog: Get in there.
scene_heading: FOLLOWING THE BUS BOY
text: As he heads up the hallway into...
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: Steam. Shouting. Rattling plates. But where Cate was
dialog: standing, now, there is...
speaker_heading: NO ONE
text: Cate is gone. The busboy enters looking for a dish washing
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL (V.O.)
dialog: (over the headset)
dialog: Anybody got eyes on Cate?
speaker_heading: AMITA (0.S.)
dialog: Here! I’11 take those.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Amita is scouring the cutlery dressed as a dishwasher. The
text: bus boy dumps his tray into her sink and heads back toward
dialog: the party.
scene_heading: CLOSER. AMITA
text: She reaches into the soapy water and fishes around through
text: the slime. All at once she stops; knows that feeling. Amita
text: fishes 150 million dollars out of the goop.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: It’s covered with gunk but still glistens. Amita grabs the
text: overhead nozzle and rinses off the Harrington necklace until
text: it gleams.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: She sticks it into her pocket and calls out to the rest of
dialog: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: AMITA
dialog: Bathroom break!
scene_heading: MOVING WITH HER
text: Amita crosses to the bathroom and locks the door behind her.
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM (SINGLE STALL)
text: Single toilet. Sink. Tampon dispenser. Changing table.
text: Amita draws a long breath and takes out the Harrington. Wow.
text: Then she opens the tampon dispenser, displaying a full array
text: of jewlers tools, neatly organized and fastened.
speaker_heading: AMITA
dialog: Dope.
text: She grabs the loupe and slips it on her head, then turns and
text: opens the changing table: a work bench.
scene_heading: INT. HALAL CART
text: Nine ball is scanning the various images.
speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: (into headset)
dialog: Where’s Cate. Anybody? Need eyes
dialog: on Cate.
scene_heading: AT THE PARTY:
scene_heading: ENTRANCE TO THE LADIES ROOM
text: Debbie is still loitering outside the door. Feels like
text: forever. She glances at Titus then back at her watch...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (to Nine Ball/in headset)
dialog: Forget her. Stay focused.
speaker_heading: TAMMY (0.S.)
dialog: You’re avoiding me.
text: Debbie turns to see...
text: TAMMY standing next to her.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: (presses close)
dialog: Seriously. We were going to talk
dialog: when I started, and then there was
dialog: so much to get ready for, and then
dialog: when I wanted to have a bigger
dialog: conversation you said everyone was
dialog: around and we needed time if we
dialog: wanted to have a “real” talk. So TI
dialog: thought great she wants to have a
dialog: “real” talk, but...
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Can we just do this later?
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: That’s all you ever say.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Like a hundred million dollars
dialog: later?
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: There’s never a good time.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Honestly Tam, there are better
dialog: times than this.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: Ok.
text: And she walks away shaken but proud of herself for having
dialog: such an important, if difficult, conversation.
scene_heading: ANGLE. BATHROOM DOOR
text: Daphne comes out, pale green -- very pale. Wipes her
dialog: mouth...
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: That was gnarly.
speaker_heading: TITUS
text: Looks relieved -- then not...
scene_heading: HIS POV. CLOSE UP. DAPHNE KLUGER’S DECOLLETAGE
text: The Harrington Necklace is missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: (feeling their stares)
dialog: What?
text: One of them (gently) grabs her. The other pushes past her
dialog: into the bathroom --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM
text: She has removed the first diamond from the Harrington and
text: holds it up to her loupe. Slight gasp.
dialog: 93.
text: EDGE OF THE DINING ROOM...
text: Debbie watches the panic build. Daphne is surrounded by a
text: security team who escort her back to the table.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: I’m not sure. It could have fallen

scene_heading: INT. EXHIBIT

speaker_heading: GALA ORGANIZER

dialog: Um -- we apologize for this

dialog: misplaced a rather expensive item
dialog: and they tell us we’re going to

scene_heading: ANGLE. TABLE ONE

scene_heading: INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM

speaker_heading: TITUS

speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: I was barfing.
speaker_heading: TITUS

speaker_heading: TAMMY

text: Pulls the necklace from a crease in the table cloth holding

speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Thank fucking God.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: It was under the tablecloth -- ina

dialog: where they fold...

speaker_heading: TITUS

speaker_heading: ANNA WINTOUR
dialog: Thank you, Ms. Kluger, for the

dialog: (a beat, to the crowd)
dialog: Let's finish the party, shall we.
text: Everyone files back in -- calm, bonded by the trauma, joyful,
dialog: a little less formal and more fun --
scene_heading: LONG LENS. CONSTANCE
text: As she moves through the party...
dialog: Past Tammy...
text: Past Rose pounding down a last glass of champagne...
text: Past Nine Ball who is now a radiant partygoer....
text: Finally face to face with DEBBIE...
speaker_heading: CLOSER

text: offset by diamonds and emeralds that dangle from her ears --
dialog:

text: massive ring and matching necklace.
dialog: 
text: Tammy descends. Forest green a-line dress -- a strand of

dialog: 
text: Rose swaggers out, a little loose and loving it -- a_new

text: Debbie floats down the steps -- wearing her new necklace -- a

text: down her backless dress.
dialog: 
dialog: No Cate.
text: Debbie checks her watch. Glances around. Is just about to
text: check it again when she looks up...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE'S POV: CATE

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Just one --
text: She takes a seat a couple stools down from Amita. Nine Ball

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TIFFANY'S HEADQUARTERS - LATER
text: An old-school yellow cab screeches up.

scene_heading: INT. TIFFANY’S CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: The Tiffany’s Associate sits at the table, shaking, giving
dialog: into the fact that even in his worst nightmares he could not
text: conjure up the circumstance which he is now experiencing.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: So you're certain the necklace in
dialog: your possession is a paste?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
dialog: (shudders)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: And when did you last see what you
dialog: believe to be the authentic item?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
text: Last night, in Ms. Kluger’s suite.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Now Larry -- may I call you Larry?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
dialog: Lawrence --
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: My experience is, sooner or later
dialog: people want to be rewarded for
dialog: their patience.
text: (takes out a toothpick,
dialog: picks with vigilance)
dialog: A necklace that’s been sitting ina
dialog: vault for 30 years isn’t doing
dialog: anyone any good. Nobody’s seen it,
dialog: no one even knows what it is. But
dialog: you place that necklace on a very
dialog: well-known young lady, on an
dialog: evening where said placement gets
dialog: lots of play and attention and all
dialog: of sudden everyone and their mother
dialog: knows about that necklace. That
dialog: necklace becomes very famous, very
dialog: quickly -- right?
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: And then if that necklace goes
dialog: missing?
text: John grabs every daily paper from his bag, throws them on the
text: table -- all the headlines are about the NECKLACE.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D)
dialog: Well what else would people talk
dialog: about? That’s a tale of scandal
dialog: and intrigue that gets people
text: talking and buying.
dialog: (almost whispers)
dialog: And what they don’t know is it is
dialog: insured for $270 million -- so now
dialog: you're up a quarter billion
dialog: dollars, your name’s in everyone's
dialog: mouth, and you’re missing a little
dialog: necklace that no one had ever seen
dialog: anyway. You get the publicity and
dialog: the money.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
dialog: Are you accusing us --
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Merely floating a theory --
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: That's my job. See if it were me,
dialog: I'd do it early in the night. Get
dialog: it off our hands quick.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
dialog: What are you suggesting?
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Speculating. That it wasn’t the
dialog: real necklace to begin with. That
dialog: someone swapped it out before it
dialog: even went on Ms. Kluger’s neck --
speaker_heading: TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE
dialog: I guarantee the necklace on Ms.
text: Kluger’s neck when she left that
dialog: hotel was the real one --
text: John Frazier shrugs.
speaker_heading: PRELAP:
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: So tell me again how you remember
dialog: it.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TIFFANY’S CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: John stands in front of four massive cloth covered boards --
dialog: he has transformed the Conference Room into Ground Zero for
dialog: his investigation.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: They put the necklace on me, I did
dialog: my silly walk, we saw the exhibit,
dialog: I ate my soup, hurled my guts out --
dialog: The necklace was gone, everyone
dialog: freaked out and then they found the
dialog: necklace again.
text: Frazier takes the clothes off the boards behind him -- they
text: reveal Daphne’s entire night reconstructed with images from
text: Getty, Buzzfeed, Instagram, Paparazzi and Security footage.
text: In most of the images, Klaus is standing right next to her.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Thank you, Ms. Kluger.
dialog: Fortunately, I’ve been able to
dialog: trace every step of your night as
dialog: relying on your memory would be --
dialog: well -- less dependable considering
dialog: your level of refreshment.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER (CONT'D)
dialog: So as you can see in all of these
text: photos, there is a young man
dialog: standing next to you -- Mr. Klaus
dialog: Von Gunther?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: He was my date --
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: Is that his real name?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: German?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Austrian.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Six o’ one. Was there ever a time
dialog: when you two were alone while you
dialog: were wearing the necklace?
text: Daphne locks eyes with him --
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAPHNE AND KLAUS (FLASHBACK)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIFANY’S - RESUME
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: No.
text: John looks over the images of Klaus and Daphne -- he is
text: touching her neck a lot, as if coveting the necklace. John
text: sits on the edge of the table --
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Do you suspect he would have any
dialog: motivations to take the necklace?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: I try not to guess about people’s
dialog: motivations. They tend to show
dialog: you.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: That's a sufficiently vague answer.
dialog: (beat -- looks at the
dialog: board)
dialog: You know, I have every minute
dialog: accounted for except five --
text: He looks down at a sheet of paper on the table --
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D)
dialog: Well, four minutes, 48 seconds to
dialog: be exact.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: I was probably rubbing one out.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: They said you were charming.
dialog: (beat)
text: Funnily enough, the unaccounted for
dialog: minutes do line up with when you
dialog: were disposed by your sickness.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: When I was throwing up?
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Was there anyone in the bathroom
dialog: with you at the time?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
text: My head was at the bottom of a
text: toilet bowl.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: How bout after --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Lots of people.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: I mean in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Don’t you have cameras in there?
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER
dialog: Sadly no. Legal thing. Whoever
dialog: took this necklace is pretty smart
dialog: and probably a woman. Or someone
dialog: dressed as such. Or maybe this
dialog: German fellow but that’s a bit of a
dialog: reach.
text: He lays out photos of Daphne with Rose, Tammy, and Debbie in
text: the background -- they are zoomed in or from the edges of
text: photos of her -- the cobbling together took a long time.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know any of these women?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: That’s Rose Weil, she designed my
dialog: gown, which you obviously know,
dialog: that chick was some type of event
dialog: planner, I think, and her -- I’ve
dialog: never seen before in my life.
scene_heading: INT. CATE’S THEATER - DAY

speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER

text: She enters from stage right and wanders over to a large
dialog: investigation board --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Wow. It’s like everyone watched
dialog: Homeland and got ideas --

speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT’D)
dialog: (re: the board)
dialog: Can I keep this?
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: You're trespassing.
speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: We asked her to come.
text: Daphne grabs an apple from the table and plops (crash-lands)
text: on the couch. All eyes turn to Debbie and Cate.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: I realized about a week ago that
dialog: Ms. Kluger...
speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: Wasn’t a total fucking idiot.

scene_heading: RESUME. WAREHOUSE
text: The rest of the women pay rapt attention.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DAPHNE KLUGER
dialog: (mouthful)
dialog: I even threw up for real.
speaker_heading: TAMMY

speaker_heading: CATE
dialog: Recently.
speaker_heading: DAPHANE KLUGER
dialog: (preens )
dialog: One take, baby.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And it seemed to us -- that eight

dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: WIDER

speaker_heading: ROSE WEIL
dialog: Insurance fraud?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: AMITA

speaker_heading: ROSE WEIL

speaker_heading: ROSE WEIL
dialog: Alright... Lest we forget.
dialog: This... This entire...

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Nobody's going to jail. We

speaker_heading: NINE BALL
dialog: Looks like it.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
