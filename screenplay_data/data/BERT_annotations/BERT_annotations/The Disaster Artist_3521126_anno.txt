scene_heading: INT JEAN SHELTON’S ACTING STUDIO
text: TWO ACTORS are performing a scene on a small stage. One
text: of them is GREG SESTERO (19, blonde, California surfer
dialog: dude handsome).
dialog: SUPE. San Francisco, July 1998
scene_heading: MALE ACTING STUDENT
dialog: “Unless Godot comes.”
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “And if he comes?”
scene_heading: MALE ACTING STUDENT
dialog: “We'll be saved.”
text: Greg slowly takes off his hat. Looks at it. He’s “ACTING”
text: but not very confidently.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “Well. Shall we go?”
dialog: Greg's performance is painfully flat. You've never seen a
text: more self-conscious actor.
scene_heading: MALE ACTING STUDENT
dialog: “Pull on your trousers.”
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “What?”
scene_heading: MALE ACTING STUDENT
dialog: “Pull on your trousers.”
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “You want me to pull off my trousers?”
dialog: A VOICE from the beyond calls:
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON (0.S.)
dialog: STOP! Stop! Jesus. That was...
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 3
text: The voice belongs to legendary acting teacher JEAN
text: SHELTON (60s, small in stature, huge in every other way)
text: in the front row of the acting school.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
text: Painfully unremarkable.
text: We see Greg visibly deflate. This hurts.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: Rob, your breath control is all over the
dialog: place. And Greg...
text: Greg waits for it.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
text: So scared and insecure. Like a wounded
dialog: puppy-
text: Greg sighs. Knows she’s right.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTER
dialog: Do you even want to be an actor?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: More than anything.
text: Jean just sighs, shakes her head. Greg and his Scene
text: Partner take their seats, Jean turns to the rest of the
dialog: class...
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: Who else? Who can show me they WANT this?
dialog: Anyone?
text: No takers. The room too afraid of her wrath at the
dialog: moment. And then:
scene_heading: VOICE FROM THE BACK
dialog: I go.
text: The whole room turns to the VOICE.
text: It belongs to a long-haired, muscle-toned, serious
text: looking MAN with a slight hunch and a creased face. He
text: wears black pants, a gaudy belt, dark sunglasses - equal
text: parts “Jack Sparrow” and “1980s Van Damme villain.”
text: For the first time, Greg is laying eyes on the man who
dialog: will change his life forever. This is TOMMY WISEAU.
text: Everyone watches as Tommy saunters slowly up to the
dialog: stage.
text: Focused, intense, he turns a chair around and straddles
text: it, getting into character.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: And what is it you have for us Thomas?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 4
text: He looks up from the chair, pushing his dyed black locks
text: from his face.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: It is Tommy. Not Thomas.
dialog: (beat, serious)
dialog: Never Thomas.
text: Shelton rolls her eyes. Whatever. She sits.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: When you’re ready...
text: Greg, too, sits back, intrigued, as if knowing he’s about
text: to witness something unforgettable.
text: The man called Tommy looks up at the ceiling, channeling,
text: well, something. After a few beats, he begins.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Stella... Stella...?
text: Tommy's accent is every bit as unusual as his fashion
dialog: sense. French, German, Eastern European - impossible to
text: tell. Tommy says “Stella” a few more times. Then he
text: stands. Starts wandering the stage like a lost kitten.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (louder )
speaker_heading: STELLA!
text: Maybe Tommy hasn’t read the rest of the play. Or maybe he
dialog: doesn’t speak English. Anything is possible right now.
text: Greg sees some of his fellow students looking at one
text: another, trying to make sense of what they’re seeing.
text: Tommy doesn’t seem to notice or care.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
scene_heading: STELLLLLAAAA!!IILLLiit
text: Tommy shouts it at the crowd. Then he shouts it at the
text: floor. That he shouts it at the chair. He kicks the
text: chair, causing even Jean (who’s seen everything) to jump
text: in her seat. Everyone is aghast.
text: And finally, at long last, he collapses, covering his
text: face with his hands. He starts to rock back and forth, as
text: if experiencing an epileptic fit.
text: Greg is amazed. The balls on this guy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (one last shriek)
dialog: STELLA! !!!
dialog: (and then, quietly)
dialog: Don’t ever leave me baby.
text: He lays on the ground another long beat. Then it’s over.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 5
text: Tommy stands, runs his fingers through his hair, waits
text: for Jean Shelton’s response. (Everyone is waiting for
dialog: Jean Shelton’s response. )
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: Where to begin...
text: Someone in the crowd laughs, nervously. Jean puts her
dialog: hand up to silence that person.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: I‘ll ask you this, Tommy. What was it you
dialog: were trying to accomplish with that?
text: Tommy doesn’t understand the question.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I was performing the Tennessee Williams.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: Yes but... what is your objective? What
dialog: does Stanley want?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: He is... hysterical.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: No, see, that is not an objective.
dialog: Objective means pursuit. You’re pursuing
dialog: someone, trying to reach them. You’re not
dialog: screaming because you’re sick or in pain -
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Forgive me, but you’re wrong.
text: And that takes the whole room by surprise. Jean’s eyes go
text: wide. No one has ever spoken to her in this way. She
text: can’t believe it. In fact, no one can believe it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: See, I know this Stanley.
dialog: (resets the chair)
dialog: I show you again --
text: Jean raises her hand.
speaker_heading: JEAN SHELTON
dialog: I’ve seen enough, thank you.
text: Tommy shrugs, walks back to his seat. To Jean, as he
dialog: passes:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You don’t know the Stanley.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 6
text: Jean doesn't know what to make of this person. Tommy
text: keeps walking, passing Greg as he does. Greg looks up at
dialog: him - awed. How can anyone have that confidence? And we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT JEAN SHELTON’S ACTING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tommy beating a hasty retreat. Greg races up to him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Tommy keeps walking.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey man.
text: It’s only this second attempt that Tommy realizes someone
text: is talking to him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: My name’s Greg. Greg Sestero.
text: Tommy looks Greg up and down. Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Would you want to do a scene together?
text: And on Tommy’s face, CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT GREG’S SAN FRANCISCO HOME - DAY
text: Greg is having a FOOTBALL CATCH with a NEIGHBOR KID when
text: a white Mercedes, its windows tinted, pulls up. The
text: windows come down. Sure enough:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Get in.
text: Tommy is dressed in an elegant white shirt and tight
text: black skinny jeans.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh. I thought we were --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I have to eat now. I get cranky little
dialog: bit when I don’t eat.
text: Greg hesitates. This is already super weird. Tommy
dialog: misreads.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don’t worry, I pay.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 7
text: Greg thinks about it. Shrugs. Why not? Hops in the front.
text: He looks at the car’s interior. Brand new, all the
dialog: amenities. He wasn’t expecting this.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Nice car.
text: Tommy turns to him, intense.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don't talk about me.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What I drive. Where I go. You understand,
dialog: yes?
text: Greg does not. At all. But he doesn’t say so. He sees a
text: toy ROBOT CRAB wiggling on the dashboard.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: And don’t look at robot crab. He’s shy.
text: And with that, the car pulls out and off they go. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER
text: Packed at lunchtime. Tommy and Greg in a booth. Tommy
text: still has his sunglasses on. He flags a PERSON walking by
dialog: (who definitely isn't a waiter).
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I need to order.
speaker_heading: CONFUSED PERSON
dialog: I don't work here.
text: Guy walks on. Soon enough the WAITER appears. Before he
dialog: can even speak:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Pesto pasta, minestrone soup, and a cup
dialog: of hot water.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Sorry, did you say “hot water?”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why you give me hard time? Hot water,
dialog: yes. And more bread with raisin stuff.
text: The Waiter looks at Greg, wondering if he’s equally as
dialog: odd.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Just... coffee for me, thanks.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 8
text: The Waiter leaves.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why you ask me here?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Scene partners. You making joke?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No. I...
text: Greg tries to think of the right thing to say.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Look, the thing is... when I get up
dialog: there, in front of people, all I can
dialog: think about is, “what if they laugh at
dialog: me, what if I embarrass myself.” I’m not
dialog: in the moment. But you... I mean, shit
dialog: man, you're amazing!
text: Tommy sits back, listening.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I figured I could learn a thing or two,
dialog: that’s all.
text: Tommy considers this. For a moment, we’re not sure if he
text: buys it. Then he takes out 2 copies of “The Lightning Rod
text: Man” by Melville.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Let’s do scene.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You mean here?
text: Greg is obviously intimidated by the crowd. Not Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So what? Yes.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: There's like... people trying to eat --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Are you not dedicated actor? To be
dialog: dedicated, you have to rehearse.
text: Greg looks around at all the crowded DINERS.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I will play “The Lightning Rod Man.” You
dialog: play... this other man. With a Z.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Zechariah. Ok.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 9
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Ok.
dialog: (beat, reads)
dialog: “Good day, sir.”
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (quiet, embarrassed)
dialog: “Good day.”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Louder.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Louder. Really project yourself. “GOOD
dialog: DAY, SIR!”
text: This draws the attention of some PATRONS. Greg turns to
text: them, self-conscious.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Forget them. There is only you and there
dialog: is only me. “I said, GOOD DAY SIR!”
text: Greg is a little hesitant but he takes a deep breath. And
dialog: he goes for it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (reads )
dialog: “Have I, sir, the honor of a visit from
dialog: that illustrious god, Jupiter Tonans?”
text: Greg looks up. What the fuck is this play?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That’s good, keep going...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (getting more into it)
dialog: “So stood he in the Greek statue of old,
text: grasping the lightning-bolt.”
text: Tommy nods, encouraging.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “If you be he, or his viceroy, I have to
dialog: thank YOU - for this noble storm...”
dialog: Hey, it’s actually working for Greg. And we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER
dialog: Greg and Tommy emerge. Greg feels great!
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 10
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It's like Brando says. “You have to feel
dialog: every performance right in your bones.
dialog: That’s how you know it’s right.”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Bridgitte Brando?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No. Marlon Brando.
dialog: (Tommy has no idea)
dialog: The Godfather? On the Waterfront?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: He did that “Stella” speech in the
dialog: “Streetcar” movie.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Ah yes. I like this guy.
text: Greg looks at Tommy askew. Then he smiles.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh man, I’m gonna show you some things
dialog: that will blow your mind!
text: Tommy nods. A nice beat. Greg assumes the day is done.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So I'll see you in class?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You brought football, no? Let's play.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: In that?
text: Tommy smiles wide and runs into the park. Greg shakes his
text: head. Nothing to do but follow. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT POLO FIELDS AT GOLDEN GATE PARK - LATER
text: Greg throws Tommy the ball. He bobbles and drops it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: My God, sun shine like hell today. This
dialog: park is no place for vampire.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (weirded out)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: You ever been to Los Angeles?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 11
text: Tommy picks up the ball and throws it back to Greg - a
text: wobbly sideways pass that never comes close to reaching
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Once. When I was little. Universal
dialog: Studios. Graumin’s Chinese. Sunset
dialog: Boulevard.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Best two days of my life.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: In Los Angeles, everyone want to be star.
dialog: All these pretty boys waiting for their
dialog: chance...
text: Greg throws the ball back. Again Tommy drops it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Just have to get lucky, I guess.
text: And that angers Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No!
text: He gets in his face. Greg has no idea what’s happening.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You have to be the best.
text: Greg nods, ok. And then Tommy drop kicks the football,
text: sending it flying over Greg’s head.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Touchdown!
text: Greg laughs. Tommy does too. Enjoying themselves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - GUERRERO STREET CONDO - SAME
text: They approach the entrance to Tommy’s condo. Tommy takes
text: out a KEY RING with at least fifty keys on it. As he’s
text: about to open the door, he stops.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I must ask you again. Please don’t talk
dialog: about me. Not to class. Not to anyone.
text: Greg nods. After a stern beat, Tommy accepts this. Opens
text: the door. Greg follows him inside, no idea what to
dialog: expect.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 12
scene_heading: INT TOMMY’S CONDO - GUERRERO STREET - SAME
text: And it’s weird. PAPERS strewn everywhere, BOXES spilling
text: over with CASSETTE TAPES (each one labeled with a
scene_heading: different date), VIDEOTAPES, OFFICE EQUIPMENT, a BLUE
text: UNICORN statue in the corner next to a random SHOPPING
text: CART filled with empty PLASTIC BAGS.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: The maid’s on vacation.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Cool, cool...
text: That explains it. Tommy walks into another room, leaving
text: Greg to continue exploring. On one wall are several
text: framed PORTRAITS OF TOMMY, on another is the AMERICAN
text: FLAG. In fact, there are American Flags all over.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So where you from, Tommy?
speaker_heading: TOMMY (0.S.)
dialog: New Orleans.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Originally?
text: No response. Greg keeps exploring:
text: On one shelf are hand-crafted SCULPTURES of DISNEY
text: CHARACTERS, a SKELETOR MASK, and a vase of DEAD ROSES. On
text: another, BOOKS about acting and film. Greg sees a framed
text: poem, perhaps Tommy’s favorite, called “I Do Not Choose
dialog: to Be a Common Man.”
text: Greg sees a bunch of shopping bags scattered around the
text: room, all with a particular amateurish label on it.
dialog: “Street Fashions USA.”
text: Tommy re-enters with two glasses of water.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “Street Fashions USA?”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I do marketing, you know, retail stuff.
dialog: (off Greg’s surprise)
dialog: I am man of many skills.
text: Greg is impressed. And now Greg’s eyes fall ona
text: PHOTOGRAPH of a much younger Tommy standing in front of
text: the Eiffel Tower. It looks to be taken in the 1960s.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: When was this taken?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Few years back.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 13
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Wow, you look so young in it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m not so old now, you know.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don’t be smart guy ok?
text: A beat. Greg quickly changes the subject.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So... how’d you get into acting?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It's always been dream. Long time. But I
dialog: ignore it. And then, one day, I have
text: accident. Guy runs red light and SMASH!
dialog: Very bad. Like wake up call you could
dialog: say. So I stop the other things, go back
dialog: to my dream.
text: Greg nods, understanding.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: For me, everything changed with “Home
dialog: Alone.”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: “Home Alone?” What is that? Movie?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, it’s... “Home Alone?”
text: Tommy has apparently never heard of it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Anyway, it spoke to me, man. That movie
dialog: changed my life. Ever since then, I...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You want to be star.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I just want to be in movies. It’s what I
dialog: was born to do.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I understand.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s your dream...
text: Greg nods. Finally someone who understands him. One day
text: with Tommy and he can feel his confidence growing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 14
text: A MOVIE SCENE FROM “REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.”
text: JAMES DEAN as Jim Stark. He’s in the holding cell at the
text: precinct and his parents have come to bail him out.
speaker_heading: JIM BACKUS
dialog: “Don’t I buy you every thing you want?”
speaker_heading: JAMES DEAN
dialog: “Oh you buy me many things...”
speaker_heading: JIM BACKUS
dialog: “We give you love and affection don’t we?
dialog: Then what is it?!”
dialog: REVEAL we are:
scene_heading: INT TOMMY’S APARTMENT— ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Greg is showing Tommy “Rebel Without a Cause.” Tommy
text: watches with rapt attention.
text: BACK ON TV SCREEN, Dean’s Parents continue to argue with
text: one another, until finally, Dean just can’t take it any
dialog: more:
speaker_heading: JAMES DEAN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: “YOU'RE TEARING ME APART!”
text: Tommy slaps Greg on the arm - you see that?! Greg smiles.
text: Tommy, enraptured, leans forward in his chair, studying
text: every inflection and mannerism of Dean’s performance. His
dialog: idol.
scene_heading: INT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Tommy and Greg are buzzing from the brilliance of the
dialog: film.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: He is emotion! Moment to moment. Not
dialog: plastic.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I thought you would like that.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: The way he speaks. Style. He has that
dialog: signature thing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah it’s called being James Dean.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You can be like Dean.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 15
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: My God you are behind the schedule!
dialog: Listen to me, young man... you have the
dialog: gift, you have the look. Now you watch
dialog: the Dean. Very close. And you learn.
text: Greg takes that in.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You really believe that?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I believe in you.
text: Greg is amazed at this. Tommy sees Greg as he wants to be
dialog: seen. As no one else sees him. It’s a powerful thing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I believe in you too, Tommy. If I can
dialog: have a career in this business, so can
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I don’t want career.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh. I thought --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I want my own planet.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: “Your own planet?”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Call it Tommy’s planet. Big lights, big
dialog: stores, big events... spectacular.
text: Again, Greg wants to laugh at this but he can’t. Tommy’s
text: enthusiasm - his unbridled confidence - is overpowering.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: And you can live there too if you want. I
dialog: let you stay for a while.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Thanks.
text: Greg laughs at this. Tommy smiles. Holds Greg’s gaze a
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Here. I have present.
text: Tommy takes something out of his pocket. It’s a PEN with
text: the Street Fashions USA label. Tommy hands it to Greg
dialog: with great drama and meaning.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 16
text: Greg takes it. He looks at the other side of the label
text: and on it is the picture of an ORB. Written beneath the
text: orb, “Tommy’s Planet.” On Greg’s bewildered face, CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT DINER - LATER
text: Greg and Tommy exit, back to talking about Dean and the
dialog: film.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: -.. three movies and just like that he’s
dialog: dead. What a tragedy.
text: Tommy nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You know he died in Cholame, south of
dialog: here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want to go one day. To the crash site.
dialog: Pay my respects --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So let’s do it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What, now? It’s like 300 miles away...
text: Tommy throws him his keys.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You drive.
text: And just like that, Greg and Tommy are taking a road
dialog: trip.
scene_heading: INT TOMMY'S CAR - LATER
text: Greg drives. He's mid-story...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: -.. we had this talent show in middle
dialog: school and I was gonna sing it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: In front of everyone?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: The whole school - parents, teachers,
dialog: everybody. I was so excited. Learned all
dialog: the words, practiced day and night --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So you could win the contest?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 17
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No. I was just excited to do it. My first
dialog: chance to perform in front of an
dialog: audience, you know. It was a pretty big
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I get the picture...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So the day before the show I’m in my
dialog: room, I take a break from singing to go
dialog: down, get some orange juice. And as I’m
dialog: walking down I hear my parents. They must
dialog: have thought I was still upstairs...
text: Greg recalls the painful memory. Tommy sees his face
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What did they say?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: My Dad was all, “who told that kid he
dialog: could sing? He sounds terrible. He’s
dialog: gonna embarrass us in front of our
dialog: friends.”
dialog: Tommy absorbs that. Wow.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: And my Mom, who usually stuck up for
dialog: me...
dialog: (shakes his head)
text: All she could say was “when he realizes
dialog: he’s terrible... maybe then he’1ll grow
dialog: out of this shit.”
text: Greg stares straight ahead, remembering. It hurts him
dialog: still.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Next morning, they woke me up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I faked a stomach flu. Stayed home for
dialog: the day.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You missed the whole show?
text: Greg keeps driving.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: To this day I’ve never had the guts to
dialog: sing in public...
text: A long beat of silence. Greg continues to drive.
dialog: Eventually:
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 18
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: My god, Greg, what a story.
text: They drive in silence a few beats. And then:

scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 23
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Greg, we really gotta go.
text: Mom looks at Greg. Greg kisses her on the cheek - he’s

text: Greg takes a moment to glance back at his window where

text: the back. Hops in.
scene_heading: MRS. SESTERO
dialog: Be safe, Mon Cherie.
text: Tommy puts the car into gear, perhaps forgetting he’s in
text: a convertible, he says to Greg:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: My god, she’s crazy!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What does that mean, “We all do?!”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Figure of speech.
text: Greg lets that go. He takes one last look back at the

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Eh, it’s all the same.
text: Greg isn’t sure what that means. They pass Graumin’s

speaker_heading: GREG

text: Tommy drives slowly down the street, talking to himself.
speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: +..a one bedroom?
text: Tommy sees Greg’s face.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What’s problem? You don’t want to share a

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: C’mon, I’m joking. What do you think?

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Check this out...

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Second bedroom!

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You can have the big bedroom.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 26
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Are you sure? Tommy, I can... I can try

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Several years now.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: How come you never moved down here
dialog: yourself? Made a real go of it or
dialog: something, you know?
text: Tommy takes a moment to think about this.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I never had a friend to do it with.
text: Greg takes that in. A nice beat between them. Tommy

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: But we can’t give up.
text: Tommy doesn’t seem so sure.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey. Hey, look at me. When they told

dialog: listen to them?
text: This approach gets Tommy's attention.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Fuck that, no, he ignored them. And he

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah... I don’t think I’1l be able to
dialog: work this into my schedule. Nice meeting
dialog: you, though.
text: And she practically runs out of there.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You think the bed is a little much?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Don’t be jealous. Who’s next?!
scene_heading: INT POQUITO MAS - NIGHT
text: Amber and Greg sit at the counter.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Well we still don’t have a Lisa but I
dialog: think we're ready.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: I gotta hand it to Tommy. He’s weird but
dialog: he comes though.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 54
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah.
text: Amber puts a WRAPPED GIFT on the table. Greg looks at
dialog: her. What’s this?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: I’m proud of you.
text: Greg unwraps the gift to reveal a KEY. He’s confused.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: This way you can come and go as you
dialog: please. No pressure or anything. I just
dialog: thought --
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I love it. Thank you.
text: They kiss. A nice moment.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT TOMMY’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Tommy in the Driver’s seat. Greg in the Passenger’s seat.
text: The car is parked in the alley outside the Studio. They
text: look at one another. It is time. And we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO - SAME
text: In SLO-MO, Tommy and Greg emerge from the car.
scene_heading: SUPER: June 12, 2002 - DAY 1
text: They walk through the alley to the soundstage. They
dialog: enter:
scene_heading: INT BIRNS & SAWYER SOUNDSTAGE - SAME
dialog: Which has been constructed to look exactly like the real
text: alley outside.
text: Sandy and Raphael stand by a DOLLY (with two different
text: kinds of CAMERAS on it). A CREW of Gaffers, Electricians,
dialog: Prop people and the like mill about. It’s a real movie
dialog: set.
text: Tommy surveys the scene. Claps his hands and yells:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Everyone, gather! Come here!
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 55
text: They do as instructed. We see the whole cast of “The
text: Room” including: Juliette (as “Michelle”), PHILIP (the
text: actor playing “Denny”), CAROLYN (the actress playing
text: “Lisa's Mom"), DAN (playing "Chris-R”) SCOTT HOLMES (as
text: “Mike”) and KYLE VOGT ("Peter").
text: Tommy turns to a YOUNG KID holding a CAMCORDER.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Markus, you ready?
text: The Kid nods, points the Video Camera at Tommy, its red
text: light starts to blink.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Today is our top of the mountain day. The
dialog: day we begin the first steps of a great
dialog: journey. After today, who among us will
dialog: ever be the same?
text: Applause all around. Speech is a little over the top but
dialog: the cast is excited. They’re making a movie!
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This play will work if the chemistry
text: between all the characters makes sense.
dialog: Human behavior and betrayal applies to
dialog: all of us. It exists within ourselves.
text: Now it’s getting a little weird. Even Greg isn’t sure
text: what he’s talking about. Markus continues to record the
text: whole thing as Tommy continues...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You love somebody. Do you? What is love?
dialog: You think you have everything, but you
dialog: don’t have anything.
text: The cast starts looking at one another. What is happening
dialog: right now? Tommy isn’t done.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You have to have hope and spirit. Be an
dialog: optimist. But can you handle all your
dialog: human behavior or other’s behavior? You
dialog: don’t want to be good, but great.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: THE ROOM!
text: More applause. Raphael and Sandy lock eyes. Holy shit.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: One other thing...
text: Tommy points to a curtained-off area at the back of the
text: lot with a sign that reads “Director Only.” It’s a toilet
text: with a curtain for a door.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 56
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This is private bathroom. Cost me many
dialog: dollars so is only for me. No one use it.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: You know there’s a bathroom, like, right
dialog: over there. With a door and everything...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (like Sandy is crazy)
dialog: This is real movie set.
speaker_heading: SANDY
speaker_heading: (WTF)
dialog: ok!
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Enough pet talk. Let’s make a movie!
scene_heading: INT ALLEY SET - LATER
text: Raphael sets up both the digital and film cameras with
dialog: his crew.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Ready first scene...
text: WE TRACK with Greg as passes the cameras on his way
text: towards the set.
text: Dan (playing the drug dealer Chris-R) paces incessantly,
text: practicing his intense over-the-top dialogue.
speaker_heading: CHRIS-R
dialog: I want my FUCKING money, motherfucker!
text: Greg slaps him on the back, encouraging. He walks on,
text: sees Tommy standing with Philip (playing the man-child
text: "Denny”), “blocking” the scene.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So he play with basketball here. And then
dialog: you come in here. Demand the money.
dialog: 
text: Greg nods along in support. Until Sandy appears.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Can I ask a question?
text: Tommy turns to Sandy. Annoyed by this intrusion.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: If Denny already bought the drugs, why
dialog: does Chris-R want the money now? What
dialog: kind of drug dealer doesn’t require up
dialog: front payment?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 57
text: Greg too finds this odd. Tommy is about to answer when:
speaker_heading: PHILIP HALDIMAN
dialog: Also... can I just call him Chris instead
dialog: of Chris-R?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: His name is Chris-R. You call him Chris-
dialog: R.
speaker_heading: PHILIP HALDIMAN
dialog: Yeah but why?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Cause he is gangster.
text: Philip looks at Greg. Can you help? But Greg and Tommy
dialog: are in lock step.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Gangster.
text: Tommy makes to move on but Philip stops him.
speaker_heading: PHILIP HALDIMAN
dialog: Oh, uh, also how old am I supposed to be?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I don’t know. 15, 16...
text: Both Greg and Philip find that odd. (Philip is quite
dialog: clearly in mid 20s.) But maybe this isn’t the time to say
dialog: SO...
speaker_heading: PHILIP HALDIMAN
dialog: Ok, sure...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: And don’t be Brando today. You will hurt
dialog: yourself.
text: Philip isn’t sure what that means. Raphael comes over.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Picture’s up...
text: Tommy walks over to the Camera(s). He nods to Greg, who
dialog: returns it. It’s really happening!
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Roll sound. Roll camera...
text: Tommy closes his eyes, takes a second to appreciate this
text: moment. And then: A CAMERA ASSISTANT holds up the
scene_heading: CLAPPERBOARD.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Action!
text: We see the lst Take through the CAMERA’S POV.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 58
speaker_heading: “CHRIS-R”
dialog: “Hey Denny.”
speaker_heading: “DENNY”
dialog: “Hey Chris-R, I’ve been looking for you.”
speaker_heading: “CHRIS-R”
dialog: “Do you have my money?”
speaker_heading: “DENNY”
dialog: “Your money is coming. It will be here in
dialog: a few minutes.”
speaker_heading: “CHRIS-R”
text: (pulls gun, grabs Denny)
dialog: “I need my money!”
speaker_heading: “DENNY”
dialog: “Just give me 5 minutes...”
text: They wrestle a few moments longer than they need to
dialog: until:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Cut!
dialog: (he approaches them)
dialog: I love it!
text: Greg does a fist pump. So proud.
text: Everyone else looks at each other like “what the fuck was
text: that?” Sandy approaches Tommy.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Did you want to do another?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why? That was perfect.
dialog: And off his face, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: SANDY (OVERLAP)
dialog: And that’s a wrap on day one, everybody!
scene_heading: INT BIRNS AND SAWYER SOUNDSTAGES - NEXT DAY
text: Greg walks through the CREW, taking it all in. His
text: enthusiasm for being on a movie set still evident on his
dialog: face. This is the dream.
speaker_heading: SUPER: DAY 4
text: He walks towards Tommy who is sitting in make-up,
text: studying his lines. AMY, the make-up artist, tries to do
text: her work while Tommy reads lines.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: “Oh hi, Mark.”
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 59
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: "Oh. Hi Mark!”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: “Oh hi! Mark.”
text: Tommy is about to make his screen debut and he’s nervous.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You’re always nervous for your on-screen
dialog: debut. You should have seen me, I almost
dialog: threw up.
text: Tommy looks at Greg, more annoyed than comforted.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You’re gonna do great, Tommy. I promise.
dialog: Just relax.
text: Sandy appears, pointing to his watch.
speaker_heading: SANDY
text: Five minutes.
text: Tommy stands. Looks around the place. Can’t sit still.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Where is wardrobe?
text: He walks over to the clothing racks. No one seems to know
text: where the costume designer is.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Do I have to do everything myself?!
text: Tommy starts grabbing CLOTHES off the rack. Picks a SHIRT
text: and a SPORTS COAT that neither fit nor match. He tries
text: both on and likes what he sees.
text: SAFOWA, the Costume Designer, shows up in the nick of
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: SAFOWA
dialog: I just went to grab ties.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Well now I’m already dressed. You’re too
dialog: late.
text: Tommy looks around for more props. Safowa has no idea
text: what he’s doing. He grabs some SCRUNCHIES, LOTION
text: BOTTLES, HAIR GEL, and a wad of fake CASH. He stuffs all
text: of them in his pants pockets.
speaker_heading: SAFOWA
dialog: You’re gonna film the scene with all
dialog: those things in your pockets?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 60
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I keep my stuff sweetie.
text: He walks off towards the set.
speaker_heading: SAFOWA
dialog: Can I at least take a picture for
dialog: continuity?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Continuity - is in your forehead.
text: And with that, he’s gone. Safowa turns to Greg.
speaker_heading: SAFOWA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SANDY (OVERLAP)
dialog: And... action!
scene_heading: INT ROOFTOP SET - MOMENTS LATER
text: The crew is set up to film an OUTHOUSE which will double
text: as the rooftop’s entry point. The door opens and Tommy as
text: “Johnny” comes out.
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “It is not...”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Line!
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: “True.” “It’s not true.”
text: Tommy holds up his hand in apology. Re-enters the
dialog: outhouse.
speaker_heading: SANDY
text: Going again. And... action.
text: Tommy comes out again.
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “It’s not true. I...”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Line!
text: Sandy looks at Greg. Then back to Tommy
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: “It’s not true. I didn’t hit her. It’s
dialog: bullshit. I did not.”
text: Tommy nods, goes back into the outhouse.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: And... action!
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 61
text: From the POV of the CAMERA, we see Tommy come out:
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “It's bullshit. I hit her, it’s
dialog: bullshit...”
text: Tommy keeps walking, until in fact he’s completely out of
text: frame. Sandy can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Dammit! Cut!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tommy... your mark.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: He! pointing to Greg)
dialog: e’s Mark.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: No, your mark. Where you need to stand.
dialog: To be in the shot.
text: Tommy realizes his mistake. Goes back in. Sandy exhales.
text: Tommy comes back out, staring at his feet:
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “It’s not true...”
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Look up!
text: Tommy can’t look up and talk at the same time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: SUPER: DAY 9
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “It’s not true. I did not hit her. It’s
dialog: bullshit. I did naaat.”
dialog: (beat, still looking down)
dialog: “Oh hi, Mark!”
text: Sandy looks towards Raphael. Good enough?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: And cut!
dialog: (in Raphael's ear)
dialog: I get it now. This is a huge money
dialog: laundering scheme.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE UP: A CHECK made out to Sandy from “Wiseau Films”
text: (complete with its own GLOBE logo). REVEAL we are:
scene_heading: INT WELLS FARGO BANK - DAY
text: Sandy is cashing the check, fully expecting it to bounce.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: Anything else I can help you with?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Really? That went through?
text: The Teller sees the confusion on Sandy’s face. He leans
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: This account... it’s a bottomless pit.
text: And Sandy can’t fucking believe it. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT APARTMENT POOL - DAY
text: Amber and Greg sit by the pool. Greg is reading from “The
text: Room” script, studying his lines. Amber looks over.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: So how’s shooting going?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 63
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Um, you know...
text: She doesn’t know. And neither really does Greg. But he
dialog: wants to believe.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Good. I think. It’s coming together.
text: Amber nods.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: And Tommy? How’s he doing?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: He’s... you know... he’s Tommy. He’s
text: trying hard but... I think he’s nervous.
dialog: He’s put a lot into this thing.
text: A beat. Amber smiles, can’t help herself.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: (in “Tommy voice”)
dialog: I am Tommy Wiseau. Great American film
dialog: director.
text: Greg laughs.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: (in “Tommy voice”)
dialog: This is movie for the ages. Classic
dialog: drama. Like the “Gone With Wind” or the
dialog: “Dance With Wolves...”
text: Greg finds this hilarious. They laugh together.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Oh man, what are you gonna do if it’s
dialog: terrible?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: I mean... isn’t this gonna be on your
speaker_heading: IMDB page?
dialog: This thought hadn’t occurred to Greg until now. Greg
dialog: thinks about it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It won't be terrible.
text: Amber doesn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It’s gonna be great, you’ll see.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 64
text: Amber picks up the script. Starts to browse through it.
text: Greg sits back in the chair, thinking about what she
text: said. On his face, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Decorated wall to wall with American flags and Christmas
text: decorations. Tommy is alone, watching some of the BEHIND
text: THE SCENES FOOTAGE that Markus has shot: Sandy and
text: Raphael in video village during one of Tommy’s
dialog: performances. We hear:
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL (0.S.)
dialog: Is he gonna do that accent the whole
dialog: movie?
speaker_heading: SANDY (0.S.)
dialog: Pretty sure that’s just how he talks.
text: Tommy watches this like a detective, making mental notes.
text: He’s interrupted by a KNOCK. It’s Juliette, the actress
dialog: playing "Michelle.”
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: May I come in?
text: She does, admiring all the office decorations.
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: Christmas in June.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (quickly turning off the TV)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: No, I mean, I like it. And the flags...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I am American. Just like you.
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: Of course. Yeah...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So what is it? As you can see I’m very
dialog: busy....
text: She sits on a chair across from Tommy’s desk.
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: Is it true you still haven’t found a
dialog: Lisa?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why, do you know someone?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 65
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: Well I was thinking... maybe I could do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (beat, looks at her)
dialog: Young lady...
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: I know, I know. I don’t have much
dialog: experience but... give me a chance. I
dialog: might surprise you.
text: Tommy looks at her as if regarding her for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Lisa is aggressive. Passionate. Very
dialog: determined. Are you those things?
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.
text: Juliette stands, slowly moves closer to Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: And you also must be ok with the kissing
dialog: stuff? There is lots of --
text: As if on cue, she kisses Tommy! He’s surprised but
text: quickly returns it and an intense make out ensues. A few
text: beats later, Juliette breaks away. Shrugs. Exits. Leaving
text: a very thrown Tommy with much to think about.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: My god.
speaker_heading: GREG AS “MARK” (OVERLAP)
dialog: “Yeah man, you never know...”
scene_heading: INT ROOFTOP SET - LATER
text: And now the rest of that scene. Tommy sits in a chair,
text: Greg as “Mark” stands over him.
speaker_heading: “MARK"
dialog: “People are pretty strange these days. I
dialog: used to know a girl she had a dozen guys.
text: One of them found out, beat her up so
dialog: bad, she ended up in the hospital.”
text: Which causes Tommy to laugh. No one can believe it.
speaker_heading: SUPER: DAY 23
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Cut. Let’s, uh, try that again...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 66
speaker_heading: “MARK"
dialog: “,.. she had a dozen guys. One of them
dialog: found out, beat her up so bad, she ended
dialog: up in the hospital.”
text: Tommy laughs at that again. Sandy and Raphael share
dialog: another glance. Holy shit!
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Cut!
text: Sandy walks over to Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: The story he’s telling you - the one you,
dialog: yourself, wrote - it’s not a funny story,
dialog: Tommy .
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: “MARK"
dialog: “,.. he beat her up so bad she ended up
dialog: in the hospital.”
text: Tommy laughs uproariously again.
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: What a story, Mark!
text: Sandy looks at Raphael who just shakes his head. Let’s
dialog: just keep going. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT BIRNS & SAWYER - PARKING LOT - END OF DAY
text: Greg walks with Tommy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Good news on the Lisa front. I know a
dialog: girl, a really good actress, just got
dialog: back in town --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Juliette is playing Lisa.
speaker_heading: GREG
text: No, Juliette is playing Michelle.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Not anymore. She show up one day, very
text: pushy, manipulative. Her competition is
dialog: vicious! Perfect for Lisa!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy, I’m the line producer. You have to
dialog: tell me these things...
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 67
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: But I’m director.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I know, I just... I want this to be good.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It won't be good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It will be GREAT.
dialog: And Greg wants to believe this. But still:
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So who's playing Michelle then?
dialog: Tommy didn't think about that. Oh shit.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You’re kidding, right? She shoots
dialog: tomorrow!
scene_heading: EXT BIRNS & SAWYER - SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Greg walks ROBYN PARIS (20s, brunette, savvy) down to the
text: other end of the alley.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’m sorry it’s so last minute. I know how
dialog: this looks.
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: It looks like I’m going to be murdered.
dialog: Is anyone else auditioning?
text: Tommy waits for them at the end of the alley in his
dialog: pirate/vampire outfit.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hello.
text: Robyn smiles.
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: Hi there.
text: Tommy looks at her a beat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Do you believe in love?
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Are you willing to give up your mind,
dialog: soul, and body to inhabit Michelle?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 68
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean, yeah I think so --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Great! You got the part!
text: On Robyn’s face, unsure how to feel. She turns to Greg.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Welcome to “The Room!”
scene_heading: INT EL COYOTE - LATER
text: Jam packed and loud. Tommy sits with Greg and Amber in a
text: small booth.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (to Waiter)
dialog: I said hot water. This is not hot. Why is
dialog: everything a problem these days?!
text: The Waiter scurries off. Awkward silence. Amber looks at
text: Greg. Sending him a message. Greg seems a little nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So Tommy the reason we, uh, brought
dialog: you here... We’ve been talking and...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We want to move in together.
text: Tommy looks at them, confused.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That's impossible. My place can’t handle
dialog: the three of us.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No that’s --
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Greg and I are moving in together.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What?
dialog: (to Greg)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: We found this place in Studio City. One
text: bedroom. Nice little yard in the back.
text: A very long beat. Tommy sees Amber take Greg’s hand and
text: hold it. He fixates on that hand for a beat. Tries to
text: mask whatever darkness comes over him.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What about the movie?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 69
text: That confuses Greg.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What about it? I’1l be there Monday.
text: Tommy shakes his head, anger building.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy, just cause I’m moving out, that
dialog: doesn’t mean --
text: Tommy stands abruptly.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You don’t understand.
text: Tommy looks at them, stewing, furious. And walks out of
text: the restaurant in a huff. Greg looks at Amber. Uh-oh. CUT
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
text: Greg enters, having carried most of his STUFF out to the
dialog: car. One more thing left to do:
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy?
text: He walks into the BATHROOM where Tommy is shirtless,
text: staring at his body in the mirror.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy, we're leaving.
text: Tommy says nothing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Can we at least talk about it?
text: Tommy continues to admire himself in the mirror. Greg
text: tries one more time.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Cause I feel like maybe we should --
text: And then, without even turning:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Look at my arms. Not bad, yeah. Like big
dialog: strong kid...?
text: Greg is disappointed.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I‘ll see ya.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 70
text: Tommy doesn’t even turn around. Greg walks out, a little
text: saddened.
text: And only then does Tommy turn, hurt and betrayed and
text: unable to hide it any longer.
scene_heading: INT BEDROOM SET - ANOTHER DAY
text: Juliette lies in bed, the covers closely tucked around
text: her naked body as her hair is touched up. Documentary
text: Markus films her close-up in the most pervy of ways.
speaker_heading: SUPER: DAY 44
text: Juliette is clearly a little uncomfortable but she’s
dialog: making the best of it. Until:
text: Tommy steps onto set, wearing nothing but a sock on his
dialog: dick.
text: Instead of getting into bed he starts barking at the
dialog: crew:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You. We need more lights. And you, help
dialog: him. You - come too. Raphael!
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: What is it, Tommy?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This shot is very important. It must look
dialog: like “The Titanic.”
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: “The Titanic.”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Trust me, it does.
text: Raphael walks off. As more crew gather around, Juliette
text: pulls the covers up higher. She looks to Greg - help me.
text: He approaches Tommy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy, can you —
dialog: (holds his script down to
dialog: cover Tommy’s junk)
dialog: Is this really necessary?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I have to show my ass or this movie won’t
dialog: sell.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Well at least have a closed set.

dialog: Closed set? Why? I want everyone to see
dialog: this.
dialog: (then, to Greg)
dialog: You especially.
text: Greg doesn’t know what that means. Meanwhile, Tommy gets
text: in bed. Juliette tenses up. Even Tommy can see that.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Brad Pitt did this in The Legends of the
dialog: Falls.
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: Can we put some music on? You know, to
dialog: help the mood. Like maybe an Alicia Keys
dialog: song?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We are not here to promote other people’s
dialog: work.
dialog: (barks at crew)
dialog: OK everyone gather closer. And... action!
text: He kisses her and she tries her best to return the
text: passion. Tommy pulls down the sheet to expose her
text: breasts, but then he suddenly stops.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Cut, cut... this is no good.
text: Everyone is confused.
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: What’s the problem?
text: Tommy points at Juliette’s shoulders.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We can’t have this on camera.
dialog: (snapping at Make-Up)
dialog: See all this stuff here... these pimples
dialog: and things.
text: He continues pointing at her body in front of everyone.
text: Juliette is horrified.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Here and here. And what is this?
text: Greg has rarely seen his friend so rude.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (still pointing)
dialog: Take this shit out. We can’t have this.
text: Juliette starts to cry.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 72
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: C’mon man, do you have to say it like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This is American movie! It needs to be
dialog: sexy. She needs to be beautiful.
text: She grabs the bedsheet and runs off.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Can I talk to you?
text: Tommy, slightly annoyed, walks with Greg off to the side
text: away from the others.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I know. I’m a little hard on Juliette
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It's not just Juliette --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You think Stanley Kubrick was nice to his
dialog: actors? Or Alfred Hitchcock?
text: Greg thinks about that.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Let me tell you something. In that book
dialog: you gave me, about the Hitchcock... there
dialog: is this movie called “Birds.”
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, I’ve seen “The Birds.”
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: When they make this movie, Hitchcock
dialog: would terrorize his actors. Lock them in
dialog: rooms, throw birds at them, real birds!
dialog: Nasty stuff. They would cry everyday.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That movie wins every award. Is Mr.
dialog: Hitchcock a bad man? No. He is great
dialog: director. The very word “director,” it
dialog: comes from the word “dictator.” I rest my
dialog: case.
text: And that strangely makes sense to Greg.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: If anyone has reason to be upset, quite
dialog: frankly it’s me, you know. I give them
dialog: jobs. I give them salary. I’ve spent more
dialog: than five million dollars on this movie
dialog: so far --
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 73
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Wait, seriously?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: -- and no one is grateful! No one
dialog: respects my vision! I know what they say.
dialog: I can hear them. No one trusts me, Greg.
dialog: Not even you.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I trust you.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Do you?
text: And he does. Despite everything, he still does.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I wouldn’t still be here if I didn’t.
text: Tommy nods. Puts his hands on Greg’s shoulders. Walks
text: back out to the SET.
text: Juliette, ever the professional, is back in bed faking it
text: with Tommy. Tommy rolls off her, smiles.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Let’s do it again.
dialog: No one thinks they need another.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Take 15...
text: Tommy begins to hump Juliet. Everyone watches. He seems
text: to be thrusting into her at a weird angle.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: He knows where her vagina is, right? Why
dialog: is he fucking her belly button?
text: Tommy rolls off her, smiles.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Cut... Reset. I want more passion.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: No, fuck that!
text: Tommy is stunned by this outburst.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: You embarrassed that girl in front of the
dialog: crew. Do it again you’re a dead man.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: You heard me.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 74
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Ok then you’re fired.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: What?!
text: Raphael wants to charge at him. Greg holds him back.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey, hey. Everybody cool out.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I hear what you say, your jokes -- you...
dialog: (to Sandy)
dialog: ++. and you...
dialog: (to the Actors)
dialog: +.. and you too. All of you!
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: The hell are you talking about?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Where is Markus?!
text: Markus emerges from behind the scrim. Camcorder in hand.
text: He drops it for the moment.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No, keep filming. Always be filming.
dialog: (to the Crew)
dialog: This is Markus. I hire him for
dialog: documentary. “The Making of The Room.”
dialog: Since our lst day he has been filming
text: behind the scenes. Every nasty comment,
dialog: every laugh - he sees it all. And then I
dialog: see it.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: So what you’re saying is... you've been
dialog: spying on your own production.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That’s right!
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: That's fucking crazy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So now you know. The next comment, the
dialog: next one to laugh - I don’t care who you
dialog: are, you’ll be out on the street!
text: Everyone looks to one another, trying to remember what
text: terrible things they probably said behind Tommy’s back.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: So am I fired or not?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 75
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I give you one more chance.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: (unenthusiastic)
dialog: Terrific. Check the gate.
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER
dialog: Checking the gate!
text: Tommy storms off. Not even Greg knows what to do. Raphael
text: sees Markus’s camera up in his grill. With a threatening
text: look, Markus turns the camera somewhere else. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT AMBER'S APARTMENT - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT
text: Greg nursing a beer, contemplative. A few empties by his
text: side. Amber comes out, dressed for bed.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: You ok?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Long day.
text: Production is clearly taking a toll on him. They both see
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: When this is over, let’s get out of here.
dialog: Take the money you made, start over
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You mean leave LA?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Why not? What’s so great about LA?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’m an actor. I need to be here. And I
text: can’t leave now. Things are finally
text: starting to happen.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: You’re not talking about “The Room,” are
dialog: you?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Greg I read the script. That’s maybe the
dialog: worst thing anyone has ever written.
dialog: Ever.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It’s... unconventional, sure...
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 76
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: No it’s bad. And every night you come
text: home, completely miserable, with a
dialog: different story of how fucked up
dialog: everything is on that set. Do you really
dialog: think this is gonna work out for you,
dialog: Greg?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Do you know how many movies had bad
dialog: scripts, troubled productions? Star Wars.
text: Jaws. Apocalypse Now. The Shining. And
dialog: every one of those turned out amazing.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Well this won't, Greg. This isn’t Jaws.
dialog: And Tommy isn’t Stanley Kubrick.
text: Greg is annoyed by this.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You don’t really know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
text: Amber looks at Greg. His devotion admirable but also
text: Maybe a little pathetic. We can see in her face Greg’s
text: naivete may be losing its appeal.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: I hope you're right.
dialog: We hear:
speaker_heading: “CLAUDETTE” (OVERLAP)
dialog: “Everything goes wrong at once...”
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TOMMY’S PRIVATE BATHROOM.
text: Raphael comes out. He looks both ways to make sure Tommy
dialog: didn’t see him. He totally just took a shit in there.
dialog: Mission accomplished.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO
text: Claudette and Juliette sit under the lights, sweating
text: bullets. They’ve seemingly been waiting a while.
speaker_heading: SUPER: DAY 68
text: Greg and the Make-Up Artist fan them down as they
text: continue to rehearse.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 77
scene_heading: CAROLYN AS “CLAUDETTE”
dialog: “Nobody wants to help me.”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: “And I'm dying.”
speaker_heading: JULIETTE AS “LISA”
dialog: “You're not dying.”
scene_heading: CAROLYN AS “CLAUDETTE”
dialog: “I got the results of the tests back. I
dialog: definitely have breast cancer.”
text: There’s a commotion and they turn. Tommy has finally
text: shown up on set. Sandy looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: He’s here, everybody!
text: Tommy ignores him, heads towards Carolyn and Juliette.
text: Already in a stint.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Tommy, does this come back?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: The breast cancer.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is twist.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: But it never comes back?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I don’t have time to explain script to
dialog: you. And what is this? Where is make up?
dialog: You look like you just went swimming in a
dialog: lake?
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: It’s 100 degrees in here.
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: Can we at least get some water?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Honey. Don’t forget. No one else in
dialog: Hollywood give you water.
text: Juliette reacts, furious. Even Greg is surprised by that.
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: (to Greg)
dialog: Someone's in a mood today.
text: Meanwhile, Raphael approaches Tommy.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 78
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: We need to cut the alley scene.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Impossible.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: No, we have to. We’re already four hours
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: And who's fault is that?
text: Raphael can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: It’s your fault. You showed up three
text: hours late - again.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m the director.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Exactly.
text: Raphael just throws up his hands. Tommy keeps walking. He
text: turns to the crew, pointing to some kleig lights.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why aren’t these on?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy, it’s way too hot for --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: IT IS NOT TOO HOT. IT IS NOT TOO HOT
dialog: UNLESS I SAY IT’S HOT!
text: At which point, Carolyn, the elderly actress playing
text: Lisa’s Mom, FAINTS from dehydration. HOLY FUCK!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO
text: LATER. Carolyn has some bottled water and a towel. She’s
text: eating with Greg and the rest of the actors at a lunch
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: I’m just tired. I haven’t been sleeping
dialog: well recently. I’1l be fine...
text: Greg studies her a beat.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 79
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Can I ask you something? Why do you do
dialog: it?
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: You’ve got a husband, grand-kids. You
dialog: live fifty miles out of town. And you're
dialog: waking up at 5, driving all this way, for
dialog: what?
text: Carolyn smiles.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: We’re actors, Greg. For you, me, people
dialog: like us... even the worst day on a movie
dialog: set is better than the best day doing
dialog: anything else.
text: Greg and the rest of the actors think about that. She’s
dialog: absolutely right.
speaker_heading: PHILIP HALDIMAN
dialog: (to Greg)
dialog: Can we ask you something? What’s his
dialog: deal?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah like where’s he from?
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: How’s he have all this money?
speaker_heading: PHILIP HALDIMAN
dialog: And what’s the hell is this movie about?
dialog: You’re the only one who’s read all of
dialog: it...
text: Greg is about to respond. Robyn interrupts.
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: I have a theory.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's autobiographical. Someone in his
dialog: life was a Denny - kid brother, someone
dialog: he looked out for or something. Someone
dialog: else was a Mark, the better looking
dialog: friend he was always jealous of...
text: Greg thinks about that. Robyn continues:
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: I’m sure there was a Michelle somewhere.
dialog: And a Mike.
text: They all think about it. It does make sense.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 80
speaker_heading: JULIETTE
dialog: So then who is Lisa? Who broke his heart,
dialog: stabbed him in the back, ruined his life?
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: Pretty obvious to me...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The universe.
text: Greg shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Look, Tommy is Tommy. He’s a weird guy,
dialog: no question. But I’11 tell you this...
dialog: every time I underestimate him, every
dialog: time I think maybe he’s just out of his
dialog: mind... somehow, someway, Tommy always
text: comes through.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You watch. This movie’s gonna make us all
dialog: famous.
text: That gets some laughs. Clearly none of them believe it.
scene_heading: INT CANTER’S - NIGHT
text: Greg and Amber are on their way out when Greg notices
text: someone waiting in the front of the restaurant. His eyes
text: bug out, holy shit. He leans in, conspiratorially:
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Shh. Check it out.
text: He gestures with his head, not too subtly. Amber looks
text: and sure enough - it’s BRYAN CRANSTON .
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Hey I know him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah no shit, Malcolm in the Middle.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: No, I mean...
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Bryan!
text: Greg's mouth hits the floor.
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: Amber, how’s it going?!
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: So good to see you! This is my boyfriend,
dialog: Greg.
text: Cranston puts out his hand. Greg shakes it, still in awe.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 81
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: He’s also an actor.
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: Oh yeah? Anything I would have seen?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Um, no, I doubt it.
text: A beat of awkward silence. But Bryan’s a pro.
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: Are you working at the moment?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Actually, yeah, I’m... shooting this
dialog: movie...
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: A movie. Nice! Good for you, man.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: But I'd love to do TV someday. Sitcoms,
dialog: drama, cop shows - I love all that stuff.
dialog: Bryan thinks about this.
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: Funny you should say that...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's this scene we're doing next week.
text: The boys go missing and Hal and Lois find
dialog: them in the woods. We need a lumberjack.
dialog: You think you could you do that?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: Well you got that beard...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That's...
text: Greg is momentarily taken aback.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Holy shit, I would love to. Next week,
dialog: did you say?
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: Tuesday and Wednesday.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Amazing! Yes. I’m not shooting next week
dialog: at all.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 82
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Wait, Greg.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You think Tommy will be cool with this?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Why wouldn’t he?
text: Amber shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy's my friend. He’ll be happy for me.
text: Amber says nothing to that. Greg turns back to Cranston.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Do I have to do anything?
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: No, just bring that handsome face of
dialog: yours.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, and don’t shave. Really sells that
text: lumberjack look.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I can do that! Yes! Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRYAN CRANSTON
dialog: My pleasure.
dialog: (to Amber)
dialog: Good to see you, Amber.
text: He hugs Amber goodbye and walks off. Greg and Amber stand
text: there a beat.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: How do you know Bryan Cranston?!
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Pilates.
scene_heading: INT A DARK BEDROOM - SAME
text: Tommy, as serious as we’ve ever seen him, kneels down and
text: makes the sign of the cross. Then he slowly raises a GUN
dialog: to his mouth. For a moment we might think this is real
text: but then Tommy pulls the trigger. The prop makes a tiny
text: POP sound.
text: ANGLE ON GREG, watching with the crew. He sees Tommy fall
text: over, start flailing around on the floor. This goes for a
text: long while until he grabs Lisa’s RED DRESS from the
dialog: ground -
speaker_heading: SANDY (0.S.)
dialog: cur!
text: Tommy turns to him, shocked.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 83
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don’t cut! What are you doing? This is
dialog: real acting!
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: Tommy, if you plan to writhe around you
dialog: should probably do it before you blow
dialog: your brains out, not after.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I disagree.
dialog: Sandy couldn't care less at this point.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Can you at least try to stay in the
dialog: frame?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That is your problem. And action!
text: This time Tommy runs around, trashing the room. Glassware
text: and picture frames go flying. He breaks a mirror. He
text: pulls out drawers. He grunts and moans throughout the
text: rampage. He nearly runs into Markus, the documentary kid,
text: filming from off to the side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Why? Why?!”
text: Tommy writhes around on the floor until he grabs the red
text: dress... which he then repeatedly rubs on his crotch.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Is he... why is he...?
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: (has to look away)
dialog: Oh Dear God...
text: BACK TO TOMMY. Who is very clearly masturbating with the
text: dress. Upon finishing, he then SNIFFS the soiled dress!
text: Eventually he picks up the gun...
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “God... forgive me!”
text: And pulls the trigger! He falls over and remains
dialog: motionless.
text: ANGLE ON the entire crew. Stunned silence. No one can
dialog: believe what they just saw.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: And... cut?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 84
text: Tommy sits up, brushes some lint off his pants. Greg
text: takes a deep breath. It’s time to ask Tommy for a favor.
text: He approaches him, anxiously.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Dude that was amazing!
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Totally. So raw and intense. You really
dialog: brought it, man. Seriously.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Tommy nods to him, is about to walk away.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey, uh, listen... I know it’s last
dialog: minute but, um...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What is it, Greg, I’m very busy?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Well, I know tomorrow is the big beard
dialog: shaving scene --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I know the schedule.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So I was hoping we could move that scene
dialog: Maybe to next week and I could have
dialog: tomorrow off...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (covers his face)
dialog: Why, are you sick?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No, I -
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (immediately suspicious)
dialog: So why you need day off?
text: Greg isn’t sure he should tell him. Has no idea how he’1l
text: react. But he doesn’t want to lie.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You won't believe this but... I landed a
text: small part on a tv show. Malcolm in the
dialog: Middle.
text: Tommy doesn’t like the sound of this at all.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 85
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: But you’re a movie actor now. Why you do
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It’s a big show. Great exposure. Could be
dialog: a real boost for my career.
text: Tommy considers for a beat. Blank poker face.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What do you have to do on this “Malcolm?”
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: (re: beard)
dialog: Just have to show up with this I guess.
text: Tommy says nothing. Considering Greg’s words carefully.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Which is why I can’t shave tomorrow. But
dialog: if you move the schedule just a day or
dialog: two... it would really help me out.
text: Tommy thinks long and hard about it. And he makes a
dialog: decision:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m sorry, Greg. I can’t help you.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What, why?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Clean shaven Mark has grand entrance at
dialog: start of 3rd Act. This is important
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I know it is. But... we can shoot it next
dialog: week, can’t we?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I'm afraid no. Is impossible.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I can’t give you special treatment, Greg.
dialog: It would not be not fair to the others.
text: Greg can’t believe it. By now everyone has stopped what
dialog: they’re doing to listen.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: C’mon Tommy, Jesus. I’m asking for a
dialog: favor --
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 86
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Another favor. All you do is ask favors.
text: Greg flinches at that.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I give you place to stay, I write part
dialog: for you, I make this whole movie, Greg,
dialog: for you and for me. And you still want
dialog: more favors.
dialog: And this hurts Greg. Friends don’t do this. But at the
dialog: same time, it’s kinda true.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m sorry but my answer is no. So you
dialog: must choose. You do TV show. Or you do
dialog: movie. Our movie.
text: Greg is furious. All eyes are on him. What will he
dialog: decide? CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT MAKE-UP TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Greg comes in to find Amber there. Her arms folded. Her
text: face unable to mask her disappointment.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: I don’t understand you.
text: Greg ignores her. Sits on the bed, distraught.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: That was your chance to get away from
dialog: this guy and you didn’t take it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Say no! Walk out! Tell him to fuck
dialog: himself!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I can't...
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Yes you can. Of course you can. Why can’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Cause he’s... my friend --
text: Amber sighs deeply. Shakes her head. And then she says:
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: You’re so full of shit sometimes, you
dialog: know that?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 87
text: And now he turns to face her.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: This isn’t about loyalty, or friendship.
dialog: This is about fear.
text: Greg looks at her - what is she saying?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Your biggest fear is that you’re bad at
dialog: this. That you'd go on to that Malcolm
dialog: set and people would laugh at you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But with Tommy around, that wouldn’t
dialog: happen. It would never happen. Cause
dialog: there’d always be somebody worse.
text: Greg doesn’t want to admit it but she’s making sense.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Tommy isn’t your friend, Greg.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's your excuse.
text: Greg looks away, unable to deny it. She squeezes his
text: shoulders, walks past him out of the trailer. He watches
text: her go and in that moment, he knows, he’s lost her. We
dialog: hear:
text: SFX: The BUZZ of ELECTRIC CLIPPERS. And we are:
scene_heading: INT BIRNS AND SAWYER SOUNDSTAGES - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Greg, demoralized beyond repair, is being shaved with a
dialog: straight razor by Amy. If that wasn’t bad enough, Tommy
text: is behind him, too close, watching every pass of the
dialog: razor.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Mmm. Slower. Do it slower.
dialog: Take your time.
text: And then it’s over. Amy lifts Greg’s head up so he can
text: see in the mirror. He looks in the mirror, a little
text: heartbroken. RACK FOCUS to Tommy, right behind him.
text: Cheshire grin and all, purposefully ruining his friend's
dialog: life. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT THE ROOM SET - LATER
text: Tommy, “Denny,” and the ACTOR playing “Peter” stand
text: around in tuxedos. Denny inexplicably has a football.
text: The DOORBELL rings. Denny opens it and in walks clean-
text: shaven Greg. Everyone gasps. A “HUGE MOVIE MOMENT.”
speaker_heading: “MARK"
dialog: “So... you like it?”
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 88

scene_heading: EXT GREG AND AMBER’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER MORNING
text: Greg waits on a street corner for Tommy. A few moments
text: later a VAN pulls up.
speaker_heading: SUPER: DAY 118
text: Tommy rolls down the window, excited.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Road trip!
text: Greg is noticeably less enthusiastic.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: San Francisco here we come. Like the old
dialog: times.
text: Tommy notices Greg’s attitude.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 89
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What’s the matter, you don’t seem
dialog: excited?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Let’s just finish this thing.
scene_heading: INT VAN - DAY
text: Greg rides with Tommy and a 3-MAN CREW we've never seen.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Who are these guys?
text: Tommy motions to TODD (20, green, fresh out of film
dialog: school).
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That’s Todd. That’s... friend of Todd.
dialog: And that’s... other friend of Todd.
text: Greg is confused by this.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Where’s Sandy?
text: Tommy doesn’t want to answer.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Where’s Rafael?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It’s over for those guys.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You fired them?!
text: Tommy looks away.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Ah forget about them. We don’t need them,
dialog: we have Todds now.
text: Greg just shakes his head. What can he do?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So where are we going anyway...?
text: And now a big smile forms on Tommy’s face. Greg does NOT
dialog: like the look of that.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: San Francisco baby!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh Christ.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 90
scene_heading: INT VAN - SAME
text: LATER. Driving on the 405 North. Tommy and Greg in the
text: back. Greg doesn’t engage, just stares out the window.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Somebody is sad today. Can you smile
dialog: little bit or is it end of the world?
text: A beat. Greg doesn’t want to talk about it with Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Is this about your lady friend?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don’t want to talk about it.
text: But then a beat later.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: We've hit a rough patch, I guess. I don’t
dialog: know. Maybe we just want different
dialog: things...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That's too bad. I always like her...
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I have idea! Let’s do a whole scene in
dialog: San Francisco.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What, a new scene?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We can use this emotion!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I thought we were just shooting
dialog: exteriors.
text: Tommy excitedly grabs his LAPTOP and opens it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don’t worry about this.
dialog: (beat, starts to type)
dialog: So maybe we’re in coffee shop. Johnny and
text: Mark talking about life and women.
scene_heading: EXT FISHERMAN’S WHARF - EARLY MORNING
text: Packed with tourists and pricey real estate.
speaker_heading: TODD (0.C.)
dialog: We made it.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 91
scene_heading: INT VAN - SAME
text: The van pulls up in front of a huge building. Greg looks
text: closer and sees a small sign above the entrance. It reads
text: “STREET FASHIONS USA.” Greg look at Tommy, shocked.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Do you own this building?
scene_heading: EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - LATER
text: The crew is walking back to the van.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: The bridges, Alcatraz...
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: We got everything. The whole city.
text: Todd and his Assistant are about to hop in. Greg stops
dialog: Tommy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don’t understand. If you own this
dialog: building, why didn’t we just shoot here?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Script called for green screen.
text: Which makes absolutely no sense. Greg is about to say so
text: when Tommy’s eyes fall on a FLOWER SHOP.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I have new idea!
text: Tommy crosses the street, oncoming traffic be damned.
text: Todd looks at his TWO ASSISTANTS. They shrug and follow.
scene_heading: EXT FLOWER SHOP - LATER
text: Scene over, Tommy comes back out on the sidewalk,
text: excited.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Maybe now we shoot scene at the zoo...
text: He walks ahead of Todd and his crew. Greg hangs back with
text: them. He hears:
scene_heading: TODD'S ASSISTANT
text: It’s almost like he doesn’t want to
dialog: finish the thing.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Well of course he doesn’t. When this
dialog: movie ends, what’s he gonna do with
dialog: himself?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 92
text: Greg absorbs that. On his face, as it lingers, CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT POLO GROUNDS - ANOTHER DAY
dialog: The exact spot they played football years ago. Greg knows
text: it too. He look at Tommy, wondering the point of all
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Now we throw the ball around. Like first
dialog: time.
text: He shows Todd where to set up the camera. Then he throws
text: the football towards Greg. It bounces in the dirt before
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (picks up the ball)
dialog: Tommy, what are we doing here?
text: He tosses the ball back but Tommy drops it. Tommy picks
text: it up with a new idea.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Let’s do singing scene.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Mark wants to sing the “Kokomo” but he’s
text: afraid. So Johnny help him.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah I don’t think so...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Tell the story of your Dad.
text: Greg realizes Tommy is serious.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’m not doing that, Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I must insist. Daddy thinks you embarrass
dialog: him, no one believes in you, you’re not
dialog: good enough --
text: Greg quickly looks towards Todd, sees the camera is
dialog: rolling.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Come on, man, I told you that in
dialog: confidence. I told you that as a friend.
text: Greg throws the ball back to Tommy who drops it.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 93
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Movies are emotion. You need to be real
dialog: for us.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Fuck you Tommy, no --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Daddy hates you, Mommy thinks you're a
dialog: loser...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I said NO!
text: Greg hurls the ball at Tommy. Hard.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Dammit Greg, why you throw this tricky
dialog: stuff?!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You want to be real for the camera, fine.
dialog: Tell me where you were born...
text: Tommy quickly looks at Todd, still filming. Then back to
dialog: Greg.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: This is not part of scene.
text: Tommy throws the ball back. His discomfort visibly
dialog: growing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Where are you from, Tommy?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I told you we don’t talk about this.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You want an easier one? Ok...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where’s the money come from?
text: Now Tommy is getting angry.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You don’t go from selling toy birds to
dialog: owning real estate on Lombard Street?
dialog: How’d you get so much money, huh? What
dialog: did you do?
text: Tommy throws the ball back, hoping the camera can’t tell
text: how angry he’s becoming.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Too personal. Ok. Forget that. Just tell
dialog: me this:
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How old are you?
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 94
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (a warning)
dialog: Greg...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You want to be real, let’s be real. What
dialog: year were you born? Cause there’s no
dialog: fucking way you’re in your --
text: And now Tommy EXPLODES, running over to Greg and leaping
text: on top of him. Fists and kicks start flying, curses too,
text: as they roll around in the grass. Todd and the crew keep
dialog: filming.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I believed in you. I trusted you. And for
dialog: what?
text: Eventually Greg shoves Tommy off of him and gets up.
text: Looks down at him, hurt and angry.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I gave you everything!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You RUINED everything!
text: Greg shakes his head. Starts walking. Tommy calls out to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Greg!
text: Greg ignores him. Keeps walking.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don’t owe you shit anymore.
text: Greg walks off. Nothing left between them now. He mutters
dialog: to himself.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: And this movie better be awesome...
text: And with that he’s gone. Todd looks at Tommy still on the
text: ground, emotionally spent. A beat:
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Can we cut?
text: Tommy looks over to him. He forgot the camera was rolling
text: still. And with that, principal photography on “The Room”
text: is over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 95
scene_heading: INT POST-PRODUCTION FACILITY - EDITING SUITE
text: Greg sits with a gleeful Sandy and an exasperated ERICA
dialog: CHASE, editor of “The Room.” We HEAR but don’t SEE what
text: they’re watching.
speaker_heading: "MARK" (0.S.)
dialog: (suddenly explodes)
dialog: "Leave your stupid comments in your
dialog: pocket!"
text: Greg is confused by what he’s seeing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don’t understand...
speaker_heading: ERICA
text: Because it doesn’t make sense. Lisa says
dialog: she's "getting ready for the party
dialog: tonight." Then it's night and there's no
text: party. Then it's day and she's still
dialog: getting ready for the party!
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: And that’s how Tommy wants it.
text: Greg looks at him. What? Sandy shrugs. Typical Tommy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So is it terrible or just confusing...?
text: Erica looks at Sandy.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: As crazy as the last 6 months have been,
dialog: and as much as I want to strangle Tommy -
dialog: this still isn't the worst movie I've
dialog: ever made.
scene_heading: EXT HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
text: Greg drives up the street. On the phone with a New Agent:
speaker_heading: NEW AGENT (OVER)
dialog: You’re telling me you worked on this
dialog: thing for eight months and got nothing to
dialog: show for it?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Believe me, we’ll be much better off if
dialog: no one ever --
text: Greg's eyes notice a giant BILLBOARD in the Hollywood
text: skyline. To his utter shock, it’s an AD for THE ROOM:
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh fuck.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 96
speaker_heading: NEW AGENT (OVER)
dialog: Greg?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’1l call you back.
text: Greg pulls over to the side. He gets a better look at the
text: billboard. It’s one of TOMMY’S HEADSHOTS, his lips
text: pursed, his eyes droopy, his whole face angled low as if
text: looking down on the passing commuters. The tag line
text: reads: “CAN YOU REALLY TRUST ANYONE?”
text: At the bottom of the billboard is an RSVP HOTLINE.
text: Greg, curious, takes out his CELL, types in the number.
scene_heading: INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
text: Tommy sits at a desk in a wife-beater. He answers
dialog: excitedly:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I'm listening...
scene_heading: INT GREG’S CAR - SAME
text: Greg quickly hangs up. Disbelief.
scene_heading: INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hello? Hello?
text: No one is there. Tommy deflates. He hangs up the phone.
text: We see his place has been turned into the de facto
dialog: operation for all things “Room” publicity. Posters,
dialog: fliers, stickers, etc.
dialog: We stay with him a beat. This is his whole life now. With
text: no one else in it. He continues what he was doing which
text: is inserting professional-looking INVITATIONS into
speaker_heading: ENVELOPES.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT LOBBY - GREG’S NEW APARTMENT - SAME
text: Greg opens the mailbox downstairs at his new place. He’s
text: got a stack of bills. One POSTCARD stands out in
dialog: particular.
text: ANGLE on the POSTCARD - “You & a Guest are Invited.” It’s
text: an invite to The Room Premiere - below which is a faux
dialog: review: “With the passion of Tenesse Willaims!”(sic) -
dialog: Entertainment Today.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 97
text: Greg looks at it. A beat. He throws it in the trash.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT COMMUNITY THEATER - DAY
text: Greg in a scene from Arthur Miller's “Death of a
text: Salesman.” A smattering of people in the audience. Greg
text: tries not to be intimidated.
speaker_heading: "BIPF"
dialog: "No! Nobody's hanging himself, Willy! I
dialog: ran down eleven flights with a pen in my
dialog: hand today. And suddenly I stopped, you
dialog: hear me? And in the middle of that office
dialog: building, do you hear this? I stopped in
dialog: the middle of that building and I saw -
dialog: the sky. I saw the things that I love in
dialog: this world. The work and the food and
dialog: time to sit and smoke. And I looked at
dialog: the pen and said to myself, what the hell
dialog: am I grabbing this for? Why am I trying
dialog: to become what I don't want to be? What
dialog: am I doing in an office, making a
dialog: contemptuous, begging fool of myself,
dialog: when all I want is out there, waiting for
dialog: me the minute I say I know who I am! Why
dialog: can't I say that, Willy?"
text: He’s doing his best. And he’s not afraid.
scene_heading: EXT COMMUNITY THEATER - LATER
text: Greg emerges, says goodbye to some of his fellow
text: performers, is about to walk to his car when he hears:
speaker_heading: TOMMY (0.S.)
dialog: Babyface.
text: Greg turns. None too pleased to see Tommy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You stalking me now?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You're not so hard to find.
text: Behind Greg is a poster advertising the play - “Death of
text: a Salesman” starring William Devane and Greg Sestero,
text: their head shots prominently featured.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Did you watch the play?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Nah. You know I don’t like comedies.
text: Greg just shakes his head.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 98
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So how’s Amber?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: (off Tommy’s surprise)
dialog: She moved to Austin. It didn’t work out.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m sorry to hear this.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That why you’re here?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You didn’t RSVP. To the premiere.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, I don’t think I can make it. Sorry.
text: Tommy says nothing. Greg is about to walk away. He turns
text: back to Tommy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Are you sure you even want to do that? I
dialog: mean, maybe it’s best to just... bury the
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Why would you say this?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’ve seen some clips...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Oh you don’t know what you saw. I fire
dialog: three editors since then...
text: Greg shakes his head. Of course he did. He starts to walk
text: off but Tommy stops him.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We made a pact, remember. To never lose
dialog: sight of our dreams. And Friday night
dialog: they're premiering a movie - our movie -
dialog: in a real live movie theatre...
text: Greg takes that in. In that respect Tommy makes a good
text: point. But still, he’s hesitant.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I know you don’t like me anymore. So
dialog: don’t do this for me. Do it for you.
dialog: You’ll finally get to see yourself on the
text: big screen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This was your dream too, Greg.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 99
text: And with that Tommy turns and walks away. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT GREG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Greg stands in the very same TUXEDO he wore in the film.
text: There's a strange vibe in the air. Maybe not excitement,
text: exactly, but some charge of anticipation, energy.
text: After a beat, a LIMOUSINE pulls up outside his place.
text: There's no mistaking its destination - “ROOM” POSTERS
text: have been taped on the doors. One of the doors opens and
text: out pops Tommy.
text: He gives Greg a big, exuberant bear hug. Greg doesn’t
text: return it. His guard still up.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Can you believe this?
text: Greg sighs. Part of him can’t believe he’s doing this.
text: As they hop in, Tommy hands Greg a “Room” POSTCARD. Greg
text: looks it over, doesn’t want it. Tries to hand it back.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It’s ok. I have boxes of these things.
scene_heading: INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
text: And Tommy meant that literally. He and Greg sit amongst
text: various boxes of Room propaganda.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You really pulled out all the stops
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Wait till you see.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh. And I have surprise for you.
text: That’s worrisome. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: The limo driving down the street. It slows in front of
text: Grauman’s Chinese Theatre where a CROWD of people have
text: gathered to see “The Matrix: Reloaded.”
text: They turn to see Tommy, popping out of the sunroof. With
text: his strange voice and dark sunglasses, he could be a
text: villain from that movie. He yells to the crowd.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don’t see that! Come see feature movie
dialog: premiere! Tonight: The Room! You’re all
dialog: invited!
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 100
text: Tommy starts throwing T-shirts and Postcards to the
dialog: crowd. And to anyone else on Hollywood Boulevard who have
dialog: no idea what to make of this crazy guy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
speaker_heading: (to the DRIVER)
dialog: Ok, let’s go!
scene_heading: EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
text: Spotlights. Red carpet. Velvet ropes. Fanfare. Exactly
dialog: what you'd expect at a big studio movie premiere.
text: Except not a lot of people waiting outside. “Chris-R” is
text: there with “Denny” and “Mike.” Juliette and Robyn stand
dialog: with Carolyn Minnott and her Salt of the Earth elderly
speaker_heading: HUSBAND.
text: The limo pulls up in front. Tommy’s HIRED PHOTOGRAPHERS
text: begin to snap pictures in expectation of Tommy’s exit.
scene_heading: INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
text: Greg is about to open the door when a look comes over
dialog: Tommy .
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (to the Driver)
text: Drive around the block again.
text: The Driver shoots him a confused look.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We need to build the anticipation.
text: Greg rolls his eyes. Typical Wiseau.
scene_heading: EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
text: The gathered guests are confused as the limo pulls away.
scene_heading: INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
text: It pulls up again. Tommy looks out the window. Still not
text: satisfied. They keep driving.
scene_heading: EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
text: Watching the limo drive off again, Robyn announces:
speaker_heading: ROBYN
dialog: Tommy Wiseau, ladies and gentlemen.
text: Which gets a big laugh from the Room-mates.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 101
text: After a few more beats, the limo pulls up again and this
text: time it stops. The Photographers look at one another,
text: shrug, start taking pictures.
scene_heading: INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
text: Tommy nods to Greg. It’s time. The door opens.
scene_heading: EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
text: Greg emerges first. Everyone cheers and shouts for him.
text: And, hearing the cheers and shouts, Tommy quickly follows
text: after. He’s ecstatic to hear the cheers increase in
dialog: volume.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hello everybody!
text: Tommy enthusiastically enters the theatre. Greg a lot
text: less so. He’s curious, sure, but he already can’t wait
dialog: for this to be over.
scene_heading: INT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
text: People have started taking their seats. The MIDDLE ROWS
text: have all been reserved for the CAST. Tommy waves to
text: anyone and everyone and takes an aisle seat. It’s
text: starting to dawn on Tommy - this is real, people are
text: about to watch his movie - and it’s beginning to make him
dialog: nervous.
text: Greg sits next to him. No idea really what to expect. The
text: lights dim.
text: A LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE steps up to the front, holding a
dialog: microphone.
scene_heading: LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE
dialog: If I can have your attention...
text: ANGLE on “Denny,” turning to give Tommy a big thumbs. It
text: doesn’t appear to calm Tommy’s nerves.
scene_heading: LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE
dialog: Please welcome the writer/ director/
dialog: producer/ and star of tonight’s...
dialog: (looking at his notes)
dialog: -.. “extravaganza.” Mr. Tommy Wizz, Wise,
dialog: Wisso?
text: Tommy stands amongst the cheers and catcalls of his
text: guests. He now looks fucking terrified. Sweat pours down
text: face and neck. His hands shake as he grabs the mic. He
text: looks out on the crowd - Juliette, Carolyn, Robyn, Sandy,
dialog: the whole cast.
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 102
text: He looks at Greg. A long, long look at Greg. And then,
text: fighting back, tears, finally he speaks:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This is my movie. This is my life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hope you learn something... And
dialog: discover yourself.
text: He makes the “hang-loose” sign above his head.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Be cool.
text: And with that, he walks back to his seat. Greg puts his
text: hand on Tommy’s shoulder and squeezes. No matter what the
dialog: movie is, Greg is legitimately proud of Tommy at this
text: moment. Tommy puts his hand on Greg’s hand in a gesture
dialog: of thanks.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m happy you’re here.
text: Greg nods. Not giving Tommy anything more than that.
text: The lights go down and everyone claps - the movie is
text: about to begin.
text: ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: the LOGO for Wiseau Films. It gets
text: the requisite applause. Tommy raises his arms in the air.
text: His shining moment.
text: And then comes a SECOND LOGO for Wiseau Films. This is
text: met with confusion, mostly. Sandy rolls his eyes. Then
text: some polite applause.
text: And now comes the opening credits. Dramatic music over
text: random shots of San Francisco. More loud applause. Greg
text: just shakes his head - “wait.”
speaker_heading: CREDITS END
dialog: “THE ROOM”
dialog: And out comes Tommy as “Johnny.” Here are his first
dialog: lines:
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Hi babe!”
dialog: (singsong)
dialog: “I have something for youuu.”
speaker_heading: “LISA"
dialog: “What is it?!”
text: “Lisa” excitedly tries to wrestle it from behind
text: “Johnny's” back. Eventually he gives it to her. A box.
text: She opens it to reveal “sexy red lingerie.”
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 103
text: ANGLE ON Greg, mortified.
text: BACK ON SCREEN: “Lisa” re-enters the room in the
text: lingerie. “Johnny” likes what he sees.
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Wow you look so sexy, Lisa. I would do
dialog: anything for my girl.”
text: At which point, “Denny” enters the room. This is
dialog: apparently not weird at all.
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Oh hi Denny.”
speaker_heading: “DENNY”
dialog: (inappropriately ogling)
dialog: “Wow look at you!”
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Anything for my princess.”
text: ANGLE ON Philip Haldiman. He just shrugs.
scene_heading: BACK ON SCREEN:
dialog: “THE ROOM”
text: “Denny” eats his apple downstairs while, upstairs, “Lisa”
text: and “Johnny” begin their foreplay. A few beats of this
text: and then “Denny,” surprising them both, joins in on the
dialog: fun!
text: ANGLE ON Amber. She looks at Greg. Wow. He doesn’t return
text: her gaze.
scene_heading: BACK ON SCREEN:
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Denny, two’s great. But threes a crowd.”
text: Denny gets the message.
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Bye Denny.”
text: And Denny leaves. The music changes to what Tommy thinks
text: is sultry and arousing. “Johnny” and “Lisa” begin to make
dialog: out.
text: ANGLE ON Juliette, hiding her face. Robyn puts her arm
text: around her. Enjoying themselves, not yet demoralized.
scene_heading: BACK ON SCREEN:
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 104
dialog: “THE ROOM”
text: “Johnny” has sex with “Lisa” as only he can. In her belly
dialog: button.
text: ANGLE ON the Audience. Many now start trading crazy looks
dialog: like “what the hell are we watching?” Many others
text: fidgeting in their chairs. You can feel it growing.
text: Greg is obviously slinking down in his chair from
dialog: embarrassment.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: “Oh hi Johnny. I didn’t know it was you.
dialog: Here you go.”
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “It’s me. How much is it?”
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: “It'll be 18 dollars.”
speaker_heading: “JOHNNY”
dialog: “Here you go. Keep the change.”
dialog: (he pets a DOG)
dialog: “Hi doggie!”
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: “Thanks. You're my favorite customer.”
text: ANGLE ON the Audience. Uncomfortable fidgeting, several

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Tommy...
scene_heading: THE DISASTER ARTIST - 108
dialog: Tommy is lower than Greg or any of us have ever seen to
text: this point. It breaks Greg’s heart.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey, listen to me. That thing up there.
dialog: That's your MOVIE, man. You made it - YOU
dialog: - all by yourself. Do you know how
dialog: special that is? It’s incredible. How
dialog: many people get to say they did something
dialog: like that?

dialog: of view.
speaker_heading: GREG

dialog: trigger.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: GREG AND TOMMY
text: As the audience starts shouting “do it! Do it!” Greg

text: nods to Greg. Greg nods back. Friends again.

text: adulation only grows as he’s handed a microphone, heads
text: up to the stage.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: So I’m glad you liked my... comedic
dialog: movie!

speaker_heading: TOMMY
