speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Yes'm, but that ain’t got nothing

dialog: Yup.

speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: REE (cont'd)
text: He’s lying in a crappy grave
dialog: somewhere or become piles of shit

speaker_heading: SATTERFIELD
dialog: And you know this how?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: You must’ve heard what Dolly’s are,

speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I didn’t know nothing. They told me
dialog: everything after.
speaker_heading: SATTERFIELD
dialog: Well, he was short on his bond.
dialog: Then this fella comes in the office
dialog: one evening, got him a sack full of

speaker_heading: REE
dialog: How long before we get kicked off

speaker_heading: SATTERFIELD
dialog: I reckon...I reckon y'all got this

dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: REE

speaker_heading: SATTERFIELD

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: That idea has been said already.
dialog: Got any others?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Help me. Ain’t nobody said that
dialog: idea yet, have they?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I tried to help you some before,

text: Megan backs away as Thump Milton enters the barn and walks up

text: shooting a look at Merab.
speaker_heading: THUMP MILTON
dialog: You got something to say, child,
dialog: you best say it now.
text: Ree thinks a minute, her eyes locked on Thump.
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I got two kids who can’t feed
dialog: themselves yet. My mom is sick, and
dialog: she’s always gonna be sick. Pretty
dialog: soon the laws are coming and taking
dialog: our house and throwing us out to
dialog: live in the field like dogs.
text: Ree catches her breath.
speaker_heading: REE (CONT'D)
dialog: If Dad has done wrong, Dad has
dialog: paid. And whoever killed him, I
dialog: don’t need to know all that. But I
dialog: can’t forever carry them kids, and
dialog: my mom - not without that house.
dialog: 49.

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: TEARDROP
dialog: You hit her?
text: Spider Milton drops his arm to the small of his back,
text: wrapping his hand around the gun tucked into his pants.
text: Merab steps up to Teardrop.
speaker_heading: MERAB
dialog: He never! No man here touched that
dialog: crazy girl. I put the hurt on her.
dialog: Me and my sisters, they was here
dialog: too.
text: Thump Milton walks back into the barn flanked by Ray and
text: Bobby. He stops within an arm’s length of Teardrop.
speaker_heading: TEARDROP
dialog: What Jessup done was against our
dialog: ways, he knew it, I know it, and I
dialog: ain’t raised no stink at all about
dialog: whatever became of him. But she
dialog: ain’t my brother.
text: Teardrop looks around the gathering, finally locking eyes
text: with Ree before concluding his case.
speaker_heading: TEARDROP (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s about all the close family I
dialog: got left, so I'll be collecting her
dialog: now and carrying her on out of here
dialog: to home. That suit you, Thump?
speaker_heading: THUMP MILTON
dialog: You're gonna stand for her, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: TEARDROP
dialog: If she does wrong, you can put it
dialog: on me.
text: Ree registers the gravity of this commitment on Teardrop’s
dialog: part.
speaker_heading: THUMP MILTON
dialog: She’s now yours to answer for.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: TEARDROP

speaker_heading: TEARDROP (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TEARDROP (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SONYA

speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Ree Dolly
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Nice to meet you. So, what brought
dialog: you down here today, Ree?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I wanted to find out more about the
dialog: forty thousand dollars I get for
dialog: signing up.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Well, that’s a good reason for
dialog: joining, but why don’t you give me
dialog: three better reasons for joining.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK (cont'd)
dialog: Because once you join up, there’s
dialog: no turning back, and it might not
dialog: be worth forty thousand dollars to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Well, the main reason is I need the
dialog: money. It’d be nice to travel, I
dialog: suppose.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: You know, five years is a long
dialog: commitment.
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Well, how long before I get the
dialog: money?
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Well, after you sign up it would be
dialog: anywhere between fourteen weeks to
dialog: eighty-two weeks.
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Well, how come it doesn’t say that
dialog: on the poster?
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Probably a clerical error, or it
dialog: just wasn’t on there. It might
dialog: have been in fine print at the
dialog: bottom. Do you mind me asking,
dialog: what happened to your eye and your
dialog: lip?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I fell off my bike.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Fell off a bike? Well, um, how old
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Seventeen.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: You're seventeen. OK. Now, if
dialog: this is something you really wanted
dialog: to do, we’d have to bring Mom and
dialog: Dad in on this, OK.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I can sign for myself.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Not at seventeen you can’t. At
dialog: seventeen you’re still considered a
dialog: minor by the U. S. Government. OK?
dialog: You have to be eighteen to sign up.
dialog: Would it be a problem getting Mom
dialog: and Dad in here? I mean, I can
dialog: come out to you guys’ house and-
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: My mom’s sick. My dad’s gone.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Well, do you have any brothers or
dialog: sisters that might be able to help?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I got a little brother and a little
dialog: sister, twelve and six.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Well, who’s taking care of them
dialog: right now?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I am.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: You are? Is that why you need the
dialog: forty thousand dollars?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Yes sir.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Well, it sounds like it might be a
dialog: bigger challenge just to stay home,
dialog: you know, and actually take care of
dialog: your brother and sister. Because
dialog: you know you’re not going to be
dialog: able to take them with you to
dialog: training, right?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: I thought maybe I could.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Not right at the beginning. Plus,
dialog: you wouldn’t be able to have them
dialog: when you’re actually in the active
dialog: duty army. Because who’s going to
dialog: be there to take care of them if
dialog: you have to go off and actually
dialog: fight?
text: Ree falls silent.
speaker_heading: SGT. SCHALK (CONT’D)
dialog: So it sounds like right now, you
dialog: need to buckle up and stay home.
dialog: It’s going to take a lot of
dialog: backbone and a lot of courage to
dialog: stay home, but that I think is what
dialog: you need to do right at this point.
dialog: OK? Now, something might change
dialog: here in the next year or so. You
dialog: might decide this is what you want
dialog: to do, you know? But don’t take it
dialog: lightly, and don’t do it just for
dialog: the money. You need to have a good
dialog: reason to do this, OK?
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: OK.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
dialog: Alright. Well, it was nice meeting
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REE
dialog: Nice meeting you.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHALK
