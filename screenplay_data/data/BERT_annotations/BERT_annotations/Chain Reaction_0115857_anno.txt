speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: SHOT - CHICAGO SKYLINE - DAY
text: Muted, gray skies, the buildings seem drained of their
text: color. A sound of wind, softly rising, and then - what's
text: this? - the skyline starts to waver, ever so slightly and
text: the image is broken by tiny droplets and then, suddenly,
text: split apart with the roar of a
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE
text: plowing through a street puddle into whose surface
text: reflection we have been looking. As the surface reforms
text: itself, we BEGIN TITLES.
speaker_heading: EDDIE KOPEK
text: Rides the motorcycle, a pack on his back. He is in his
text: late twenties, working class and street smart, dodging
text: traffic, making time. And getting wet; it's raining.
scene_heading: NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Away from the proud high-rises of downtown, going to
text: seed. Eddie passes through on his bike.
scene_heading: EXT. STEEL MILL - DAY
text: A line of huge blast furnaces, rusting and abandoned.
text: Eddie steers the motorcycle past them to the one small
text: island of life - a few cars parked at the edge of a vast
text: empty lot - and pulls to a stop. He gets off, splashes
text: across the lot toward the mill entrance. He enters.
scene_heading: INT. STEEL MILL - DAY
dialog: No ordinary mill: it's been converted into a high tech
text: lab, holding tanks, mainframe computers, experimental
text: devices. A dozen TECHNICIANS are at work, drawn from
text: across the world - brown, yellow, black, white skins ina
text: casual mix and comfortable style that belies the high
text: seriousness of purpose in the lab.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: nods as he passes techies at work in cubicles, stops at
text: an office, reaches into his coat and draws out a comic
text: book, slides it onto the desk of CHEN, about forty. Chen
text: looks up from his work:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: New Spawn?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Just out.
text: He continues down the hall, nearly running over LILY
text: NAUGHTON, roughly Eddie's age. She's wearing a lab coat
text: over her jeans, the kind of woman who would be stunning
dialog: if she took even a minute to think about it, which she
text: doesn't. Mostly she thinks about her work (she runs the
text: lab as Chen's assistant), and when she isn't thinking
text: about that, she thinks about the long backpacking trips
text: she wishes she had more time to take.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Do you have the new nozzle?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Right here.
text: He sets his pack down, begins rummaging through it.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Do we have a computer model?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: This doesn't make her happy:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You'll have to make one. We're
dialog: testing at four thirty.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I haven't had time...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Make time. We're not going to
dialog: test without the model. Haven't
dialog: we gone through this before?
text: Eddie pulls the new nozzle from his pack. But when he
text: proudly raises it for Lily to inspect, she's already
text: gone, moving down the hall. He says, to himself:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: ...It was a hand job.
speaker_heading: LAB AREA - CONSOLE
text: Lily and Chen stand before the console. Chen speaks into
text: a microphone in thickly accented English:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Okay, data recorders and
dialog: confirm.
text: A row of green lights illuminate one by one on the
text: console. The TV monitors flicker, then images of the
text: lab's machinery appear on various screens.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Main stage pressure, forty five
text: sixty by the mark. Fire and
dialog: safety lines to condition "A".
text: Chen glances over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: We have a green board.
scene_heading: LAB AREA - WATER TANK
text: empty. Small jets spray water into the tank and it
text: begins to fill. The wavery image of Ernest
text: Bucholtz (BUCKY) appears through the water. He's nearing
text: seventy, a grand old eccentric man of science in rumpled
text: tweeds, drawing peanuts from one pocket of his coat,
text: munching absent mindedly and dropping the shells in the
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Let's begin.
text: He turns toward Chen and Lily, waves an imaginary baton,
text: as if he were leading an orchestra.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Main power.
speaker_heading: TECHIE
text: standing near a bank of capacitors, throws a switch. The
text: building begins to hum.
speaker_heading: TANK
text: Small bubbles appear at the edges of the electrodes
text: ringing the tank.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Injector...
text: A techie throws a switch as Eddie peers closely at the
text: injector he's recently installed.
speaker_heading: TUBES
text: as mercury-like beads of catalyst enter and rise to
text: valves which begin releasing catalyst into the tank.
text: Eddie smiles in satisfaction. A bell rings, and another
text: figure appears beside Bucky -
text: TONY SHANNON, in his fifties, smoothly confident, a
text: private foundation executive equally at home in the lab
text: and in the board room. At the sound of the bell, he puts
text: on dark glasses.
text: Then he notices a pair perched atop Bucky's head. He
text: slides them down over Bucky's face.
text: The others in the lab put their glasses on.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Activate the laser.
text: A techie flips a huge switch and a
speaker_heading: LASER DEVICE
text: glows brightly, sending beams toward a series of mirrors,
text: which reflect the beams into the tank from different
dialog: directions.
speaker_heading: LILY
text: peers at the tank through her dark glasses as the water
text: inside begins to roil. She crosses to the computer
text: readout and begins making notes on a chart she carries.
speaker_heading: HYDROGEN TUBES
text: leading to a holding tank carry two ping pong balls,
text: which rise toward the tank as hydrogen flows and the
scene_heading: BURN OFF CONTAINER
text: ignites, sending a pure blue flame forward.
scene_heading: THE WATER TANK
text: begins to shudder as the water roils dangerously. Lily,
text: Eddie, and now Shannon are mesmerized as the shuddering
text: increases; Shannon turns quizzically to Bucky, who seems
text: to be waiting, waiting... then Bucky motions to Chen, as
text: if he were cueing the horn section.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Cavitation sound waves...
text: A techie at the console moves a control forward and a hum
text: emanates from the nozzle in the water tank, reducing the
text: shuddering and causing the water to glow an eerie blue...
text: Eddie peers expectantly at his nozzle.
speaker_heading: LILY
text: watching the Energy In and Energy Out meters on the
text: console: the Energy Out meter rises slowly. Chen reads
dialog: from the meters:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: We have a split. Output ratio
dialog: at point three... output ratio
dialog: at point four...
text: Lily crosses to a bank of computers, spewing printouts in
text: various graph forms. She studies them as Chen continues:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Output ratio at point five...
speaker_heading: BLAST FURNACE
text: ignites: a smallish flame in the huge burner. Shannon
text: turns, stares into the fire but BUCKY seems mesmerized by
text: the bubbling water.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Point six...
speaker_heading: ENERGY METERS
text: The Energy Out meter stops its climb.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Holding at point six...
text: It actually drops a little.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Point five five...
text: Disappointment an Shannon's face. He turns to Bucky,
text: still mesmerized by the activity in the water tank.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: ...and holding at point six...
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Shut it down.
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: System shut off.
text: The techies respond; the system shuts off, the flame in
text: the blast furnace falters, leaving the lab in silence.
text: Bucky is deep in thought, absently munching on his
text: peanuts. At last, Shannon speaks up:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Pizza's on me.
text: TITLES END as Bucky shuffles back toward the offices.
speaker_heading: OFFICE AREA
text: A stack of pizza boxes on a main desk, Shannon, Chen,
text: Lily and Eddie sit eating. Eddie is busily sketching on
text: his pad, Bucky is pacing nearby.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: It's music.
text: The others turn to him.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Isn't that odd? We deal in
dialog: science, but in the end the
dialog: answers come to us from art.
text: Shannon rolls his unlit cigar in his fingers.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What do you mean, Bucky?
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: I want to change the frequency
dialog: of the acoustic nozzle. Can we
dialog: build a device which gives us a
dialog: variable frequency, Eddie?
text: Eddie is sketching, looks up from his pad.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (thinks: )
dialog: Sure. Why not?
text: He flips to another page, begins sketching, absently.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: We need to think like children
dialog: making music. Excite the water
text: with music.
text: The others stare at him, not getting his meaning. Bucky
dialog: turns to Shannon:
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Are you worried Mr. Shannon?
dialog: Shannon grins:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: But your foundation is spending
dialog: a fortune on us. The least we
dialog: can do is worry you.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: That's very thoughtful of you.
dialog: Thank you.
text: Bucky pats him on the back.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: We're close. We're very close.
text: He turns to the others:
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: We learned something very
dialog: important today. We found
dialog: another way that doesn't work.
text: He waves, shuffles off, lost in thought again as Shannon
text: stares after him. Chen stands, stretches.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Lily, take a break. We go back
dialog: over it tomorrow.
text: Lily looks up from the computer readouts she's studying.
text: She's puzzled:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We're missing some input here...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (not looking up:)
dialog: I'll have it tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, it's not the nozzle, it's...
text: But Chen folds the printout, won't let her read.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Tomorrow, Lily.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Shannon emerges, finally lights his cigar, crosses to his
text: car. He sees Eddie moving toward his motorcycle.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie how are the classes
dialog: coming?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Pretty good.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Are you keeping up? Doing the
dialog: reading?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Mostly.
text: Shannon eyes him skeptically. Eddie grins.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Some.
text: Shannon opens Eddie's saddle bag, pulls out a half dozen
dialog: comics: X-Men, Spawn, Gen 13.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Part of the curriculum?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I've been trading with Chen.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Trading for what?
text: Eddie hands him a book from the same saddle bag:
dialog: Fundamentals of Physics.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Good. You understand this
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Chen does. He doesn't
dialog: understand that stuff.
text: He means the comics. Shannon smiles, waves, and crosses
text: to his car; Eddie fires up the bike.
text: And as he drives out of the lot, we HEAR, VOICE OVER:
speaker_heading: BUCKY (V.0.)
dialog: We have reached a new stage in
dialog: the history of man - a stage in
dialog: which the limits of the past can
dialog: simply be discarded as old ways
dialog: of thinking...
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - DAY
text: Various shots: the halls of learning, students crossing
text: to their classes. Bucky's voice over continues:
speaker_heading: BUCKY (V.0.)
dialog: We are within sight of an age
dialog: old dream of mankind. we will
dialog: soon have the capacity for all
dialog: peoples in all nations to
dialog: extinguish poverty. Simply
dialog: snuff it out, the way we've
dialog: conquered smallpox, or polio.
dialog: And what is the source of this
dialog: new wealth?
scene_heading: SHOT - WATER GLASS
dialog: half full. We are in Bucky's
scene_heading: CLASSROOM - DAY
text: and Bucky dramatically empties the glass into a tank and
text: places it on a small table top, where in a vastly
text: simplified fashion, he has recreated his experimental
text: device. The tank is bubbling, storing its oxygen and
text: hydrogen in small holding containers.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Water. H20. Two parts
dialog: hydrogen, one part oxygen. A
dialog: rather simple matter to separate
dialog: the two elements... we've done
dialog: it here. But here's the rub:
dialog: the energy required to make the
dialog: split, as we say, is for now
dialog: greater than the energy we
dialog: derive from the separated parts.
dialog: But, see the power of the energy
dialog: we have created...
text: Bucky crosses to a small tank of hydrogen, turns a valve,
text: lights a match... and BOOM - a small explosion startles
dialog: the
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
text: watching in fascination. Nervous laughter. Bucky grins
text: slyly.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: It is, after all, the power that
dialog: destroyed the famous blimp
dialog: Hindenburg. But what happens
dialog: when we have learned how to
dialog: separate those elements in a way
dialog: that requires very little
dialog: energy? I will give you the
dialog: answer. We will transform the
dialog: world. Think of it: fire from
dialog: water... We will have an
dialog: inexhaustible resource. For
text: water is everywhere, and it
dialog: doesn't matter whether it's
text: clean or dirty, salty or fresh.
dialog: And here's the truly exciting
dialog: part. It's a completely non
dialog: polluting resource as well. For
dialog: what happens when you burn
dialog: hydrogen? You get a waste
dialog: product that is... water.
text: And now Bucky drinks the collected water from the glass
text: he has placed on the table at the beginning of the
dialog: demonstration, and his
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
text: laugh and burst into applause as the CAMERA moves up and
text: back and finds Eddie, in the back row, a dozen empty rows
text: between him and the rest of the class. Sketching.
speaker_heading: BUCKY (V.0.)
dialog: But if we put an end to
dialog: pollution, perhaps we may also
dialog: put an end to war.
scene_heading: EDDIE'S SKETCH PAD
text: A new acoustic nozzle takes form under Eddie's pen...
speaker_heading: BUCKY (V.0.)
dialog: For what is war, but an old idea
dialog: derived from the notion that we
dialog: must choose between my security
dialog: and yours. Why should it be me
dialog: or you? Why not both of us?
dialog: All of us? With a plentiful
dialog: supply of clean energy, we don't
dialog: have to choose at all. Truly,
dialog: we can all live like...
dialog: billionaires.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: ...and as we pull back from the pad, we see we are in
text: Eddie's basement, crammed with gear, tools, gadgets, and
text: especially, sound equipment. Eddie puts a prototype
text: nozzle in place, switches on his amplifier...
speaker_heading: BUCKY (V.0.)
dialog: (continued)
dialog: This glass contains not only
dialog: water, but a command, a demand,
dialog: that we develop new ways of
dialog: thinking, new ways of looking at
dialog: the world, new ways of being
dialog: human...
text: ...and a low, rumbling HUMMMM emanates from Eddie's
dialog: speakers as we CUT TO
scene_heading: EXT. EDDIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT .
dialog: A working class neighborhood; the house practically
text: vibrates on its foundation from the SOUND pouring out of
text: Eddie's basement, drowning out Bucky's lecture and we CUT
speaker_heading: TO
scene_heading: INT. MILL - EDDIE'S WORK AREA - DAY
text: As Eddie shapes his new nozzle on his lathe, carefully
text: crafting the nozzle's horn, feeling it with his fingers,
dialog: and there is
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: peering over Eddie's shoulder at the work, until Eddie
text: turns off the lathe. Chen runs his fingers over the
text: nozzle, checking it out.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You have made your model?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Lily gonna shoot you. What means
dialog: necroplasmic goo?
text: Eddie removes his safety goggles, looks at Chen blankly.
dialog: Chen reads from his Spawn comic:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: "His identity was now forever
text: lost, exchanged for an unholy
dialog: shell of necroplasmic goo."
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Sort of tired blood.
dialog: (pause)
text: But clotted.
text: Chen doesn't get it.
scene_heading: INT. MILL - LAB AREA - DAY
text: Eddie is slumped inside the water tank, the door open,
text: installing the acoustic nozzle.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie... can I interrupt?
text: Eddie looks up.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: This is Doctor Collier.
text: COLLIER has a wide grin for Eddie. He is in his fifties,
text: outgoing and confident, wearing a dark suit.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Hello, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie's our machinist. He makes
text: the gadgets the rest of the crew
dialog: get to play with. what have you
dialog: got here?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: A new acoustic nozzle.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: We're treating the water with
dialog: sound, hoping to make the
dialog: hydrogen separation more
dialog: economical. We also use a
dialog: catalyst for the same purpose.
dialog: The two work together. Ah. Dr.
dialog: Buchaltz, Dr. Collier...
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: A great pleasure: I've been
dialog: looking forward to meeting you.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Dr. Collier is evaluating
dialog: research programs for the Office
dialog: of Technology Assessment in
dialog: Washington.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: So much waste in government
dialog: programs, Dr. Bucholtz. I've
dialog: been wanting to see how your
dialog: program runs on private funding.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Well, stick around. You can see
dialog: if it runs at all.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'd be delighted!
speaker_heading: CONSOLE
text: as the board lights up. Chen leans into the microphone:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: We have a green board.
speaker_heading: WATER TANK
text: The jets spray water into the tank. Collier watches,
dialog: fascinated. We HEAR CHEN:
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Main power.
text: Bubbles appear in the tank, near the electrodes.
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Injector...
text: Bucky is in his customary deepthink. Shannon rolls his
text: unlit cigar back and forth between his fingers. The bell
text: rings and Shannon has to slip Bucky's dark glasses down
text: from their spot on the top of his head.
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.O.)
dialog: Laser...
speaker_heading: LASER
text: fires its beams at the mirrors. The water in the tank
text: begins to roil.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
text: watches... watches... then cues Chen.
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Cavitation sound waves...
text: Eddie moves closer to the tank, peers down through the
text: water at the new nozzle.
speaker_heading: CHEN AND LILY
text: At the console:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: We have a split. Output ratio
dialog: at point three... output ratio
dialog: at point four...
text: Lily crosses to the computer printouts.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Output ratio at point five...
speaker_heading: BLAST FURNACE
text: ignites. Collier turns his face to the fire.
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Point six...
speaker_heading: ENERGY METERS
text: The Energy Out meter rises.
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.O.)
dialog: Point seven...
text: Still rising. A new note of excitement in Chen's voice:
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Point eight...
text: Eddie turns to Bucky, but Bucky is absently shelling
text: peanuts, watching the water tank.
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Point nine... and one!
text: Lily drops the printout, turns, trying to make eye
dialog: contact with someone, anyone...
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: One point two... one point
dialog: three...
speaker_heading: METERS
text: The Energy In meter falls rapidly now, the Energy out
text: rising. And suddenly the
speaker_heading: BLAST FURNACE
text: fires into a giant flame, a huge WHOMP that startles the
text: techies; all eyes on the furnace now:
speaker_heading: CHEN (V.0.)
dialog: Two... two point one...
text: Collier and Bucky turn to the fire now, reflected flames
text: dancing in their dark glasses.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: can't contain his glee. He practically runs to the
text: console, so he can see the meters registering this
dialog: amazing output.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Two point five... two point
dialog: six...
speaker_heading: BUCKY
text: looks up, as if from a dream, peers around the room.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Shut it down.
text: But in the roar of the furnace, the stunned techies don't
text: hear him. He shouts:
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Shut it down!
text: Chen manages to look up from the meters, realizes that
text: Bucky is shouting at him.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: System shut off!
text: The techies scramble to their tasks; the flame in the
text: furnace sputters out, the hum of machinery quiets. In
text: the silence that follows, no one moves. It is Bucky who
dialog: finally speaks:
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Who brought the marshmallows?
text: The entire lab erupts in a joyous whoop.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Champagne and pizza; the techies are in a party mood,
text: music over the speakers. Lily has a full glass, an
text: instamatic in her hand.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Excuse me... Eddie, will you
dialog: take a shot of us?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sure.
text: She slips her arm around Chen, smiles hugely for the
text: camera. Eddie shoots.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Let's get everybody. Hey,
dialog: everybody! Let's get a shot!
dialog: Oh, Mr. Shannon.
text: She puts her arms around Shannon; she's a little tipsy:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: I just... I... thank you. I am
dialog: so thrilled!
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Bucky stands in the cold night air, shelling peanuts.
text: Collier crosses to his side.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Doctor Bucholtz...
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Bucky.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Bucky. May I shake your hand?
dialog: I'll never forget this day.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Yes, a big day.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: How long before you'll be ready
dialog: to announce your findings?
dialog: Weeks? Months?
text: Bucky chews thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Well. I suppose it belongs to
dialog: the world, now. I think I'll
dialog: just send it out on the
dialog: internet.
text: And as Collier registers his surprise, Eddie emerges from
dialog: the lab. He calls:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Bucky? They want you for a
dialog: picture.
scene_heading: INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT
text: The techies have gathered in a group, champagne bottles
text: in hand, silly grins plastered on their faces. Lily is
text: arranging them for the shot as Eddie sets up the camera
text: on a makeshift tripod.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Okay, Mr. Shannon here, Chen,
dialog: over there - oh, wait, no...
text: She's flushed with excitement.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, it doesn't matter, just
dialog: anywhere... Bucky, you have to
dialog: be in the middle. Do we have
dialog: everybody?
text: She counts noses. Collier emerges from the shadows:
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Why don't I take the picture?
dialog: Eddie, you should be in there.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, right, Eddie... of course.
dialog: Forgive me.
text: As if it never occurred to her. Eddie crosses to Bucky's
text: side. Bucky turns to him, grins:
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Congratulations, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Thank you. Congratulations to
dialog: you.
text: And now Lily is at Bucky's side, inserting herself
dialog: between Bucky and Eddie:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Bucky, I'm so proud. Ever since
dialog: I was a child, I dreamed of
dialog: something like this. I never
dialog: imagined it would happen so
dialog: soon.
text: And she slips her arm around him, plants a big kiss on
text: his cheek as Eddie grins wryly to himself and a
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: from the camera as Collier snaps the picture:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, wait: I was... You have to
dialog: take another one:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Eddie emerges from the lab, crosses to his bike. Not far
text: away, we HEAR the grinding of an engine. Eddie stops,
text: peers through the darkness, then crosses to a car, raps
dialog: an the window.
speaker_heading: LILY
text: looks up, puzzled.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Won't start.
text: Eddie scans the dashboard.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're out of gas.
text: She peers at the gauge.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You shouldn't drive, anyway.
dialog: Come on, I'll take you home.
speaker_heading: LILY AND EDDIE
text: cross the parking lot. It's cold, and she huddles in her
text: thin coat.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where do you live?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Kimbark and 54th.
text: She's giddy and a little drunk.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: How come I don't know you
dialog: better? Are you shy? Or am I
dialog: just a snob?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're a snob.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I bet you're smart, though.
dialog: Shannon wouldn't hire you if you
dialog: weren't.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Could've made a mistake.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, even so. You should be
dialog: proud. It takes everyone working
dialog: together to do a thing like
dialog: this. Just being on the team
dialog: is... it's a great thing, don't
dialog: you think? Even if you're
dialog: not... you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I know exactly what you mean.
text: They're standing at a bus stop.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Where are you parked?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Back there. I have a
dialog: motorcycle.
text: She turns, looks back into the parking lot. The bus
text: arrives, Eddie boards. He holds out his hand for her:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You'd freeze to death.

speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Big excitement today. You think
dialog: it happen?
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Not so soon.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: You tell Shannon it happen soon.
text: Bucky grins.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Sometimes it's better to be
dialog: lucky than good.
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: Ah.
text: A NOISE from another part of the lab.
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Someone still here?
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: I think we got rats. They gonna
dialog: eat our tubing.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: A bus moves through the late night streets.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: And in the nearly deserted bus, Eddie and Lily sit side
dialog: by side.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What do you carry in your bag?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Burglar's tools.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Okay, I am a snob. I can't help
dialog: it. You probably have a great
text: novel in there.
text: He pulls out a fistful of comics. Wrong again.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Why do you read these things?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm corrupting Chen. Making a
dialog: real American out of him.
text: Eddie pulls out his book on Physics, begins reading. She
text: looks at him oddly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Have you read it?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Ages ago.
text: He hands it to her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go ahead. Test me. Ask me
dialog: anything in there.
text: Lily eyes him with new interest. She opens the book,
text: skims a chapter or two.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (reads: )
dialog: Let the potential difference
text: between the inner shell of a Van
dialog: de Graaff accelerator and the
dialog: point at which charges are
text: sprayed onto the moving
dialog: belt be 3.40 MV. If the belt
dialog: transfers charge to the shell at
dialog: the rate of 2.80 mO0C/5, what
dialog: minimum power must be provided
dialog: to drive the belt?
text: Pause as Eddie considers the question. Then:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Ask me something else.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well come on, you picked the
dialog: hardest chapter.
scene_heading: INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT
text: Chen is on his hands and knees, baiting a rat trap with
text: cheese. He delicately slides the trap under a jutting
dialog: corner...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CHEN
text: ...and we watch him as if through the eyes of an observer
dialog: as
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: takes another trap and baits it, carefully sets it,
text: creeps toward us, slides the trap slowly, slowly... and a
text: sudden BANG... startles Chen and sends
speaker_heading: BUCKY
text: to the doorway, peering into the shadowy lab:
speaker_heading: BUCKY
dialog: Chen?
text: Chen looks up sheepishly: he's accidentally sprung the
text: trap. When he speaks, it's in his native Chinese:
speaker_heading: CHEN
dialog: (untranslated)
dialog: Cocksucker.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: Eddie is reading from the physics text, using his hands
dialog: to illustrate the problem:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: See, you have this tuning fork
text: attached to a stretched wire,
dialog: and it generates transverse
text: waves. The vibration of the
dialog: fork is perpendicular to the
dialog: wire. Its frequency is 400 Hz
dialog: and the amplitude of its
text: oscillation is 0.50 mm...
text: He turns to Lily, who's out like a light, snoring gently
text: against his shoulder. Eddie puts the book away, peers
text: out the window.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Hey. This is us.
scene_heading: EXT. LILY'S STREET - NIGHT
text: Eddie half carries Lily up the stairs to her apartment.
text: She's leaning into him, speaking into his neck.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Big key for this one. Little
text: key inside.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Can you stand up while I do
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No problema.
text: He lets her go to fiddle with the key, has to grab her as
text: she sags to her knees...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Little problema.
scene_heading: INT. LILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.
text: Eddie helps Lily inside.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Bedroom?
dialog: She points.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Do you think I'm too serious?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not right now.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You understand why we need the
dialog: specs, don't you?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yes.
text: He drops her gently onto the bed. Swings her feet up.
text: Slips her shoes off.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Poor Lily. She's too serious.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Who says?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Everybody. Never finda
dialog: husband.
text: He can't help noticing the half dozen or so framed
speaker_heading: DIPLOMAS
text: not hung but propped modestly on an overflowing book
dialog: shelf: a BA from South Africa, graduate degrees from
dialog: schools in London, Paris, science awards from Sydney, the
dialog: Planck Institute. She's a heavy hitter.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You've been around.
text: But she's already asleep, her arms curled around her
dialog: pillow for comfort.
scene_heading: INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT
text: Chen has baited his last trap, is down on his hands and
text: knees, sliding it carefully under some tubing. He
text: pushes, pushes, can't quite get it where he wants it, has
dialog: to slide it through a small opening without the damn
text: thing going off... pushes ever so gently... ah. That's
dialog: it.
text: He's gotten his hands and clothes dirty from trying to
text: position the trap. Still on his knees, he dusts himself
text: off, then rises slowly, looks up...
text: Something he sees startles the hell out of him.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: Eddie is back on the bus. Peering out the window,
text: thinking about Lily. Smiling.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT
text: The bus pulls up and Eddie alights, heads for his bike
text: parked in the lot.
speaker_heading: BIKE
text: Eddie hops on, fires it up, pulls slowly past the
text: entrance to the mill lab...
speaker_heading: DOOR
text: is slightly open, lights shining dimly from the inside.
text: Eddie stops. Considers for a moment.
text: Then he turns the bike off. He crosses to the door,
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. MILL - NIGHT
text: Eddie enters. Listens for a beat; then says, under his
dialog: breath:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Anybody home?
text: He crosses to the office area, sees a light shining from
text: the back - Bucky's office. He crosses.
text: And he pokes his head into
scene_heading: BUCKY'S OFFICE
text: where Bucky's feet are visible, propped on the computer
text: stand behind his desk, his head obscured by the high back
text: of the chair in which he sits.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Bucky?
text: No answer. Bucky's computer is on, the screen casting a
text: dim, green glow into the small office.
dialog: Eddie repeats:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Bucky? You awake?
text: Still no answer. Eddie crosses to the chair, and what he
text: sees hits him like a hard blow to his chest, taking his
dialog: breath away:...
speaker_heading: BUCKY
text: is slumped in the chair, his face blue, a plastic bag
text: tied tightly over his head and plastered to his skin with
text: his last inhalation of breath.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, my god: Oh, Jesus...
text: He yanks the bag off Bucky's head with such force that
text: Bucky's inert body falls from the chair onto the floor.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Oh, Jesus, Bucky!
text: He's down on the floor with Bucky, holding the old man's
text: head back, breathing into his mouth.
text: And then he begins pumping Bucky's chest.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Oh, Bucky, come on... come on...
text: He breathes into his mouth again, pumps his chest, but
dialog: it's useless.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Oh, shit, oh shit!
text: He scrambles up, searches wildly for a phone, lifts the
text: receiver: the line is dead. The cord dangles loosely to
dialog: the floor.
text: Eddie darts out of the room into the
speaker_heading: HALL
text: walking quickly to another office, tries the phone there:
text: the cord is cut.
text: He stands for a moment, trying to make sense of this,
text: then his face darkens. He sniffs... He raises his head,
text: sniffs again...
speaker_heading: LAB AREA
text: Eddie races in: a soft HISSING SOUND coming from
text: somewhere in the lab. He moves into the lab searching
dialog: for it's source, stops suddenly:
scene_heading: HYDROGEN STORAGE TANK...
text: is spilling hydrogen into the lab, it's valve wide open.
text: Eddie turns, almost stumbles, past an oxygen storage tank
dialog: nearby:
scene_heading: OXYGEN STORAGE TANK
text: is also hissing, sending a lethal mixture into the lab.
text: Eddie tries to turn the valve shut but it spins uselessly
text: under his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: An unmarked van, bland, white, pulls to a stop an the
text: bridge. The door on the driver's side opens and a pair of
text: booted feet emerge into the night. In the distance, we
text: can see the hulking mill in the dim light.
scene_heading: INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT
text: Eddie is frozen with fear. The HISSING SOUND is louder
text: now, but perhaps it is just in Eddie's brain. Slowly, he
text: begins making his way out of the lab...
scene_heading: EXT. MILL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: ...and once outside, he runs. He grabs the bike, fearful
text: of starting it so near the lab, he pushes it, sweating,
text: until he is willing to gamble. He lets out the clutch
text: and the EXHAUST sputters with a blue flame and EDDIE
text: cringes, expecting an explosion, but there is none. He
text: slips into low gear, speeds on a straight away, tearing
text: through the night as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: as the booted figure we saw earlier slides the panel door
text: open, reaches for a small detonator resting on the rear
text: seat. He holds the detonator in both hands as
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: puts his head down and roars away and
speaker_heading: THE DETONATOR
text: is plunged down. From our view on the bridge...
speaker_heading: THE MILL
text: erupts in a violent explosion that suggests a mighty
text: bomb, sending huge pieces of debris into the air anda
scene_heading: ROLLING SHOCK WAVE:
text: that threatens to overtake Eddie on his bike, and finally
text: does, sending him careening into the brush beside the
dialog: road as
text: PIECES OF THE MILL
text: begin to descend like shrapnel on the neighborhood,
text: raining destruction from the winter night sky...
speaker_heading: A BOILER
text: crashing through the roof of an American Legion Hall...
speaker_heading: LILY'S CAR
text: rolling like tumbleweed across the parking lot...
speaker_heading: ROW OF HOUSES
text: ignited by flaming shards landing on the peaked roofs,
speaker_heading: and WE CUT TO
speaker_heading: A TELEPHONE
text: ringing in the night once, twice, a hand reaches for it,
dialog: we are in
scene_heading: INT. SHANNON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: as Shannon picks up the phone and says, groggily:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Yes...
text: We can HEAR a torrent of words spoken so loudly, so
text: rapidly, coming through the phone, it almost lifts
text: Shannon to a sitting position.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: ... Eddie?
scene_heading: EXT. MILL SITE - EARLY MORNING
text: Utter devastation: the mill has been leveled, a shroud
text: of thick smoke diffusing the weak winter light and giving
text: an other worldly sense to the scene. Fire department
text: investigators comb the wreckage, as police maintain the
text: barricades set up to keep the crowds of curious away. A
text: television newsreporter (RITA BLISS) is doing a standup,
text: with the smoking ruins in the background:
speaker_heading: RITA
text: The incredible devastation from
dialog: last night's blast is only now
text: becoming apparent, and has left
text: workers at this scene with a
text: sense of utter disbelief.
dialog: Just what was going on here and
dialog: what might have caused the -
dialog: powerful explosion is still not
dialog: clear, although according to
dialog: sources at the university, the
dialog: mill had been converted into a
dialog: site for the experimental
dialog: production of hydrogen fuel. It
dialog: was not, these sources say,
dialog: supposed to be dangerous.
dialog: But tell that to this once
dialog: peaceful neighborhood whose
dialog: quiet was shattered last night.
dialog: And tell that to the dozens of
dialog: local, state and federal
dialog: Investigators who have descended
dialog: on this spot, trying to make
dialog: sense from the bits and pieces
dialog: of what is left...
scene_heading: AGENT RAYMOND FORD
text: a tall, soft spoken man with a hint of New York Irish in
text: his speech moves through the gloom, led by an aide, to a
text: spot where Eddie and Shannon stand.
speaker_heading: AIDE
text: This is agent Raymond Ford from the FBI, Mr. Shannon, who
dialog: runs the Franklin Foundation...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Mr. Shannon.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: ...and Mr. Kopek.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Hello.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You were the one who was here
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We were all here. But yeah, I
dialog: came back later.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: And when you got here, Dr.
dialog: Bucholtz was dead?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: How do you know he was dead,
dialog: son?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: He had a plastic bag over his
dialog: head. He was blue...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Could he have done it himself?
text: Eddie looks offended by the question:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. He wouldn't have.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (to his Aide: )
dialog: Okay, I want everyone who worked
dialog: at the lab in my office. Mr.
dialog: Shannon, if you don't mind, I'd
dialog: like to have you, too. I want a
dialog: search of Dr. Bucholtz' office
dialog: at the University. I want a
dialog: search of Mr. Shannon's
dialog: foundation... Mr. Shannon, I
dialog: hope you'll make this easy for
dialog: us...
text: As he begins to move off, the newsreporter presses him:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Excuse me... Mr. Ford, may I ask
dialog: a few questions...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: No, Ma'am.
text: He moves quickly, but she keeps up:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Do you have any leads?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: No, Ma'am.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Can you tell us why the FBI is
dialog: involved?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ma'am, we just had eight city
dialog: blocks disappear. That's why
dialog: we're involved.
scene_heading: EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY
text: A half dozen TV news trucks are parked nearby as a group

scene_heading: INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI OFFICES - HALLWAY - DAY
text: A madhouse: agents moving back and forth as, inside
text: various offices and cubicles we see the techies and
text: scientists from the lab being interviewed. We FOLLOW a
dialog: secretary into
speaker_heading: FORD'S OFFICE
text: where Ford and other agents are interviewing Shannon:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: They were scientists. Highly
dialog: trained, experts in their field.
dialog: Some technical assistants,
dialog: graduate students, mostly...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Suppose you start from the
dialog: beginning. How many altogether?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I'd have to think...
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICE
text: A large room where Eddie, Lily and a half dozen techies
text: from the lab are undergoing interrogation by a group of
dialog: agents.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'd come back for my bike.
speaker_heading: AGENT GRAY
dialog: You'd taken Miss Naughton home?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AGENT GRAY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: She couldn't get her car
dialog: started. She'd had a little bit
dialog: to drink.
speaker_heading: AGENT GRAY
dialog: You have a relationship with
dialog: Miss Naughton?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. She's a physicist.
text: A blank look from the agent.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: I'm a machinist.
text: He casts an eye across the room at Lily, answering
text: another agent's question. She seems stunned, red eyed
dialog: from lack of sleep.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I was hired by Dr. Chen.
speaker_heading: AGENT MASTERS
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: He was Dr. Bucholtz's project
dialog: manager.
speaker_heading: AGENT MASTERS
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: He's home, I'd imagine.
speaker_heading: AGENT MASTERS
dialog: You have a number for him?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AGENT MASTERS
dialog: Let's get him in here. why did
dialog: he hire you?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Because I'm smart. And I speak
dialog: Chinese.
dialog: AND WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FORDS OFFICE
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I found Dr. Chen in China. He'd
dialog: run into trouble with the
dialog: Chinese authorities. I helped
dialog: arrange for him to come here.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What sort of trouble?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: He was involved in the pro
dialog: democracy movement. Not a good
dialog: thing to be, in China.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: And what about this Kopek guy?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Is he one of your scientists?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: No. But he's good at what he
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What do you know about him?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I've known him for a long time.
dialog: Dad was a plumber, and thena
dialog: union official. He had a union
dialog: scholarship to college, but he
dialog: had to leave school...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (shrugs: )
dialog: I think he was having problems.
dialog: Spent a couple years in the
dialog: army. I ran into him again
text: working in a machine shop. He
dialog: was good and I hired him.
dialog: AND WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION OFFICES - DAY
text: A pair of agents are with Shannon's worried secretary:
speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: These are the entire foundation
dialog: offices?.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: In Chicago, yes. We have other
dialog: offices in Washington.
speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: And the personnel at the lab
dialog: were technically employees of
dialog: the foundation?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: Can you show us the personnel
dialog: files?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: They're over here. That drawer.
scene_heading: INT. CHEN'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The door opens and two FBI agents enter, followed by the

speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: where yesterday's dishes remain in the sink, unwashed.
text: The super appears in the kitchen doorway:
speaker_heading: AGENT GRAY
dialog: When's the last time you saw
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: SUPER
dialog: Yesterday.
speaker_heading: AGENT GRAY
dialog: What time?
speaker_heading: SUPER
dialog: He go to work same time,

dialog: Always said hello.
speaker_heading: FORDS OFFICE
text: Ford's phone rings. Ford picks up:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ford... yeah. Okay. Find him.
text: He hangs up, turns to Shannon.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Your Doctor Chen is missing.
text: Shannon can't fathom this; he holds Ford's stare with his

scene_heading: EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - EVENING
text: Eddie emerges, is immediately engulfed in a shouting mob
dialog: of reporters:
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Can you tell us what's going on
dialog: up there?... Excuse me, sir...
dialog: Do they have any suspects?...
dialog: Was it a bomb?... Who are they
dialog: talking to?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know anything. I'm
dialog: sorry.
text: He makes his way through the mob, but they've already
text: spotted someone else coming out of the door: it's
speaker_heading: LILY
text: nearly overwhelmed as the horde descends an her:
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Miss, would you speak to us?...
dialog: Pardon me, who are you?...
dialog: What's happening up there?...Was

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don't know. I don't know
dialog: anything, please...
text: She makes it to the curb, looks up for a cab, finds Eddie
text: standing on the steps of a bus:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Need a ride?
text: The mob of microphones and cameras stalks her. It only

dialog: AND WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: SHOT - TELEVISION SET
text: A press conference, with Ford at the microphone, backed
text: up by Chicago police and a room jammed with reporters.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We have not ruled out an

dialog: sabotaged...
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: By whom?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We can't say at this point.
speaker_heading: RITA BLISS
dialog: Mr. Ford, we have reports that

speaker_heading: FORD

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm sorry... Dr. Collier is en

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: No. Not at this time. we're

dialog: follows:
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Lily is making herself busy with the dishes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why would he do it?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: He wouldn't. But he looks
dialog: different and he talks different
dialog: and they're going to think he
dialog: did it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where do you think he is?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don't know where he is.
dialog: (pause: something
dialog: occurs to her:)
dialog: You don't think he did it...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. I'm not saying that...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well what are you saying?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm just wondering where he
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: ...because I don't know you very
dialog: well. I've only been here for
dialog: six months. I don't know anyone
dialog: very well. My family isa
dialog: million miles away... and I'm
dialog: scared.
text: Tears start down her cheeks. She tries to wipe them

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: I think you better look at this.

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: That's all you have?... How

speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: It's Kopek's file.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: Had to leave college for

speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: (continued)
text: Broke into a science lab after

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: This is a lie...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LILY
text: It has Chen's name on it, but
dialog: it's not from Chen.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It uses a vernacular he couldn't
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It says I should join him. It
dialog: says the information is in safe
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Join him where?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: In China.
text: She folds the fax, puts it in her pocket. She can barely

dialog: I'm being framed.
text: Silence as Eddie tries to make sense of this. She turns

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SHANNON

speaker_heading: FORD

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I was on the science faculty at

speaker_heading: FORD

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I didn't think it was relevant.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You don't see some small

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FORD

text: A VOICE comes from upstairs:
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: EDDIE'S BEDROOM
text: Schmidt enters with Agent Gray; a couple of cops are in

dialog: Eddie's bureau.
speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
dialog: What've you got?
text: Gray leads him to a small black bag, which they've taken

speaker_heading: BAG

speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Tony we need some help.
text: Someone's trying to frame Lily.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What do you know about the bag,

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What bag?
speaker_heading: SHANNON

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SHANNON

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Meet you there. Get out of

text: He rises, heads to the men's room. She watches him,
text: uncomprehending, until she sees a guy down the bar with
text: the newspaper, casually studying the two of them, looking
text: at the pictures on the front page. He turns, watches as

scene_heading: EXT. BAR - NIGHT
text: The man with the paper watches as Eddie melts into the
text: crowd on the street. He seems unsure, is about to re-
text: enter the bar, when a police car passes slowly.
scene_heading: MAN WITH PAPER
dialog: Hey:
text: He flags the car down, crosses, sticks his head in the
text: window and says something to the cop driving.
scene_heading: EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - NIGHT
text: Eddie moves through the crowd. It's rush hour and the
text: sidewalks are jammed with people buttoned up against the
text: icy blast. A sudden NOISE startles him and we CUT To a
speaker_heading: SQUAD CAR
text: southbound on the Avenue making a screaming U-turn across
text: six lanes of traffic, and sliding to a halt at the curb.
text: Two cops lump out and scan the scene.
text: Eddie tries to disappear into the crowd.
speaker_heading: COPS
text: have spotted him. Eddie breaks into a run, but the
text: sidewalk is too crowded. He darts into the street,
text: running south into oncoming traffic, dodging taxis like a
text: broken field runner. The cops are in pursuit, chasing
text: him down the middle of the street.
text: In the distance are the sounds of APPROACHING SIRENS.
text: Then he hears another noise - the deep bellow of a SHIP'S
text: HORN, and the CLANG CLANG of the traffic barricades
text: coming down on the bridge ahead.
text: He turns: there are squad cars inbound on both side
text: streets. He's cut off. No choice but to make for the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDGE
text: is already in motion as Eddie slides under the crossing
text: arm and leaps onto the deck. One of the pursuing cops is
text: right behind him.
text: Eddie scrambles up the tilting incline, slipping and
text: sliding on the icy surface. The cop isn't doing any
text: better. Desperately, Eddie works his way over to the
text: side rail. He uses it like a ladder to claw his way up.
text: The cop is in reach. He grabs for Eddie - manages a grip
dialog: an Eddie's shoe!
dialog: cop
text: For just the briefest moment, the cop and Eddie hang
text: together - their eyes meet - and in the cop's agonized
text: expression we can see that he's slipping... slipping...
text: until his grip releases and he crashes onto the sidewalk
dialog: below.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
text: The BRIDGE TENDER moves to the window. He can't believe
text: his eyes. There's a man climbing up the side rail.
text: The Tender lunges for the brake lever...
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Eddie makes it to the lip of the rising bascule - now
text: eight stories above the pavement - just as it shudders to
text: a halt.
text: It nearly shakes him loose. Clinging by his fingers, he
text: grips the steel edge of the spar...
text: He looks down and sees a half dozen cops, guns drawn,
text: shouting at him from the pavement below.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
text: Two cops come pounding up the steps, enter the tower.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: How do we get him down?
speaker_heading: TENDER
dialog: I dunno. We move it and well
dialog: shake him loose...
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Alright, don't move it.
dialog: (into his radio: )
dialog: Where the hell's the goddam
dialog: boat?
speaker_heading: TENDER
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
text: The guy who blew up the lab.
speaker_heading: TENDER
dialog: Jesus!
text: He peers out at Eddie. And WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: clinging to the top of the span, barely able to hold an
text: in the icy wind. As he looks up, he finds himself
text: staring into the
speaker_heading: WINDOWS
text: of the skyscrapers bordering Michigan Avenue, now filling
text: with spectators who suddenly find themselves with front
text: row seats for the unexpected drama, their faces awash in
text: the red and blue lights from the police and emergency
text: vehicles below.
text: Eddie manages a toe-hold on the side rail. With a final
text: effort, he inches up on top of the bridge. He looks down:
speaker_heading: COPS
text: have gathered on Michigan Avenue. On the other side of
text: the raised roadway is the open mouth of the lower level -
text: and the icy river, 100 feet below. And in the window,
text: nearly at his own level, a SECRETARY holds a message she
dialog: has scrawled:
dialog: Call me: (312) 555-9795
dialog: Marie
text: A sudden blinding light from below, and WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: STREET
text: where a TV crew has set up for business. Behind them, a
text: crowd gathers, faces turned upward like a field of
text: sunflowers.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - NIGHT
text: A police boat slows to maneuvering speed as it approaches
text: the open span. On the afterdeck, one OFFICER talks into
text: his radio as two other men adjust their fins and wet
dialog: suits.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Marine three-five. We got two
text: divers on deck.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Copy, three-five.
text: He looks up at Eddie, brilliantly lit against the black:
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Alright, bring him down.
dialog: Slowly.
text: The tender moves to his machinery.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The bridge shudders. Eddie is thrown off balance.
scene_heading: EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - NIGHT
text: AS cops and the TV crew look on, Eddie teeters, then
text: disappears. A horrified GASP from the crowd as
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: falling, grabs a pipe running from the upper to the lower
text: level and slides down it like a fireman.
speaker_heading: COPS
text: on Michigan Avenue scatter to the side rails to see if he
text: hit the water.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE
text: Eddie lands on the lower level footbridge. He loses his
text: footing and begins to slide down the steep incline -
text: straight for the grinding gears of the bridge mechanism.
text: Desperately clawing at the side rail, he tries to catch
text: himself before he's caught in the churning gears. But he
dialog: can't hang on.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE MACHINERY ROOM - NIGHT
text: The immense gears interlock, meshing together like the
text: workings of a giant clock. It looks like time has run
text: out as Eddie falls into the machinery...
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
text: The Tender grabs the brake lever...
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE MACHINERY ROOM - NIGHT
text: ...and the bridge shudders to a halt. Several cops rush
text: into the concrete chamber that houses the bridge
text: mechanism. Shining their lights into the gears, they
text: search for Eddie - but there's no sign of him. The cops
dialog: are mystified.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
text: Lily enters, crosses toward the ticket booths:
speaker_heading: LILY
text: The eight fifteen to Madison.
scene_heading: TICKET AGENT
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: One.
text: Lily turns, sees a pair of cops strolling through the
text: station, scanning the crowds. She peers up at the clock:
speaker_heading: CLOCK
text: It's a few minutes past eight. She turns back to the
dialog: ticket agent.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You better make that two..
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE COUNTERWEIGHT - NIGHT
text: The shadows of the bridge structure work in Eddie's favor
text: as he inches along a beam set into the face of the
text: gigantic concrete counterweight. Below him - one false
text: step away - is the empty blackness of the dry well.
text: On the other side, cops are shouting at each other. As
text: their flashlights play across him, he sucks himself into
text: the channel of an I-Beam, and tries not to look down.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
text: Ford comes pounding up the steps, joining the Tender and
text: the two cops.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (showing his badge)
dialog: FBI, Sergeant. Where is he?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Damned if I know.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Let's get the bridge down and
dialog: find him.
speaker_heading: TENDER
dialog: If he's down there in the
dialog: machinery, we'll squash him like
dialog: a bug.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What do you suggest?
speaker_heading: TENDER
dialog: I only work here.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Take it down.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE SUPERSTRUCTURE - NIGHT
text: Wedged between two steel beams, Eddie is sweating bullets
text: as the cops sweep the area around him.
text: Suddenly, the ALARM BELLS sound and the WHIRR and GRIND
text: of machinery starts again. The bridge is moving.
text: Wide eyed, Eddie realizes that the two beams he's
text: sandwiched between are closing in on him.
text: A COP is right beside him, nearly close enough to touch.
text: Eddie is trapped. At last, the cop moves on and Eddie
text: eases clear at the last second.
text: He looks up. There is a narrow gap between the roadway
text: and the bridge but it's closing fast.
text: He makes a leap - catches the edge of the bridge - and
text: slithers through the opening as it closes like a
text: ponderous guillotine.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
text: Emerging like a gopher onto the lower level roadway,
text: Eddie slides under the first car in line.
text: He catches his breath and looks around. There are cops
text: all over the place, but none right on top of him. Moving
text: on knees and elbows, he slithers on down the line under
text: the next car and the next.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
text: Lily steals another nervous glance at the clock: eight
text: ten. Two cops are approaching. She turns to an OLD
text: WOMAN nearby, slips her arm through the woman's arm:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Do you mind walking me to my
dialog: train? I get so nervous when I
dialog: have to travel.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Aw, nothin' to it. Come on.
dialog: Where we goin'?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, thank you. I'm sucha
dialog: goose.
text: She buries her face in the woman's shoulder and moves
text: past the cops.
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER.MICHIGAN AVENUE - NIGHT
text: The bridge is being sealed off and the cops are
text: frantically clearing the area.
text: A city salt truck idling in line is finally able to back
dialog: up:
speaker_heading: CoP
dialog: Okay, move it, move it:
text: The driver slams it in gear and as it trundles past, we
text: see the tarp on top of the load has an extra hump. And
text: it's alive.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
text: The clock hand leaps to eight fifteen. We HEAR the
dialog: announcer:
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Final call for the eight fifteen
dialog: to Madison.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: comes running into the station, moving through the crowd,
text: nearly knocking down a red cap with a load of luggage as
speaker_heading: THE TRAIN
text: begins to move, silently...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where's the train to Madison?
speaker_heading: REDCAP
dialog: Track nine, but you too late.
dialog: Go ahead, run.
text: Eddie runs.
text: Ahead, chatting casually, watching the train, are the two
text: cops. No way for Eddie to make it past them.
text: The train is gathering speed.
text: Eddie slows, begins walking, casually, trying to hide his
text: face. It's agonizing. The train is simply outgaining
text: him, pulling away. The cops scan the platform area...
text: Eddie stops. Nothing to do now but watch the train
text: depart. It is moving further away, out of reach.
text: And suddenly, the train stops, brakes hissing, the cars
text: jouncing together noisily. The cops are on the alert.
text: They hurry to the train just as the
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
text: alights onto the platform, turns, and helps the old woman
text: off the train.
speaker_heading: CoP
dialog: What's the trouble?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Had the wrong train. St. Louis
dialog: is track seven, Ma'am.
text: And the cops watch as the old woman makes her way across
text: the platform. The spot where Eddie was standing is now
dialog: vacant.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Lily sits alone, staring at the two tickets in her hand
text: as the conductor makes his way down the aisle toward her.
text: There is a voice behind her. It's Eddie:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This seat taken?
text: He sits beside her.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT
text: The train plows through the night landscape. And WE CUT
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MADISON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
text: A taxi swings around in a wide arc, illuminating the
text: Madison sign in it's beams, then pulls away.
scene_heading: EXT. MADISON ROAD - NIGHT
text: The taxi approaches an oddly shaped building, pulls up in
text: front and stops, its lights illuminating a sign saying
text: "Observatory". Eddie and Lily emerge, cross to the
text: building and enter.
scene_heading: INT. MADISON OHSERVATORY - HALL - NIGHT
text: Hall lights are on, but most of the offices are dark.
text: Eddie and Lily move down the hallway, come upon the night
text: WATCHMAN, dozing at his desk.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Excuse me... I'm looking for
dialog: Maggie Horner.
text: He blinks awake.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Might try the door down at the

dialog: corner.
text: He points. Watches as Eddie and Lily follow his
text: directions. Then he settles back in his chair and closes
text: his eyes again.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATORY ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eddie and Lily enter. A huge telescope dominates the
text: room, at the base of which, a single seat is occupied by
text: a woman (MAGGIE) in her late twenties, wearing bib
text: overalls, her eye glued to the telescope sight.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Maggie?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hold on.
text: She makes notes on a board she holds on her lap.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Maggie...
text: Maggie finally turns, annoyed, is startled to see Lily:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Jesus H. Christ!
text: The board slips to the floor. She leaps from the seat,
text: throws her arms around Lily.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: How did you get here?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We took the train. Maggie, this
dialog: is Eddie.
text: Maggie looks from one to the other.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It's bullshit, isn't it. The

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Nothing at all.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I knew it. You're being framed.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, Maggie, thank god for you.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: Everybody gets framed. Oswald,

dialog: nothing to be ashamed of.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We're not ashamed.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You watch, they're gonna catch

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Calling Lily...
speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

text: obsolete gear from various physics and astronomy labs.
text: The door opens and Maggie enters, with Lily and Eddie
text: trailing.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I think you'll be alright in
dialog: here. There's a sofa against
text: the wall. The grad students use
dialog: it for naps.
text: Maggie watches Eddie as he wanders into the room, peering
text: at the odd collection. Maggie turns to Lily, whispers:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Are you sleeping with him?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Jesus, Maggie.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He's cute.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I hadn't noticed.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You hadn't noticed?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Maggie, somebody is trying to
dialog: wreck my life! Excuse me if I
dialog: haven't had time to work it into
dialog: my dating habits.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You don't have any dating
dialog: habits.
text: A look from Lily.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (continued)
text: There's only one sofa.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We'll work something out.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Too bad.
scene_heading: EXT. VIRGINIA SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A black government sedan pulls into the driveway and
text: toward the white frame house set back from the road. As
text: the car nears the house, a sensor registers its presence,
text: bathing the house and surrounding area in high intensity
text: light, revealing three other cars parked nearby.
text: Shannon emerges from the car, enters the house.
scene_heading: INT. VIRGINIA SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Shannon enters. Collier is there to greet him.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Hello, Tony. Good flight?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Good enough. .
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: You know Art Bentley from
dialog: Intelligence. This is Paul Ryan
dialog: from D.O.D and Arthur Coburn
dialog: from State.
text: Three men nod hellos.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You know the drill. We have to
dialog: log you in.
text: He offers Shannon a standard form, which Shannon reads
text: quickly and signs under the gaze of the others. He looks
dialog: up when he's done:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Better have a seat.
text: Shannon sits on the sofa.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: (continued)
dialog: The short of it is you had a
dialog: leak. We think the Chinese
dialog: government had Chen's family
dialog: back in Shanghai. They put the
text: squeeze on him and he broke.
text: Shannon absorbs this without a flicker:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Early on, from all we can tell.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Who else?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We think Miss Naughton. Maybe
dialog: Eddie Kopek.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Impossible.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: You were close to him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I hired him.
speaker_heading: BENTLEY
dialog: We're checking on him, Tony. It
dialog: could be they set him up.
dialog: Planted the money.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BENTLEY
dialog: We're guessing. Maybe to hide
text: Naughton and Chen.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We need him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You've got half the known
text: universe looking for him.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Tony, we have reason to believe
dialog: they can't get the damned thing
dialog: working.
dialog: We think they're missing a piece
dialog: of the puzzle. It's possible
dialog: Kopek has it.
dialog: Maybe it's Naughton. Maybe
dialog: both. If it's true, then they
text: like looking for him, too.
speaker_heading: COBURN
dialog: If the FBI gets him, it'll be on
dialog: Ted Koppel by nightfall. we're
dialog: in a very sensitive situation
dialog: with the Chinese government. The
dialog: bureau wants to make it public.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Fuck the Chinese. They're
dialog: stealing secrets.
speaker_heading: COBURN
dialog: When the time comes, we'll fuck
dialog: the Chinese.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Why don't you just call the
dialog: bureau off?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: They'd look bad, they'd never go
dialog: quietly. We'd have a lot of
dialog: explaining to do. what kind of
dialog: guy is this Kopek?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Don't underestimate him.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Smart enough to keep the bureau
dialog: out of his hair?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I don't know. If he's that
dialog: smart, he's also smart enough to
dialog: keep you out of his hair.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We have an advantage.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We have you.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATORY - EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lily lies on the couch, Eddie on a makeshift arrangement
text: on the floor nearby.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lily? You awake?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do you have the fax from Chen?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Let me see it.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You want to brush up on your

dialog: And WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATORY - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The watchman is making his rounds, checking doors.
speaker_heading: EQUIPMENT ROOM
text: Eddie is studying the fax, Lily kneeling beside him.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There's a fax number here.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So let's find out where it came
dialog: from.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You mean send a fax?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. whoever sent the fax from
dialog: Chen would know exactly where we
dialog: are.
dialog: Some other way.
dialog: Lily thinks.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I send E mail to China all the
dialog: time. I could ask somebody to
dialog: check the number.
text: She peers at Eddie. New found warmth in her voice:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You do believe me.
text: He puts his hand to her mouth, hushing her; they listen
text: as the watchman's FOOTSTEPS ring just beyond the door.
text: The door handle turns, but it's locked. The watchman's
speaker_heading: FOOTSTEPS
text: fade down the hall, and Lily breathes at last.
scene_heading: EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: A small, frame house, snowbound but for the neatly
text: shoveled walk, on the grounds of the observatory. Maggie
text: emerges, her arms loaded down with old clothes, a coffee
text: cup in her hand, a newspaper stuffed under her arm. She
text: crosses toward the observatory.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATORY - HALL - MORNING
text: Maggie enters. The watchman from the night before is
dialog: still there.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hi, George. You still here?
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Frank went ice fishing. Doing a
dialog: double shift. You had some
dialog: visitors last night.
text: He eyes the clothes, the coffee cup. Maggie takes a gulp
dialog: of coffee.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yeah. I did. An old... friend.
dialog: From graduate school.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: That today's paper?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yeah. I'll let you have it when
dialog: I'm finished. See ya.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATORY - EQUIPMENT ROOM - MORNING
text: Maggie enters, waking Eddie and Lily. She dumps the
text: clothes on a counter.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I brought you a change of
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What for?
text: She tosses him the morning paper; Eddie scans the
dialog: headlines:
text: "DRAGNET FOR BLAST SUSPECTS WIDENS'
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They've got a pretty good
dialog: description of what you guys are
dialog: wearing.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Maggie, we need to send some E

text: Maggie takes a second to think:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Student Union.
scene_heading: EXT. OBSERVATORY - DAY
text: Maggie's beat-up Plymouth is stuck in the snow and ice.
text: She is behind the wheel, Eddie and Lily pushing, but it's
text: no use. The watchman approaches, calling:
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Need a hand?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (under her breath: )
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (cheerily: )
dialog: Would you? George, these are my
dialog: friends Mary and... and John.
text: He crosses to the rear of the car.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Which one is Mary? Just
dialog: kidding. Let's give 'er the ol'
dialog: heave ho.
text: The three of them put their shoulders to the car, and it
text: slowly frees itself from the mush.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: There you are. Where you
dialog: headed, Miss Horner?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: The Union.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Oh, how about that paper?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Oh, the paper. I'll get youa
dialog: new one.
text: She waves and pulls away. The watchman returns to the
text: observatory, just as a campus police car pulls up at the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: CAMPUS COP
dialog: Hiya, George. Looking for
dialog: Margaret Horner.
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Just missed her.
text: There's a federal agent in the seat beside him. He hands
text: two photos to the watchman:
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Have you seen these people?
speaker_heading: PHOTOS
dialog: Eddie and Lily.
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: Awash in students, coming and going. In the parking area
text: outside, a half dozen charter buses sit idling in the

scene_heading: INT. STUDENT UNION - COMPUTER CENTER - DAY
text: Rows of personal computers: Maggie and Lily sit at one

text: Eddie is a short way off, peering out of the window at
dialog: the buses.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (whispers: )
dialog: How'd it go?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Now did what go?
dialog: She looks
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Last night.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I think we should split up.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (appalled: )
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Because they're looking for two
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Oh. Yeah.
text: up, sees Eddie in his changed clothes:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: God, he looks great in tweed,
dialog: doesn't he?
text: begins printing out the response to Lily's E mail; it's
text: in Chinese. Lily stares at the message, dumbfounded, as
text: Eddie crosses to them.
dialog: She looks
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It says the fax number is
dialog: assigned to a personal residence
dialog: in Beijing.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What residence?
text: up, peers into his face before she answers:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: The United States Military
dialog: Attaché.
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT UNION - HALLWAY - DAY
text: A bank of pay phones in a busy hallway. Maggie is at one
text: of the phones, Eddie and Lily hovering nearby.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Anthony Shannon, please...
scene_heading: INT. SHANNON'S CHICAGO OFFICE - DAY
text: Shannon's secretary on the phone, as we intercut:
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I'm afraid he's not here. Who
dialog: may I say is calling?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It's personal...
text: The secretary looks up at FBI agent Schmidt, sitting
text: beside some fancy electronic gear, listening in. He
dialog: shrugs.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He's in Washington. Would you
dialog: like me to transfer the call?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yes.
text: Schmidt peers down at his gear, casually: the number on
text: Maggie's phone appears.
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: A half dozen police cars pull up outside the union,
dialog: disgorge officers...
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: Meanwhile, Maggie awaits the transfer; she whispers to
dialog: Eddie:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He's in Washington...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Washington!
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON SECRETARY (V.0.)
text: Mr. Shannon's office.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: WASHINGTON SECRETARY (V.0.)

dialog: It's personal.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON SECRETARY (V.0.)
dialog: Can you hold, please?
dialog: Maggie holds as
speaker_heading: POLICE

scene_heading: INT. SHANNON'S CHICAGO OFFICE - DAY
text: as Agent Schmidt listens into the transferred call and WE
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SHANNON'S WASHINGTON OFFICE - DAY
text: as Shannon picks up a telephone: it is attached to an
text: electronic device, and when Shannon speaks...
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Tony Shannon...
dialog: ...the phones on
speaker_heading: AGENT SCHMIDT
text: squawk and emit a pure digital static that makes Schmidt
dialog: wince and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: as Maggie leaves the booth and hands the phone to Eddie,
dialog: who enters:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's Eddie.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie! Where are you?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm in Madison. Listen, this is
dialog: crazy: The fax from Chen came
dialog: from the US embassy in
dialog: Beijing...
text: He looks out of the phone booth at a hallway full of
dialog: cops:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Are you secure?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. I'm not.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie, listen to me carefully.
dialog: We're gonna pick you up. Stay
dialog: where you are...
text: The last of the cops pass, heading down the hall.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I can't stay where I am. I'll
dialog: come to you.
text: He hangs up as
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: is left hanging:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie?
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: Eddie has Lily by the hand, leading her quickly down the
text: hall in the opposite direction of the cops, Maggie
text: hustling beside them.
text: Through the doors to the outside, we can SEE
speaker_heading: TwO COPS
dialog: and the FBI agent we saw at the observatory taking up
text: positions where they can keep an eye on the entrance.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Lily, wait. Let me help. Try
dialog: those buses.
text: She hugs Eddie; then she hugs Lily:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Good luck. Don't be such a
dialog: jerk.
text: And she's out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: Maggie emerges, crosses to the cops:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Excuse me... you know those
dialog: people in the paper this
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'm Maggie Horner. I think they
text: just snuck out the back way.
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: watch this from their vantage point just inside the
text: entrance. Maggie points down the walk leading away from
text: the union, then follows as the cops and the agent head
text: off in that direction.
text: And then, Eddie and Lily burst through the doors...
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: ...and cross rapidly toward the buses. A young man
text: dressed incongruously in a raccoon coat and a straw
text: boater stands before a bus door with a clipboard in his
text: hands. He grins as he sees Eddie and Lily approaching:
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Mr. Findlay?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (thinking quickly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: (checking off a name)
dialog: You're the last. Get right on.
text: Eddie and Lily climb the bus stairs. And now we see the
text: placard in the window: YOUNG REPUBLICAN CLUB OF
speaker_heading: WISCONSIN.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Excuse me... are there two of
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. This is Mrs. Findlay.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Oh. I didn't realize you were
dialog: both coming.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Last minute thing.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: No problem. Delighted to have
dialog: you both...
text: And as they turn into the bus, the man stops them again:
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Um... excuse me. You've only
dialog: paid for one ticket.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, sorry. How much is it?
text: He fumbles for his wallet:
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Well you've already paid for the
dialog: room. That'll be another ninety
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: The room.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: At the lodge, yes. Did you want
dialog: separate rooms?.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Of course not.
text: She slips her arm through Eddie's.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: That includes meals, of course.
text: Eddie peers into his wallet.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Will you take sixty on account?
dialog: I'll have to get to a cash
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Oh... what the heck. We're all
dialog: Republicans.
text: They board the bus, and the man in the raccoon coat waves
text: as the driver pulls away.
text: And as he heads for the union, a man comes running
text: through the parking lot, lugging a pair of boots and
text: skis. It is, of course, poor FINDLAY, desperately out of
dialog: breath:
speaker_heading: FINDLAY
dialog: Where's the bus?
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Just left.
speaker_heading: FINDLAY
dialog: Goddamit: I paid for my ticket.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: FINDLAY
dialog: Jack Findlay.
text: Raccoon coat turns and peers after the bus, now too far
text: away to hail. Then he turns back to Findlay, as if
dialog: something has just occurred to him:
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Mr. Findlay... do you know where
dialog: your wife is?
scene_heading: EXT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION - WASHINGTON OFFICE - DAY
text: A government sedan pulls up in front of a handsome town
text: house. Agent Ford emerges from the car, along with a
text: driver. They cross to the entrance. WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: SHOT - FILE FOLDER
text: As it drops on an elegantly polished desk.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: The Franklin Foundation's file
dialog: at the IRS. Shall I tell you
dialog: what's in it?
dialog: We are in
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION - SHANNON'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Shannon is at his desk, the file in front of him. Ford
text: stands before him as the other agent sits.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Your funding comes from a number
dialog: of different sources. But when
text: the checks are cashed, they end
text: up at the same bank. In
dialog: classified accounts.
dialog: Why do you suppose that is?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I couldn't say.
text: Shannon lights his cigar. Ford drops a second file on
text: top of the first.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Your resume. Very impressive.
dialog: Leaves out one important thing.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Which is who pays your salary.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: And who would that be?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Well, now, that's where it gets
dialog: interesting. I have a friend at
dialog: Langley who tells me they pay
dialog: your salary.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: That is interesting. Have to
dialog: check into that myself.
text: A deep drag on the cigar, a cloud of smoke.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: A man might be forgiven for
dialog: concluding that your foundation
dialog: is a front for the people at
dialog: Langley as well. Mr. Shannon,
dialog: do I need to tell you that
dialog: interfering with a federal
dialog: investigation is a crime?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I know the law, Mr. Ford.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Then perhaps you'd like to share
dialog: a little information with us.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Such as what's going on here.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I have no idea. I'd tell you if
dialog: I did.
text: Ford leans over, until he is practically nose to nose
dialog: with Shannon.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Alright. I'm going to do you the
dialog: favor of being frank with you.
dialog: These people are suspects in
dialog: crimes of murder and espionage.
dialog: I'm gonna find them. If it turns
dialog: out you and your friends at
dialog: Langley are trying to get in my
dialog: way, I'll fry your ass so bad
dialog: you'll never sit down again.
text: He gathers up the folders and leaves Shannon puffing on
text: his cigar.
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
text: Findlay and the Raccoon Coat are studying photos of Lily
text: and Eddie. Two cops and the agent await their judgment.
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: That's them.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: They got on the bus?
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
text: Just before it pulled out.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Where's it going?
speaker_heading: RACOON COAT
dialog: Lake Geneva. They oughta be

scene_heading: EXT. SKI LODGE - DAY

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What do we do now?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We're the Findlays. We do
dialog: whatever they would do.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know. I think we
dialog: register.
dialog: And we CUT TO:
scene_heading: SHOT - REGISTRATION CARD
dialog: already made out to Jack Findlay. We are in
scene_heading: INT. SKI LODGE LOBBY - DAY
text: and there is bedlam at the desk as the busload of

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I'm sorry sir, we have you down
dialog: for a single.
speaker_heading: A helpful Republican (MAXWELL) offers:
speaker_heading: MAXWELL
dialog: Would you like my double?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No, it's alright.
text: He's already signing the card.
speaker_heading: MAXWELL
dialog: It's no bother, really. My wife
dialog: couldn't make it. My name's
dialog: Maxwell.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (reading of the
dialog: registration: )
dialog: Jack Findlay.
speaker_heading: MAXWELL
dialog: Jack Findlay? That's strange.
dialog: I know a Jack Findlay. He was
dialog: supposed to come on this trip.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, that's the other Jack

dialog: Eddie has seen something outside:
speaker_heading: P.O.V.
text: A state police car pulls up to the entrance, lights

speaker_heading: MAXWELL
dialog: There's two Jack Findlays?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We're the pro choice Findlays.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He takes Lily by the arm, begins walking her toward the
text: rear of the lobby.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Mr. Findlay? Your key:
text: But Eddie and Lily are already running...
scene_heading: EXT. SKI LODGE - REAR - DAY
text: ...out of the back entrance and down through the snow, to
text: the lake where a half dozen ice boats skim along under
text: the brisk wind.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know:
text: They reach the frozen lake just as a man has finished
text: rigging his ice boat for a sail. Eddie turns, sees the
text: cops emerging from the entrance behind him. He shouts at
dialog: the boater:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Hey: The cops are looking for
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: BOATER
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know. They're pretty
dialog: steamed. Shall I hold your
dialog: boat?
text: The boater watches as the police come running down
text: through the snow, shouting and pointing.
speaker_heading: BOATER
dialog: What the hell...
text: Eddie takes the boat as the boater crosses toward the
text: advancing cops. He shouts:
speaker_heading: BOATER
dialog: (continued)
dialog: I can't hear you!
text: And when he turns, he is shocked to see Eddie and Lily on
text: his boat, sailing for the opposite shore.
speaker_heading: BOATER
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Hey! Come back here!
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: on the boat, sailing. The boat is picking up speed,
text: bouncing from side to side. They can barely hold on:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Do you know what you're doing?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I sailed a boat once.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: An ice boat?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. Gotta be the same thing,
dialog: right?
text: The boat nearly tips over, sliding crablike across the
text: slick expanse of ice. Then it spins, loses the wind as
speaker_heading: TWO POLICE CARS
text: move down the packed snow beside the lodge and onto the
dialog: ice.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: They're coming!
text: Eddie manages to fill the sails, and the boat takes off
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Look out!
text: A fishing shanty looms ahead. An ice fisherman emerges,
text: sees the ice boat coming, barely under control, his eyes
text: widening as it WOOSHES past the shanty...
text: ...and spins out of control. Eddie manages to regain the
text: wind and he takes off again, heading back toward the
text: shanty. The fisherman watches dumbfounded as the boat
text: seems bent on attacking
text: ...but Eddie manages to avoid a collision just as one of
text: the police cars comes roaring along the ice, narrowing
dialog: the distance...
text: ...Eddie swerves, the boat careening on one runner,
text: narrowly missing the police car and the cop hits the
text: brakes, the car doing a spinning 360 and wiping out the
text: shanty in an explosion of boards and fishing tackle.
speaker_heading: FISHERMAN
dialog: Goddam sonofabitch!
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: are now in the center of the lake, running before the
text: wind, but behind them, the second police car is making
text: headway along the ice, narrowing the distance between
text: them. Lily has to shout to be heard:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I'm freezing!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Me, too.
text: He aims the boat toward the opposite shore line,
text: approaching rapidly, but suddenly A SECOND ICE BOAT
text: barreling along an a perpendicular tack is bearing down
text: on them.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Eddie!
text: He sees the boat just in time to yank his rudder hard,
text: sending his own boat into a spin and clipping the other
text: boat with a sickening CRAACCCKK!!!...
speaker_heading: EDDIE'S BOAT
text: is missing a runner, now, tipped at an odd angle, sliding
text: toward a snowbank on the far edge of the lake, spinning,
text: grinding a path across the ice with a painful SHRIEK...
text: ...and dumping Eddie and Lily into the snowbank. Silence
text: for a long moment as
speaker_heading: THE POLICE CAR
text: spins it's wheels against the slick ice, making progress
text: toward the wrecked boat and at last
speaker_heading: LILY
text: rises, takes Eddie by his arm, almost drags him through
text: the snow, away from the lake.
dialog: And they run.
text: Behind them, the cop in the second car realizes too late
text: he's heading for an ice fisherman's large hole. He pumps
text: his brakes, the nose of the car dips, and then drifts
text: slowly and inevitably into the hole. Up go the back
text: wheels, spinning uselessly in mid air.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Eddie and Lily run. But the snow is deep and they are
text: exhausted, and the tracks they leave show how impossible
text: it is to keep to a straight line. Lily stumbles, falls.
text: They are both fighting for breath.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Wait...
text: It is a long moment before they can speak.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: This is insane...
text: A sudden CRACK through the trees, a rifle shot,
text: splintering wood near by and the two of them are off
text: again, scrambling...
speaker_heading: LILY
text: racing through the trees, a look of terror an her face
dialog: now. And Eddie calls:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lily!
text: He is burrowing into the snow, making a cave. He grabs
text: her, forces her down into the hole, scurries in behind
text: her, then brings a pile of snow down to cover the
text: entrance. Ina flash they are invisible.
text: And we HEAR FOOTSTEPS and HEAVY BREATHING; it is a moment
dialog: before
speaker_heading: TWO HUNTERS
text: appear, slogging through the snow, rifles at the ready.
speaker_heading: HUNTER #1
dialog: You sure it was a buck?
speaker_heading: HUNTER #2
dialog: Hadda be. Big ol' hairy
dialog: sonofabitch.
text: And as they move an into the woods, WE CUT TO
speaker_heading: EDDY AND LILY
text: stuffed like rabbits in a cozy hole, their noses inches
text: away, peering into each others' eyes.
scene_heading: INT. COSMOS CLUB - EVENING
text: An old-boys club (and now, old-girls, too) at cocktail
text: time: stuffed chairs, deep carpet, white coated waiters
text: serving drinks. A woman (FLORENCE) enters, attractive,
text: about 50, pauses briefly as she searches for someone,
dialog: then crosses to
speaker_heading: SHANNON
text: sitting in an easy chair. He rises with a smile, kisses
text: her cheek.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I swear you get more beautiful
dialog: every time I set eyes on you.
text: She sits.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Liar.
speaker_heading: SHANNON.
dialog: It's the truth.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: It's okay, the lie will do.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What are you drinking?
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: The usual.
text: He calls the waiter over:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Bourbon and soda.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: That was a test.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Shame on you.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: I've been reading about you.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I suspect you have.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I need some help, Flo.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: And I thought this was purely
dialog: social.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I wish it were.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Chinese physicist by the name of
dialog: Chen Lu
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: The missing Chen...
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: ..and his assistant, Lily
dialog: Naughton. Collier's been
text: tracking them.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Collier: Is he involved in
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I need to find out what he
dialog: knows.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: He knows everything. He's kissed
dialog: every important butt in
dialog: Washington.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I've got egg on my face, Flo. I
dialog: found Chen. I brought him here
dialog: from China.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: I'll do what I can. Be careful
dialog: of Collier. He won't play with
dialog: you unless he can keep your
text: balls in a jar by the door.
dialog: Shannon grins:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I like to take mine with me.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: I wouldn't mind holding them
dialog: myself.
scene_heading: EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Nestled in among the trees, boarded up and closed for
dialog: winter.
scene_heading: INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The SOUND of BREAKING GLASS, and then a hand reaches in
text: through a broken window and unlocks the door.
text: Eddie and Lily enter. Sheets shroud the furniture,
text: matching the cool white landscape visible through the
text: windows in the moonlight. Lily shivers violently.
text: Eddie grabs a blanket that's being used as a covering for
text: a chair, wraps Lily in it. She's making involuntary
text: sounds, her teeth chattering, her whole body shaking. He
text: rubs her back, puts his arms around her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Come on, lie down.
text: She does. Eddie goes down with her, holds her tightly to
text: himself, whispering in her ear:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Shhh... it's okay... you're okay
dialog: now...
text: She's weeping from cold and fatigue, but gradually her
text: shivering stops...
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Lily has calmed down and warmed up. She lies beside
text: Eddie, wrapped tightly in her blanket.
text: In the dark, they speak in near whispers:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Can we stay here?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: They'll have the dogs and
text: choppers out by daylight. We've
dialog: got to get to Shannon.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It's too dangerous.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's our only chance.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Eddie, the fax came from the
dialog: embassy... whoever's involved in
dialog: this is in Washington.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: He's the only one who can help
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You trust him.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don't trust anyone. I think I
dialog: trust you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: He's like my dad, Lily. After
dialog: my dad died, he gave me a job.
dialog: He made me go back to school.
dialog: He believed in me.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I hope you're right.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get some sleep.
scene_heading: EXT. SHANNON'S HOUSE - WASHINGTON - NIGHT
text: A secluded house on a quiet, suburban street. A light

scene_heading: INT. SHANNON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A phone RINGS on Shannon's nightstand. Shannon picks up:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Tony Shannon.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE (V.0.)
dialog: Tony, it's Flo. Are you secure?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE (V.0.)
dialog: I've checked on Collier for you.
dialog: He's off the reservation.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What's going on?
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: Florence is at a pay phone:
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: I don't know. The Chen story is
dialog: a fake. Langley was never
text: tracking him.
dialog: Same with the Naughton woman.
speaker_heading: SHANNON (V.O.)
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: That's all I have.
text: Silence from Shannon. Then:
speaker_heading: SHANNON (V.O.)
dialog: Thanks, Flo.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Be careful.
text: She hangs up. AND WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
text: sitting an his bed. Rolling his unlit cigar through his
dialog: fingers.
scene_heading: INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Lily is asleep on the sofa. A hand reaches down, touches
text: her shoulder gently. She wakens with a start, blinks her
text: eyes open: it's Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sorry... we have to go.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sun'll be up in an hour.
dialog: And WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS ROAD - NIGHT
text: Running lights from a Chevy pick up cut a path through
dialog: the woods...
scene_heading: INT. PICK UP TRUCK - NIGHT
text: ...as Eddie drives, Lily in the seat beside him.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: How'd you get it started?
speaker_heading: EDDIE.
dialog: Everybody knows how to do that
dialog: in my neighborhood.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: And gas?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Drained the lawnmower.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: We're criminals, now.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You were sleeping.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The truck emerges from the woods, passes along a bluff
text: with a commanding view of the countryside.
speaker_heading: EDDIE'S P.O.V.
text: Down the bluff, we can see squad cars parked an the road
text: leading away from the woods: a road block.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I was afraid of that. They'll
dialog: be all over these woods by sun
dialog: up.
text: Lily is studying a road map from the glove compartment.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: If the lake is that way, there's
dialog: a freeway this way. They
dialog: wouldn't block the freeway,
dialog: would they?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Good point.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don't see how we get there.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: As the crow flies.
text: He swings the truck around, turns off the road and into a
dialog: farm lane, and WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STAGING AREA - DAWN
text: The sky is just light enough to make out the state police
text: cars, unmarked black sedans, and police choppers at the
text: ready. A dozen cops and FBI agents prowl among the
text: vehicles as the choppers rise like giant birds, head
text: toward the wooded area atop the bluff...
scene_heading: EXT. FARM FIELD - DAWN
text: The truck comes bouncing over the field, through the corn
text: stalks, turns down a tractor lane and pulls up to a snow
text: fence separating the farm field from a freeway, just up a
text: short rise on the other side.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - DAWN
text: Eddie puts the truck in gear:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Buckle up. And hold on to your
dialog: hat.
text: He backs the truck up for a running start, guns the
text: engine, and heads directly for the fence...
speaker_heading: FENCE
text: closer, closer... and suddenly the fence shatters with
dialog: the impact of the
speaker_heading: TRUCK
text: slipping and sliding now, into the icy ditch that
text: collects the runoff from the rise leading to the freeway.
text: Eddie tries to force his way through, but it's no use,
text: the wheels are spinning against the snow and slush. They
dialog: are stuck.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - DAWN
text: The choppers are cruising the woods, peering down onto
text: the rooftops of the summer homes, one of which Eddie and
text: Lily have just left. Fresh tire tracks through the newly
text: fallen snow catch the eye of the chopper pilot. He
text: speaks into the radio:
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Chopper one... we've got some
dialog: tire tracks...
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - DAY
text: Eddie is pushing, trying to get the pick up unstuck.
text: Lily is behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Give her some gas!
text: She floors it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Not so much! Let it rock a
dialog: little...
text: She tries again. No luck.
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - DAWN
text: Following the tire tracks as they veer off the road and
text: into a farm field.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Chopper one... we got somethin'
dialog: goin' on here...
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - DAWN
text: Eddie is straining with all his might. At last, there is
text: movement, the truck inching ahead slowly, along the
text: ditch, and then Lily points it uphill and gives it the
dialog: gas:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No! No... don't... not so fast.
text: He watches as the truck slips back down the incline,
text: then, miraculously catches hold, spins up the bank and to
text: the crest beside the road. Eddie runs:
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - DAWN
text: Eddie opens the door, swings himself in.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Nice work.
text: Lily makes a muscle. She heads for the freeway, slides
text: into the trickle of early morning traffic as...
scene_heading: INT. CHOPPER - DAWN
text: ...The chopper passes over the fields and hovers above
text: the broken snow fence.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Chopper one... they made it to
dialog: the freeway.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGING AREA - DAWN
text: A federal agent stands listening to his radio. He
dialog: mutters:
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Sonofabitch.
dialog: And we CUT TO:
scene_heading: SHOT - BREAKFAST PLATE
text: Two poached eggs, beautifully arrayed with a sprig of
text: parsley and a neatly scalloped orange
dialog: slice. We are in...
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING
text: ...a fancy hotel restaurant, a jacketed waiter serving
text: Collier his morning fare. Shannon is opposite,
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Why the-bullshit?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: No bullshit, Tony. You know
dialog: everything I do.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: That's the bullshit. That, and
dialog: the story about Chen.
text: Collier looks up from his eggs.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: What makes you say so?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Let's just say I have my
dialog: sources.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Alright. Let's just say he's
dialog: serving a larger purpose. So am
dialog: I. So are you.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Meaning we're just actors here.
dialog: We don't know how the play comes
dialog: out.
dialog: You might be the villain.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Chen was your boy, Tony. You
dialog: brought him to the party. You
dialog: brought in this Kopek kid.
dialog: You're a suspect. Hell, you
dialog: even lied to Congress. You said
dialog: the project was private, no
dialog: involvement from Langley. Who
dialog: drinking
dialog: do you think would believe you
dialog: now? Who do you think is going
dialog: to be responsible if it blows up
dialog: in our faces?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Except there was no espionage.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: There is now.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I could make a hell of a mess
text: going down, George.
text: Collier studies him for a beat:
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: You could.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: That makes me a pretty good
dialog: villain.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: The truth.
text: Collier pokes his egg, watches the yellow run onto the
dialog: plate.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - DAY

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: His phones are tapped for sure.
dialog: They'll be waiting for us.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: How much money do we have?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I saw something in a movie once.
text: She turns onto the main drag.
scene_heading: INT. ZANESVILLE FLOWER SHOP - DAY
text: Lily enters, crosses to the counter. The clerk is an old
text: duffer in a plaid shirt.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I'd like to send some flowers to
dialog: Washington.
speaker_heading: CLERK
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I'd like to send something to
dialog: Washington. Wouldn't be
dialog: flowers.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: May I include a message with
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You can if you hold your horses.
text: As the clerk prepares his order form, Lily is suddenly
text: aware of the TV, it's volume tuned low, sitting down the

speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER

speaker_heading: TV SET
text: now showing photos of Eddie and Lily just as
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: enters the shop with a bag of fast food. Lily shoots him
text: a look, nods to the Tv, just as the clerk snaps it off.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Can't hear yourself think with
dialog: that damn thing yapping at you.
dialog: Now, who we sending this to?
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Shannon rides a cargo elevator down, accompanied by two

scene_heading: INT. VAULTED CHAMBER - DAY

text: Collier is waiting for him.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Hello, Tony. This way.
text: He ushers Shannon through a door into a...
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM - DAY
text: ...modestly appointed board room: a large conference
text: table and chairs, in which Bentley, Coburn and Ryan await
text: his entrance.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Gentlemen.
text: They nod helloes; Shannon sits in the chair provided for
dialog: him.
dialog: Mirthless
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: I'm sorry we couldn't have been
dialog: more open with you from the
dialog: beginning.., we've pretty much
dialog: had to proceed on a need to know
dialog: basis. And until now, we felt
dialog: you didn't.
speaker_heading: BENTLEY
dialog: Tony, before we begin, I'd like
dialog: to assure you that what you hear
dialog: today will remain inside these
dialog: walls.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You mean you won't tell or I
dialog: won't tell?
text: chuckles.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: You're right about Dr. Chen,
dialog: Tony. There was no espionage.
dialog: Your lab was destroyed on our
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: And Bucky?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: I'm sorry to say, also on our
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We're an interagency team. We
dialog: advise the president on
dialog: technology and defense.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Tony, we were in a crisis
dialog: situation. We had to act
dialog: quickly. None of us wanted to
dialog: see Dr. Bucholtz hurt. We had
dialog: no choice.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BENTLEY
dialog: He was going to release the
dialog: information needed to duplicate
text: his machine on the internet. It
dialog: would have created chaos. The
dialog: oil business, the automobile
dialog: business would have been in
dialog: turmoil. There would have been
dialog: financial panic.
dialog: The relationships on which the
dialog: world has run for fifty years
dialog: would have been turned upside-
dialog: down. We couldn't let it
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: So you had him killed.
speaker_heading: COBURN
dialog: It was very regrettable, Tony.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: And Chen?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We took him. We made him an
dialog: offer.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: He's here. You can see him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: And Eddie Kopek?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: He and Chen were our cover
dialog: story. They were simply... how
dialog: should I put it? Convenient.
dialog: We were going to throw then to
dialog: the FBI and let nature take its
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Nature and some trumped up
dialog: bullshit from CIA.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: If you like.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: So why don't you?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Tony, the story we told you
dialog: about not being able to make the
dialog: thing work was true.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Only it's not the Chinese.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You think he's the missing piece
dialog: of the puzzle?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We hope so. We believe so. He
dialog: and Miss Naughton.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: And I'm your Judas goat. I lead
text: Eddie to the slaughter.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: If he cooperates, there is no
dialog: slaughter.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What if I refuse?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We don't think you can, Tony.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: We're in very deep. We're
dialog: playing for very high stakes.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: That wouldn't be a threat, would
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BENTLEY
dialog: We've won the cold war, Tony.
dialog: We're not about to give the
dialog: trophy back.
text: The door opens, and a security officer enters:
speaker_heading: OFFICER
text: A phone call for Mr. Shannon.
dialog: Shall I put it through?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Please.
text: The men and women around the table stare curiously at

scene_heading: INT. SHANNON'S WASHINGTON OFFICE - DAY
text: Shannon's Washington secretary an the secure phone. She

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I didn't know whether to bother

dialog: Shall I read it?...
dialog: (reading: )
dialog: Smithsonian, 5pm. Today. Eddie. That's it.
scene_heading: INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

text: Slips a cigar out of his coat pocket, rolls it in his

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - DAY
text: Eddie drives, swings into the lane marked Route 70,

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How come you speak Chinese?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I grew up in China. My parents
dialog: were missionaries.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Missionaries?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yeah. Everytime I hear the
dialog: expression "missionary
dialog: position: I think of my parents
dialog: Oing it.

speaker_heading: SHANNON

speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Yes, sir. Shall I try and lose

speaker_heading: SHANNON

speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Yes sir.
scene_heading: INT. DUPONT CIRCLE FLORISTS - DAY
text: Ford and another agent talk to the OWNER:
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: They were sent by phone. I do

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Do you recall where they were
dialog: sent from?
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: I don't. I'm sorry. It's

speaker_heading: SHANNON

text: He walks quickly to the doors to the rear.
speaker_heading: BUTCHER

speaker_heading: BUTCHER

scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET, LOADING DOCK - DAY

scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

dialog: Yes, I do remember.... young
dialog: man, young woman, very nice
dialog: couple... alright, hold on...
text: He puts the phone down, crosses to his waste basket,
text: pulls out today's paper: Eddie and Lily's photographs on
text: the front page. The clerk returns to the phone.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (continued)
dialog: It's them.
scene_heading: INT. DUPONT CIRCLE FLORISTS - DAY
text: Ford is on the phone. He turns to the second agent:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: They were in Zanesville.
dialog: (to the phone: )
dialog: Do you recall the time?
scene_heading: INT. ZANESVILLE FLOWER SHOP - DAY
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Earlier today... this morning,
dialog: it was. Sent a message, too...
text: He scratches his head:
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (continued)
dialog: No, I can't remember.

speaker_heading: CLERK

dialog: Well, now, I am thinking...
scene_heading: EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY
speaker_heading: HIGH ANGLE
text: Far below, Eddie and Lily appear between the massive
text: marble columns and enter the museum.
scene_heading: INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY
text: Security guards everywhere. Eddie and Lily walk past the
text: looming dinosaur skeleton and head up the broad stairway
dialog: to the
speaker_heading: SECOND FLOOR
text: where they emerge in a long gallery. A line of arched
text: openings overlooks the main hall, and as they move down
text: the colonnade, Eddie spots
speaker_heading: SHANNON
text: just entering the building.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: There he is.
text: But as Lily registers her relief, Eddie sees three men
text: who accompany Shannon. They stop, speak for a moment,
text: and then the men fade into the museum, take up positions
dialog: - apparently as visitors.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: is frozen in his place, incredulous. A long moment
text: before he can say to Lily:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What is this?
scene_heading: INT. DUPONT CIRCLE FLORISTS - DAY
text: The owner is rummaging through the waste basket, Ford
text: still on the phone beside him:
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: We don't keep records of
dialog: messages. I might've made
dialog: notes...
text: He draws a scrap of paper from the basket, reads it:
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: (continued)
dialog: This is it...
text: He hands it to Ford, who scans it quickly, starts moving
dialog: for the door...
scene_heading: INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY
text: Shannon climbs the stairs to the second floor. He
text: reaches the gallery, sees Eddie, sitting on a bench.
text: Alone. He crosses to him, sits beside him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Hello, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You're safe. Relax.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Who are your friends?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What friends?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: The ones you came with.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I'm here by myself. Where's
dialog: Lily?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: She never made it.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: She hates Washington. She's
dialog: probably a thousand miles away
dialog: by now.
dialog: Those friends.
text: The men Shannon entered with have moved into the gallery,
text: still trying to blend into the stream of visitors.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: It's complicated, Eddie. I can
dialog: explain...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You'll have to come with me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why don't you explain here?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I can't.
text: Eddie stands.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Eddie, take it easy.
text: But the men, seeing Eddie rise, move quickly. Eddie
text: turns, sprints down the gallery.
text: The three men pursue, as visitors turn, stare at this
text: breach of museum decorum.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie!
speaker_heading: PURSUER
text: gaining on Eddie. Suddenly, a display comes sliding
text: across the floor into his path, knocking him down. Lily
dialog: has pushed it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lily, run!
text: She turns, sprints down the gallery as Eddie grabs the
text: club from the hands of "Paleolithic Man", smashes the
text: second pursuer in the face.
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARDS
text: come running into the gallery, but are swamped by a
text: stream of visitors trying to get out of the way.
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: with two pursuers on their heels, run through a maze of
text: display cases looking for a way out.
text: The door marked "BOTANY" is unlocked and they go through
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. ATRIUM - DAY
text: Several workers are startled by the sudden commotion as
text: Eddie and Lily race through, followed seconds later by
text: two pursuers.
text: A researcher grabs a phone and dials...
scene_heading: EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY
text: Ford pulls up in his car, a second car behind. Ford and
text: two other agents emerge, cross to the entrance...
text: ...just as Shannon emerges from the museum.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Grab him: Mr. Shannon, I'm
dialog: going to ask you to wait here.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Are you arresting me?
text: Ford doesn't answer. Without looking back, he enters the
text: museum, leaving Shannon with one of the agents.
scene_heading: INT. SMITHSONIAN (SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY) MUSEUM - DAY
text: A locomotive, a race car, and a Boeing 727 dominate the
dialog: Hall of Transportation.
text: Eddie and Lily race into the hall, look around, and head
text: for the nearest stairway.
speaker_heading: THREE PURSUERS
text: enter behind them, closing the gap, until the stairwell
text: suddenly fills with a group of eighth graders. One of
text: the men breaks off and heads for another stairwell.
speaker_heading: SECOND LEVEL
text: Eddie and Lily race down the balcony alongside the Boeing
text: 727. Then Eddie sees the
speaker_heading: PURSUER
text: who took the other stairway blocking their path. Eddie
text: runs headlong into the man, knocking them both down. But
text: the guy is a brute and he is still blocking the way.
text: Eddie turns, heads the other way.
text: He looks around for Lily, but she's nowhere in sight.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lily?!
dialog: Nothing.
text: The man he knocked down is closing in; the other two are
text: approaching from the other side.
text: Eddie is trapped. Desperate, he leaps up on the 727
speaker_heading: ENGINE POD
text: then scrambles over the top of the fuselage, past the
text: tail, and slides down the other side onto
speaker_heading: THE WING
text: suspended high in midair above the hall. Eddie dashes
text: along the wing to the tip and vaults over the railing on
text: the opposite balcony.
text: The men make an end run around the balcony but they're
text: too late. Eddie has vanished.
text: They backtrack to the jetliner, searching.
scene_heading: INT. BOEING 727 - DAY
text: The men enter the airplane, peering behind the seats,
text: into the cockpit. One of the men yanks open the lavatory
dialog: door:
text: LILY...
text: stands looking out, her face a mask of fear, as the man
text: closes in on her.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Don't touch me!
text: He pins her wrists as she struggles against him. Another
text: of the men appears at her side. He cracks a vial of
text: inhalant under her nose. She goes limp.
scene_heading: INT. SMITHSONIAN (SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY) MUSEUM - DAY
text: Eddie dashes into the darkened
scene_heading: BRIDGE OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER
text: in the middle of a full alert.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from speaker: )
dialog: Stand by to launch aircraft.
text: Eddie melts into the shadows and glances around. It

scene_heading: INT. ATRIUM - DAY: -
text: Ford and two agents are surrounded by a half dozen
text: workers, all of them shouting different directions:
speaker_heading: WORKERS
dialog: There were four of them... they
dialog: went through there... no, that
dialog: way... there were only two of
dialog: them...
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Eddie is moving along the ground floor corridor with a
text: mob of tourists, looking around frantically for Lily and
text: trying to stay invisible.
text: Suddenly, he stops in his tracks.
scene_heading: P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW
text: Eddie sees Lily.
scene_heading: EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM (FIELD MUSEUM) - DAY
text: The three men support Lily as she stumbles along with
text: them, half conscious. They lead her to a white van...
scene_heading: INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM (FIELD MUSEUM) - DAY
text: ...as Eddie slams his fist against the glass in
text: frustration. He spots an exit at the end of the hall.
scene_heading: EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM (FIELD MUSEUM) - DAY
text: Eddie comes running out and down the broad steps. The van
text: is moving away. Eddie runs after it, catching sight of
text: something scrawled in the dust on the back: Leesburg
dialog: Construction hires scab....
text: ...but as Eddie gets almost close enough to touch the
text: rear, door, the van pulls away.
text: He stops, out of breath. Not far away, Eddie sees
text: security guards moving in. He turns, dashes back down a
text: ramp leading to door under the museum. He enters.
scene_heading: INT. STEAM TUNNEL - DAY
text: Eddie runs down the long tunnel, footsteps echoing in the
dialog: emptiness.
scene_heading: EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY
text: Ford emerges from inside, crosses down the steps to

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Better get yourself a lawyer,

dialog: your ass.
text: And Ford continues on down the steps as WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING (MADISON) - DAY
text: A door marked "No Public Access" opens a crack. Eddie
text: peeks out. He steps into the marble hallway, gently
text: closes the door behind him. He has no idea where he is.
text: He eases into another tour group.
speaker_heading: GUIDE
dialog: ...and at the end of this hall
dialog: we will see the Capitol Building

scene_heading: EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING (MADISON) - DAY
dialog: Eddie emerges:
scene_heading: P.O.V. OF CAPITOL MALL (SECOND UNIT) - DAY
text: the bronze statues of generals on horseback are dusted

text: against the crisp winter sky. All around, American flags
text: snap smartly in the breeze.
text: Eddie pulls up his collar and descends the steps.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: Eddie walks. He seems aimless, his mood dark. He
text: hunches his shoulders against the wind and cold, his eyes
text: an the pavement in front of him.
text: Newspapers at a kiosk sport headlines:
scene_heading: ELUSIVE PAIR IN D.C.?
scene_heading: EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A sign says "Full Chinese Meal - $2". Eddie peers in
text: through the frosted window, reaches into his pocket. He
text: pulls out a handful of change - not nearly enough. He
text: continues on.
text: Down the sidewalk, a homeless man (LARRY) is panhandling.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Pardon me, sir. Spare some
dialog: change?
text: Eddie doesn't even look up.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: That's right. Don't even look.
text: Eddie continues on. Larry has to call after him:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
text: Nobody looks at the homeless.
text: Another few steps, and then Eddie stops, turns, stares at
dialog: Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Hey! Con...TACT!
dialog: Larry salutes:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Yes... SIR! Lawrence
dialog: Applewhite, ready for duty, SIR!
dialog: And WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SOUP KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: A line of destitute men and women snakes through a dingy
text: church basement, where volunteers serve soup and
text: sandwiches. Eddie and Larry are among them, only Eddie
text: is wearing Larry's clothes and Larry has on Eddie's
text: tweeds. Somehow, Eddie looks right at home among these

dialog: royalty.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Thank you sister... set my man
dialog: up here with whatever he
dialog: needs... thank you brother...
dialog: Hey! One dinky ol1' baloney
dialog: sandwich for my man? Shame
dialog: on you! He's a growin' boy.
text: The volunteer dumps another limp baloney sandwich on

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: You want that?
text: Eddie puts the sandwich on Larry's plate.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Thank you, bro.
scene_heading: EXT. LARRY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: A beat up Dodge Dart, circa 1968. The back seat is
text: filled with the odds and ends of Larry's existence. And
text: at the moment, it is also filled with Eddie, huddled
text: under a blanket. Larry is in the front seat, huddled
text: under his own blanket.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Can't sleep in them shelters,
dialog: bro. Very low class of people
dialog: in there. Steal your goddam
dialog: teeth if you open your mouth to
text: snore.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where's Leesburg?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Leesburg? Only Leesburg I know
dialog: is in Virginia.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Your car make it that far?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hell, yes.
text: Suddenly, a light flashes inside the car, illuminating
text: first Larry's face.
speaker_heading: A COP
text: stands beside the car, pointing his flashlight at the
dialog: occupants.
speaker_heading: CoP
dialog: Can't park it here, boys.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes, SIR! We'll move it, SIR!
text: The cop shines his light on Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE

text: The cop douses his light, walks away, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: LARRY

dialog: Ass...HOLE!
scene_heading: EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
text: A glorious day; the Capitol Building stands proudly

scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SIDE OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Who wrote it?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: It's nice to know who's
dialog: mouthpiece I am.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: You're-investing in your future,
dialog: Tony.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Well, let's see. You've killed a

dialog: away without his secret, and you
dialog: can't put your hands on a kid
dialog: who's running around out there
dialog: without a clue. You want me to

speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Just read it, Tony.
scene_heading: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - HEARING ROOM - DAY
text: A Senate committee hearing: a panel of Senators listens
dialog: as Shannon reads:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: We don't know the cause of the
dialog: explosion, it's true. We don't
dialog: know the source of the
dialog: espionage, if indeed there was
dialog: espionage. But we know that we
dialog: are at risk. Every idea that
dialog: offers a competitive advantage
dialog: for Americans is subject to
dialog: theft. And that is the lesson
dialog: to be drawn from this disaster.
dialog: Security concerns must be
dialog: paramount. We must begin to
dialog: treat business secrets the way
dialog: we once treated military ones.
dialog: The cold war may be over, but we
dialog: are still at war.
speaker_heading: SENATOR
dialog: Mr. Shannon, yours are the words
dialog: of a patriot...
scene_heading: EXT. LEESBURG CONSTRUCTION COMPANY - DAY
text: A yard brimming with trucks, vans, and at the far end, a

text: and Eddie emerge, head for the office.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'd give my left nut for a job,
dialog: bro.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION OFFICE - DAY
text: A tough looking FOREMAN is giving Eddie and Larry a
text: disapproving look over:
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: No jobs. Sorry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Man, how about a little
dialog: temporary work? Just a little
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: Sorry. You'd need security
dialog: clearances anyway.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Security? What for?
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: All our guys need clearances.
dialog: Tell your friend he oughta start
text: with a bath.
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S CAR - DAY
text: Eddie and Larry are parked outside the construction yard.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Man said no.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Never know. Let's

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You da boss.
text: Larry pulls out behind a row

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: The trucks pull off the road
text: a large "No Admittance" sign
text: pulls up and stops along the
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S CAR - DAY
text: Eddie and Larry watch as the

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, what's your idea,
dialog: I think you're
dialog: just see

dialog: road.
text: trucks disappear into the
dialog: bro?
text: A sharp RAP on the window startles them both:
speaker_heading: AN ARMED GUARD
text: has come up behind them.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Looking for work.
text: Larry rolls down his window.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Can't park here. They're hiring
text: down at the Leesburg yard.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes, SIR! Right away, SIR!
text: And Larry swings around, heads back down the road. A
text: NOISY line of flatbed trucks, hauling huge construction
text: pipes and heading for the gate, makes Larry shout as he
dialog: concentrates on not getting sideswiped:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Ain't that the usual bitch?
dialog: Ain't hiring here, they're
dialog: hiring over there. And then you
dialog: get there and they tell you no,
dialog: it's the last place, and now you
dialog: Lost your place in line at the
dialog: last place...
text: And he turns to Eddie, discovers the car door open and
text: Eddie nowhere in sight..
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (continued)
dialog: What in the goddam...
scene_heading: EXT. GATE - DAY
text: The line of trucks enters the gate.
scene_heading: EXT. FLATBED TRUCK - DAY
text: A truck pulls to a halt beside the other trucks, near
text: some construction sheds. The driver crosses to a shed,
text: and once he passes, Eddie pokes his head out of a
text: construction pipe, then leaps out.
text: He sees a group of construction workers coming out of one
text: of the sheds, wearing jackets and hard hats, and he makes
text: his way to the door, enters.
scene_heading: INT. SHED - DAY
text: Slickers and hard hats hang on pegs; Eddie dresses. Ona
text: wall is a set of blueprints detailing the construction
text: site; Eddie takes it down, rolls it up, stuffs it under
text: his arm.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA - DAY
text: Eddie falls in with a group of workers, heading toward a
text: cargo elevator. As he goes, he notices that each of them
text: has a security identification badge. He looks down at
dialog: his own slicker: no badge.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: The workers wait as a group of men exit the elevator,
text: apparently a shift change. Eddie awkwardly bumps into
text: one of the departing men:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Sorry. Excuse me.
text: Eddie has his badge. He pins it to his slicker and the
text: group enters the elevator cage. The elevator begins its
dialog: descent.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: The elevator cage reaches bottom and the men exit. Eddie
text: sneaks a look at a conveyor belt hauling rocks and earth
text: upward. The group moves down the tunnel to a truck.
text: They climb on and the truck and it heads down the long
dialog: tube.
scene_heading: TUNNEL - ANOTHER AREA
text: The men are walking again, past a huge hydraulic machine.
text: Eddie stops, looks it over, then unscrolls the blueprints
text: under his arm, tries to orient himself. When he rolls
text: the blueprints up again, the group has moved off, and he
text: is alone. He heads the other way.
speaker_heading: TUNNEL - DOOR
text: Eddie comes to a huge door, blocking his progress. He
text: crosses to a ladder at the side of the door, climbs it,
text: where it gives way to a vent pipe. Eddie moves from the
text: ladder to the pipe and crawls through.
speaker_heading: VENT PIPE
text: Eddie slips through the narrow pipe with some effort.
text: Ahead, a shaft of light suggests an opening. He
text: crawls... AND WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER CENTER - DAY
text: a massive array of computers, run by a staff of
text: technicians. Just off the main room, there is a small
speaker_heading: OFFICE
text: with a large window looking onto the main computer area.
text: Sitting before a small group of scientists is Lily.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We've been following your work
dialog: for some time. We're very
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Am I supposed to be flattered?
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We'd like to check some figures
dialog: with you, if you don't mind.
speaker_heading: SECOND SCIENTIST
dialog: Miss Naughton, we can offer you
dialog: a chance to continue the work
dialog: you've been doing with Dr. Chen.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Where is Dr. Chen?
speaker_heading: SECOND SCIENTIST
dialog: I'm afraid he's not available.
dialog: He's quite ill.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Then let me speak to him.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We'd have to get clearance for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Fine. Call me when you do.
speaker_heading: PUMP ROOM
text: Eddie emerges from the vent pipe into a pump room - a
text: huge pumping station supplying the entire complex.
text: Several smaller tunnels lead off of this room; Eddie
text: opens a door to one of them, peers down:
speaker_heading: P.O.V.
text: at the end of the tunnel, he can see workers moving past
text: an opening. They are lab personnel, dressed in casual
text: clothes. Eddie removes his slicker and hard hat, then
text: enters the tunnel.
scene_heading: SMALLER TUNNEL
text: with cables running the length: Eddie moves through the
text: tunnel as the CAMERA MOVES with him along the length of
dialog: cable and we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Lily is being led by a security GUARD along a corridor to
dialog: a
speaker_heading: ROOM
text: which she enters. It is minimally furnished with a bed
text: and desk and nothing else; a door leads to a small
text: bathroom. She turns to the guard:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Sorry. I'd ask you in but the
text: place is a mess.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Yes, Ma'am.
text: She closes the door in his face. AND WE CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INTERSECTION
text: where the tunnel ends and a series of corridors lead in
text: different directions. Eddie enters from the tunnel; he
text: chooses a corridor and moves off.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Near the ceiling, a surveillance camera catches Eddie
dialog: unaware. We CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
text: A series of screens with odd, infra red images. One of
text: the screens reveals Eddie as he moves down the corridor -
text: an infra red picture of him that intermittently flashes a
dialog: warning sign:
text: UNIDENTIFIED. A security OFFICER checking the screens
text: picks up a phone:
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: We have an unregistered party in
dialog: corridor thirty four.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Eddie moves past doors announcing various research
text: projects. Through the window he can see a Saudi Prince
text: with a robed entourage playing with a deadly contraption.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICERS
text: move down another corridor, checking in rooms as they
dialog: pass.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: rounds a corner, then stops. He is stupefied.
text: He is standing in the midst of a duplicate of the lab in
text: Chicago. It is a stunning sight.
text: Technicians move about, checking equipment. Eddie hears
text: something behind him. He wheels, finds a half dozen
text: armed security guards, their weapons pointing at him.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Put your hands over your head.
dialog: Don't move...
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: A war room: a world map - a mosaic of real-time
text: satellite images - dominates rows of empty desks and
text: consoles. Eddie sits under the watchful eye of a pair of
dialog: guards.
text: The door opens, and Shannon enters. He nods to the
text: guards, and they exit, leaving Shannon and Eddie alone.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Hello, Eddie. You did well.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where's Lily?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Don't worry, you'll see her.
dialog: You hungry? Want something to
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No.
text: Shannon crosses to him, sits.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: How much have you figured out?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Only that you're a liar.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Partly true. The money for the
dialog: lab was coming from the CIA. I
dialog: couldn't be honest about it,
dialog: because we'd never have gotten
dialog: Bucky if he knew. I'm under
dialog: contract to them. I was
dialog: reporting our progress. I had
dialog: no idea they'd killed Bucky, and
dialog: no idea that they'd blown up the
dialog: lab.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: They planted the money on me?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You were just an accident. If
dialog: you hadn't gone back to the lab
dialog: and discovered Bucky, you might
dialog: have been left alone.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: And Chen?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: They needed a cover story. He
dialog: was convenient.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why did they kill Bucky?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: He's was going to make his
dialog: discovery public. It's why they
text: blew up the lab.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: But they had a duplicate lab.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: From your information.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What'll they do with Bucky's
dialog: invention?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Develop it. Make sure American
dialog: companies are ready for it.
dialog: Make sure they can profit from
dialog: it.
text: Eddie shakes his head:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Bucky was going to give it
dialog: away...
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: That's not the way the world
dialog: works, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: The world works the way we make
dialog: it work! Everything else is
dialog: bullshit!
speaker_heading: SHANNON
text: The world is full of fear. Full
dialog: of greed. It's full of people
text: struggling for an advantage.
dialog: You still have to live in it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: And how do you do that?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You make compromises. You make
dialog: choices. Sometimes it's not
dialog: between good and bad, it's
dialog: between bad and worse. But you
dialog: still choose.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You lied to him. You betrayed
dialog: him, and now you're just looking
dialog: to justify it.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: His way isn't the only way,
dialog: Eddie. Bucky was a dreamer. He
dialog: had a great way with college
dialog: kids, that's what he was good
dialog: at.
dialog: Eddie explodes:
dialog: Pause;
dialog: he
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then what are you good at?
dialog: Shannon. I trusted you! I
dialog: believed in you!
dialog: I made Lily trust you!
text: looks as if he might weep:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Where is she? I want to see
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie, I'm going to offer you
dialog: both a choice. They need your
dialog: help. To make Bucky's invention
dialog: work. You and Lily.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: They can't get it to work?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: No.
text: Dumb motherfuckers is what Eddie thinks. He shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What if I say no?
text: The doors suddenly swing open, and Collier enters,
text: crossing to Eddie and Shannon.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: If you say no, Eddie, you'll
dialog: miss a chance at history.
dialog: You'll miss a chance at one of
dialog: the great discoveries of the
dialog: modern age. You'll miss a
dialog: chance at a long and prosperous
dialog: life. You and Lily. Think
dialog: about it.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: A small conference room, a few chairs and a table, where
text: Lily sits. The door opens: Eddie stands in the corridor
text: with an armed guard. Lily's eyes widen with relief, then
text: fill with tears.
text: She draws him in, closes the door behind him, embraces
text: him tightly. Before he can speak, she puts a finger to
text: his lips, takes a pen and writes on the
scene_heading: PALM OF HER HAND
text: a single word: "bugged."
text: Eddie takes the pen, writes on
speaker_heading: HIS OWN PALM:
dialog: "Don't trust them."
text: She embraces him again.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Eddie and Lily are accompanied by Shannon and a small
text: group of scientists and technicians.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: We understand the function of
dialog: the catalyst and the laser
dialog: application, which makes the
dialog: reaction self sustaining. But
dialog: we can't seem to control it, and
dialog: this makes the process highly
dialog: dangerous. We think the nozzle
dialog: you've built is what makes it
dialog: controllable. But for some
dialog: reason, we don't have the specs
dialog: for the nozzle, and we can't
dialog: seem to duplicate your work.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I want to see Chen. I can't do
dialog: it without Chen.
text: The scientist nods, then casts a glance at Shannon.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Eddie, Lily, Shannon and a pair of armed guards move down
text: a long corridor into an area marked "Hospital".
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY
text: The ward is equipped with two dozen beds, ready for the
text: disasters envisioned by Cold War planners. At the far
text: end, a single bed is occupied and attended by a NURSE.
text: Eddie, Lily, Shannon and the guards enter and cross to
text: the occupied bed.
speaker_heading: CHEN
text: lies on the bed, his breathing aided by a an automatic
text: respirator, its mechanical INHALE and EXHALE EERILY LOUD.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: How is he today?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No change.
text: Lily takes Chen's hand in her own. It is nearly
text: imperceptible, but we can SEE Chen's hand squeeze Lily's,
dialog: twice.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Can we be alone with him? Just
dialog: for a minute?
text: Shannon considers. At last, he nods to the guards, and
text: he, the nurse and the guards exit, leaving Lily and Eddie
text: alone with Chen.
text: Eddie makes a rapid inspection of the bed, the walls, the
text: medicine cart nearby - no bugs. But he sees Chen's free
text: hand moving feebly along the bed to a spot near his
text: pillow. Eddie lifts the mattress just far enough.
text: There's the bug. And WE CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
text: A security officer listens and as WE MOVE IN ON HIS
text: EARPHONES, WE HEAR the SOUND
text: of Chen's respirator, a deep, rasping inhale and exhale
dialog: and WE CUT TO...
scene_heading: INT. - HOSPITAL WARD - DAY
text: ...Chen's bedside, only it's not Chen's breathing but
text: Eddie forcing air from an inflated hot water bottle to
text: simulate the raspy sound for the hidden bug as Lily bends
text: over Chen and listens to Chen's whispered words. And as
text: WE MOVE IN, we can HEAR them too: they're in Chinese.
text: She turns to Eddie, searching his eyes out with her
dialog: own...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Lily emerges from the ward, crosses to Shannon, waiting
text: with the guards.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You bastards. Get him to a real
dialog: hospital and we'll help you.
text: Shannon peers into the hospital ward at Eddie, sitting
text: with Chen, holding onto his hand.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
dialog: And we CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: The machine shop is outfitted in a way that makes Eddie's
text: Chicago shop seem amateurish.
text: Eddie pokes through the various materials, neatly stored
dialog: on shelves as
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY
text: hospital personnel place Chen on a gurney and wheel him
dialog: to the corridor and
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Lily moves through the lab with Shannon, Collier and a
dialog: small group of scientists:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: The laser timing?
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Computer controlled, using your
dialog: data.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: And auxiliary power?
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Automatically, in the event of
dialog: main source failure.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I think you're using discarded
dialog: data here.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Can you update?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I think so.
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Eddie is at the lathe, turning his nozzle, shaping it
text: carefully. Two scientists watch over his shoulder as
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Chen's gurney is loaded onto the elevator and it begins
dialog: it's ascent as
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Eddie inserts the plunger into the nozzle and checks its
text: play: He passes the nozzle to the scientists, and while
text: they inspect it, we see Eddie slip a metal cylinder into
dialog: his pocket. And we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
text: Lily enters new data into the computers under the
dialog: watchful eye of scientists and
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: the elevator door opens and the hospital personnel wheel
text: Chen's gurney to a waiting ambulance and
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Eddie squirms under the water tank, placing the nozzle in
dialog: it's appropriate housing as Shannon, Collier and the
text: scientists observe. He removes the old housing, places
text: it on the floor beside him, and as Shannon and Collier
text: study the new nozzle in place, we see that the old
text: housing has disappeared.
scene_heading: INT. LUNCH ROOM - DAY
text: The scientists and technicians sit at a long table,
text: eating their cafeteria fare. At the far end of
text: the table, Eddie and Lily sit side by side. As always,
text: Lily's head is bent over a computer print out, which she
text: is checking with her pencil, making notes on the margins.
speaker_heading: PRINTOUT
text: In the middle of her technical comments, she has scrawled
dialog: a note: "reprog okay".
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: nods, he's seen it. She overwrites the note with a
dialog: series of figures.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - NIGHT
text: The lights are out, save for a few work lights that cast
text: eerie shadows over the equipment.
text: Standing in the half dark is Shannon. Thinking. He
text: crosses to the water tank, peers down at the nozzle,
text: newly installed. He runs his hand over it, but there's
dialog: no way that he can judge it's construction.
text: There's also no way that he can ignore his suspicions.
speaker_heading: OFFICE AREA
text: Shannon is reading through a stack of computer print
dialog: outs, much like the ones we've seen Lily with.
text: He sits back in his chair, rubs his eyes. Then he
text: notices a the wastebasket nearby, filled with print outs.
text: Idly, he pokes through them.
speaker_heading: PRINTOUTS
text: Lily's figuring on the margins. Something draws his eye
text: to one of the sheets: it's the note Lily has scrawled,
text: still legible through her overwriting.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER CENTER
text: Shannon is watching as the computer spits out a series of
text: pages. He gathers a stack of them, sits down at a desk
text: and begins comparing a set of sheets with another set
text: already on the desk. He reads.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - NIGHT
text: Shannon is in the lab, rolling his cigar back and forth
text: in his fingers. The door opens, and Eddie is led in by a
text: guard. Shannon nods to the guard.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Thank you.
text: The guard exits, leaving Eddie and Shannon alone among
text: the shadows.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You'll never get away with it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: with what?
text: He motions to a pile of computer printouts he has in his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I'm sure it's clever. I'm sure
text: it uses Lily's help.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I don't know either, exactly.
dialog: They're not fools, you know.
dialog: They'll figure it out. Why
dialog: don't you tell me what it is?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why don't you figure it out?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Are you that brave, Eddie? Are
dialog: you willing to risk that much?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Suppose we make it work. What
dialog: happens to us then?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: They'll give you a new life.
dialog: Another name, another country,
dialog: if necessary.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: They're not monsters. They're
text: just caught in a bad spot.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: They've killed Bucky! They
dialog: destroyed his dream. It was my
dialog: dream, too.
dialog: What good would it do to get a
dialog: new life if I had to be a part
dialog: of that?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You have a lot to live for,
dialog: Eddie. You're like a son to me.
dialog: I never had a family, so I made
dialog: one up. You and Chen and Lily,
dialog: everyone at the lab. And Bucky,
text: like a crazy old uncle.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You threw it away. Don't you
dialog: understand? You threw it away!
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You don't always get what you
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You lied! You want me to do the
dialog: same thing.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I want you to understand. I
dialog: wish I could make you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You already have.
text: And their eyes meet and hold. Shannon's seem to harbor a
text: deep sadness.
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL EXIT - DAY
text: Workers emerge from the elevator as the next shift
text: prepares to descend.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Collier, Shannon, and a group of scientists cluster
text: together as the technicians busy themselves with a test.
text: Not far away are Eddie and Lily.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Main power.
text: The odd hum of machinery again. In the tank, small
text: bubbles appear at the edges of the electrodes.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Injector...
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: move, as if by instinct, closer to one another. Eddie
text: slips his hand around Lily's; their fingers tighten
text: together, then intertwine. A BELL RINGS as
scene_heading: SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS
text: slip dark glasses over their eyes.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: Laser...
text: The laser glows, bouncing its beams off the mirrors.
text: The water tank begins to shudder as the water roils.
speaker_heading: SCIENTIST
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Cavitation sound waves...
text: A Technician at the console moves a control forward and
dialog: the
speaker_heading: NOZZLE
text: hums, turning the water blue.
scene_heading: SHANNON AND COLLIER
text: cross to the tank, watch, expectantly, as the shuddering
text: continues. A long moment as Collier peers down at the
text: nozzle. He turns to Shannon, consternation growing.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Wait.
text: He's seen this before. He turns to Eddie, stares hard at
text: him, then back to the tank, which is shuddering
dialog: dangerously now. And Shannon knows:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Shut it down.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
text: draws the main power switch to its off position. The hum
text: of machinery dies. In the silence that follows, Shannon
text: turns to Eddie again:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie...
text: But before he can add another word, the hum suddenly
text: returns, and the roiling of water in the tank increases.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Shut it down!
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: It is down!
text: He maneuvers the master switch, but the hum and the
text: shuddering in the tank seem to grow.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (continued)
dialog: It's not responding!
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie!
text: But Eddie is already moving, toward Collier, something in
text: his hand, shiny, metallic...
text: He grabs Collier, holds the object to Collier's temple
text: and now we can see what it is-a crudely shaped, lethal
text: looking pistol, fashioned from spare parts in the machine
dialog: shop.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Pull the alarm!
text: No one moves.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Pull the alarm!
text: He cocks the hammer.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Do what he says:
text: A technician crosses to the emergency alarm, pulls the
text: switch. A loud WAILING SIREN suddenly adds its noise to
text: the shuddering tank.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get these people out of here.
dialog: Clear the tunnel!
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Do it!
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Do it! All of you!
text: The scientists and technicians head for the doors.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lily...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Eddie, no...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Time to go, Lily. Get out.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: It won't work, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You want to take a chance?
text: He points the pistol at Shannon.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: He's bluffing. I don't think he
dialog: has any ammunition in that
dialog: thing.
text: Eddie returns the pistol to Collier's temple.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Shall we demonstrate?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Tony, for Christ sake!
text: Shannon reaches into his coat, draws out a small
text: automatic pistol. He crosses to Lily, hold the
text: gun to her.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Go ahead. Let's see what's real
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Let her go.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Shoot, Eddie.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Don't shoot!
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: On three, Eddie. One... two...
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Shannon; goddamit
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Last call, Eddie.
text: Eddie drops his pistol to the floor. Collier lets out a
text: long breath, mops the sweat from his forehead.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Make him shut the damn thing
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: How do we do it, Eddie?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Guess.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I've already guessed. You're
dialog: using auxiliary power. Lily,
dialog: isn't that right?
dialog: You reprogrammed the computer so
dialog: that when the main power was
dialog: shut down, it would read as a
dialog: power failure. Very smart. So
dialog: all we have to do is shut down
dialog: the back up!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It doesn't matter what you do.
dialog: This whole thing is worthless,
dialog: anyway.
dialog: You might as well let it blow.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Why, Lily?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Because Bucky was smarter than
dialog: all of you. He knew someone was
dialog: Stealing his information, so he
dialog: kept part of the data secret.
dialog: Not even Chen knew what it was.
dialog: The stuff you were sending to
dialog: this lab had a missing element,
dialog: and only Bucky knew it. And you
dialog: killed him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: The goose that laid the golden
dialog: egg. What about it, George?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: I think they're lying.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I don't think so. Not this
dialog: time.
text: Collier crosses to a phone.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: I'm getting the power shut down.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I wouldn't do that.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: What do you mean?
text: He looks up to find Shannon's pistol pointed at him.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Get out, Eddie. Lily.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Are you mad?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Eddie, do me a favor. Pick up
dialog: that phone and call 911. Tell
dialog: them you want Agent Ford from
dialog: the FBI here.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Tony, don't be stupid...
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Shut up, George. Go on, Eddie,
dialog: make the call.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We can all get out...
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Make the call!
text: Eddie crosses to the phone, dials:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We've got an emergency here.
dialog: We'd like you to get Agent
dialog: Raymond Ford from the FBI...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Shannon!
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Good, Eddie. Now go.
text: No mistaking his intent; Eddie grabs Lily by the hand and
text: they run. Shannon crosses to the hydrogen holding tank
text: still holding his pistol on Collier. He opens the valve,
text: and deadly hydrogen gas spills into the lab with a loud
dialog: HISS...
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: Eddie and Lily burst through the doors to the lab and
text: head for the elevator. But rounding a corner and looking
dialog: up, they see the
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
text: loaded with lab and security personnel, ascending to the
dialog: surface.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This way!
text: They turn, race down the tunnel as
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARDS
text: from the lab area recognize Eddie and Lily:
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Don't let them get away!
text: They chase, one of the guards barking into his radio
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF TUNNEL
text: ...asS Eddie and Lily reach a concrete form: they are
text: blocked by another pair of guards. Eddie grabs Lily's
text: hand, leads her down a narrow space between the wall and
text: the concrete form, barely wide enough for them pass.
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: Inch their way forward. It's a tight, claustrophobic
text: squeeze, and Lily has to fight her panic.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hold on... hold on...
text: He gives her his hand, tries to reassure her as
speaker_heading: A GUARD
text: follows them into the space, a short way behind.
speaker_heading: TUNNEL
text: Another guard, seeing Eddie and Lily behind the form,
text: throws the compression controls; the hydraulic arm starts
text: to move and the form closes to the walls as
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: can barely edge forward, the space growing smaller and
dialog: smaller, the stuff of nightmares:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Eddie! I can't...
text: And at the last moment, Eddie clears the form, pulling
text: Lily with him. They leap down to the tunnel floor as
speaker_heading: THE GUARD
text: following them through the narrow space is crushed, his
text: blood seeping down the wall below like an ugly paint.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Shannon holds Collier at bay with his pistol.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Well, George, we're in a real
dialog: pickle, aren't we? If I shoot,
dialog: you're dead. But the shot would
dialog: set this whole place off, so I'm
dialog: dead, too. What are we gonna
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: I don't know, Tony. Why don't
dialog: you put the gun down?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: It's sort of like the arms race,
dialog: isn't it? What was the phrase?
dialog: Mutually Assured Destruction?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Yes, that's it.
text: Collier is sweating profusely.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: What do you say we negotiate?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Yes, that's fine. That's a good
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: We'll both make a full
dialog: confession of how we happen to
dialog: be here. You write how it was
dialog: that Bucky died. I'll write how
dialog: it was I've been lying to
dialog: Congress. Then we'll exchange
dialog: confessions. I'll have yours
dialog: and you'll have mine. That way,
dialog: we'll each be protected if the
text: other decides to go to the FBI.
dialog: Is that fair?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Tony, I'm going to turn around
dialog: and walk out of here. You,
dialog: won't shoot.
text: Shannon cocks the pistol, loudly.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Are you certain?
text: Collier finds himself staring down the barrel of the
dialog: pistol.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: You are mad.
text: Shannon places his pen on the table between them.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: We have some paper here, don't
dialog: we?
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: Eddie and Lily race toward the conveyor belt, carrying
text: crushed rock upward from the tunnel to the surface.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get on it:
text: She turns to him as if he's crazy:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Lily, get on!
text: And he practically has to put her on it himself, before
text: leaping on behind her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get down!
speaker_heading: GUARDS
text: chasing the two of them race past the conveyor belt and
text: on down the tunnel.
speaker_heading: CONVEYOR BELT
text: Eddie and Lily ride the belt. Lily, ahead, looks
text: forward, sees that the rocks are being carried
text: toward a compressor. She turns, shouts:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Eddie!
text: And now, Eddie sees it too. He turns, looks behind him:
text: a guard has seen him on the belt. He jumps on, begins
text: moving up the belt toward Eddie and Lily. As he closes
text: in, Eddie notices a pipe stretching across the conveyor
dialog: belt:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Grab onto the pipe!
text: LILY turns, she is closing on the pipe:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lily!
text: Can she do it? She reaches out, grabs for the pipe, but
text: her hand slips off. The belt carries her just beyond and
text: she turns and tries again - this time, she manages to
dialog: hold on:
text: Behind her, Eddie approaches the pipe. He reaches for it
text: and the two of them now hang side by side as
speaker_heading: THE GUARD
text: riding the belt behind them approaches, trying to aim his
text: weapon at them. But the belt is unsteady and he can't
text: quite manage as he draws closer and closer and
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: holding onto the pipe, swings his boot at the guard,
text: catching him flush on the jaw and the guard goes down
text: onto the conveyor belt and is carried up toward the
dialog: compressor as
speaker_heading: LILY
text: watches, over her shoulder, finally turns away, can't
dialog: bear to look as the guard is... compressed.
speaker_heading: EDDIE AND LILY
text: make their way, hand over hand, away from the moving belt
text: until they are clear and can jump down onto the tunnel
text: floor. They run...
scene_heading: INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Collier is finished writing. He puts Shannon's pen down.
text: Shannon picks up the paper and reads. And while he
text: reads, he chats:
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: You love science, George?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Very much. Yes.
text: He speaks to Shannon as if Shannon has lost his mind.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: So do I. We could have been
dialog: famous. One of the great
dialog: discoveries of the modern age,
dialog: indeed. It's not enough, is it?
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: What isn't enough?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Science, George. It doesn't
dialog: make us better people. This is
dialog: excellent.
text: The HISS of the hydrogen leak seems like a howl now. The
text: water tank shudders with such force that a metal tipped
text: strap breaks loose, slams with great force against the
text: floor, again and again.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: That looks very dangerous.
text: Shannon folds the paper neatly, puts it in his pocket.
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Bucky was right, wasn't he? We
dialog: need new ways of being human.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Aren't you going to write your
dialog: confession?
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: Actually, I've change my mind.
text: And as Collier watches with growing alarm, Shannon coolly
text: rises and crosses toward the door.
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Shannon!
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: Eddie and Lily emerge from the tunnel into the daylight.
text: The RADIATION ALARM is still screaming as lab personnel
text: and construction workers scramble for safety. Eddie and
text: Lily join in the throng, running for the perimeter of the
dialog: site as
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE FACILITY - DAY
text: Agent Ford pulls up in his car and stops, gets out and
text: watches agape as the mob runs toward him.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
text: Shannon runs for the huge submarine doors, now open at
text: the end of the tunnel. Behind him, Collier chases:
speaker_heading: COLLIER
dialog: Shannon, for god's sake...
text: Shannon leaps through the doors, turns, manages to stare
text: into Collier's frantic eyes just before he slams the huge
text: doors shut. He grabs some construction rods piled by the
text: doors, inserts them through the door handles so that they
text: bar the door from opening.
scene_heading: OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS
text: Collier frantically presses the automatic controls,
text: trying to open the doors. They shudder, but the force of
text: the construction bars is too strong and the doors don't
dialog: open.
text: Collier races for the lab.
