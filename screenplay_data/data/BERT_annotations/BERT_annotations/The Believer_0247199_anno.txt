dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: A run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old-
dialog: fashioned desks. These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews:
text: normal American kids in yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV
text: ZINGESSER is young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: And why did the Holy One -- blessed
dialog: be He -- do this? Why did he ask
dialog: Abraham to sacrifice his only son,
dialog: whom he loved?
dialog: 
text: Two boys off to one side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose)
text: and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath....
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: Isaac wasn't his only son. Ishmael
dialog: was his son, too.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD AVI
dialog: The only son he loved.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: Oh, they only kill them when they
dialog: love them...?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD STUART
dialog: (up front; answering Zingesser)
dialog: It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of
dialog: his devotion to God.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: It's not about Abraham's faith. It's
dialog: about God's power. God says, "You
dialog: know how powerful I am? I can make
dialog: you do anything I want, no matter how
dialog: stupid. Even kill your own son.
dialog: Because I'm everything, you're nothing."
dialog: 
text: TITTERS. Danny looks around at his classmates: nerds,
text: wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids in back furtively read the
text: racing form under their desks. He hates them for their
text: indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's
text: ass-kissing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: But, Danny, if HaShem is everything,
dialog: and we are nothing how are we to
dialog: judge His actions?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: We have free will and intelligence --
dialog: which God allegedly gave us....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVI
dialog: Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill
dialog: Isaac. He provides the ram so that --
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: Personally, I think that's a lie. I
dialog: think he did kill him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: You think?! Based on what?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: There's midrash supporting this. My
dialog: father read a book by Shalom Spiegel
dialog: that -- Isaac actually died and was
text: reborn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
text: No one follows that midrash.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: I do; I follow it. But okay, say God
dialog: provided the ram. So what? Once
text: Abraham raised the knife, in his
dialog: heart it was as if he'd killed him.
dialog: He could never forget that. And
dialog: neither could Isaac. Look at him:
text: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the
dialog: rest of his life. By the end he can't
dialog: tell Jacob from Esau....
dialog: 
text: The kids laugh. Zingesser CRACKS a ruler against a desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: Watch your language....
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: (rising impassioned)
dialog: I think the whole Jewish people were
dialog: permanently scarred by what happened
dialog: on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in
dialog: terror....
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD STUART
dialog: Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: Fear of God makes you afraid of
dialog: everything. All the Jews are good at
text: is being afraid. And being sacrificed.
dialog: 
text: Oooo. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK. Even the guys with the sports
text: pages are shocked by that one.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD STUART
dialog: Don't you believe in God?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: I'm the only one here who does
dialog: believe. You say he's mysterious, yet
dialog: merciful. I see him for the power-
dialog: drunk madman He is. And we're
dialog: supposed to worship such a Deity?? I
dialog: say Never! I say...fight him. I say --
dialog: 
text: The ruler has been CRACKING from "power-drunk" on.... Now
text: Zingesser grabs Danny, yanks him out of his chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: Avi -- ask Rabbi Springer to come
dialog: remove Danny from the class....
dialog: 
text: Avi rises, grinning, as...Danny struggles wildly to get free.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: And you, if you had come out of Egypt,
dialog: you would have been destroyed in the
dialog: desert with those who worshipped the
dialog: Golden Calf.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
dialog: Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him
dialog: crush me like the conceited bully He is.
dialog: (to the ceiling)
dialog: Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
dialog: 
text: The class sits frozen in terror, waiting for God to kill
text: Danny. But nothing happens.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny runs down the steps alone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher,
text: blonder) coming toward him. He slips off his yarmulke and
text: slants across the street. The kids slant that way. He hears
text: a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station.
text: He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER
dialog: 
text: The train passes above used car lots, discount furniture
text: stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a
text: station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting
text: them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a
dialog: YARMULKE. Danny grown up?
dialog: 
text: PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The
text: doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly
text: notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of
text: the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is
dialog: being watched.
dialog: 
text: REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a "SUEDE-HEAD"
text: (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric).
dialog: 
text: SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up
text: his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the
text: handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left
text: the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands
text: directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke
text: pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt
text: collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,
dialog: dandruff, ingrown facial hair...
dialog: 
text: He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a
text: little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede-
text: head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide
text: farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede-
text: head presses into the boy's knees.
dialog: 
text: The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's
dialog: left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African-
text: American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands
text: at once what is going on.
dialog: 
text: Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns
text: to his paper. Suede-head eases him aside and steps on the
dialog: boy's shoe.
dialog: 
text: SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: The wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free.
text: The boy still hasn't looked up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUEDE-HEAD &amp; THE JEWISH BOY
dialog: 
text: swaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. Suede-head
text: forces the boy into ever more contorted postures,
text: increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. And
text: the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he
text: keeps highlighting relevant passages.
dialog: 
text: The train slows. The boy closes the book, caps the
text: highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up,
text: wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head. The doors open, he
text: gets off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STATION -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Looking up a long escalator, the Jewish boy riding down
dialog: toward us.
dialog: 
text: Suede-head arrives on the run at the top, races down a
text: flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal
dialog: slope....
dialog: 
text: Lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the
text: escalator.
dialog: 
text: The boy rides inexorably down. At the bottom, he tries to go
text: around Suede-head who blocks this way, then another, driving
text: him into a corner.
dialog: 
text: The boy realizes he has nowhere to go -- finally turns to
text: face his tormentor. Their eyes meet for the first time. He
text: is actually bigger than Suede-head, but not nearly as strong.
text: He won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no
text: longer deny. There is even an odd relief that disgusts
dialog: Suede-head more than all the rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUEDE-HEAD
dialog: Fucking kike.
dialog: 
text: He slaps him in the face. He stumbles backward. As Suede-
text: head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front
text: of him. Suede-head punches the books straight into his face.
text: The boy falls, curls into a fetal position. Suede-head kicks
dialog: him....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUEDE-HEAD
dialog: Get up.... Get the fuck up....
dialog: 
text: He won't budge. Suede-head punches him repeatedly until he
text: hears VOICES approaching. He runs back up the stairs to the
text: train and only as we FOLLOW him do we realize that he is our
text: protagonist. This is Danny grown up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S STUDIO APARTMENT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Like his brain, the room is at once crowded and tidy and has,
dialog: so far as we can see, neither windows nor doors. Shelves of
text: books, CDs, magazines, videotapes loom over a neatly made bed.
dialog: 
text: Danny, in briefs and boots, is lifting weights. The phone
text: rings. A machine picks up: no outgoing message, only a BEEP.
dialog: Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Is this working? I'm trying to reach
dialog: Danny Balint...Danny, it's Vicki, we
dialog: met at Happy Jack's last month...?
dialog: 
text: He keeps doing curls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: I was hoping maybe we could...get
dialog: together again... Give me a call --
scene_heading: 718-555-0193.
dialog: 
text: She hangs up. A moment later Danny finishes the set, gasping
text: for air, heart pounding, muscles throbbing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAME -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A radio is playing the news. Danny sits at a small desk, on
text: the phone and browsing the Internet, a take-out menu beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: ...Is it completely vegetarian?
dialog: ...What do they make the stock
dialog: from?... Not chicken, you're sure?...
dialog: And no dairy... No, no cheese I don't
dialog: eat cheese... Yeah, all right. And
dialog: the tropical fruit shake... How long?...
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: A tough working-class Queens bar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Men drink in clusters, including a group of skinheads....
text: Danny takes a place alone at the bar, drawing furtive
text: attention from the regulars. When the BARTENDER finally
text: comes over...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Vodka tonic.
dialog: 
text: A strange call for this place. As he waits, Danny turns and
text: watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him.
dialog: 
text: The girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One of
text: them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it. The
text: others try to calm him, and when they look back, Danny has
text: left. He barely touched the drink.
dialog: 
text: The skins are puzzled, but one indicates his watch: time to
dialog: go. They gather their stuff....
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY/INT. 7 TRAIN -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Looking out the front of the train as it rushes toward
text: Manhattan. A dramatic sky rises above the skyline.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The three skins -- O.L., CARLETON, BILLINGS -- walk up an
text: East Side street. Billings is telling a story....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: ...So she takes the pants in back --
dialog: where they try them on? And I think
dialog: fuck it....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: She's been giving me the eye. She's
dialog: hot. So I wait till the owner goes up
dialog: front....
dialog: 
text: During this, O.L. starts to SPRAY PAINT a crude SWASTIKA
text: onto a BUS KIOSK. A VOICE startles them....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What are you doing??
dialog: 
text: They jump, turn. Danny steps out of the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (indicating swastika)
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (coming toward them)
dialog: Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks,
dialog: you can't even make a decent
dialog: swastika.... Give me the paint.
dialog: (O.L. looks to his friends)
dialog: Give it to me.
dialog: 
text: Danny's will is stronger; O.L. hands over the spray can.
text: Danny shakes it, critiques O.L.'s rendering....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (gruff but avuncular)
dialog: It's too squared off. You got to
text: orient it up and down, diamond-shaped,
dialog: like this....
dialog: (sprays an excellent swastika)
text: ...The arms go clockwise.
dialog: (hands the can back)
dialog: You're going to Curtis Zampf; me, too.
dialog: Let's go?
dialog: 
text: They exchange looks: how did he know about Curtis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS ZAMPF (O.S.)
dialog: ...Where I grew up in South Boston
dialog: twenty years ago, when a kid walked
dialog: down the street, everyone knew who he
dialog: was...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grand but threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like a child,
text: Carleton like a sardonic adolescent, Billings like a
text: revolutionary, Danny like an uncrowned prince.
dialog: 
text: CURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests. He is 40
text: but appears younger; with rough good looks, longish hair and
text: a leather jacket, he seems more like an aging rock star or
dialog: sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: ...If he ran out in front of a car,
dialog: some old Mick'd yell at him, "Jimmy
dialog: Dunne, get back on that sidewalk and
dialog: stay there...."
dialog: 
text: He does the Boston Irish accent so well, everybody laughs.
text: Up front we notice the only WOMAN in the room. She is in her
text: 40s, regal, beautiful, forbidding. Her name is LINA MOEBIUS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: ...The day he graduated high school,
dialog: he'd go see his uncle down at the gas
dialog: works, or the priest's brother in the
dialog: shipyard, get his apprentice papers,
dialog: eight years later he'd be making
dialog: $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play
dialog: ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and
dialog: when he died, the whole town'd get
text: drunk and cry over him....
dialog: 
text: The crowd -- nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers,
dialog: unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off-duty cops --
text: listens quietly.
dialog: 
text: During this, a young woman (CARLA) appears from the rear of
text: the apartment, heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and
text: a history book. She glances into the living room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: ...Today, when that kid walks down
text: the street it's full of trash and
text: half the faces are black. The
dialog: shipyard's closed, all the jobs at
text: the gas works are set-asides, and by
text: the time he drops out of school, he
dialog: can barely get a job at Burger King.
dialog: So he drinks, smokes crack, and when
text: he hangs himself on the front porch
dialog: at twenty-three, the only people at
text: his wake are a couple of buddies and
dialog: his mother. The boy's father won't
dialog: find out he's dead till six months
dialog: later.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The soul of this country is being
dialog: destroyed, and all the government can
dialog: offer is free trade, mutual funds and
dialog: IPOs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY DANIELSEN
dialog: You sound like a leftist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I used to be one.... No, seriously, I
dialog: called myself an anarchist. I stood
dialog: up for the oppressed. I opposed state
dialog: power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AN OLD COOT
dialog: Don't you still?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I oppose the present state because
dialog: it's weak. It has been ever since the
dialog: left emasculated it over Vietnam. But
dialog: I think the average man is crushed
dialog: less by accumulated capital than the
dialog: loss of community or real leadership,
dialog: the personal emptiness he simply
dialog: cannot fill on his own....
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: That's why I'm a fascist. It's the
dialog: only form of government that
dialog: addresses our deepest needs.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Danny -- who has spotted Carla -- begins to clap, a
text: few others join in. Danny raises his hand; Curtis nods to
dialog: him....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What do you think the fascism of the
dialog: twenty-first century will look like?
dialog: 
text: Everyone -- including Carla -- turns to see who asked that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: More cultural than political.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Obviously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Decentralized, nonviolent,
dialog: increasingly mainstream. We'll see
dialog: antiabortion, anti-immigration groups
dialog: form alliances with the gun lobby,
dialog: Christian identity types, tax resisters
dialog: and even some libertarians....
dialog: 
text: The crowd seems impressed, but restless and bored.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD COOT
dialog: What about race?
dialog: 
text: A stirring: many share the concern. Lina watches closely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: This isn't the time for that.
dialog: 
text: Murmurs of surprise, disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I disagree.
dialog: (glances at Carla)
dialog: I think race is central to everything
dialog: we're talking about.
dialog: (murmurs of agreement)
dialog: Spiritual life comes from race. From
dialog: the blood. Without that, we're no
dialog: better than the Jews....
dialog: 
text: The magic word. The whole room comes alive. Zampf grimaces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: What's wrong with the Jews?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: Carla...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Too difficult?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul
dialog: Virilio?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The point is, the modern world is a
dialog: Jewish disease.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Disease? What disease?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Abstraction. They're obsessed with
dialog: abstraction.
dialog: 
text: That stops the conversation. But Carla is intrigued; here is
text: someone whose mind moves in strange and interesting realms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (GUY DANIELSEN)
dialog: What would you propose?
dialog: 
text: The questioner is a young man (GUY DANIELSEN), better spoken
text: than the others. Danny feels all eyes on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Killing Jews.
dialog: 
text: A tremor of fear and excitement ripples through the room.
text: Zampf glances at Mrs. Moebius; she is watching Danny intently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: That would be a catastrophic mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: People hate Jews. Do you agree?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: They used to. Today it's not an issue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, but deep down, beneath the
dialog: "tolerance" they learn on television,
dialog: nothing's changed. The very word
dialog: makes their skin crawl.
dialog: (around the room people nod)
dialog: It isn't even hate, really. It's more
dialog: the way we feel when a rat runs
dialog: across the floor. We want to step on
dialog: it. Crush it. We don't even know why.
dialog: It's a physical reaction. Everyone
dialog: feels it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY DANIELSEN
dialog: Which ones would you kill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Prominent Jews. Who are either
dialog: symbols in themselves or who
dialog: represent aspects of the Jewish
dialog: character people despise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY DANIELSEN
dialog: Such as?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD COOT
dialog: Barbra Streisand.
dialog: 
text: Mutterings: "Who's she?" "Yeah, her..." But Danny says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Too obvious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Kissinger...Dershowitz...Roseanne...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yes. And Larry King...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD COOT
dialog: Is he Jewish?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: ...Leona Helmsley, Michael Eisner, Bob
dialog: Dylan, Phillip Roth, Ruth Bader
dialog: Ginsberg, Steven Spielberg, Winona
dialog: Ryder, Beverly Sills, Alvin Toffler,
dialog: Katherine Graham. All of them. But
dialog: not yet. We don't want celebrity
text: obscuring the issue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Which is what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: At first, no one will know why the
text: victims are being killed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You wouldn't announce it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'd say nothing. After two or three,
dialog: people will try to find a pattern. A
dialog: reason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: But when it comes out, the public
dialog: will be outraged. It will look like
dialog: Germany all over again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Isn't that what we want? Germany all
dialog: over again? Only done right this time...
dialog: 
text: The crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill. Zampf glances at
dialog: Mrs. Moebius....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Without speeches or political parties.
dialog: A movement without leaders so that no
dialog: one can stop it...
dialog: 
text: The room is stunned to silence. Mrs. Moebius signals Curtis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Okay, let's break this up for now....
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: Could you wait a minute...?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAME -- FIVE MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: Danny -- flushed with triumph -- stands looking down at the
dialog: city.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM -- MRS. MOEBIUS &amp; CURTIS ZAMPF
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (low)
dialog: ...I thought we agreed, no anti-
dialog: Semitism...it's exactly what we're
dialog: trying to put behind us.... Trash the
dialog: blacks, fine; but...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: Did you see how they reacted to him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yes, of course. But that only plays
dialog: in this room, with people who aren't
dialog: embarrassed to call themselves Nazis.
dialog: If you want a modern fascism, you
dialog: don't mention Jews.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It
dialog: always has been.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely
dialog: lasted a decade.... Do you really
dialog: want to go down that road again? In
dialog: America of all places, where
dialog: obedience and discipline are not
dialog: exactly the national virtues...
dialog: 
text: She looks over at Danny, now chatting with Carla....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: He's very bright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: He speaks well. But what do we do
dialog: with him?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You mean who he really is.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON DANNY &amp; CARLA
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: You're not in school? What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In
dialog: Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Where'd you read all that stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I just read it....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: Young man...
dialog: 
text: He turns. She's beckoning to him. He gives Carla a look,
text: then crosses to her, sitting in a chair she indicates.
text: Curtis offers him a drink; he declines. Carla takes one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: Lina Moebius. And you are...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Daniel Balint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: Balint?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's German.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA (IN GERMAN)
dialog: What part of Germany are you people from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY (IN GERMAN)
dialog: From the Rhineland originally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA (IN ENGLISH)
dialog: Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?...
dialog: Or any other law enforcement agency?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I was going to ask you the same thing.
dialog: 
text: Smiles, laughter. Everyone seems to relax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: So what are you really after,
dialog: Daniel?... Do you just want to kill
dialog: Jews, or do you have something larger
dialog: in mind?
dialog: 
text: Carla watches, silent. Danny is aware of both mother and
dialog: daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Without blood -- a willingness to
dialog: spill it -- there's no real power, no
dialog: authority.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: (pleased by this)
dialog: Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We're already marginal. We are saying
dialog: what no one else has the guts to say.
dialog: Isn't that precisely our appeal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: So what Jew would you kill first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to
dialog: France. Managing partner at Damon,
dialog: Schwarzchild.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (to Lina, explaining)
text: An investment banking house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: He's Jewish? Manzetti?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Totally. The family emigrated from
dialog: Bulgaria when he was eleven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: How would you kill him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'd have to research it, study his
dialog: routines, his security.... But
text: ideally on a New York street at
text: midday, using a small-caliber
text: automatic without a silencer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Why no silencer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You want it to be an event.
dialog: 
text: Lina stands, takes a sherry. Everyone else rises with her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: Danny, why don't you come visit us in
dialog: the country. We have young men with
dialog: lots of energy and no ideas. Maybe
dialog: you could give them something to
dialog: think about.... Bring your friends,
dialog: if you like....
dialog: 
text: As Curtis leads him toward the door, Danny looks around for
text: Carla, hears WOMEN'S VOICES arguing in German. Frustrated,
text: he goes down the stairs....
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny and the other skins walking down the middle of the
text: street, drinking beer, oblivious to traffic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Bring your friends.... We're not his
dialog: friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Then I won't bring you....
dialog: 
text: The others laugh. Someone HONKS behind them. Billings turns:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: FUCK YOU.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, bonehead...get your moon ass off
dialog: the street.
dialog: 
text: Billings turns and throws his beer at the voice. A CRASH,
text: BREAKING GLASS, a screech of BRAKES, CAR DOORS open and shut...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Why don't you go back to Rwanda and
dialog: give each other AIDS.
dialog: 
text: That does it. The skins run out of frame. SOUNDS of a fight.
text: Danny watches, indifferent, then finally joins in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT LOCKUP -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The skins in a cell. O.L., head bloody, moaning and vomiting.
dialog: 
dialog: O.L.
dialog: I can't see....
dialog: 
text: Carleton comforts him. Billings paces, looks at Danny,
text: sitting against the wall, relaxed for the first time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: What, do you like it here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Read Mein Kampf? Hitler had all his
dialog: best ideas in prison.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFF-SCREEN VOICE
dialog: Daniel Balint?
dialog: 
text: Danny looks up: a JAILER unlocks the cell. Carla appears
text: behind him. Danny stops without stepping through the open door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm not leaving without them.
dialog: 
text: The other skins are surprised, moved. Carla and Danny stare
text: at each other. Finally she turns to the jailer....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Can I use a credit card?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER, SUBWAY ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A Mercedes pulls up, Carla driving. The skins climb out,
text: Carleton guiding O.L., who cannot see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He should go to a hospital.
dialog: 
dialog: O.L.
dialog: I'm okay.
dialog: 
text: Billings turns back, sees Danny still in the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: You coming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: (glances at Carla, stays
dialog: in the car)
dialog: We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
dialog: 
text: Billings nods grudgingly. The car drives off. Carleton grins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: Fucking Danny, man...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: He's an asshole.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Carla leads Danny through the darkened apartment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARLA'S ROOM -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: An old bookcase full of leather-bound German volumes...Danny
text: opens one marked Hofmannsthal. He tries to read a marked
dialog: passage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: "...und die Worte zerfielen mir im
dialog: Munde wie modrige Pilze..."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: "And the words fell apart in my mouth
dialog: like moldering mushrooms..."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How come so many of the books are in
dialog: Spanish?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: They're my father's. He's from
dialog: Argentina. My mother's family went
dialog: there during the war. That's where
dialog: they met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Are they still together?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He's in a mental institution.... He's
dialog: been there for ten years, off and on.
dialog: Mostly on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Is he a Nazi?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I guess. His parents are. He doesn't
dialog: care about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's he care about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Killing himself.
dialog: 
text: They look at each other. There's that gulf between them that
text: they have to cross, but they're not sure how.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You think people ever commit suicide
dialog: out of happiness?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: That's stupid. Why would they?
dialog: 
text: He shrugs. She takes his hand, rubs the bruised knuckles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: You're not like the others, are
dialog: you?... Your friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yes, I am. Basically I am.
dialog: 
text: She leans close, whispers....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Hurt me.
dialog: 
text: He's surprised, but not very. He grabs her wrist, twists it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Ow! That's too hard.
dialog: 
text: He pulls her out of frame. She starts to say something, but
text: it's cut off by another CRY OF PAIN. We keep looking out the
dialog: window....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAME -- LATER
dialog: 
text: The light has shifted across the city, and we hear only a
text: muffled sobbing.
dialog: 
text: The CAMERA TURNS to look at...Carla and Danny naked on the
text: bed. He lies back, reading the German book. She's curled on
text: her side, weeping abjectly. Still sobbing, she rolls over,
text: buries her face in his chest. We see that his neck is
text: scratched up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Do it again....
dialog: 
text: She begins to fondle him. He ignores it until he finishes
text: the poem, then turns to her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAME -- LATER
dialog: 
text: The light has shifted again. Danny sleeps alone, his face
text: strangely innocent. Carla drops onto the bed, shakes him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Get up...you gotta go.
dialog: 
text: He opens his eyes. She's dressed, her hair wet from the
text: shower, a faint puffiness around her mouth. He pulls her
text: down to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: No, you have to leave. I've got to
dialog: write a paper.
dialog: (slaps his stomach hard)
dialog: Out!
dialog: 
text: He looks up. Her face is cold, indifferent. He gets to his feet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny on his way to the door, hears something, turns...CURTIS
text: ZAMPF is coming out of a bedroom in his underwear. From
dialog: within...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA MOEBIUS (O.S.)
dialog: Bring the paper, too.
dialog: 
text: Curtis now sees Danny. A look between them. Danny goes out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. QUEENS, STAIRS TO ELEVATED TRAIN -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Once a Jewish neighborhood, now occupied chiefly by blacks,
text: Latins and more recent immigrants.
dialog: 
text: As Danny (wearing headphones) comes down the steps... TWO
text: BLACK KIDS (big, menacing, boombox) are coming up, blocking
text: his way. Danny walks right between them, forcing them apart.
dialog: 
text: They turn, glare after him. He turns, glares back. They
text: scoff and keep going up. He walks on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: He lets himself into a row house. We barely notice the
text: mezzuzah on the door post.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: A nearly vanished world of lower-middle-class Jewish life,
dialog: though the "Jewishness" (menorah, kiddush cup...) is
text: restricted to one dusty corner behind a secular chaos of
text: books, newspapers, half-empty cups, half-filled glasses...
dialog: 
text: Danny's FATHER, 55, sits on a faded chair, an oxygen mask on
text: a cart beside him. Danny's sister, LINDA, 30, is cutting his
text: hair with a scissors. When Danny enters, they both look up
text: at him in surprise, alarm, possibly even love. For a moment
dialog: no one knows what to do.
dialog: 
text: The father begins to wheeze, puts the mask over his face and
text: breathes deeply. Linda tells him to lean back; resumes
text: cutting. On the wall we see Danny's BAR MITZVAH PHOTO.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, Danny has found a stack of mail, all addressed to
text: him. His father and sister are visible behind him in a
text: mirror. Without speaking, he goes down the hall, and we hear
dialog: him DESCEND STAIRS to:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE, BASEMENT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny has taken off his coat (revealing a black T-shirt with
text: a red swastika), and is going through a number of cardboard
text: boxes marked "D," pulling out comic books, baseball gloves,
text: martial arts gear, drawings of voluptuous women, morbid
dialog: gothic figures, gun magazines, books about Hitler,
text: Nazis...and finally a .22 AUTOMATIC stuffed in a blue sock.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE, BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: He removes the clip, checks the slide, while nodding to the
text: MUSIC coming through his earphones. He looks up, sees LINDA
text: at the foot of the stairs, pulls off the headset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I knocked, you didn't answer.
dialog: 
text: It's too late to conceal the gun; he places it beside him.
text: She does her best to ignore the swastika shirt....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I just came to get some stuff. I'll
dialog: be out in five minutes.
dialog: (off her)
dialog: He doesn't want me around.
dialog: 
text: She looks down as if that were not true, or the way in which
dialog: it is too complicated to go into.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He's going to die.
dialog: (as Danny looks away)
dialog: He won't take his medicine. He eats
dialog: dairy. He probably still smokes when
dialog: I'm not around.
dialog: (off Danny's helpless gesture)
dialog: I asked him to come live with us.
dialog: Alex offered to share his room,
dialog: unsolicited.... But he didn't want to
dialog: be any trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Then he couldn't be bitter about
dialog: living alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
dialog: 
text: They exchange what are almost smiles. But then the subject
text: she's been trying to avoid -- the only subject -- suddenly
text: erupts...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you
dialog: wear that thing?... You know what it
dialog: means? To your people...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: They're not my people....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Tell it to Hitler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief
dialog: rabbi now?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Is this because of those kids who
dialog: used to beat you up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What kids?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nobody ever beat me up.
text: (as she sighs, turns to go)
dialog: Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons.
dialog: Even if you knew them all, there'd be
dialog: another fifty you didn't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Do you know them?
dialog: (off him)
dialog: I made him some noodles for dinner.
dialog: You can heat them up and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I've got to get back to the --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You can heat them up and eat with him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, QUEENS HOUSE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny (now wearing a plain white T-shirt) bends over the
text: coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the Post.
text: His father eats off a TV table. He finishes, cursorily wipes
text: his mouth, picks up a remote and turns on the television.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's Friday....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (a hoarse rasp)
dialog: Do I give a shit?
dialog: 
text: Danny holds up both hands: he's not arguing, simply informing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: The Torah says not to light a fire on
dialog: the Sabbath, because it's work,
dialog: correct?
dialog: (Danny sighs)
dialog: But if alternating current's running
dialog: through the wires every second of
dialog: every day, and I throw a switch, send
dialog: it here instead of there, how is that
dialog: lighting a fire?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: "Do chickens give milk?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: 
text: He channel-surfs until he comes to a stand-up COMIC doing a
text: routine. They both watch.
dialog: 
dialog: TV: the COMIC is funny in a brutal, compulsive way. Lots of
text: pop references, implicit postmodern nihilism. The routine
text: reflects what Danny (and the Shiites, the Unabomber, Timothy
text: McVeigh, T.S. Eliot, et al.) have against the modern world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Who's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dennis Leary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Leary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: The father grunts with grim satisfaction, he suspected as much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (offering consolation)
dialog: Howard Stern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Obviously.
dialog: 
dialog: Danny sighs: why bother. But adds...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Adam Sandler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Funny?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: He was funny.
dialog: 
text: As they watch, apropos of nothing:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: After your mother died, that's when
dialog: you stopped going to shul. Doing your
dialog: homework. Everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And that's when the Mets started to
dialog: stink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: 'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He
dialog: knew how to deal with the assholes.
dialog: Dallas Green, please...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Valentine...
dialog: 
text: The father snorts. On TV the comic gets off a line, and they
text: both laugh. Their laughs are quite similar; they glance at
dialog: each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
text: There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Linda says you're not supposed to
dialog: have dairy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Just a little... What's the difference?
dialog: 
text: Danny goes into the kitchen. The father extracts a pack of
text: Salems from between the cushions, lights one, takes a
text: desperate drag... The phone RINGS. He curses, stubs it out,
text: grabs the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yeah?... Hold on.... It's for you.
dialog: 
text: Danny gives his father a dish of ice cream, takes the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hello...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Daniel Balint? My name's Guy
dialog: Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the
dialog: New York Times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (impressed, suspicious)
dialog: New York Times...?
dialog: 
text: His father looks up. Danny takes the phone into the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm doing a piece on right-wing
dialog: groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear
dialog: you're an important figure in those
dialog: circles. You have a lot of interesting
dialog: ideas....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who told you that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Isn't it true?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, it's...yeah, it's true, but...
dialog: how'd you get this number?... No, not
dialog: here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place
text: off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY
dialog: 
text: A HIGH-ANGLE view of the coffee shop. After a moment, Danny
text: enters frame, starts toward it....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny enters, looks around. To his surprise he sees GUY
text: DANIELSEN from the Nazi meeting rising, extending his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY DANIELSEN
dialog: Danny...Guy Danielsen...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (sardonic, now he gets it)
dialog: You...
dialog: 
text: Guy shrugs, smiles apologetically.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE -- DANNY &amp; GUY WITH COFFEE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Milk...?
dialog: 
text: As Danny declines, Guy gets out a small cassette recorder,
text: is about to turn it on, when he notices Danny's reaction....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Is it okay if I record this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So
dialog: what's this about? Is this about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I'm trying to figure out where the
dialog: radical right is going to next....I
dialog: thought you were the most interesting
dialog: person at that meeting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What about Curtis Zampf?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Curtis is a politician -- and a bit
dialog: of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I agree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: The other night you said the modern
dialog: world is a Jewish disease. Could you
dialog: elaborate on that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: In the movement -- the racialist
dialog: movement -- we believe there's a
dialog: hierarchy of the races. Not just in
dialog: IQ, but in the civilization, the art,
dialog: the forms of government, the
dialog: civilizations that each race
dialog: produces... Why are you writing this
dialog: down if you're recording it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: It helps me concentrate.... So does
dialog: that mean you're a white supremacist?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What should I be, a white inferior-
dialog: ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian?
dialog: Let me ask, where are your people from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: My mother's family is French, my
dialog: father's was German, originally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: German. Mine, too. So who do you
dialog: think's given more to the world, the
dialog: Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe,
dialog: Nietzsche -- or the entire continent
dialog: of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Danny, what about the Jews?
dialog: 
text: Danny shifts in his seat, growing more interested....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The Jews are different.... Blacks are
dialog: disgusting and inferior, but it's
text: like criticizing a retarded child.
dialog: The Jews are...a poison in the human
dialog: well....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: A poison...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Sexuality??? What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What??!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: (laughing, embarrassed)
dialog: What's that go to do with...I've gone
dialog: out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And? WHat did you notice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Notice? Like what...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Jewish girls like to give head, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I don't know. Is that right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And Jewish men like to get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Everybody likes to, don't they?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the
dialog: Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Because the Jew is essentially female.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Female...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Real men -- white, Christian men --
dialog: we fuck a woman. We make her come
dialog: with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't
dialog: like to penetrate and thrust -- he
dialog: can't assert himself that directly --
dialog: so he resorts to perversions. Oral
dialog: sex is technically a perversion, you
dialog: know that, don't you?
dialog: (as Guy nods)
dialog: After a woman has been with a Jewish
dialog: man, she never wants a normal partner
text: again. A normal man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Does that mean the Jew is the better
dialog: lover?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You're not listening. He isn't better.
dialog: He gives pleasure, but that's
dialog: actually a weakness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Danny, what makes you think you know
dialog: all this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let's just say I've done due diligence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the
dialog: Jews own the media and the banks.
dialog: It's that they're sexually corrupt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The Jews clearly control the media
dialog: and the banks. Investment banks, not
dialog: the commercial ones. But the point is
dialog: they carry out in those realms the
dialog: same principles they display in
dialog: sexuality. They undermine traditional
dialog: life; they deracinate society.
dialog: 
text: Danny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A
dialog: people -- a real people -- derives
dialog: its genius from the land: the sun,
dialog: the sea, the soil. This is how they
dialog: know themselves. But the Jew doesn't
dialog: have soil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Those aren't Jews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Of course they're Jews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally
dialog: secular society. They no longer need
dialog: Judaism because they have soil. The
text: real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He
dialog: has no roots, no attachments. So he
dialog: "universalizes" everything. He can't
text: hammer a nail, plow a field. He can
dialog: only buy and sell, invest capital,
dialog: manipulate markets. He takes the life
dialog: of a people rooted in soil and turns
dialog: it into a cosmopolitan culture based
dialog: on books, ideas, numbers. This is his
dialog: strength....
dialog: (pumped; this is what
dialog: he loves)
dialog: Take the great Jewish minds: Marx,
dialog: Freud, Einstein. What have they given
dialog: us: communism, infantile sexuality
text: and the atom bomb. In a mere three
dialog: centuries since these guys emerged
dialog: from the ghettos of Europe, they've
dialog: taken us from a world built on order
dialog: and reason and hurled us into a chaos
dialog: of class warfare, irrational urges
dialog: and relativity, a world where the
dialog: very existence of matter and meaning
dialog: is in doubt. Why? Because it is the
dialog: deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to
text: unravel the very fabric of life until
text: nothing is left but thread, nothing
text: but nothingness. Nothingness without
dialog: end...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Are all Jews the same?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Differences exist, of course, but
dialog: they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his
dialog: Jewishness dominates everything. Even
dialog: the ones who renounce it, who hate it,
dialog: who want to cut it out of their
dialog: hearts a knife...can't escape.
dialog: They're still just Jews.
dialog: 
text: Guy finishes writing that and looks up.

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Danny, this is great. You're

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: He says you were bar mitzvahed there,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You believe that? And you call
dialog: yourself a reporter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (sputtering, unsure
dialog: what to say)
dialog: Listen to me....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Why would Nadelman lie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: To discredit me. Because I know who
dialog: they are. Look, I thought I explained
dialog: it to you. Those people can say or do
dialog: anything. And they will. It's all
dialog: narrative to them, it's... Are you
dialog: going to print what this guy said?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Give me a reason not to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's slander. It's reckless disregard.
dialog: I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Does that mean you deny what he says

dialog:

speaker_heading: STEROID EXCESS
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Steroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge and
text: goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what
text: happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny is
dialog: stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In seconds,
text: Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up him,
dialog: leans close:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Enough?
dialog: 
text: Steroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hits

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six
dialog: million, why is he your hero?...
dialog: Concentration camps all over Europe,
text: and he only gets rid of a measly two
dialog: hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
dialog: 
text: Some surprise that a Nazi is arguing against a denier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANCIENT JEW
dialog: Hitler was not a putz. Hitler was
dialog: real. God created him to punish the
dialog: Jews for abandoning God.
dialog: 
text: The other survivors are embarrassed by this, but the Ancient
text: Jew ignores them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANCIENT JEW

text: As Danny walks out, the Ancient Jew catches his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANCIENT
dialog: And what should we learn from you,
dialog: Daniel?
dialog: 
text: Her use of Danny's name feels knowing, slyly invasive. All
text: SOUND VANISHES for a beat, and Danny barely manages to say:

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Kill your enemy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Kyle opens the trunk of his car, shows Danny inside: two
text: bags of shotgun powder and several lengths of metal piping
text: with screw-on caps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe
dialog: bombs.
dialog: (off Danny's reaction, smiles)
dialog: A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me.
dialog: A donation to the cause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Danny.... Guess who's here....

dialog: the trunk)
dialog: Your girlfriend... She's up at the house.

scene_heading: EXT. THE FARMHOUSE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: In the driveway: Carla's Mercedes, a Triumph motorcycle.
text: Danny peers in through the windows, goes to the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny sees Carla sitting on a green sofa wearing a white
text: sundress and leafing through a magazine. Curtis is mixing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: My L's keep coming out as C's....

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: Danny, get a drink and come talk to me.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: ...Insulting people who were in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: They're liars and cowards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm sure they are. But what do we
dialog: accomplish by pointing it out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's the truth....

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA MOEBIUS
dialog: Danny, what do you think of our troops?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (trying to be diplomatic)
dialog: They have guts. And they know what
dialog: they hate...which is good. But they
dialog: have no idea why; they don't think,
dialog: they don't read.... They're on beer
dialog: and crank half the time....
dialog: 
text: A phone RINGS in another room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: The young people in this country...
dialog: They're like pigs; all they want is
dialog: happiness.... But one needs pigs
dialog: sometimes.
dialog: (as it RINGS again; to Carla)
dialog: Liebchen...
dialog: 
text: Carla puts down her magazine, goes out to the kitchen.
text: Danny's eyes follow her, and Curtis's follow his.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: Do you feel you're making progress here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You mean Ilio Manzetti?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA

dialog: simple. Something you can actually

dialog: Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: An urban type.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA (O.S.)
dialog: Danny...telephone.
dialog: 
text: He starts: who could be calling him here? As he goes into
text: the kitchen to take the phone, Curtis says quietly...

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: He's mad, Lina, you know that.
dialog: 
text: She hears him but doesn't respond.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- DAY

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: You know what today is?

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: LINDA'S VOICE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How did you get the fucking number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA'S VOICE
dialog: I want you to say kaddish for her.
dialog: It's the only thing she asked from us....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA'S VOICE
dialog: You do it on the inside....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: LINDA'S VOICE

dialog: too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA'S VOICE
dialog: Yes!
dialog:

speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Who's Linda?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (dropping the Times)
dialog: Why won't you talk to me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I'm talking to you right now. Who's

dialog: 
text: He tries to kiss her. She pushes him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: When can I see you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: You can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA (O.S.)

dialog: Carla, it's time to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I have to go visit my father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Your father??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He's at a home out here.
dialog: 
text: She starts to walk past. He grabs her arm.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm coming to your room tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: She tries to pull free; he won't let her go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA (O.S.)
dialog: Carla!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
text: Just after midnight. Five past... But
dialog: don't come through the house, they'll
dialog: hear you. I'm in the back bedroom,
text: second floor. Climb onto the kitchen
dialog: roof, I'll leave the window open.
dialog: 
text: He tries to kiss her, but she ducks away and goes out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/INT. O.L.'S VAN -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Danny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled
text: brick. For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out.
text: Finally he opens the door....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AHAVAT TORAH, FOYER -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: A LARGE WOMAN, about 40, her body barely contained by a
text: brilliant magenta dress, greets him with a smile the size of
text: a wedding cake. She holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: Shabbat shalom.
dialog: 
text: She speaks quietly, not wanting to disturb the service, yet
text: even so her voice is huge, and her flashing eyes clearly
text: expect some kind of enthusiastic response. Within we hear
text: the ALENU being chanted.
dialog: 
text: Danny ignores her and the proffered siddur. A basket of
text: yarmulkes seems to infuriate him, but he snatches one anyway
text: and, conveying a helpless disgust, puts it on his head. From
text: within he hears...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONGREGATION (O.S.)
dialog: (in rough unison)
dialog: Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo...(etc.)
dialog: 
text: He stands with his hand on the door, but not opening it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: On that day, the Eternal shall be One.

text: The mourner's kaddish can be found on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: Is anything wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
dialog: 
text: She's startled but not intimidated, is about to respond,
text: when Danny simply turns and walks out of the building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AHAVAT TORAH -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: He stops beneath an open window through which he hears...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE
dialog: ...Grant us peace, thy most precious
dialog: gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace.
dialog: We recall with loving memory those
dialog: whom Thou hast summoned unto thee.
dialog: And we mention by name...Sophie
dialog: Budnitz...Bernard Schwabb...Milton
dialog: Lifter...Aaron Lustig...Minnie Baum...
dialog: 
text: Danny closes his eyes, but at the end adds, under her breath:

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: ...Harriet Kantor Balint...
dialog: 
text: A half dozen VOICES, including Danny's, recite in unison...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DANNY &amp; OTHERS
dialog: Yis-ga-dal v'yis-ka-dash sh'may ra-bo...
dialog: 
text: The body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases,
text: producing a subtle and solemn music. Danny chants the entire
text: prayer, and the moment it ends, and the rabbi begins the
dialog: benediction....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED)
dialog: May the Lord bless you and keep you....
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AHAVAT TORAH/STREET -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: ...he starts toward his car. But the Rabbi's VOICE seems to
text: follow him, unnaturally loud and clear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI (O.S.)
dialog: May He cause the light of His
dialog: countenance to shine upon you and be
dialog: gracious unto you....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Eat shit....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI (O.S.)
dialog: ...May you be blessed in your going

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY

text: EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI (O.S.)
dialog: And let us say...
dialog: 
scene_heading: RABBI &amp; CONGREGATION
dialog: (with organ; singsong)
dialog: Ah -- ah -- ah....men....
dialog: 
text: As Danny reaches the van, he sees the LARGE WOMAN silhouetted
text: in the open doorway....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: YOU EAT SHIT.
dialog: 
text: Danny realizes he's still wearing the kippah. He throws it
text: at her, but it only goes a couple of feet. He catches it,
text: throws harder. This time it floats back toward him, and he
text: has to jump out the way to keep it from hitting him. He gets
text: in the car and drives off.
dialog: 
text: A WRISTWATCH: 12:05. We are:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof. Above him is an
text: open window, candlelight flickering. He starts into the room,
dialog: stops....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Carla sits on the bed, straddling Curtis, who lies beneath
text: her. She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of him,
text: keeps thrusting into her from below.
dialog: 
text: Danny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla
text: stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to
text: Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that
text: when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny she
text: is responding to, Danny she is really making love to.
dialog: 
text: Gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach
text: out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny.
text: She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders
text: out a series of stifled cries.
dialog: 
text: When she looks again, the window is empty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny reading. A KNOCK at the door. He looks up, Curtis
text: comes in. Danny stiffens at the sight of him, but Curtis is
dialog: friendly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What are you reading?
dialog: 
text: Danny tilts the book to show him: History of Political
dialog: Philosophy.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: They left an hour ago.
dialog: (off Danny's disappointment)
dialog: You mind some personal advice? Forget
dialog: Carla. That's not the side your
text: bread's buttered on.
dialog: (off Danny's silence)
dialog: How soon can you get back to the city?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A week or so. There's something I

scene_heading: INT. SYNAGOGUE SANCTUARY -- NIGHT

dialog: sports bag)
dialog: Okay, let's take one of these panels
dialog: off so we can get under the bema...the

dialog: 
text: As they unscrew a panel, Carleton runs past. A football
text: flashes overhead. We hear GLASS BREAK...LAUGHTER.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: DANNY WATCHES KYLE attach a bomb (four sticks of dynamite
text: wired to a digital timer) to a 2x4 with a bungee cord. He
text: hooks the ends, cautiously lets go. The cord springs free.
text: The bomb falls.
dialog: 
text: Kyle gasps. Danny catches it.
dialog: 
text: Frozen, they look at each other. Kyle exhales, takes the
text: bomb and, with Danny holding it, carefully restrings the
text: bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEROID (O.S.)
dialog: Wow, look at this shit....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What are they doing?
dialog: 
text: Kyle has no idea and doesn't care. Danny scrambles out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SANCTUARY -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Straightening up, Danny is stunned by a vision:
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS
dialog: 
text: ...their silver crowns and breastplates, velvet robes. And
text: Steroid Excess, lifting one out. Danny reacts with an
text: instinctive horror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What are you doing? Put that down!
dialog: ...Put it back in there.
dialog: 
text: Steroid -- cowed by Danny -- starts to obey, but before he
dialog: can...

speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: What do you care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't, but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS

dialog: Let's look at the fucking thing.
dialog: 
text: Each CURSE makes Danny wince, but he just hovers about
text: nervously as Billings and Steroid try to unwrap the Torah
text: while others gather, some comically wrapping themselves in
text: tallises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Put it there, on the...
dialog: 
text: He indicates the bema, stepping back as if to deny any
text: involvement, yet at the same time trying to monitor
dialog: everything they do.

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: yod...)
dialog: Just be careful with the...
dialog: 
dialog: O.L.

dialog: "If I were king of the forest...not

text: laughs, so he keeps his mouth shut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Open it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (impulsively taking over)
dialog: Here...
dialog: 
text: He shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the
text: Torah. Low MURMURS at the sight of the broad columns, the
text: mysterious calligraphy, the CRACKLING parchment. Danny
text: himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred text.
dialog: OVER this...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Oooo... Weird... You read it from
dialog: right to left.... The letters look
dialog: like squashed bugs.... What kind of
dialog: paper is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's not paper, it's parchment. It's
dialog: made from sheepskin. And all the
text: letters are drawn by hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Neat calligraphy.
dialog: 
text: Danny nods, then, as if against his will....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's called the flame alphabet. It's
dialog: supposed to be the word of God
text: written in fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Fire...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: The mystics tried to read the white
text: spaces around the letters. They
dialog: thought there was a whole alternative
text: language hidden there, with secret,
dialog: alternative meanings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Cool.
dialog: 
text: Danny sees Drake watching him, smirks to express his disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: How come you know all this shit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How come you don't know it?
dialog: (pressing the advantage)
dialog: How can you say you hate the Jews
dialog: when you don't know anything about --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as
dialog: much as you do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, you don't.... If you hated them,
dialog: you'd study them, so you'd know why
dialog: you hate them. You know what tefillin
dialog: is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the
dialog: kaddish from the kiddush?
dialog: (obviously not)
dialog: Eichmann? He went to Israel. He
dialog: studied the Torah, the Talmud, the
dialog: Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: Who's Eichmann?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who's Eichmann?!!?
dialog: 
text: Danny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of the
dialog: others know why Eichmann was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: He was head of the Gestapo's Jewish
dialog: sector. He deported people to the camps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: (reaching toward the parchment)
dialog: Can we touch it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, but not on the letters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Why the fuck not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (warning finger)
dialog: Just don't.
dialog: 
text: Billings bristles at Danny's authority; Carleton says to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: Didn't you see Raiders of the Lost Ark?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: What??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: That was an ark, man. That was a
dialog: Torah. They fucked around with it,
dialog: and the Torah melted their faces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: That's a movie, you moron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
dialog: 
text: The others are gathered around, delicately touching the
text: sheepskin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLINGS
dialog: Let me see.
dialog: 
text: He pushes through, looks at the Torah. He runs his fingers
text: over the crinkled parchment, the smooth black letters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I said not on the --
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Billings grabs the parchment in both hands and
text: tries to tear it. It's tougher than it looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Stop it! What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: He tries to stop him, but -- accidentally or not -- Drake
text: gets in the way, and before Danny can do anything else,
text: Billings crumples it and finally tears a long gash into the
dialog: scroll.
dialog: 
text: This produces a strange effect on the others. Some (Kyle,
text: Steroid, Drake) join in. They knock the aitz off the bema,
text: it rolls out, exposing ten feet of Torah. They stamp on it,
text: spit on it.... Others (Carleton, O.L.), though less troubled
text: than Danny, are surprised (and embarrassed) by their own
dialog: revulsion at these acts.
dialog: 
text: Danny watches helplessly, like the survivor who did nothing
dialog: as his son was murdered.
dialog: 
text: Finally the Torah lies torn and soiled on the stage. A
text: strange silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Let's get out of here.
dialog: 
text: ...Danny kneels by the Torah. With a tallis, he attempts to
text: clean the parchment. Carleton and O.L. help him roll it onto
dialog: the aitz. [Echo "Christ taken down from cross" with Torah as
dialog: Christ.] They replace the cover, the yod, the crowns....
dialog: 
text: Finally Danny lifts it up, holds it to him as if it were his
text: dead child. He closes his eyes, murmurs to himself....

speaker_heading: CARLETON
dialog: What'd you say?

dialog: We believe that God has thirteen
dialog: attributes...
dialog: 
text: Danny is beside himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI (ON TV)
dialog: ...Of which the highest is ein sof,
dialog: which means "without end," or,
dialog: sometimes, "nothingness without end...."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CINDY (ON TV)
dialog: Nothingness without end.... That's
dialog: very interesting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RABBI (ON TV)
dialog: The purest form of spirit...
dialog: 
text: ON DANNY. Sound fades. He's haunted: "Nothingness without
dialog: end" was what he'd told Guy Danielsen the Jews were obsessed
text: with. He seems to hear the cello playing "Kol Nidre" again.
dialog: Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Okay, everybody out. Get out.
dialog: 
text: He switches off the TV. Shoves them out the door, slams it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Alone he sits at the desk, finds himself gazing at the Torah,
text: standing in a corner of his closet, draped in the tallis.
dialog: 
text: He slams the closet door, it bounces open. Slams it again,
text: making sure it latches.
dialog: 
text: He sits down, looks at the closed door until, in bitter
text: resignation he gets up and opens it again.
dialog: 
text: He unrolls the Torah on the bed...Scotch tapes the tear
text: closed...attempts to clean the stain with a moistened cloth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror, holding his
text: shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his
text: torso. When he lowers the shirt, the fringes hang out like
dialog: the tsitsis that Orthodox men wear.
dialog: 
text: He feels a weird loathing for this, but he smooths and
text: arranges the tsitsis to look just like a Hasid's. He clicks
text: his heels together and gives a Nazi salute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Alenu l'shab'ach la'adon hacol...
dialog: 
text: Another Nazi salute. A KNOCK at the door. He hides the
text: fringes under the shirt, throws a blanket over the Torah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEROID (O.S.)
dialog: Phone, Danny.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL -- PAY PHONE -- DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY'S VOICE (PHONE)
dialog: Danny Balint...Guy Danielsen, New
dialog: York Times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (tucks in the tallis
dialog: fringes)
dialog: What do you want? What happened to
dialog: your article?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY'S VOICE (PHONE)
dialog: I couldn't get my editor to run it,
dialog: but I bet he will now that you've put
dialog: a bomb in a synagogue. That was you,
dialog: wasn't it, Danny?
dialog: 
text: Danny hangs up. Stands there. A VOICE makes him jump....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (DRAKE)
dialog: Hey, Danny, want to kill a Jew?
dialog: 
text: Danny turns: it's Drake. These are the first words he's spoken.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET/INT. CAR -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny and Drake pass a low-slung modern synagogue. A sign
text: announces: AMBASSADOR ILIO MANZETTI Friday, August 31. Danny
text: reacts, startled...Drake smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Park up there, we'll walk back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CONGREGATION BETH SHALOM -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: The building is lit. Within we hear an AMPLIFIED VOICE,
text: presumably Manzetti giving a speech. We can't make out the
text: words. Danny and Drake are hidden among the rhododendrons
text: flanking the parking lot. Danny is watching a door in the
text: side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads a
text: scoped rifle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Lie on your stomach and come up on
dialog: your elbows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
dialog: 
text: Danny assumes the prone position, Drake sets the rifle in
text: his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who'd you kill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Four. But no one this important.
dialog: 
text: We hear APPLAUSE within as the speech ends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Okay, it's over. He'll take a couple
text: questions, then come out.... Sight
text: down the rifle toward the door.
dialog: 
text: THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Danny pans from the side door -- where
text: TWO MEN are smoking -- to a waiting limousine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How did you know they were Jews?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: I can tell....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: I was a Jew in a previous life.
dialog: 
text: Before Danny can respond, Drake gestures toward the synagogue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Here they come.
dialog: 
text: Danny puts his eye back to the scope.
dialog: 
text: SCOPE POV: stirring at the door. The men put out their
text: cigarettes. Three figures emerge: a MAN and a WOMAN on
text: either side of an older, distinguished-looking man (MANZETTI).
dialog: They walk this way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a
text: Jew in the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Just get him in the cross-hairs. With
dialog: those shells, anywhere you hit him,
dialog: it'll bounce around, rip his insides
dialog: all up.
dialog: 
text: SCOPE POV: the TRIO walking this way, cross-hairs on Manzetti.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Right there! Just squeeze he trigger.
dialog: Slow... Do it!
dialog: 
text: Danny FIRES, misses. Everybody hits the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: You missed on purpose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I didn't. I told you, I can't --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
text: Danny looks over his shoulder. His shirt has ridden up his
text: back, revealing the tallis wrapped around his waist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: I knew it.
dialog: 
text: Drake pulls a .45 from the duffel.... Without thinking,
text: Danny rolls over, fires the rifle. Drake is blown backward,
dialog: dropping the .45.
dialog: 
text: Danny leaps up.... Drake's on his hands and knees, his
text: trousers quickly darkening with blood. Danny's upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, Jesus...Drake, are you okay...?
dialog: 
text: FOOTSTEPS, coming this way. Danny runs. We hear voices, "Get
text: down.... Stay down.... He's got a gun...." Drake picks
text: himself up, stumbles away, bent over....
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. QUEENS -- DUSK
dialog: 
text: Danny parks the van in an abandoned lot near the river.
text: Quickly wiping down the wheel with his shirt, he tosses out
text: his duffel bag and the scoped rifle. He climbs out, wipes
text: down the door, throws the rifle into the water, grabs the
text: duffel and hurries away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY (V.O.)
dialog: Kyle, it's me Danny. How you doing?...
dialog: I had to come into the city to see
dialog: Mrs. MOEBIUS... No, I gave Drake the
dialog: van, didn't he bring it back?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny's on the phone, whipping through several newspapers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: ...Since when?... Really? And he
dialog: didn't call?... No, I don't know...
dialog: 
text: He finds a tiny item: "Gunfire Reported at Synagogue." He
text: scans it: no mention of Drake or himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sure, come on down.... Can you bring
dialog: my stuff?... Thanks...and if Drake
dialog: shows up, let me know right away....
dialog: Good...
dialog: 
text: He hangs up. From behind some books, he extracts the small
text: caliber handgun he found in his father's house earlier.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MRS. MOEBIUS'S APARTMENT -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny alone, waiting, nervous. He hears FOOTSTEPS approach,
text: he touches the gun in the back of his trousers. Lina and
text: Curtis enter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: How have things been going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (how much do they know?)
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINA
dialog: (indicates a chair)
dialog: We want to talk to you about
dialog: something....
text: (as they sit, Danny nervous)
dialog: We're about to launch an aboveground,
dialog: intellectually serious fascist movement.
dialog: 
text: Danny is relieved and intrigued. Lina nods at Curtis to go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: We want to build bridges to certain
dialog: positions in the political mainstream:
dialog: works like The Bell Curve,
dialog: Sociobiology, anti-Zionism, anti-
dialog: immigration, the com-munitarian
dialog: issue.... We'll hold conferences:
dialog: invite liberals, blacks, Jews.
dialog: Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch,
dialog: Shahack....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I've been waiting all my life for
dialog: something like this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: We want you to help run it. Give
dialog: speeches, lead seminars... Handle the
dialog: fund-raising.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (slapped in the face)
dialog: Fund-raising??
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: We think you'd be good at it.
dialog: 
text: OFF-SCREEN we hear the front door. FEET come up the stairs....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: That doesn't seem to be happening,
dialog: does it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I've been stuck out in the country
dialog: with those guys who just want to
dialog: paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How
dialog: am I supposed to -- (get anything
dialog: done there?)
dialog: 
text: He stops short as Carla walks into the room for shopping.
text: She glances at them, puts down her bags, goes into the
dialog: kitchen....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Danny, the night we met, you said the
dialog: name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed.
dialog: We were excited. But here it is
dialog: September, and Mr. Manzetti is still
text: walking around breathing the air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: We need intellectuals, we have enough
text: thugs already.
dialog: 
text: Danny's watching Carla go down the hall toward the back, can
text: barely bring his attention back to the conversation at hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I
dialog: read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: Look, if you want to kill Jews on
dialog: your free time, fine. We need you to
dialog: raise money. Will you do that for us?
dialog: 
text: He nods but cannot look at her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: He's dismissed. He rises.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: Do you have a suit?
dialog: (off Danny; to Curtis)
dialog: Let's get him one.... And a cell
dialog: phone too.
text: (as Danny turns to go;
dialog: a joke for her own amusement)
dialog: And if you insist on blowing up a
dialog: synagogue, make it that big one on
dialog: Fifth Avenue, would you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: So what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: They're not that Jewish.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: I don't care what they are. I know
dialog: those people, and I don't like them.
text: The rest are just a bunch of kikes,
dialog: aren't they?
dialog: 
text: She smiles. He manages a smile back and hurries away, face
text: burning with shame.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT, STREET -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Danny comes out of the building, squats between two parked
text: cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for
dialog: breath...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Here...
dialog: 
text: He turns. Carla walks over to him, wipes his mouth with a
text: crumpled tissue. When she moves to kiss him, he holds back,
text: shy about the smell, but she kisses him anyway, on the mouth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Carla, naked, browsing the books, sees something in the
dialog: closet. It's the Torah Danny took from the synagogue. She
text: unrolls it on the bed, her gaze moving over the mysterious,
text: glossy script. Danny, coming out of the bathroom, sees what
text: she is doing, and stops short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Where'd you get this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I stole it. From a synagogue.
dialog: 
text: She looks at the broad printed columns....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: How come there's no punctuation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That was a later invention, it's not
dialog: in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews
dialog: know where the sentences end. They
dialog: know the whole thing by heart. Every
dialog: word. Every letter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Do you know it like that? By heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: But you can read it, the Hebrew....
dialog: Right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What do you care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: 'Cause I want to know.... What is
dialog: this word? This one here...
dialog: 
text: Danny looks at the word, then back at her. He's torn between
text: competing desires, but finally...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Va-yomer... And he said.
dialog: (she moves her finger
dialog: to the left)
dialog: It goes the other way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (she knew that)
dialog: Oh, yeah...
dialog: (moves finger right)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha
dialog: mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt
dialog: avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: What's it mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And God said to Avram, take yourself
dialog: away from your land and from the
dialog: place you were born and from your
dialog: father's house into the land -- a
dialog: different land -- and I will show you....
dialog: 
text: Danny remains silent a moment, affected by the passage....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I want to learn to read it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a
dialog: basic text of Western culture. I want
dialog: to read it in the original. Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hebrew's very difficult. It would
dialog: take years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I'm good at languages.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the smooth expanse of her back, the articulations
text: of her spine. He finds her very beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Put something on. You're not supposed
text: to be naked in front of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: They think it's the word of God, and
dialog: it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: That's stupid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, it's stupid.
dialog: (indicating her T-shirt)
dialog: Put it on, or I won't teach you.
dialog: 
text: She grudgingly pulls on the shirt as he gets a pencil and paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: See, the Jews love to separate things:
dialog: the holy from the profane, milk from
dialog: meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath
dialog: from the week, the Jew from the
dialog: gentile.... As if one little scrap of
dialog: this was going to completely
dialog: contaminate that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: What assholes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You can't curse in front of it either.
dialog: 
text: He shrugs as if indifferent to these rules, yet compelled to
dialog: point them out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Who gets contaminated, the Jews or
dialog: the gentiles?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Good question. Both.
dialog: (draws a letter)
dialog: Aleph...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
text: It looks a little like a swastika.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: It's silent. It holds a place, takes
text: a vowel. The vowels are little dots
dialog: that go under the letters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Where are they?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: They don't put them in the Torah.
dialog: I'll get you a chumash, they'll have
dialog: them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...
dialog: (as she repeats the names)
dialog: How come you're here instead of with
dialog: Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: The sex is better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Even though his dick is so big?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: With you there's a tragic dimension.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm

dialog: This time it's gotta happen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It will.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows

scene_heading: INT. BOOKSTORE -- DAY

dialog: (All the hands go up.)
dialog: Good. Actually, the term is a bit
dialog: imprecise since technically Jews are
dialog: only one of the Semitic peoples....
dialog: In fact, Arabs are Semites, as are
dialog: the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, and so

dialog: them?
dialog: 
text: He looks around. The room is silent.
dialog:

dialog: (smiles)
dialog: There is no reason. If there were,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did he say love them? Love the Jews?
dialog: It sounds strange, I know, but with

dialog: Jew says that all he wants is to be
text: left alone to study his Torah, do a
dialog: little business and fornicate with
dialog: his over-sexed wife.... But it isn't
dialog: true. He wants to be hated. He longs
text: for our scorn. He clings to it as if
dialog: it were the very core and mystery of
dialog: his being. If Hitler had not existed,
dialog: the Jews would have invented him. For
dialog: without such hatred, the so-called
dialog: Chosen People would vanish from the
dialog: earth....
dialog: 
text: People react with confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: ...And this reveals a terrible truth,
dialog: the crux of our problem as Nazis: the
dialog: worse the Jews are treated, the
dialog: stronger they become. Egyptian
dialog: slavery made them a nation; the
dialog: pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave
dialog: birth to the State of Israel.
dialog: Suffering, it seems, is the very
dialog: crucible of their genius. If the Jews
dialog: are, as one of their own has said, a
dialog: people who will not take yes for an
dialog: answer, then let us say yes to them.
dialog: If they thrive on opposition, let us
dialog: cease to oppose them. The way to
dialog: annihilate them, utterly and
dialog: completely, is to open our arms, take
dialog: them into our homes and embrace them.
dialog: Only then will they vanish into
dialog: assimilation, dilution...and love.
dialog: (a warning finger)
dialog: But we cannot pretend. The Jew is
dialog: nothing if not clever. He will see
text: through condescension and hypocrisy.
dialog: To destroy him, we will have to love
text: him sincerely.

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Who killed Manzetti?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: If I tell you, will you pull the
dialog: story? Not write about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: It's too late.... If I didn't,

dialog: (as Danny just snorts)
text: Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will
dialog: you go to synagogue?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: Get the fuck away from me.
dialog: 
text: Guy backs off. Danny crosses the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey, Danny, just one more!
dialog: 
text: He glances back. It's the PHOTOGRAPHER who has reloaded and

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Danny and Miriam walking together among the trees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: You're telling me you killed him? You?
dialog: Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of
dialog: gun did you use?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (guessing)
text: A forty-five.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
text: It was a nine millimeter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You're lying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: So are you... But they'll believe
dialog: you....
dialog: (as they walk)
dialog: Lina Moebius is saying the whole
dialog: thing was your idea. That you
dialog: proposed it in a meeting at her house.
dialog: (when he doesn't deny it)
dialog: Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you
dialog: thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's
dialog: dead? Do you really want to kill Jews?
dialog: You want to kill me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I was just talking. I -- look, I
dialog: can't help what I think.
dialog: 
text: He doesn't know how to answer, walks away from her to the
text: railing overlooking the water. He stares into the current
text: flowing past. Finally Miriam joins him....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: All right, what if all along you were
dialog: actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to
dialog: expose them....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But I wasn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: And only talked about killing
dialog: Manzetti to convince them you were an
dialog: anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea
dialog: somebody would take it seriously, you
dialog: never would have said it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I can't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Think about your father. Your sister.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The truth doesn't mean anything to
dialog: you, does it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (over her)
dialog: Fucking kike.
dialog: 
text: Miriam is stung. She can't believe he said that. Still, she
text: gets a small tape recorder out of her purse, hands it to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRIAM
dialog: Try to get Lina Moebius on tape,
dialog: telling you to do something.
dialog: Something violent... That's right, I
dialog: don't care about truth. I care about
dialog: you.
dialog: (looks at her watch)
dialog: Kol Nidre's at six-thirty. I've got
dialog: to meet Stuart. We'll be at the
dialog: minyan tonight and tomorrow. If you
dialog: need me, come there....
dialog: 
text: Danny watches her walk away, then turns to the railing.
text: Ideally a FERRY is pulling away from its slip and heading
text: out across the harbor. He watches it, then looks down at the
text: current moving past. He reaches a decision, throws the tape
text: recorder into the water, turns and walks away....
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Danny stops just inside the door. The place is spotless. The
text: desk has been pulled out from the wall, covered with a snowy
text: cloth and set for a Sabbath meal: brass candelabrum, challah
text: under a satin cover...and two place settings.
dialog: 
text: Carla is pouring wine into the kiddush cup. She's wearing a
text: modest dress, her hair is pinned up with a piece of lace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: 
text: She turns, startled; she hadn't heard him come in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: It's erev Yom Kippur.... We'll have
dialog: dinner, then go to shul. Atone for
dialog: our sins.
dialog: 
text: He grabs a couple of olives off the table, eats them as he
text: goes through his closet, stuffing a couple things in a bag....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He
dialog: studied Torah. He hated Jews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (in the closet, looking)
dialog: Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I don't know. I just want to try it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shit...
dialog: (looking in other places)
dialog: Did you talk to your mother today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: No. What are you looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (indicates table as he
dialog: keeps looking)
dialog: Why are you doing this?
dialog: (back to the closet)
dialog: I thought God didn't exist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He commands it whether He exists or
dialog: not...
dialog: (off his silence; with
dialog: difficulty)
dialog: Look, we can fight him and be crushed.
dialog: Or we can submit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (from the closet)
dialog: And be crushed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Yeah, okay. But what if...what if...
text: submitting...being crushed, being
dialog: nothing, not mattering, what if
dialog: that's the best feeling we can have?
dialog: 
text: He finds it (a kittel), stuffs it in the bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Look, just light the candles with me.
dialog: Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You eat first, then you light.
dialog: (exasperated, he has to
dialog: explain)
dialog: Once you light, it's Yom Kippur,
dialog: which means you're fasting, so you
dialog: can't...eat.
dialog: 
text: He trails off, looks at her. She's everything he ever wanted,
text: and he's already lost her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A woman of valor, who can find her?
dialog: Her price is above rubies....
dialog: 
text: He walks out, leaving the door open. Carla starts to call
text: after him, but then doesn't. She turns back, lights the
text: candles and awkwardly reads the prayers....
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/PAY PHONE -- SUNDOWN APPROACHING

scene_heading: EXT. 5TH AVENUE AND 65TH STREET -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It'll be enough if we use it right.
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Okay, the service'll go about another
dialog: hour. Say an hour for the janitors,

dialog: We'll go in at midnight.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Didn't you get anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, I believe that a bomb is going

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: I think anti-semitism today is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: In the Third Reich, weren't a number
dialog: of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MOEBIUS
dialog: Yes, and they were said to be the
dialog: most virulent proponents of the Final

dialog: about such things?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER

text: comes to meet him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Danny, listen, people expect me to

text: Danny, leading the prayers, looks up at Carla, Stuart,
text: Miriam...near the front, chanting with him. He looks at the
dialog: clock: 7:21.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this. He
text: stops praying, but no one notices....
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: As Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to
text: glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons
text: at their sides.
dialog: 
text: The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up,
text: reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes
dialog: he weren't here.
dialog: 
text: Everything suspends for a moment as, within the building,
text: three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting
text: the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer.
dialog: 
text: Drake raises his gun and fires.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT
dialog: 
text: People are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the
text: GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING. No one
text: particularly notices. Danny, freaking, doesn't hear the
text: gunshots. He tries to address the people in the front rows....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Wait a minute...
dialog: 
text: But the praying is too loud, too strong. No one stops or
text: listens. He steps down off the bema....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Stop praying. You've got to get out
dialog: of here.... All of you...
dialog: 
text: A few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior,
text: but the rest keep chanting. Stuart comes up to Danny....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You wanted to daven. Now daven....
dialog: 
text: Danny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. He
dialog: doesn't notice...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
dialog: 
text: BANGS open. DRAKE stands there, .357, bleeding profusely
text: from the head, the swastika on his lips. At first, only a
text: few people notice, they stop praying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEOPLE
dialog: (panic, confusion)
dialog: Who's that?... What is he...oh, my God...
dialog: 
text: Avi is the first one out of his chair, walks right at Drake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AVI
dialog: (calm, forceful)
dialog: Put down the weapon. Put it down....
dialog: 
text: Drake shoots him. Avi goes down, writhing in pain. Screams,
text: panic. People come at Drake, but he grabs an 11-year-old
text: girl, puts the gun to her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Drake! Up here...
dialog: 
text: Everyone turns, including Drake -- who's blinded by the
text: blood in his eyes, but recognizes the voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENRAGED MAN
dialog: See, he knows him. The Nazi bastard...
dialog: 
text: Drake moves unsteadily toward the front, pulling the girl
text: with him. A WOMAN (a doctor) goes to tend Avi, who is still
text: conscious. People begin to slip out the back, taking
text: children. Others stay, looking to jump Drake, but he keeps
text: the .357 on the little girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to Carla, Miriam, Stuart)
dialog: Get everybody out of here. Fast.
dialog: 
text: He steps back onto the bema, separating himself from the
text: others and drawing Drake's attention. The clock reads 7:28.
text: Outside we begin to hear SIRENS....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Drake...
dialog: 
text: Drake refocuses, pulls the girl on.... From the hall, we
text: hear OTHER GROUPS in the building, chanting....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v'aneyenu...
dialog: Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v'aneyenu,
dialog: ki eyn banu ma-asim...
dialog: (Our father, out king, graciously
dialog: answer us though we are undeserving...)
dialog: -- nu va-aneynu...
dialog: 
text: At the front, Drake wobbles. People start forward. He cocks
text: the gun against the little girl's head. She's weeping silently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Drake, I'm right here....
dialog: 
text: Drake looks. Danny reaches out a hand. Drake points the .357
text: at him and FIRES, missing. A HAND grabs the little girl,
text: pulls her to safety.
dialog: 
text: The room is nearly empty now, save Miriam, Carla, Stuart, a
text: few others. The AVINU MALKENU can still be heard from the
dialog: hall....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENRAGED MAN
dialog: (from the door)
dialog: Let them kill each other. They're
dialog: animals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENRAGED WIFE
dialog: Barry, for God's sake...
dialog: 
text: Drake wobbles from loss of blood. Nearly drops the .357.
dialog: 
text: Danny glances at the clock: 7:30. What is it, another dud??
dialog: 
text: Drake FIRES again, hits Danny in the shoulder....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Danny!
dialog: 
text: She runs forward. The shoulder hurts; he calls to the others....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: GET HER OUT OF HERE!
dialog: 
text: Miriam, others, grab Carla, pull Carla toward the door.
dialog: 
text: Drake comes toward Danny, trying to lift the .357 for the kill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Cha'nainu v'anainu, ki ain baw-nu
dialog: ma'ah-seem...
dialog: 
text: Danny grabs Drake's gun hand, forces it up in the air. The
text: gun goes off. Plaster rains down on them.
dialog: 
text: Drake dies. Danny catches him under the arms.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the watch: 7:32. He relaxes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: (fervent)
dialog: ...Asey imanu tz'dakah va'chesed...
dialog: Asey imanu tz'dakah va'chesd, v'ho-
dialog: shi --
dialog: 
text: The instant before the prayer ends...it's cut off by a
text: sudden silence. Then a FLASH of light...
dialog: 
text: The SCREEN GOES WHITE...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLA'S VOICE
dialog: Danny, no...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE, YESHIVA -- DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Where we saw Danny leave the school as a 12-year-old. Now
text: LOOKING DOWN, we see Danny as an adult, coming up them two
dialog: at a time.
dialog: 
text: FOLLOWING DANNY as he races up. His old teacher, RAV
text: ZINGESSER, appears on a landing above....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAV ZINGESSER
dialog: Danny, good to see you...I wanted to
dialog: take up that discussion we were
dialog: having...
text: (as Danny hurries past)
dialog: ...about Abraham and Isaac.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I can't right now....
dialog: 
text: But as he nears the NEXT LANDING, there is Zingesser waiting
dialog: for him again...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZINGESSER
dialog: You remember what you said, that
dialog: Isaac actually died on Mt. Moriah?
dialog: I've been thinking maybe you're
dialog: right... Died yet was reborn in olam
dialog: ha-bah....
dialog: 
text: Danny goes past once more....
dialog: 
text: But now, LOOKING DOWN at Zingesser as he appears above Danny
text: yet again. As Danny nears the landing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZINGESSER
dialog: Danny, stop...
dialog: (as Danny goes by,
dialog: calling after him)
dialog: ...Where are you going?... Don't you
dialog: know, there's nobody up there?
dialog: 
text: As Danny passes the camera we PAN to watch him still racing
dialog: upward. beyond us into the darkness....
