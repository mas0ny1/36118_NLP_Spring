scene_heading: EXT. EUROPEAN VILLAGE ~ STREET - NIGHT
text: On a heavily shadowed street, two enemy Guards patrol a
text: tactically important village block. Inside the most
text: Prominent building, a party is in Progress, music wafting
text: out into the street. The two Guards meet at a corner near
text: the party's entrance, one loaning a cigarette to the other.
text: Then they reverse their directions, walk apart, the Second
text: Guard disappearing into the darkness of the night. Titles
dialog: begin.
text: Suddenly, Jack Flack, everything a spy should be, swoops
text: into view, riding a square American-flag parachute down
text: from a nearby rooftop. Red, white, and blue cut through
text: the darkness as he lands directly on top of the First Guard.
text: The parachute envelops them both. Two bodies thrash within
text: the silk. A moment later, Flack steps out, glances down the
text: empty street. He wears a pair of tight pants and a beauti-
text: fully cut brown leather jacket, molded perfectly to his
text: broad shoulders, tapering to a tight fit around his slender
dialog: waist. .
text: He pushes a hidden button on his jacket, and, with a whoosh,
text: the parachute repacks itself instantly back into the jacket,
text: showing not even a Lump.

text: The Second Guard turns around, heads back toward the party
dialog: building.
text: Jack Flack strolls nonchalantly up to the Second Guard, who
text: challenges him.

dialog: Halt! Identify yourself.
text: A moment of tension is followed by Jack Flack suavely

text: The Second Guard looks suspicious, pumps the action on his
dialog: rifle.
text: Jack Flack blows a feather-tufted poison dart from his
text: cigarette and into the neck of the Second Guard, who
text: instantly stumbles and falls. TITLES CONTINUE.
text: An expensive period limo pulls up. Out of it steps a
text: villainous Iranian (with an uncanny resemblance to Khomeini),
text: arm-in-arm with the lovely Lady Gillingham, a voluptuous
text: Englishwoman. They are followed by a fat Soviet diplomat,
text: who carries a thin black briefcase chained to his right
dialog: arm.
text: From the shadows, Flack makes his move: just as the black
text: bag is passing him, he whips out a cord from his Jack Flack
text: spy watch, with the same action used to start a chainsaw.
text: Indeed, he is starting a chainsaw, a miniature one. Its
text: tiny but effective blade running from his watch to his
text: other hand. He instantly cuts through the chain, grabs the
text: black bag, and the flexible saw retracts back into his
dialog: watch.
text: The Iranian lunges at him with a scimitar. Flack deftly
text: kicks the knife high into the night sky, then Kung Fu kicks
text: the Iranian! Lady Gillingham draws a Luger from a bra
text: holsterette, fires at Flack, who cleverly doffs his
text: official hat with the shiny bulletproof-steel inner liner.
text: He holds the hat shield between himself and the bullet,
text: causing it to ricochet off and plant itself right between
text: Lady Gillingham's beautiful eyes.
dialog: The Russian diplomat pulls one of those bowling ball-type
text: bombs out of his pocket, its fuse already burning. He
text: tesses it at Flack, whose spy drill kit Presents itself. He
text: instantly drills three holes in the burning bomb, inserts
text: his fingers into it, and, exhibiting pro bowler prowess,
text: bowls it at the diplomat and a group of soldiers, who are
text: running in pin formation to his aid. The bomb explodes,
dialog: sending them flying.
text: Jack Flack knows enemy reinforcements are on the way, so he
text: ducks around the corner, the prized black bag safe in his
text: hands. TITLES CONTINUE.

text: Frantically, the spy again reverses his direction, runs for
