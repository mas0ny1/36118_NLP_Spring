dialog: The problem is the intercept velocity.
dialog: The Hermes cannot enter Mars orbit, or
dialog: they'll never have enough fuel to make it
dialog: home. The MAV is only designed to get to
dialog: Low Mars Orbit. So in order for Mark to
dialog: escape Mars' gravity entirely and
dialog: intercept the Hermes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: He needs to be going fast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUCE
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Which means we need to make the MAV
text: lighter. A lot lighter. Five-thousand
dialog: kilograms lighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You can do that?
dialog: 
dialog: Bruce gives him a look that says, well, that depends on your
text: definition of "do that," Vincent. He begins to deconstruct a
dialog: scale model of the MAV:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: There were some gimmes right off the bat.
text: The design presumes 500 kilograms of
dialog: Martian soil and samples. Obviously, we
dialog: won't do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: There's just one passenger instead of
dialog: six. With suits and gear, that saves

dialog: support. We don't need it. We'll have
dialog: Watney use his EVA suit for the whole
dialog: trip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How will he use the controls?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He won't. Martinez will pilot the MAV
text: remotely from the Hermes.

speaker_heading: VINCENT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUCE (CONT'D)
dialog: The hull's mostly there to keep the air

speaker_heading: LEWIS

speaker_heading: MAV?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: Negative, Commander. They ditched the

speaker_heading: LEWIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHANSSEN
dialog: 39 minutes, 12 seconds --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: What if we point our attitude thrusters

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ

speaker_heading: LEWIS
speaker_heading: JOHANSSEN --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHANSSEN
dialog: (already working it)
dialog: Use 75.5 percent of remaining attitude
dialog: adjust fuel. That'll bring the intercept
dialog: range to zero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHANSSEN
dialog: Hang on -- that gets the range to zero,
dialog: but the intercept velocity will be 42
dialog: meters per second --

speaker_heading: LEWIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK (OVER COMMS)
dialog: How bad is it, Commander?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: We've corrected the intercept range, but

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I could find something sharp in here and
text: poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit.
dialog: I could use the escaping air as a

dialog: it pretty easy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I can't see you having any control if you

speaker_heading: MARK (OVER COMMS)
dialog: Those are very good points. But.
speaker_heading: CONSIDER THIS:

scene_heading: INT. MAV - DAY

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: You want to open the Vehicular Airlock?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: It would give us a good kick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: Yeah. And it might blow the nose of the
text: ship off in the process.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHANSSEN
dialog: And... all the air would leave. And we
dialog: need air. To not die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: We'll seal the bridge and reactor room.
dialog: We let everywhere else go vacuo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: But we'd still have the same problem as
dialog: Watney. We can't direct the thrust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: We don't have to. The VAL is in the
text: nose. We just point the ship at Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: (reading the numbers)
dialog: A breach at the VAL would decelerate us
dialog: 29 meters per second.
