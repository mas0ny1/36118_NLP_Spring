scene_heading: INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY
text: Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi
dialog: zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.
text: Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the
text: cab we hear the sounds of the airport: the almost monotonic
dialog: loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not
dialog: permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that
dialog: they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other
text: automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get
text: their bearings. Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is
text: Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".
text: Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE
text: UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes
text: shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red
text: hair. His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.
text: He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy
text: going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Hotel Mondial.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Le Mondial. Tres bien.
text: He starts driving.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un
dialog: moment. L'autoroute est ferme. A cause
dialog: du 14 Juillet.
text: He drives for a while.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: [Do you mind the radio?]
text: Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away. He also
text: looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du
dialog: Bois.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: [Do you want me to turn the radio off?]
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (realizing he's being asked a
dialog: question)
dialog: I don't speak French.
text: The driver turns around.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: (in broken English)
dialog: Ah. American?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: That's good because I speak a little
dialog: English.
text: Zed nods.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: I asked if you mind the radio. Music.
dialog: You know.
text: Zed shakes his head "no".
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Super cool.
text: Zed adjusts his watch.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Time, time, time. I don't know.
dialog: Daytime.
text: Zed forgets the adjustment for now.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Are you in town for business?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: It's a nice hotel. Your hotel. Very big
dialog: rooms.
text: He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Do you know Paris?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I've been here once before. When I was
dialog: younger.
text: The cab driver smiles.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Those were the days.
text: They drive for a while.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Married?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Do you have a wife?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No.
dialog: (then after thinking about it
dialog: for a while)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Well, if you need a wife for the night...
dialog: (searching for the right words
dialog: in French)
dialog: Une escorte. Pour vous faire visiter.
dialog: (then back to his broken
dialog: English)
dialog: For business. I give you my number.
dialog: Very nice girl. French. Like when you
dialog: were young.
text: He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger
text: tightly extended together, then he crosses them.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Know what I mean?
text: Zed smiles at this and nods.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Speaks the language of love. Take you to
dialog: heaven and back. You just tell me and I
dialog: set it up.
text: Zed shakes his head and laughs.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: What you laughing at? You let Moises set
dialog: it up. She treat you right. She treat
dialog: you fine.
text: Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY
text: A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel. From
text: around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.
text: Zed is right behind him.
text: They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed,
text: walks into the room.
text: He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and
text: proceeds to show him the room.
text: Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: (in broken English)
dialog: Your package...It arrived in the last
dialog: night of before last night.
text: He points to the telephone.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Ah...telephone, for the room service.
text: He motions toward the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
text: The toilet.
text: He opens the closet door.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: To hang the clothes.
text: He points to a control console next to the bed.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: From here you can operate the television.
text: Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.
text: Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money,
text: he starts fingering through it.
text: Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which
dialog: bills to give him.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: (after getting what he wanted)
dialog: Merci.
text: He starts to leave.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Oh, wait.
text: The bellboy turns around.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (pointing at his watch)
dialog: Time.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures
dialog: moins dix.
text: The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.
text: Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is,
text: and takes a seat on the bed.
text: Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit
text: and lays back on the bed next to the package. Before he
text: dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on
text: the bedside table.
text: He is asleep.
text: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY
text: Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.
text: Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package. Inside
text: of it is a black steel briefcase.
text: The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.
text: On the bedside table we see Zed's watch. It reads 12:10 P.M.
text: Next to it is the phone. Next to the phone is a piece of
text: folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:
dialog: 45.63.53.37.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY
text: Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his
text: face and cascade down his body.
text: He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits
dialog: some out with a spurt.
text: Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.
text: He turns the shower off.
text: Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower. He makes his
text: way toward the knocking.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped
text: around his waist. He opens it.
text: In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than
text: twenty. She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but
text: she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Bonjour.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (a little awkwardly)
dialog: Bonjour.
text: Zed opens up the door and lets her in. She checks out the
text: room and places her bag on the bed. Then she makes her way
text: to the window for a view of the city.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Wow. Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne
dialog: suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.
text: She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to
text: examine every detail of the room.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure. Toute la
dialog: nuit pour 700. D'avance. Et faudra
dialog: porter un--
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I...don't speak French.
text: She blows a bubble.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: It's okay.
text: She takes a seat on the bed.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: It will be one thousand francs for all
dialog: night. In advance.
text: Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: We can do it now if you want.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, let me just dry up.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Okay, but it's not necessary.
text: He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.
text: She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the
text: television from the remote console. A French talk show comes
text: on. She changes the channel until she comes to a station
text: playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu". She
text: smiles and sits back to watch.
speaker_heading: ZED(O.S.)
dialog: (from the bathroom)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.
speaker_heading: ZED(O.S.)
dialog: My name's Zed.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (smiling at this)
dialog: That's funny. We both have Z names.
text: Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair. His
text: pants are on.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What was that?
text: She notices his pants.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: You can take those off. The pants.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I'd rather watch you get undressed first.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (matter-of-factly)
dialog: Alright.
text: She stands up and starts to lift her top off. He stops her.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Slower.
text: He lays down on the bed.
text: She stands there looking at him and then smiles.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Alright Mister America. Zed.
text: Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she
text: slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her
text: eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Slow enough for you?
text: Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the
text: bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.
text: She removes the pants and climbs on top of him. They begin
dialog: to make love.
text: On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.
text: Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't
text: resist during a moment of passion.
text: She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp. An IMAGE
text: overcomes her mind.
text: They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both
dialog: satisfied.
text: She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: C'etait formidable.
text: She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.
text: They rest there for a while...holding each other.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I'm cold.
text: She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Zed?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Moises told me you were in town for
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: What kind of business?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I don't know. I'm just curious.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Do you ask all your clients questions?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: No. Just the ones I like.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: So you like me?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Because you're...a good person. I run
dialog: into some real creeps. You know.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: How do you know I'm a good person?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Body language. We fit together.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: All men and women fit together. Hell,
dialog: even some men fit together.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: No, but you know, we clicked. You made
dialog: me orgasm. Do you know how often I
dialog: orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No I don't.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Usually never. They're almost always fat
dialog: like pigs.
text: Zed laughs at this.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: And you make me feel safe. That's
dialog: something more important than the orgasm.
dialog: An integral part maybe of the orgasm.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I never really thought of it like that.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Well, it's true.
text: Zed nods at this.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
text: Turn off the television.
text: Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like
dialog: you very much.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, I like you too Zoe.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Honest?
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Why? For the same reason? Any man can
dialog: orgasm. Even with his own hand.
text: Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, I like your honesty. You're open.
dialog: Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.
text: She doesn't like the sound of this. She slaps him.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I am not a prostitute!
text: Zed is a little surprised at this.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Really? Can I have my francs back then?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I'm a student. And to pay for the
dialog: classes I became an escort. It's my
dialog: choice to sleep with you.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: What? You don't understand.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No, I do.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Hey, it's not easy.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I didn't say it was.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I'm here because I want to.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay, okay relax. What school do you go
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: The Centre du Art, Paris.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: That's really interesting. What kind of
dialog: art do you study?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Not any of the old shit.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I have a day job too. Three times a
dialog: week.
text: She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as
text: she talks to Zed.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: But someday there will be only my art.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What kind of things do you paint?
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I don't paint. I make things. Objects.
dialog: Not like sculpture. Like life...but with
dialog: no narrative. I want when someone looks
dialog: at one of my objects for there to be no
dialog: reference to the world. Void of feeling,
dialog: emotion...void of destiny. Those are
dialog: left for me. They belong only to me. If
dialog: someone else can see into it...then it is
dialog: no longer mine. I have failed. And I
dialog: would destroy it. I don't care how much
dialog: cash they would offer me. It would be
dialog: shit. I can't tell you how many objects
dialog: of mine have been destroyed. They told
dialog: too much about me. And if someone wants
dialog: to know something about me...I'll tell
dialog: them myself. The way I'm telling you.
text: She looks back at him.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: What I do I do only for the objects.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I'd like to see one of these.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: What? So you could see the work of a
dialog: whore?
text: He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a
dialog: prostitute. I didn't understand the
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: The difference is a prostitute would have
dialog: lied to you about her orgasm.
text: He gives her a kiss.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: If these things you make are as true as
dialog: you are...I'm sure they're as
dialog: indescribable. Perhaps, someday, you'll
dialog: make one...about me.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: If I do...you'll never know which one it
dialog: is. Because I'll be the only one who
dialog: understands. I'll be the only one who
dialog: can look into it and see where in my life
dialog: it came from.
text: Zed is unable to speak. They look into each others eyes for
text: a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in
text: through the window. Then she leans forward and gives him a
text: soft understanding kiss.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Zed is asleep. Zoey is asleep in his arms.
text: There is a knocking at the door.
text: Zed opens his eyes.
text: The knock becomes a pound.
text: Zed gets up and puts on his pants. Zoey gets up and looks
text: around.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (groggily)
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I have no idea. Night time.
text: There is more pounding on the door.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: I'm going to take a shower.
text: She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.
text: Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.
text: Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age
text: wearing baggy French-style clothes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (with a thick accent)
dialog: Hey you madman!
text: Zed's happy to see him.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Eric. Come in.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What happened to you? I thought you were
dialog: going to call.
text: Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love
text: making around the room.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh I see. You have been busy.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a
dialog: wake up call.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's good, but now I am here. So let's
dialog: go. We have a lot to talk about.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What about the girl?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Is she your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck her.
text: He peeks into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: She's a dishrag whore. Kick her out.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I'll let her stay here tonight.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Don't be silly. It's dangerous.
text: Eric walks into the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door. Zoey is
text: obviously surprised to see him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (in French with English
dialog: subtitles)
dialog: [Okay. Get out of the shower. It's time
dialog: for you to leave.]
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: [Fuck you.]
text: Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [No. Come on you fucking slut!]
text: She shrieks.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: [Let go of me you shit!!]
text: He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Zed can't believe this.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Eric.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Don't worry about her.
dialog: (to Zoey in French)
dialog: [Why don't you just go back to your pimp
dialog: and suck his black dick!]
text: She bites his hand. He yells in pain.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: God damn it!
text: He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Get the fuck out of here you fucking
dialog: whore!]
text: He opens the door and throws her into the hall.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT
text: Naked, Zoey falls into the hall.
text: Eric slams the door shut.
text: She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds
text: on the door.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: [Give me my clothes you asshole!]
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: She is pounding on the door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (looking at his hand wound)
dialog: God damn it. Look at my hand.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (shocked at the whole incident)
dialog: Jesus Eric.
speaker_heading: ZOEY(O.S.)
dialog: Ouvres! Je veux mes habits!
text: Eric listens.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh shit. Her clothes.
text: He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and
text: throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (almost too quick to
dialog: understand)
dialog: Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: La ferme!
text: He slams the door shut.
text: Then he turns to Zed.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So tell me, what have you been up to?
text: Zed sits down on the bed.
speaker_heading: ZOEY(O.S.)
dialog: Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Eric, I liked that girl.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh. Well, then why didn't you stop me.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Because you were on a rampage.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Look, your whole life you've done nothing
dialog: but fuck whores. A girl like that will
dialog: give you AIDS. Why don't you find a nice
dialog: girl in the suburbs?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Because when you need to get off you
dialog: don't want to have to date for months to
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Just use your hand like me.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Sometimes you just need honesty...and
dialog: security.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't understand. Anyway, it's too
dialog: late. Get dressed, let's go out and meet
dialog: the boys.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay, let me take a shower.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No, in Paris it's good to smell like
dialog: you've been fucking. It will make them
dialog: respect you.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.
text: Zed starts to get dressed
scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT
dialog: The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue
text: Soufflot is bustling.
text: Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past
text: the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in
text: Eric's car. The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is
text: playing on the radio.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Years.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's amazing, you know? Here you are.
dialog: One day in America. Now here.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, to be honest there really wasn't
dialog: much happening for me in the states.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a
dialog: job for you, so you came. That's good.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: How could I resist your invitation?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You would have been stupid to.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: So what have you been doing here?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: After school I spent some time in Algeria
dialog: studying African philosophy. And then I
dialog: bummed around. You know. For fun. For
dialog: a while I worked at Le Figaro. The
dialog: newspaper.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree.
dialog: And lately we have just been bombing
dialog: fascists here in Paris. You know, like
dialog: terrorists.
text: Zed looks over at him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's fun.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where
text: Eric's flat is. On the top landing there is a dead cat
text: laying. Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the
text: door.
text: There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The people next door are on holiday. We
dialog: took their phone. If you want to make a
dialog: long distance call, go ahead.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Is that cat dead?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't know. I think it's asleep but
dialog: it's been there for days.
text: Eric gives it a kick. No response.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I guess it is dead.
text: They walk into the flat.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a
text: connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. In the
text: front of the living room there is a small balcony where the
text: sounds of the city pour in. The room itself is a general
text: mess. A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.
text: Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill"
text: poster.
text: Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.
text: Sitting at the table playing cards are three men: FRANCOIS,
dialog: RICARDO, and JEAN.
text: Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE
dialog: and OLIVER.
text: They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Hello.
text: They all return the greeting.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean,
dialog: Oliver, and Claude. Got it?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: They all know who you are.
dialog: (to the rest of them)
dialog: Ne soyez pa salauds. Offrez une biere au
dialog: plus grand perceur de coffres.
text: Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (with an English accent)
dialog: Zed, would you like a beer?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Don't think of it.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Come. Sit down.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The kitchen is an absolute pig stye. Dishes are piled up in
text: the sink and on the counter.
text: Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties
text: it. He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer
text: into the glass.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.
text: Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam
text: costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto
text: his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.
text: Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Zed)
text: Easy. Don't scare him. He just wants to
dialog: claim you.
text: Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto
text: Claude's shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Let me introduce you properly. This is
dialog: Enrique.
text: The monkey screeches.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we
dialog: don't always get what we like...do we?
text: Again, the hideous creature screeches.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Enrique)
dialog: Tais-toi!
dialog: (then to Zed)
dialog: Do you like hash?
text: Then Eric interrupts.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Don't sit next to that junkie.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Ahhhhhh!
text: Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a
text: mass of sparks. They laugh.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Claude)
dialog: That little shit monkey of yours pissed
dialog: on my Billy Holiday albums. Next time
text: he's out the door.
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Zed, come here.
text: Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom. On the way
text: Oliver hands him the glass of beer.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Here you go mate.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Thanks.
text: Oliver sits down next to Claude.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Eric's bed has probably never been made. In fact, this room
text: looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment. But,
text: there is a certain order to all this chaos. Eric pulls out a
text: blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Don't ask me where we got this.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: On Bastille Day, all the banks are
dialog: closed.
text: He places his hand on the blueprint.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But this one. BIP. The Banque
dialog: Internationale de Paris. And for being
dialog: greedy capitalists perhaps they will
dialog: remain closed next Bastille day. Yes?
text: Zed smiles.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We will go in and shut the bank down.
dialog: Now, look at this.
text: Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: As you can see, only one person can start
text: the alarm.
dialog: (he hands it to Zed)
dialog: The concierge, at this desk.
dialog: (he points it out on the
dialog: blueprint)
dialog: We will take care of him. Then we can
dialog: close the bank. No one will know the
dialog: difference since every other bank will be
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (turning the schematic around)
dialog: Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Ahhh! He's right next to the door. We'd
dialog: have to be totally incompetent not to
dialog: stop him. Don't worry about that.
text: He points to the main floor vault.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Here. This is where they keep the days
dialog: reserve cash. Okay fuck that.
text: He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There are many vaults downstairs, but
dialog: this is the vault we must get into. This
dialog: is where the real prize is.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What kind of vault is that?
text: He checks the blueprint.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Ah...Swiss made. A Caliber.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Caliber?
dialog: (he thinks about it)
dialog: It'll take three hours.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No, that's too long.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: That's how long it'll take.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Well shit. It's too long. We have to be
dialog: in and out.
dialog: (he snaps his fingers)
dialog: Like that. Or there will be suspicion.
dialog: A little time is okay...but too long
dialog: and...
text: He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well hold on a second.
dialog: (pointing to the blueprint)
dialog: What's this?
text: Eric looks down at the blueprint. There is a small passage
text: connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Another vault.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No this.
text: Eric looks closely at the blueprint.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't know...it connects the two
dialog: vaults.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, what kind of vault is this other
dialog: one?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (reading the blueprint)
dialog: Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Why would those two vaults be connected?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Because I can get into this vault in half
dialog: an hour. Maybe less.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But this entry way is too small to get
dialog: the platen out. We have a lot of
dialog: merchandise in there.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No, don't you see? We get in through
dialog: this secondary vault and take this
dialog: passage to the other main vault. From
dialog: the inside I could open the Caliber vault
dialog: in five minutes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You could open it in five minutes?
speaker_heading: ZED
text: From the inside it's easy.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Hot damn. That is our answer.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay. When is Bastille day?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Tomorrow!? We're doing this tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But of course.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's not impossible. Everyone knows what
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I don't know what to do.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You don't need to know shit. Just get
dialog: into the vault and we'll do the rest.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I haven't even seen the bank.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck the bank. Before we do a job we
dialog: live life. It's better that way. Okay?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Good. Now we do heroin!
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: EXTREME CLOSE ON: Eric making heroin.
text: The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon
text: squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water. Huddled
text: around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (so high he's wobbling)
dialog: You have to look at the Starship
dialog: Enterprise as a metaphor for the human
dialog: brain.
text: No one is really listening to Oliver. Eric takes out a
text: lighter and cooks it to a boil.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Spock is the right hemisphere of the
dialog: brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is
text: the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.
text: And Kirk is the unseen observer. He
text: drifts between the two. Back and forth,
dialog: as it might be, caught between the two
dialog: thought processes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Cotton.]
text: Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's really quite brilliant you know.
dialog: That's why Star Trek is and always will
dialog: be a hit show.
text: Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: [Here, shut up and hold this.]
text: He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle. Using the
text: cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.
text: Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Don't want to get air bubbles in my
dialog: veins.]
text: They all laugh at this.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and
text: Jean. Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette. Jean
text: is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small
text: picture.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Do you want heroin?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.
text: Jean and Claude laugh at this.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a
dialog: beer...and you're just right.
text: Jean snorts a line.
text: Claude offers Zed the spliff. Zed shakes his head "no".
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (recovering from the snort)
dialog: That's good.
text: Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen
text: laughing.
text: Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite
text: Zed. Francois sits on the floor.
text: Eric rolls up his sleeve.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Ricardo in French)
dialog: [Hold my arm.]
dialog: (then to Zed)
dialog: My vein is like a rock.
text: Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes. Eric inserts the
text: needle into his vein and draws out a little blood. It mixes
text: with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the
text: syringe, then all the way back in.
text: He withdraws the needle.
text: Ricardo lets go of his arm.
text: Eric is in bliss. His eyes roll back into his head. He
text: looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.
text: Then Jean takes another snort.
text: Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting
text: up, and drinking more beer.
text: Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some
dialog: heroin in it.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Try some. It's called chasing the
dialog: dragon. The Chinese have been doing it
dialog: for centuries.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh, but you must. It will make you feel
dialog: as though the rest of the world is in a
dialog: bubble of glass and that you're rubbing
text: up against it like a bad windshield
dialog: wiper.
text: They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to
text: his face. They then light the bottom of the foil with a
text: lighter. Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon
text: of smoke.
text: Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...
text: FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris
text: weaving in and out of traffic. Next to him is Oliver, and in
text: the back seat is Zed and Eric. They're giving the very
text: stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.
text: A car speeds up next to them. In it is Francois, and Claude,
text: with Jean driving. They are racing with Ricardo through the
text: streets.
text: The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting
dialog: away on the radio.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There. That's Notre Dame.
text: But before Zed can even look it has past by.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: Do you like French cars?
text: All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160
text: kilometers per hour. He tries to calculate what that is in
dialog: miles per hour.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (answering Enrique's question)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: I like the Cadillac. Fifty-two to
dialog: seventy-five. Very nice.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.
text: Zed is in too much of a blur. He leans over to Eric.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Is tomorrow really Bastille day?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in
dialog: French history. And spend the rest of
dialog: our lives in Monte Carlo.
text: The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT
text: The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.
scene_heading: INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it
dialog: is they're going to.
text: Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Faster, faster...go faster. Let's beat
dialog: them!]
text: Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT
text: Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and
text: cuts off Ricardo.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [Shit! That bastard.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Ricardo)
dialog: Watch it! Don't crash my car.
text: Eric takes a big hit.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Over here is where the male prostitutes
dialog: sell themselves. Do you see?
text: No, Zed doesn't see.
text: Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (out the window)
dialog: Fucking fags!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (also out the window)
dialog: Suce ma bite?!
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: Perverts d'homosexuels!
text: Eric laughs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into Zed's ear)
dialog: This is good to have you here. We could
dialog: not do this without you.
text: Zed nods.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Everyone has agreed to give you double
dialog: shares. That's good.
text: Zed nods, delirious.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You know I have AIDS. From the needle.
text: Zed can't believe this. He's not sure if what he heard was
dialog: what he thought he heard.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Really?
text: Then Eric sees something.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.
text: They take a sharp turn.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
dialog: Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are
text: all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.
text: Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.
text: An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.
text: Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables
text: scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for
dialog: great acoustics.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: a BAND is playing away. In the audience sit about TWELVE
text: FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.
text: AT THE BUFFET
text: In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been
text: set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it. Behind the
text: tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE.
dialog: Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk
text: in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle
dialog: and Josephine.
text: Eric hands them some money.
speaker_heading: ZED'S TABLE
text: Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.
text: Oliver sits next to Zed.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: So, how long have you known Eric?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, Eric's mother is American.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yeah, and his dad's French.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: They're divorced. And she and his father
dialog: had some kind of six month split plan set
dialog: up. So every six months he would come
dialog: back to the states. We were best
dialog: friends. Eventually he and his mother
dialog: had a falling out and he stayed here.
dialog: It's been...years.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, it's good to have you here. Eric
dialog: speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he
dialog: says you're a big fan of Viking films.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well...I suppose. I used to be, when I
dialog: was young.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh they're the best. Helmets with horns
dialog: on them. Shit. That's fucking genius.
text: He starts laughing.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: How 'bout Toy Jazz? You like it?
text: Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yeah...I guess.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I love it. It's really good, you know?
dialog: Like real music. It has a heart and
dialog: culture all it's own. It's, like, jazz
dialog: for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.
dialog: Total purity of essence.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Hungry cannibals'd like it.
text: Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle
dialog: of red wine.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Here, you must drink some of this wine,
dialog: it's good.
text: He pours Zed a glass.
text: Oliver passes on the wine.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (to Claude)
dialog: Non merci, c'est de la merde.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: La ferme. C'est du bon vin.
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: The fucking English.
text: Zed sips some. He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's
dialog: good or not.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.
text: The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a
dialog: delirium of music.
text: The band stands up.
text: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats
text: then right in front of everything.
speaker_heading: ZED'S TABLE
text: Suddenly, Zed notices something...
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the
dialog: band.
speaker_heading: ZED'S TABLE
text: Zed blinks but it's true.
text: Oliver and Claude start laughing.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Look at him. He's crazy.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up
dialog: with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.
text: Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running
text: down his face but he's caught up in the moment.
text: ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the
text: stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like
dialog: James Brown.
text: Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back
dialog: to a musician.
text: The set is over.
text: Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver,
text: Claude, and Zed are sitting.
scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT
dialog: The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue
text: Soufflot is bustling.
text: Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past
text: the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in
text: Eric's car. The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is
text: playing on the radio.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Years.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's amazing, you know? Here you are.
dialog: One day in America. Now here.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, to be honest there really wasn't
dialog: much happening for me in the states.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a
dialog: job for you, so you came. That's good.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: How could I resist your invitation?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You would have been stupid to.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: So what have you been doing here?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: After school I spent some time in Algeria
dialog: studying African philosophy. And then I
dialog: bummed around. You know. For fun. For
dialog: a while I worked at Le Figaro. The
dialog: newspaper.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree.
dialog: And lately we have just been bombing
dialog: fascists here in Paris. You know, like
dialog: terrorists.
text: Zed looks over at him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's fun.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where
text: Eric's flat is. On the top landing there is a dead cat
text: laying. Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the
text: door.
text: There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The people next door are on holiday. We
dialog: took their phone. If you want to make a
dialog: long distance call, go ahead.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Is that cat dead?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't know. I think it's asleep but
dialog: it's been there for days.
text: Eric gives it a kick. No response.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I guess it is dead.
text: They walk into the flat.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a
text: connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. In the
text: front of the living room there is a small balcony where the
text: sounds of the city pour in. The room itself is a general
text: mess. A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.
text: Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill"
text: poster.
text: Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.
text: Sitting at the table playing cards are three men: FRANCOIS,
dialog: RICARDO, and JEAN.
text: Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE
dialog: and OLIVER.
text: They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Hello.
text: They all return the greeting.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean,
dialog: Oliver, and Claude. Got it?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: They all know who you are.
dialog: (to the rest of them)
dialog: Ne soyez pa salauds. Offrez une biere au
dialog: plus grand perceur de coffres.
text: Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (with an English accent)
dialog: Zed, would you like a beer?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Don't think of it.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Come. Sit down.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The kitchen is an absolute pig stye. Dishes are piled up in
text: the sink and on the counter.
text: Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties
text: it. He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer
text: into the glass.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.
text: Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam
text: costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto
text: his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.
text: Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Zed)
text: Easy. Don't scare him. He just wants to
dialog: claim you.
text: Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto

dialog: Tais-toi!
dialog: (then to Zed)
dialog: Do you like hash?
text: Then Eric interrupts.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Don't sit next to that junkie.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Ahhhhhh!
text: Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Claude)
dialog: That little shit monkey of yours pissed
dialog: on my Billy Holiday albums. Next time
text: he's out the door.
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Zed, come here.
text: Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom. On the way
text: Oliver hands him the glass of beer.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Here you go mate.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Thanks.
text: Oliver sits down next to Claude.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Eric's bed has probably never been made. In fact, this room
text: looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment. But,
text: there is a certain order to all this chaos. Eric pulls out a

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Don't ask me where we got this.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: On Bastille Day, all the banks are

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But this one. BIP. The Banque

text: Zed smiles.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We will go in and shut the bank down.

speaker_heading: ZED

speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Ahhh! He's right next to the door. We'd
dialog: have to be totally incompetent not to
dialog: stop him. Don't worry about that.
text: He points to the main floor vault.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Here. This is where they keep the days
dialog: reserve cash. Okay fuck that.
text: He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There are many vaults downstairs, but

dialog: is where the real prize is.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What kind of vault is that?

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: ZED

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No, that's too long.
speaker_heading: ZED

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Well shit. It's too long. We have to be
dialog: in and out.
dialog: (he snaps his fingers)

dialog: and...
text: He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well hold on a second.
dialog: (pointing to the blueprint)
dialog: What's this?
text: Eric looks down at the blueprint. There is a small passage
text: connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Another vault.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No this.
text: Eric looks closely at the blueprint.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't know...it connects the two
dialog: vaults.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, what kind of vault is this other
dialog: one?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (reading the blueprint)
dialog: Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Why would those two vaults be connected?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Because I can get into this vault in half
dialog: an hour. Maybe less.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But this entry way is too small to get
dialog: the platen out. We have a lot of
dialog: merchandise in there.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No, don't you see? We get in through
dialog: this secondary vault and take this
dialog: passage to the other main vault. From
dialog: the inside I could open the Caliber vault
dialog: in five minutes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You could open it in five minutes?
speaker_heading: ZED
text: From the inside it's easy.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Hot damn. That is our answer.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay. When is Bastille day?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Tomorrow!? We're doing this tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But of course.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's not impossible. Everyone knows what
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I don't know what to do.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You don't need to know shit. Just get
dialog: into the vault and we'll do the rest.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I haven't even seen the bank.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck the bank. Before we do a job we
dialog: live life. It's better that way. Okay?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Good. Now we do heroin!
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: EXTREME CLOSE ON: Eric making heroin.
text: The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon
text: squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water. Huddled
text: around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (so high he's wobbling)
dialog: You have to look at the Starship
dialog: Enterprise as a metaphor for the human
dialog: brain.
text: No one is really listening to Oliver. Eric takes out a
text: lighter and cooks it to a boil.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Spock is the right hemisphere of the
dialog: brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is
text: the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.
text: And Kirk is the unseen observer. He
text: drifts between the two. Back and forth,
dialog: as it might be, caught between the two
dialog: thought processes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Cotton.]
text: Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's really quite brilliant you know.
dialog: That's why Star Trek is and always will
dialog: be a hit show.
text: Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: [Here, shut up and hold this.]
text: He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle. Using the
text: cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.
text: Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Don't want to get air bubbles in my
dialog: veins.]
text: They all laugh at this.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and
text: Jean. Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette. Jean
text: is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small
text: picture.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Do you want heroin?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.
text: Jean and Claude laugh at this.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a
dialog: beer...and you're just right.
text: Jean snorts a line.
text: Claude offers Zed the spliff. Zed shakes his head "no".
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (recovering from the snort)
dialog: That's good.
text: Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen
text: laughing.
text: Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite
text: Zed. Francois sits on the floor.
text: Eric rolls up his sleeve.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Ricardo in French)
dialog: [Hold my arm.]
dialog: (then to Zed)
dialog: My vein is like a rock.
text: Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes. Eric inserts the
text: needle into his vein and draws out a little blood. It mixes
text: with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the
text: syringe, then all the way back in.
text: He withdraws the needle.
text: Ricardo lets go of his arm.
text: Eric is in bliss. His eyes roll back into his head. He
text: looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.
text: Then Jean takes another snort.
text: Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting
text: up, and drinking more beer.
text: Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some
dialog: heroin in it.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: Try some. It's called chasing the
dialog: dragon. The Chinese have been doing it
dialog: for centuries.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh, but you must. It will make you feel
dialog: as though the rest of the world is in a
dialog: bubble of glass and that you're rubbing
text: up against it like a bad windshield
dialog: wiper.
text: They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to
text: his face. They then light the bottom of the foil with a
text: lighter. Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon
text: of smoke.
text: Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...
text: FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris
text: weaving in and out of traffic. Next to him is Oliver, and in
text: the back seat is Zed and Eric. They're giving the very
text: stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.
text: A car speeds up next to them. In it is Francois, and Claude,
text: with Jean driving. They are racing with Ricardo through the
text: streets.
text: The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting
dialog: away on the radio.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: There. That's Notre Dame.
text: But before Zed can even look it has past by.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: Do you like French cars?
text: All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160
text: kilometers per hour. He tries to calculate what that is in
dialog: miles per hour.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (answering Enrique's question)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: I like the Cadillac. Fifty-two to
dialog: seventy-five. Very nice.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.
text: Zed is in too much of a blur. He leans over to Eric.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Is tomorrow really Bastille day?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in
dialog: French history. And spend the rest of
dialog: our lives in Monte Carlo.
text: The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT
text: The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.
scene_heading: INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it
dialog: is they're going to.
text: Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Faster, faster...go faster. Let's beat
dialog: them!]
text: Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT
text: Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and
text: cuts off Ricardo.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [Shit! That bastard.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Ricardo)
dialog: Watch it! Don't crash my car.
text: Eric takes a big hit.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Over here is where the male prostitutes
dialog: sell themselves. Do you see?
text: No, Zed doesn't see.
text: Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (out the window)
dialog: Fucking fags!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (also out the window)
dialog: Suce ma bite?!
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: Perverts d'homosexuels!
text: Eric laughs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into Zed's ear)
dialog: This is good to have you here. We could
dialog: not do this without you.
text: Zed nods.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Everyone has agreed to give you double
dialog: shares. That's good.
text: Zed nods, delirious.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You know I have AIDS. From the needle.
text: Zed can't believe this. He's not sure if what he heard was
dialog: what he thought he heard.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Really?
text: Then Eric sees something.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.
text: They take a sharp turn.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
dialog: Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are
text: all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.
text: Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.
text: An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.
text: Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables
text: scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for
dialog: great acoustics.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: a BAND is playing away. In the audience sit about TWELVE
text: FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.
text: AT THE BUFFET
text: In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been
text: set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it. Behind the
text: tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and
speaker_heading: JOSEPHINE.
dialog: Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk
text: in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle
dialog: and Josephine.
text: Eric hands them some money.
speaker_heading: ZED'S TABLE
text: Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.
text: Oliver sits next to Zed.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: So, how long have you known Eric?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, Eric's mother is American.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yeah, and his dad's French.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: They're divorced. And she and his father
dialog: had some kind of six month split plan set
dialog: up. So every six months he would come
dialog: back to the states. We were best
dialog: friends. Eventually he and his mother
dialog: had a falling out and he stayed here.
dialog: It's been...years.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, it's good to have you here. Eric
dialog: speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he
dialog: says you're a big fan of Viking films.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well...I suppose. I used to be, when I
dialog: was young.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh they're the best. Helmets with horns
dialog: on them. Shit. That's fucking genius.
text: He starts laughing.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: How 'bout Toy Jazz? You like it?
text: Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yeah...I guess.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I love it. It's really good, you know?
dialog: Like real music. It has a heart and
dialog: culture all it's own. It's, like, jazz
dialog: for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.
dialog: Total purity of essence.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Hungry cannibals'd like it.
text: Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle
dialog: of red wine.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Here, you must drink some of this wine,
dialog: it's good.
text: He pours Zed a glass.
text: Oliver passes on the wine.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (to Claude)
dialog: Non merci, c'est de la merde.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: La ferme. C'est du bon vin.
dialog: (to Zed)
dialog: The fucking English.
text: Zed sips some. He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's
dialog: good or not.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.
text: The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a
dialog: delirium of music.
text: The band stands up.
text: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats
text: then right in front of everything.
speaker_heading: ZED'S TABLE
text: Suddenly, Zed notices something...
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the
dialog: band.
speaker_heading: ZED'S TABLE
text: Zed blinks but it's true.
text: Oliver and Claude start laughing.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Look at him. He's crazy.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up
dialog: with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.
text: Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running
text: down his face but he's caught up in the moment.
text: ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the
text: stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like
dialog: James Brown.
text: Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back
dialog: to a musician.
text: The set is over.
text: Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver,
text: Claude, and Zed are sitting.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY
text: EXTREME CLOSE ON: The door to the bank.
text: Francois puts a sign on the door that reads: [Closed for
dialog: Bastille Day].
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY HALL - DAY
text: The sub lobby teller and the sub lobby guard #2 rendezvous
dialog: with the sub lobby assistant.
speaker_heading: SUB LOBBY TELLER
dialog: (to assistant)
dialog: [Do the phones work?]
speaker_heading: SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT
dialog: [They went dead.]
speaker_heading: SUB LOBBY TELLER
dialog: Merde!
text: They walk out into the sub lobby.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY
text: The sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into
text: the sub lobby just as Eric, Zed, Oliver, and the bank manager
text: start coming down the stairs.
text: At the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims
text: his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager.
text: Eric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to the guard)
dialog: [Drop the gun!]
dialog: He doesn't.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Drop your gun now and nobody dies!]
dialog: After a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver
text: has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the
text: floor.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Good boy.]
text: They descend down the stairs into the sub lobby.
text: Oliver takes his gun.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Francois, Ricardo, and Jean have finished herding everyone
text: behind the teller windows. Claude is on his way downstairs.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [I'm going to check things out
dialog: downstairs.]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: (to the people)
dialog: [Now! On the ground! Face down!]
text: Then, for effect, he kicks a man.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY
text: Claude comes downstairs with his gun raised.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [All clear down here?]
text: Everyone turns.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Take these two upstairs. And chain the
dialog: gate to the sub lobby shut.]
text: Oliver pushes the sub lobby guard #2 and the sub lobby
text: assistant toward Claude. Then he hands him a chain.
text: Claude can barely maintain his enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [The phones and video are down! We're
dialog: locked up tight!]
dialog: (then in English)
dialog: We fucking did it!
text: He takes the two upstairs.
text: Eric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Any others I should worry about?]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [No.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: [Well, just to be sure--]
text: Then, from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard.
text: All eyes turn to it.
text: Oliver walks up to it and kicks the door in. The stodgy
text: customer is kneeling in it. He instantly holds his hands
dialog: high.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: [Freeze motherfucker!]
text: Eric walks up, gun in hand.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Who the fuck are you?]
speaker_heading: STODGY CUSTOMER
dialog: [Please don't shoot me!]
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: [On the ground!]
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to the bank manager)
dialog: [Making a deposit I hope.]
dialog: (he smiles to Oliver)
dialog: [Bring him with us.]
text: They all make their way down through the sub lobby hall.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
text: They're herding the men through the hall.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: (to the sub lobby teller)
dialog: [Vault locked?]
speaker_heading: SUB LOBBY TELLER
dialog: [Yes.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Shut your fucking mouths!]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: (to Eric)
dialog: [The vault doors are shut and time
dialog: locked. You won't be able to open them.]
text: They walk through a doorway into the storage/elevator area.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
text: Eric pushes the manager and the others through the doorway.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to the bank manager)
dialog: [You think we're fucking amateurs? You
dialog: think we're stupid? I've got news for
dialog: you...we planned ahead my friend!]
text: Eric pushes them infront of the Calibre vault door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Now save us a lot of time and just open
dialog: the vault.]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [No.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Okay.]
text: He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his
text: handgun into the sub level tellers mouth.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Open the vault.]
text: The teller's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [I cannot.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Oh.]
dialog: (to the teller)
dialog: [Can you?]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [No. Once closed only I can open it.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Then open it.]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [I cannot.]
text: The sub lobby teller's eyes plead with the bank manager.
text: Zed is watching the whole affair nervously.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Do you understand that I'll kill her if
dialog: you don't open this fucking vault?]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [Do you understand that this is an
dialog: international reserve bank? Robbing it
dialog: is punishable by life imprisonment.]
text: Eric fires. The back of the sub lobby teller's head paints
text: the wall red.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ!
text: The bank manager, shocked as he is, looks at Zed. He knows
dialog: he's an American.
text: The sub lobby teller's body slumps to the ground.
text: Eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his
dialog: temple.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Open the vault door or I'll kill this
dialog: man next.]
text: The bank manager is freaking out, but after what was probably
text: the most horribly agonizing internal debate, he holds his
text: ground.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [I still cannot open the vault.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Come on. It's only things in there.
dialog: This man is flesh and blood.]
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [I will not open the vault.]
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Eric no! I can open the vault!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
dialog: (then to the stodgy customer)
dialog: [You're a customer in this bank and this
dialog: is how they treat you. Do you have a
dialog: family?]
text: He nods his head "yes".
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Would you like to see them again?]
text: He nods his head again.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to the manager)
dialog: [This man has a family he would like to
dialog: have Bastille day dinner with tonight.
dialog: So save us some time and open the vault.]
dialog: After losing about a pound of sweat...
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: [No.]
text: Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and
text: fires two shots into the bank manager's face.
text: The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the
text: floor.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fucking idiot.
dialog: (then to the stodgy customer)
dialog: [You seem like a nice man. Tonight at
dialog: dinner think about how lucky you are and
dialog: how much you love your family.]
text: He starts nodding his head.
speaker_heading: STODGY CUSTOMER
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: [Take him upstairs.]
text: Oliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people.
text: Eric rips off his mask.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Don't you ever conflict with me during
dialog: work again! Do you hear!?
text: Zed off his clown mask.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: You didn't have to shoot any of them!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were
dialog: in charge now. Nobody told me.
dialog: (his temper flares)
dialog: If he had opened the vault it would have
dialog: saved us a fucking hour.
text: He charges into the reserve vault area.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
text: They enter and Eric walks up to a bathroom door.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Eric. It's just that we've gone from
dialog: being thieves to murderers.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh fuck it doesn't matter! Here you get
dialog: the death penalty just for robbing a
dialog: federal bank.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I thought the death penalty was abolished
dialog: in 1980?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Ohhhh! That's what they tell you! But
dialog: who cares? I need to take a piss.
text: Eric enters the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (on his way into the bathroom)
dialog: Why don't you open the vault?
text: Zed looks at the bathroom door close. After a fuming pause
text: he turns and walks back toward the Poseidon vault door.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Francois peeks through the venetian blinds of the windows to
text: the outside.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: [Looks clear.]
text: In the meantime, behind the teller windows guarding the
text: people who are laying on the floor, Jean and Ricardo are in
text: the middle of a conversation. Oliver is sitting on the
text: counter, having just brought the stodgy customer upstairs.
dialog: Also here now are the sub lobby assistant and the sub lobby
dialog: guard #2.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [What do you mean you're not sure if the
dialog: alarm went off or not?]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [I mean I'm not sure.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Well, either it did or it didn't.]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [And I'm not sure.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Well, do you think it did?]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [I just fucking told you, I don't know.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Take a guess.]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [It didn't.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [You're sure?]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [No. It's just a guess.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Well what kind of a fucking guess is
dialog: that? You're saying it could have.]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [Yes.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Well that's fucking great. Why didn't
dialog: you just kill that asshole to begin with.
dialog: I knew I should have been the one to kill
dialog: him. You're always so damn slow.]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [Shit these masks are really hot.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [I know, I've got fucking sweat stinging
dialog: my eyes.]
text: In the meantime Zoey is on the floor, unsure of what is going
dialog: on.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Zed opens up his steel briefcase. Inside of it are all sorts
dialog: of electronic gear and tools.
text: He takes out a tape measure and some callipers and measures
text: out a point on the vault door. He marks the point with a
text: piece of chalk.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: In one of the stalls Eric is preparing a syringe. He has
dialog: just cooked the heroin and is now tapping on it to get the
text: bubbles out.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Zed takes a power drill out from the briefcase and attaches a
text: special diamond tipped bit. He measures the depth he wants
text: to drill to and then marks the bit with a yellow pencil.
text: He places his ear to the vault and taps the spot.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Eric readies the needle and slaps his vein. He is shaking
text: but trying to remain as still as possible.
text: He places the needle at the end of a track on his arm and
text: inserts it.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Zed starts drilling into the point he marked with the chalk
text: on the vault door.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Eric's eyes roll back into his head as the heroin fills his

scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: EXTREME CLOSE ON: Zed's drill bit. It burrows into the

text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Zoey looks at all the people sitting around her. They're all
text: scared. Jean, Ricardo, and Francois are talking amongst
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (in French to Ricardo)
dialog: [Do you know one?]
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [Let's see. Okay. An unfortunate fellow
dialog: was locked up in prison doing five to ten
dialog: for armed robbery. All he could think of
dialog: the whole time was eating pussy.]
text: Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [The day finally came for his release.
dialog: He walked out of the prison with a new
dialog: suit and fifty francs the officials had
text: given him, and made a bee-line for the
dialog: whorehouse in the nearest town. Slamming
dialog: his fifty francs on the front desk, he
dialog: said, "I wanna eat some pussy."]
text: Jean is already laughing.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [I'm not done. Listen. "Where've you
dialog: been," said the greasy fellow behind the
dialog: desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close
dialog: look these days."]
text: Zoey glances at all of the people. Then her eyes lock with
text: the concierge security guard.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: ["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict,
text: pulling him out of his chair by the shirt
dialog: collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I
dialog: want it now!"]
text: The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: ["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor,
dialog: "I'll see what I can do." So the ex-con
dialog: followed him through to the very back of
text: the warehouse through some stained,
text: tattered red curtains, and into a grimy
dialog: little room where a bedraggled looking
text: whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed.
dialog: "She's yours for fifty francs," said the
dialog: proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]
text: Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an
text: ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it. His fingers
text: begin to unsnap the safety harness on it.
text: Her eyes widen.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: [After a little while, he came across a
dialog: piece of egg. "That's funny," he thought
dialog: to himself, "I don't think I had egg for
dialog: breakfast." But he spat it out and kept
text: eating away. Next he found a piece of
text: chipped beef wedged between his front
dialog: teeth. "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped
dialog: beef this week," he thought, but kept on.
dialog: Then he came across the corn. "What is
dialog: this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be
dialog: sick."]
text: The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety. Zoey knows
dialog: he's going to make his move.
speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: ["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what
dialog: the last guy said."]
text: Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips
text: out the .38 and fires three shots.
text: Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest. He falls to the
text: ground.
text: The other hits Francois in the arm.
text: In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group
text: of people huddled on the floor.
text: Everyone is screaming and trying to get away.
text: Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard
text: killing him dead.
text: Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three
dialog: of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer,
dialog: killing them all.
text: People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the
text: ceiling.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [No one fucking moves!]
text: Jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Shit! What happened!?]
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Zed looks up hearing the commotion.
text: Eric comes running out of the bathroom and into the
text: storage/elevator area.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What is it? What's going on?
text: Zed gets up to go upstairs.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No! You stay here.
text: Eric runs upstairs.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Francois is on the ground holding his arm. He keeps rolling
text: back and forth in pain.
dialog: Ricardo is dead.
text: Jean, Claude, and Oliver are waving their guns around ready
dialog: to kill someone any second.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Nobody fucking moves! Nobody fucking
dialog: moves!]
text: Claude motions to the dead security guard.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [The gun! Somebody get it!]
text: Oliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time
text: waving his gun at people.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: [Don't fuck with me! Don't fuck with
dialog: me!]
text: He grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip.
text: Eric storms in. He isn't wearing his mask.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [What the fuck is going on!?]
text: Zoey notices Eric, she remembers him.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (pointing at the dead man)
dialog: [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!]
text: Eric looks over at Ricardo and then at the carnage.
text: Then everybody notices he isn't wearing a mask.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: [Eric, your mask.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Then Oliver yanks his off.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Who gives a damn if they see us or not
dialog: anyway! I can't see a fucking think in
dialog: this!
text: Everyone takes their masks off.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Is this what happens? Is this what
dialog: happens when I walk away for five
dialog: minutes?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [He had a hidden gun.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (mimicking a little child)
dialog: [He had a hidden gun.]
dialog: (then back to normal)
dialog: [I don't care!]
text: Then, one of the bank customers, a MALE TOURIST, speaks up.
speaker_heading: MALE TOURIST
dialog: (holding up his passport)
dialog: This is insane! I am a U.S. citizen!
dialog: You must let me go!
text: Eric looks at him.
speaker_heading: MALE TOURIST
dialog: I'm an American! American! I'm just
dialog: here exchanging dollars. If it wasn't
dialog: for my country you'd all be speaking
dialog: German!
text: Eric is tired of this outburst, he shoots him.
text: Everyone screams.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to the people)
dialog: [I have had enough of this nonsense! The
dialog: next person that speaks will die!]
text: Everyone is quiet.
text: Francois is sitting on the floor bleeding from his arm.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Eric, I'm sorry. Things got out of
dialog: hand. But we're in control now.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Good. Let's try to keep it that way.
dialog: God what a mess.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Eric
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [What the fuck is it now!? You want me
dialog: to hold your hand as you take a piss?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [I have a question.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [What?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Do we know if the alarm went off or
dialog: not?]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Yes.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [We do?]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Yes. It didn't go off. If it had the
dialog: police would be here and our whole plan
dialog: would be fucked. But they're not here,
dialog: and our plan isn't fucked. So if there
dialog: aren't any more fucking stupid questions
dialog: I'll go downstairs and see if we're in
dialog: yet. Is that okay with you?]
text: Claude nods.
text: Then, the phone rings.
text: Everyone looks at it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [I thought the phones were dead.]
text: It rings again.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: The phones are dead.
text: Eric grabs a WOMAN TELLER who is crying hysterically and
text: lifts her to her feet.
text: He drags her to the ringing phone.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Answer it!]
text: She is crying too hard.
text: Eric puts his gun to her head.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Answer it or you will die.]
text: She slowly picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: WOMAN TELLER
dialog: (answering phone through tears)
dialog: Banque Internationale de Paris.
text: She pauses, then hands the phone to Eric.
speaker_heading: WOMAN TELLER
dialog: [It's for you.]
text: Eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor.
text: He puts the receiver to his ear.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: [Hello.]
dialog: (pause)
dialog: [Who is this?]
text: Eric motions to Oliver to check the windows.
text: Oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh my God! The police!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: [What do you want?]
text: Eric looks around at the dead bodies.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: [We're all fine in here.]
text: Oliver is pacing back and forth wildly. He starts loading
text: extra ammo into his weapon.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: [No. I'll tell you what, you go fuck
dialog: yourself you fucking pig. You send
dialog: anyone near this building and I'll kill
dialog: the first person I lay my hands on. I've
dialog: got plenty hostages here to kill so don't
dialog: even think of coming in.]
dialog: (pause)
dialog: [Just stay put. We'll call you when
dialog: we're ready. In the mean time, have a
dialog: nice day.]
text: Eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [The silent alarm must have gone off
dialog: after all!]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Shut the fuck up! The alarm didn't do
dialog: shit. For all we know your idiot
dialog: shooting brought them here. Anyhow it
dialog: doesn't matter. Nothing has changed.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [My God! The police! What are we going
dialog: to do?]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Nothing. We don't have to do anything.
text: The plan stays the same, just slightly
dialog: different.]
text: Then Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock. Eric
text: smiles and winks. Then he turns to Jean with a whisper.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [If the police decide to come in...kill
dialog: them. And if you don't mind, stack those
dialog: bodies somewhere else. This place is a
dialog: fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]
text: Then he takes off downstairs, smiling. Jean is a little
text: stumped.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
text: As Eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault
text: area a look of intense concentration washes over his face.
dialog: You can see that a trillion calculations are being made in
dialog: his brain...the question is: are there any answers?
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Zed is drilling now with a hand drill. He removes it and
text: blows into the hole. Shavings come out.
text: Eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (turning to Eric)
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Nothing. They were just scaring them.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes. They're assholes. Just having fun.
text: Zed looks into the hole.
text: He has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Fucked up my drill bit.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's okay. You can buy another one.
text: Zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the
text: two prongs into the hole.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Cross your fingers.
dialog: Eric does.
text: The volt meter's needle jumps.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Excellent. What next?
speaker_heading: ZED
text: We find the fuse box. It'll probably be
dialog: upstairs.
text: Zed gets up.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's okay. I'll find it for you.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No. I need to see it myself.
text: Zed jumps up and into the storage/elevator area with Eric
text: close behind him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I think it would be better if I looked
dialog: for you. I could--
scene_heading: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
text: Instead of walking upstairs, Zed finds the fuse box right in
text: the next room.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Hold on. Here she is.
text: Eric is a bit relieved.
text: Zed opens it up.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Let's see.
text: He looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and
dialog: then back on when I call to you. Any
dialog: other switch may set off the alarm.
text: Eric smirks.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (serious)
dialog: Got it?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Got it.
text: Zed goes back to the vaults.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Zed trots back to the Poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a
text: little gizmo from out of his briefcase. It is a little home-
text: made black box with a series of LED's on it and two wires
text: coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end.
text: Three other wires are also coming out of it.
text: He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them.
text: He then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself.
text: The two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt
dialog: battery.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Come on sweetie don't fail me now.
text: He looks toward the door leading to the reserve vault area.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (calling to Eric)
dialog: Ready?!
speaker_heading: ERIC(O.S.)
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Ready!
text: Zed turns on his little box, the LED's start flickering.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Now!
text: The lights go out and then back on.
text: There is a whirring sound from the vault door.
text: The LED's quickly go from red to green.
text: There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Open seasame.
text: Zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of
dialog: the Poseidon vault.
text: Eric comes running in like a kid on Christmas morning.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It worked!
text: He and Zed hug.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh my God it worked!
text: Zed looks into the Poseidon vault at the passage connecting
text: it to the main vault. It is covered by a small locked cage.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I can get through that lock in a minute.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Then do it. We don't have all day.
text: Zed enters the Poseidon vault.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY
text: Zed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a
text: window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get
text: him into the main vault.
text: Eric is right behind him.
text: Zed takes a twirl at the combination lock.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Dime store brand. Three minutes max.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Good.
text: Then, there's a gunshot. The bullet comes from the Calibre
text: vault through the window and almost hits Zed.
text: Zed falls backwards onto the floor.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Fuck!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Merde!
text: Then there's another gunshot.
text: The bullet ricochets through the vault.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Scrambling on their hands and knees Zed and Eric crawl out of
dialog: the Poseidon vault.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: They take cover.
text: Another shot is fired into the vault.
text: Zed and Eric look into the vault.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Another security guard?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Must be.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: I think I stained my pants.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Me too.
text: Oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: What is it?! I came down to see how
dialog: things were going and heard shots!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Some asshole in the vault.
text: Oliver takes cover and cocks his gun.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: We've got guns. Why don't we just storm
dialog: in and blast his fucking ass! It's three
dialog: against one! Let's give it the old--
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'm just trying to be helpful.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Just let me think.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You don't have to snap at me.
text: Eric peeks into the vault.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (calling into the vault)
dialog: [Hey you. Nice shooting. Play time's
dialog: over. Why don't you throw out your gun?]
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
dialog: (calling from main vault)
dialog: No!
text: Oliver and Eric look at each other and smile.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Come on. We don't want to kill you.]
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
dialog: [You'll have to!]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (quietly to Zed)
dialog: What is this guys problem?
dialog: (then to the guard)
dialog: [Come on! You're making me impatient. I
dialog: don't have all day.]
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
dialog: [Look, don't take it personally. This is
dialog: my job.]
text: Oliver and Eric look at each other and shrug. Then Eric sees
text: something in Zed's briefcase. It looks like grey clay.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Then take a paid vacation. We won't
dialog: tell if you won't.]
text: There is a pause. During this time Eric takes the clay and
text: pushes a detonator into it.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What the Hell are you doing? Have you
dialog: gone mad?
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
dialog: [Sorry. I can't.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Well, look, we're going to give you
dialog: fifteen minutes to change your mind.
dialog: Okay?]
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
dialog: [Okay.]
text: Zed starts to grab the plastique away from Eric. Eric
text: resists.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (holding his voice down)
dialog: That's too much. It's dangerous.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I like danger.
dialog: (then to the guard)
dialog: [Changed your mind yet?]
text: Eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator.
text: Zed and Oliver run for cover.
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
dialog: [No. And I'm not going to. Why don't
dialog: you just take the money from the other
dialog: vaults?--]
text: Eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and
text: makes a break for it.
text: There is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault. The
text: walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window,
text: blowing it open.
text: The vault guard #1 screams and then goes silent.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Francois, Claude, and Jean are forcing customers to drag dead
text: bodies into a cube. The room shakes and everyone looks
text: toward the hall that leads to the stairs.
text: The hostages, whose nerves are already shot, start crying.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: [Should we see if they're okay?]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [No. They're just blasting the vault
dialog: open.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [What does it matter now? We're fucking
dialog: surrounded by police.]
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
text: Dust has blown out of the vault and is settling on Oliver,
text: Zed, and Eric, who is laughing like a madman.
text: Zed is looking at him like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: You asshole! You could have killed us
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But I didn't! Let's go check out the
dialog: damage.
text: Eric gets up and walks into the Poseidon vault.
text: Before Zed follows him he looks at Oliver who doesn't know
dialog: what to think.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY
text: Eric laughs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Zed look!
text: He points to the caged window. It's been blown off it's
text: hinges.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I beat you! I opened it in under three
dialog: minutes.
text: He starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting
dialog: passage into the Caliber vault.
text: Zed, with his briefcase, follows.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: Go around and wait at the main vault
dialog: door. When I tell you, open it up.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Right. When you tell me, I'll open it
text: up.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Right.
text: Zed crawls through the opening.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'll be at the other vault waiting for
dialog: you to call to me.
scene_heading: INT. CALIBER VAULT - DAY
text: The main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it
text: were blown up from the inside. On the floor is the still
text: smoldering body of the security guard. The room is
dialog: incredibly smokey.
text: Zed squeezes through the opening.
text: Then, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke
text: with a brick sized bar of pure gold.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Look at it! We're all rich!
text: The smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault
text: there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked
text: onto it.
text: Eric starts laughing.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We're rich!
text: Zed looks at him like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We're rich!
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: We're not out of here yet.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes but we're rich!
text: Zed takes a seat at the vault door. The backside of a vault
text: door looks like an incredibly intricate clock. Zed removes
text: the Plexiglass shielding.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm going to show the others.
text: He squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold.
text: Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using
dialog: his voltmeter to test electrical points.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Claude is talking to Jean.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [What? You think we may actually get out
dialog: of this? You're fooling yourself.]
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Why are you such a pessimist?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Are you kidding me? Look at this mess.]
text: Jean surveys the mess, the crying people.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [This is nothing. Imagine the police
dialog: outside. We're dead men.]
text: Eric walks in from the rear stairs. In his hand is a brick
dialog: of gold.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Jean, Francois, Claude...look at this.]
dialog: They see the gold.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [You did it! You got in!]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Zed is opening the vault now. This is a
dialog: taste.]
text: Eric holds the bar of gold up for all the people to see.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Look at this and tell me I'm not
dialog: brilliant.]
speaker_heading: WOMAN CUSTOMER
dialog: (crying)
dialog: [You're a monster! And you'll never
dialog: leave this place alive!]
text: Eric shoots her with his Uzi.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to the hostages)
dialog: [None of you are worth half of this
dialog: single bar. Remember that.]
text: Francois, Jean, and Claude look at each other.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Eric...can I speak with you?]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Of course.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [In private.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [There's no need. I have nothing to
dialog: hide. What is it Claude?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Well...we're surrounded by the police
dialog: and we have no way out. What are we
dialog: going to do?]
text: Eric slaps him across the face.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [What are you doing Claude? Talking of
dialog: all this false doubt. What do you think
dialog: we're going to do?]
text: Claude is hurt, not physically but emotionally.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [I don't know...not the original plan.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up
dialog: and didn't kill the concierge fast
dialog: enough. And killing all these assholes--
dialog: ]
dialog: (motioning to all the
dialog: customers)
dialog: [--isn't going to do us a damn bit of
dialog: good now, is it?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [No. Because we'll need them as hostages
dialog: when we get on the plane.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [We're going on a plane?]
text: Eric pats his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Claude, you are a mental giant. Leave
dialog: the plans up to me and just kill people
dialog: if they get out of line, okay?]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Okay.]
text: Eric turns and starts to walk toward the downstairs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [I'm going to see how things are going.]
scene_heading: INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY
text: Eric is whistling while he walks, he pauses to perform a
text: quick magic trick, then he continues.
scene_heading: INT. RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
text: Eric walks into the reserve vault area.
text: He stops. He hears something. A scratching sound.
text: He looks at it's source, TWO POLICEMEN, decked out in black
text: flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a
dialog: sewer manhole.
text: Eric's eyes widen. He takes his silencer out of his coat and
text: fixes it to his handgun. Then, like a man with intent to
text: kill, he rapidly approaches them.
text: The one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see
text: Eric fire into his chest. Then, Eric aims the gun into the
text: tight crawlspace and fires into the other man. For safe
text: measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway.
text: He drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other
text: policeman into it. He then pushes a large utility wagon over
text: the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY
text: Eric comes running out from the reserve vault area and up the
text: stairs to the lobby.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Eric rushes into the lobby.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [They want to fuck with me!? They want
dialog: to fuck with me!?]
text: He puts the phone on the hook.
text: It instantly rings.
text: He answers the phone.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [You want to fuck with me!? I'll show
dialog: you what happens to people who fuck with
dialog: me!]
text: He throws the phone to the ground and looks at Zoey.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [The moment of truth my love. You knew
dialog: it would come.]
text: He grabs Zoey and lifts her to her feet.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (screeching)
dialog: No!
text: Then, the assistant manager stops him.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: [No! What ever it is you're going to do
dialog: have mercy!]
text: Eric suddenly calms down.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Have mercy?]
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: [Yes.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [With her.]
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: [Yes.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [That's sweet.]
dialog: (to Zoey)
dialog: [You have quite a reach my lovely. Is he
dialog: one of your clients?]
text: He pushes Zoey to the ground.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [It's a deal.]
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: [Thank you.]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Don't mention it.]
text: He grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to
text: the main entrance.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [Eric! What are you doing?]

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: [Hello.]

dialog: (pause)
dialog: [No. None of that. We won't trade.

dialog: (pause)

scene_heading: INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY
text: Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door. He

dialog: calculator.
text: Then, there is a groaning sound.
text: Zed, terrified, spins around.
text: Another groaning sound. The vault security guard isn't dead.
text: His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1
dialog: [I'm going to die...]

speaker_heading: VAULT GUARD #1
dialog: [I'm going to die...please hold
dialog: my...hand. I don't...want to
dialog: die...alone.]
text: Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it. He gives it a
text: nudge with his foot.
text: The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever.
text: Zed kneels down next to the body.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Are you still there?
dialog: Nothing.
text: Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and
text: checks for a pulse.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like
dialog: he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he
text: scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches.
text: He has wired a battery to two leads. He takes out a wire
text: cutter and snips a wire.
text: There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as
text: the vault unlocks.
text: Zed calls to Oliver from the passage.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
text: Oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub

speaker_heading: ZED(O.S.)
dialog: (distant, calling from the

dialog: Oliver, now! Open the vault!
text: Oliver turns the large wheel and opens the Caliber vault

text: With some amount of energy the door opens. Standing inside
dialog: is Zed.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Open seasame.
text: He steps out of the vault.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Do you want to give me a hand?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Sure.
text: Oliver puts his gun down and they go into the Calibre vault.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY
text: Oliver sees the huge platen of gold bricks. Zed puts his

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Holy mother.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Here, help me with this.

scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Eric slams the phone down and then in a fit of rage tears the

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Merde!
text: He grabs his machine gun and aims it at the sub lobby guard

text: The sub lobby guard #2 braces himself for gunfire.

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [That's what you get!]
text: Claude puts his hand on Eric's shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Eric.
text: Eric looks at him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [The fucking police won't budge. I kill
dialog: a man and they don't care. They say they
dialog: don't make deals with terrorists. It
dialog: really fucks up my plan.]
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [And what if we gave up?]
text: Eric can't believe this.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: [Claude, look around you. We're not
dialog: talking prison here. You know. The cops
dialog: will give in. You start killing
dialog: women...they give in. They're all so
dialog: fucking much in love with women!]
text: Then he looks at Zoey.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [What are you looking at you fucking
dialog: whore?]
text: She doesn't want to say a thing that'll upset him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Are you afraid I'll tell these people

text: She shakes her head "no".
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [What? So they know that you're a--]
text: The sub lobby assistant speaks up.
speaker_heading: SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT
dialog: [Leave her alone.]
text: Eric cracks the butt of his gun into the man's face.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Shut up!]

speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Just help me steer this out.
text: They maneuver out of the Calibre vault.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
text: They come out of the Calibre vault with the huge platen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Do you think we should get some cash
dialog: also?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, you never know.
text: They start maneuvering the platen toward an elevator.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Money is too easily traceable. You'd
dialog: never be able to spend it. And forget
dialog: about exchanging it.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: That's true.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No sir. Your best bet is to get these
dialog: bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Eric knows someone in Portugal.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Or Portugal.
text: They get into the banks private freight elevator.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Zed closes the door and pushes the button to go up to the
text: ground floor.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Eric is dragging Zoey by the hair toward the door when she
text: grabs his groin and starts squeezing.
text: Eric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the Uzi
text: into her face.
text: But she won't let go. Her years as a prostitute have taught
dialog: her to ignore pain.
text: She grabs hold of the gun hand.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (groaning)
dialog: [You fucking bitch!]
text: A few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's
text: foot red.
text: Eric lets go and falls to the ground.
text: Claude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to
dialog: what's going on.
text: Zoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it. She showers
text: the room with bullets. She starts to run toward the back
text: office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude,
text: Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages.
text: Then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and
text: start clouding the place up.
text: Eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red
text: foot.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Bitch!]
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Zed is waiting for the elevator to arrive.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Do we have a covering of some kind?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: You know. Something to cover this with.
dialog: It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving
text: the bank with a platten of gold.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh, it won't matter. The police know
dialog: what we're up too.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Police?! What do you mean they know what
dialog: we're up too?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You don't know? We've been discovered.
dialog: But Eric has them under control.
text: Zed is frantic.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No I didn't know! How many police?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: The building is surrounded.
text: The elevator doors open onto the ground floor to the sound of
text: automatic gunfire. Zed walks out into the back office.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - BACK OFFICE - DAY
text: Suddenly, from the back office, Zed sees Zoey blasting away
text: an Uzi and running toward the rear stairwell. Eric is in the
text: lobby limping around. The other gang members are ducking
text: from her fire.
text: Then, her clip runs out.
text: She sees Zed, their eyes lock. An IMAGE overcomes Zed. She
text: runs down the stairs to the back.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Kill her! Kill her!
text: Oliver aims his gun to fire and Zed pushes it up. Oliver's
text: gun discharges into the ceiling. Oliver and Zed begin to
text: struggle.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Zed and Oliver collapse out of the back office and into the
text: lobby. They tumble onto the floor. Eric hobbles over to
text: them, his gun aimed at Zed.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What the fuck are you doing!?
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
text: Zoe is near tears. She drops the empty machine gun to the
text: floor and starts walking toward the sub lobby.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Eric leans down to talk to Zed. Oliver and Jean are
text: watching. Francois and Claude are more worried about the
dialog: tear gas.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: [They're trying to smoke us out Eric!]
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: [What do we do!?]
text: Eric waves them off with a brush of his hand. He's
text: concentrating on Zed.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Do you really love your bitch whore
dialog: girlfriend that much? She's really
dialog: fucked with your mind.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Eric...what are you talking about?
text: Eric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the
text: knife. He turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his
text: ear.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: Look at it. It's all for us. The smoke.
text: The attention. They have no idea of who
dialog: they're dealing with. They have no idea
dialog: what kind of men we are.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (thinking Eric is a madman)
dialog: What kind of men are we?
text: Eric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You can no longer be in our club. You
dialog: forfeit your cut of the pie.
text: Zed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What about our friendship?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Shit Zed. I haven't seen you in years.
dialog: You hardly know me.
text: He slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade. Zed
text: falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Never let a girl come between two men.
text: He walks down the hall toward the gold.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Now let's try to get out of here.
text: Eric walks into the back office. The others look at each
dialog: other.
text: Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the
text: shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires.
text: In the background the distinctive sound of European police
text: sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank.
text: Also, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a
dialog: bullhorn.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: [The police! They're entering the
dialog: building!]
text: Suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the
text: smoke.
text: Francois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator
text: via the back office.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Eric caresses his hand across the bars of gold.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: [Smoother and more giving than the most
dialog: selfless human being. You're beautiful.]
text: Francois runs in.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: [Eric!]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Jesus, what now?]
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: [The police are coming in! We're
dialog: doomed!]
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Get a hostage.]
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: [They don't give a fuck about the
dialog: hostages!]
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke
text: and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud.
text: Then he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his
text: head.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: [Don't make me!]
text: A single bullet passes through his torso. As Jean falls to
text: the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling.
text: Oliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man.
text: From behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold
text: of Claude and wrestles him to the ground.
text: The other customers start to flee for cover.
text: Oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and
text: Claude. It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the
text: upper hand. Oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine
text: gun fire at them...killing them both.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY
text: Zoe walks up the stairs out, not only are they locked but a
text: cloud of tear gas is pouring into the downstairs sub lobby.
text: Suddenly, Zed stumbles in.
text: Zed is like a zombie. Then he notices Zoe in the stairwell.
text: They lock eyes.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (almost delerious)
dialog: Zoe...
text: She steps down into the sub lobby, machine guns crackle in
text: the background. She runs up to him just as he slumps to the
text: ground.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (holding him)
dialog: My Zed. They've hurt you.
text: She dabs a cloth to his cut face. He holds it on.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (trying to comfort him)
dialog: You're going to be okay. In many
text: countries scars on the face are a symbol
dialog: of heroism. To proudly display a flaw
dialog: like a badge...is to wear a badge of
dialog: truth.
text: He takes her hand.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Be serious Zoe...I can stick my tongue
dialog: through my cheek.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: The police are now laying it on heavy. Francois comes out of
text: the office.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Oliver! Let's get a hostage!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: This is the end!
text: Francois is ripped into by machine gun fire.
text: Oliver races past him.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY
text: Tear gas is starting to fill the room.
text: Zoe stands Zed up.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Listen to me. We're going to lock
text: ourselves into one of the air tight
dialog: vaults...if any of them are still open.
text: They start walking toward the reserve vault area.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Eric hops into the elevator and closes the door, just as
text: Oliver runs up, firing toward the police.
text: Eric is laughing manically as he leaves them behind.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Bastard!
text: Oliver turns to where the police will surely be coming in.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
text: Zoey and Zed rush into the reserve vault area. Zoey notices
dialog: that the downstairs reserve vault is closed.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Merde! The vault has been closed.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: What about the others?
text: The gunfire upstairs has subsided and has been replaced by
text: unintelligible POLICE VOICES.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Listen...there's no gunfire.
text: Zoey quietly opens the door opposite the vault that leads to
text: the rear stairs to the lobby level.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY
text: Zoey peeks up the stairs just in time to see Oliver bolt for
text: the stairs.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (to police)
dialog: Motherfuckers!
text: A volly of gunfire rips into Oliver but he stands his ground
text: and fires into the police.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You wanna fuck with me? You wanna fuck
dialog: with me? I'll show you who you're
dialog: fucking with!
text: He starts blasting away.
text: Terrified, Zoey leads Zed to the storage/elevator area.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: C'mon, we'll be safer in here.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
text: The elevator door opens, Eric steps out and looks around like
text: a caged animal.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Think!]
text: Then, Zed and Zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault
dialog: area.
text: Eric turns to them with his gun raised, when he sees them he
dialog: lowers it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Zed.
text: They all stand there for a moment, the gunfire cracking away
text: upstairs. Eric is more casual than he should be.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (matter-of-factly)
dialog: What's your girlfriends name?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Zoe.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Zoe.
dialog: (to Zoey in French)
dialog: [Zoe, come here to me.]
text: Zoey spits at him.
text: Eric laughs and aims the gun at her.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: [Killing you would just be gravy, so
dialog: don't fuck with me.]
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: [Go ahead you slob. Shave my ass!]
text: Eric smashes the side of her face with the gun and then grabs
text: a hold of her arm.
text: Zed tries to stop Eric but Eric aims the gun at him.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Zed no. I'll kill you. It means nothing
dialog: to me, our friendship.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: (starting out calm and then
dialog: building to a scream)
dialog: Eric...there's no fucking way out of
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh but you're wrong. This is my way out.
dialog: This dime store couge with her motor
dialog: driven ass. You find your own.
text: Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching. Eric drops the
text: gun but quickly whips out his knife.
text: She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her
text: shirt.
text: Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back.
text: Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back.
text: Zoey falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a
dialog: sausage.
text: Zed is standing between Zoey and Eric.
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: Zoey, get out of here!
text: She scrambles away.
text: He swipes at Zed.
text: Zed jumps back down the hall toward the reserve vault area.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA- DAY
text: They rush out toward the stairs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Did you see how she ran? Did you see how
dialog: she ran? She doesn't care about you.
dialog: Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.
dialog: Look out for number one. What do you say
dialog: Zed?
text: He swipes again.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I will kill you. And once I kill you
dialog: Zed, I'll get out of here. I'll fuck
dialog: your bitch up the ass and give her
dialog: AIDS...if she doesn't already have it.
dialog: What do you say to that Zed?
text: He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade.
text: Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor.
text: Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face.
text: Eric reaches for the knife.
text: Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric.
text: Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair.
text: She plunges her nails into his face.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fucking bitch!
text: Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath.
text: Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes.
text: Zed lets out a shrill scream.
text: Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face.
text: The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like
dialog: worms, unable to move because each is putting the other
dialog: through such agony.
text: Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the
text: room. His body is a mass of bullet wounds.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Ox! Where is thy yoke!?
text: He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near
dialog: Zoey, Zed, and Eric.
text: The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman
text: could posses. He rolls over and throws Zoey off him.
text: Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it.
text: Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun.
text: He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck both of you.
text: Then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs.
text: Eric turns back to them.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Au revoir.
text: He aims to kill Zed.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: No!
text: Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their
text: assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs.
text: At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their
dialog: guns.
speaker_heading: FRENCH POLICEMAN #1
dialog: [Stop!]
text: Eric stops.
text: It becomes quiet.
text: Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun
dialog: kick.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I give you little kiss. Ciao.
text: He squeezes the trigger and...
speaker_heading: CLICK
text: The police open fire with their French made assault machine
text: guns and fill Eric with bullets. Instead of falling he does
text: a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red.
text: The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed.
text: An IMAGE overcomes Eric.
text: Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of
dialog: Zed.
text: Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey.
text: Zoey runs up to him and holds him.
text: The police all charge into the secondary vault area and
dialog: secure the downstairs.
text: Zoey is crying as she holds Zed.
text: The police have their guns aimed at the two of them.
text: Zoey looks up.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: (to the policemen)
dialog: [I work here. This man is a

text: They take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if
dialog: he's okay.
speaker_heading: FRENCH POLICEMAN #2
dialog: [How bad do you think his wounds are?]
text: The other policeman, unable to tell because of Eric's blood,
text: simply shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRENCH POLICEMAN #1
dialog: (to Zoey)
dialog: [Are you alright?]
text: Zoey starts to cry.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
text: Zoey and Zed, bandaged up, are being aided by all of the

speaker_heading: FRENCH POLICEMAN #1

dialog: [This one's the ringmaster. We need an

text: No longer interested in Zoey or Zed, he goes to check out the

speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: The hospital?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ZOEY
dialog: Come on. I have a car.

dialog: Do you feel pain?
speaker_heading: ZED
dialog: No...it was mostly his blood.
speaker_heading: ZOEY

speaker_heading: ZED

speaker_heading: ZOEY
