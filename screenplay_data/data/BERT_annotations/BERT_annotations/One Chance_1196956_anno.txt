scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
text: Where a CHURCH CHOIR comprised of ordinary Welsh faces,
text: begins a medley of “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen”... The
text: chirpy rendition continues over the following scenes...
scene_heading: INT. PRINCESS OF WALES HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
text: The doors fly open as a team of EMS WORKERS wheels in a
text: YOUNG PAUL POTTS (9) lying on a gurney. His parents ROLAND
text: and YVONNE POTTS follow.

speaker_heading: DR. THORPE
dialog: Right. Room three, please.
text: He follows the gurney into a triage room, while the nurse
text: waylays Roland and Yvonne with her clipboard.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You’re his parents?
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I’‘1l just need to get some basic
dialog: information from you.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: (to his anxious wife)
dialog: He'll be alright.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (filling in a form)
dialog: Right, so it’s Paul...last name please?
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Potts. P, O, double-T, S.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Paul Potts. Like the Cambodian dictator
dialog: who massacred all the--?
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: (for the millionth time...)
dialog: Not at all like the Cambodian dictator.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Shots of the choir... Four rows deep... First and third
text: rows leading the song; rows two and four following several
text: bars behind... All eyes on the peripatetic CHOIRMASTER...
text: Several rows behind the fourth row, Paul stands alone,
text: singing with gale-force might...
speaker_heading: YOUNG PAUL
dialog: O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and
dialog: joy. O tidings of comfort and joy.
text: Several members of the fourth row wince at the decibel
dialog: level as--
scene_heading: INT. TRAIGE ROOM THREE - DAY
text: The gurney is locked into position as the medical team
text: takes over. Yvonne wrings her hands in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DR. THORPE
dialog: How long since it occurred?
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: About an bour. They said he just
text: collapsed after his solo.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Miracle he hasn’t ruptured our eardrums
text: from all his hooting and hollering.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: (elbowing her husband)
dialog: He’s a passionate singer.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Where Paul sways as he solos with eyes fervently shut,
text: hands clenched, voice like a wind throughout the
dialog: cathedral...
speaker_heading: YOUNG PAUL
dialog: Fear not then said the angel, let nothing
dialog: you affright. This day is born a Savoir
dialog: of a pure Virgin bright. To free all
dialog: those who trust in Him--
speaker_heading: CHOIR
dialog: --from Satan's power and might. O tidings
dialog: of comfort and joy.
text: A distinct THUMP is heard... The members of the fourth row
text: look over their shoulders to find Paul is vanished from
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: CHOIR (CONT'D)
dialog: Comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and
dialog: Jjoy-
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY HALLWAY - DAY
text: As Paul is wheeled into surgery. Young Dr. Thorpe, now in
text: gown and gloves, meets his parents at the door...
speaker_heading: DR. THORPE
dialog: --got some fluid build-up in the middle
dialog: ear. Not to worry, we'll have him right
dialog: as rain in no time.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: So you've done this sort of thing before?
speaker_heading: DR. THORPE
dialog: Of course. Well, not with anyone still
dialog: breathing...
dialog: (realizes the faux pas)
dialog: I’m still new, but rest assured, live or
dialog: dead, the bits are all the same once you
text: start digging around inside.
dialog: (now they’re freaked)
text: Cafe’s just down the hall.
text: He heads into surgery... As the doors swing shut--
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: (arm around his wife)
dialog: He'll be just fine.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POTTS HOUSE - DAY (SEVERAL DAYS LATER)
text: A two-story row house adjoined on either side and
text: identical to the sixty other homes on the block.
text: The door slams behind Paul, who stands on the landing,
text: carrying his school bag.
text: He pats the large bandage mummifying his repaired ear,
text: then looks both ways before descending the steps to the
dialog: sidewalk.
text: He checks his surroundings again before venturing out the
text: gate and turning down the road.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: There he is! Get ‘im!
text: Paul runs as a flock of screaming YOUNG BOYS crosses the
text: road, hot on his heels... Their screams blend into the
text: continuing choral medley as we return to...
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
text: Where the same Welsh choir-faces, several years older now,
text: continue the song with undiminished fervor over--
scene_heading: EXT. PORT TALBOT, WALES - DAY
text: Establishing shots of this gray, industrial steel-town
text: huddled on the edge of the Celtic Sea.
text: From above the city, we see Paul, a lone figure running
text: down the center of a road...a moment later the group of
text: boys appears in close pursuit until they catch him and
dialog: start punching...
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
text: Reveal that the rows behind the choir are empty... And
text: yet, Paul’s voice rises above the rest, though it sounds
text: impossibly far away...
scene_heading: EXT. PORT TALBOT STREET - DAY
text: Paul tears around a corner, the lead pursuers close behind
text: him... He’s slightly older now, closer to thirteen or
dialog: fourteen with a few extra pounds...
text: He cuts across a busy intersection, narrowly avoiding a
text: lorry which momentarily cuts off his pursuers...
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY
text: Paul weaves through pedestrians. He’s aged again, nearing
text: eighteen, and puffing even harder with the extra weight.
text: The boys chasing him appear older, larger, and there are
text: more of them than before and they’re gaining on him.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: Paul turns down the empty alley, losing his schoolbag to
text: the clutching hand of the closest pursuer...
text: Near the alley’s end, Paul veers wide to the left in
text: anticipation, then cuts right, barely fitting his belly
text: through a narrow pedestrian opening...
text: The lead boys miss the turn, smacking into the alley wall
dialog: and crumple...
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
text: Paul’s hidden voice is somewhat louder now as the CAMERA
text: looks down on the choir from above...
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN STREET - DAY
text: Paul looks back to see his lead has widened. He smiles
text: then turns forward an instant too late to avoid the newly
text: constructed scaffolding on the sidewalk...
text: He opens his mouth to scream...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN STREET - DAY
text: Where Paul lies on the ground, mouth bleeding, bullies
text: standing over him, laughing. MATTHEW, the toughest of the
text: lot, leans forward and allows a stream of spit to dribble
text: onto Paul’s cheek where it mixes with the blood from his
text: ruined mouth.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCESS OF WALES HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
text: As Paul is brought in on another gurney where he’s met by,
text: a slightly aged Dr. Thorpe.
speaker_heading: DR. THORPE
dialog: What’ve we got?
speaker_heading: CHOIR
dialog: Among your friends and kindred that live
text: both far and near.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
text: CAMERA PULLS OUT of the shattered mouth of PAUL, now in
text: his twenties, singing, with reckless fervor through the
text: shards of two badly broken front teeth...
text: CAMERA CONTINUES pulling back to reveal he is alone, in
text: the upper choir loft, a good twenty feet above the rest of
dialog: the choir.
speaker_heading: CHOIR (V.O.)
dialog: That god send you a happy new year, happy
dialog: new year. That god send you a happy new
dialog: year.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
text: The Choirmaster’s fists clench shut, silencing the choir.
speaker_heading: CHOIRMASTER
dialog: That’s very nice indeed.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. CAR PHONE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Walls lined with various phones and phone accessories.
text: BRADDON (34), painfully thin with spiky hair, bad skin and
text: elvish ear-extensions, hits on a FEMALE CUSTOMER.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Now this one comes with customizable
text: ringtones and dual vibrating mode, which
dialog: can come in quite handy in certain
dialog: situations.
text: The bell jingles as Paul walks in quietly.
speaker_heading: FEMALE CUSTOMER
dialog: And what situations would that be?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: (leaning closer)
dialog: What’ve you got in mind?
speaker_heading: FEMALE CUSTOMER
dialog: I'd like a word with your manager.
text: He shows her his employee badge, that reads “MANAGER” just
text: below his name, “BRADDON MELLINS”.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: What seems to be the problem, Miss?
speaker_heading: FEMALE CUSTOMER
dialog: They should lock you up.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Bondage? Naughty, cheeky, but presto, you
dialog: talked me into it.
text: She storms out...
speaker_heading: BRADDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Come see us again soon.
text: ---passing Paul who offers a tentative, closed-mouth smile
dialog: to Braddon.
dialog: Hands him
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Better luck next time.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: It’s quantum algebra, mate; if I offer my
dialog: personal services to twenty women, one
dialog: point three of them are certain to shag
dialog: me blind.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How many have said yes so far?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: (calculating)
dialog: S’about... I’m still tinkering with the
dialog: approach, but erection is the mother of
dialog: invention, yes? Right, what can we do ya
dialog: for? Something compact, ‘round five-
dialog: hundred minutes a month with unlimited
dialog: text and a free shaving kit?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Actually, I was wondering if the
text: position’s still open.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: The position?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The job.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: You want to work here, what in god’s name
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Because I love mobile phones?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Lying will get you everywhere.
text: an application, then snatches it back...
speaker_heading: BRADDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you got a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes? Well, sort of-- Not really.
text: Braddon snatches the application back again...
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Boyfriend then?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh no, she’s definitely a girl, I’m sure
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Okay, as long as you’re sure.
text: Paul takes the application and gets to work.
scene_heading: EXT. PORT TALBOT STREET - NIGHT
text: Paul walks home from the interview, passes a pub, The
text: Forge Tavern, from which numerous UNION MEN have spilled
text: out onto the sidewalk.
text: Paul lowers his head and gives the men a wide berth, until
text: one DRUNK man stumbles into him and “accidentally” drops
dialog: his beer.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRUNK
dialog: Watch where you’re going, Martha.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry.
text: He tries not to break stride, but the man grabs his arm
text: threateningly...
speaker_heading: FIRST DRUNK
dialog: Sorry ain’t gonna pay for a new pint, is
dialog: it?
text: Suddenly, the drunk is jerked backwards and ends up on his
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: (standing over him)
dialog: I’‘1l thank you to leave him alone now,
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRUNK
dialog: ‘Not my fault he can’t walk straight.
speaker_heading: SECOND DRUNK
dialog: Probably ‘cause his teeth are all
dialog: crooked.
speaker_heading: THIRD DRUNK
dialog: Or it’s that enormous ass of his.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: One more word.
speaker_heading: SECOND DRUNK
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: And your next shift will be in the queue
text: at the unemployment office.
text: Finally, they all back down to his seniority. Roland helps
dialog: the First Drunk to his feet--
speaker_heading: ROLAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Now come on Bill and apologize to--
text: But Paul is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. QUIET STREET - NIGHT
text: Paul walks down the center of the road. Roland jogs after
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: All right?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m fine, dad.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Pete’s a good lad, he’s just in his cups
dialog: is all.
text: Paul doesn’t respond. They walk for a moment.
speaker_heading: ROLAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe if you joined a fitness club.
text: Lifted some weights.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: I’m just saying... Maybe losin’ a few
dialog: stone you wouldn’t provoke them as much.
text: Paul looks away; not the first time he’s heard this brand
text: of logic from his father.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I got a job.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: What, that bloody musical down the
dialog: community centre?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Mobile phone shop in Bridgend.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Oh... Well done... So, you’ll be getting
dialog: your own place then?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Actually, um, I’ve been saving up for
dialog: opera lessons...in Italy.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: You’re twenty-nine years old, Paul.
dialog: Singing lessons can wait.
text: They turn up the path to their home. Paul hesitates a
text: moment letting Roland go up the steps ahead of him.
text: Furious, he opens his mouth to speak, but loses his
dialog: nerve...
text: Music is heard - Pavarotti singing “Che Gelida Manina”
dialog: from La Boeme.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN LP COVER; PAVAROTTI IN FULL CLOWN (CANIO FROM
speaker_heading: PAGLIACCT )
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: TRACK ACROSS walls plastered with posters and downloaded
text: print-outs of images from the opera world: The Three
dialog: Tenors; Caruso; a program from La Traviata in Rome; and
text: finally a virtual shrine to Pavarotti, his great hero...
scene_heading: ENDING ON:
text: A PAIR OF KNITTING NEEDLES
text: Pointed skyward, quivering slightly in anticipation...
text: Then slicing and waving through the air as Paul angrily
text: “conducts” the music as the refrain kicks in.
text: Gradually, Paul is enveloped and the thrashing needles
text: slow and subside and finally slip to the ground as,
text: panting, he stops the record, revealing a muffled BANGING
text: coming from downstairs.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: As Paul makes his way down the stairs and into the kitchen
text: where Roland is already at the table.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Always with the bloody violins. Won't
text: shed a tear when they’ve packed and gone.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: (serving dinner)
dialog: What do you mean gone? Paul, are you
dialog: going somewhere.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Venice.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Oh no, this singing rubbish has gone on
dialog: long enough. He’s got a job, he can get
dialog: his own flat.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Pish-posh.
dialog: (to Paul)
dialog: Stay forever darling. Here you are.
text: As she places an enormous plate in front of Paul.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Christ, Yvonne, He can hardly fit through
text: the door as it is.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (to Roland)
dialog: Look, I get it. I’m never going to be a
dialog: professional singer. I just... It’s the
dialog: only thing that makes me-- Let me go to
dialog: Venice and I'll move out when I get back.
text: Yvonne looks at Roland, eyes pleading Paul’s case.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STIARWELL - DAY
text: As Paul, gasping and sweating and carrying two moving
text: boxes, climbs several flights up the increasingly narrow
text: staircase until he reaches the top floor and the door to--
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. A TINY STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY
text: Where he drops the boxes alongside several others. The
text: room is partially unpacked with his pictures of Pavarotti
dialog: and Toscanini already hung with prominence, and his
text: computer has been set up atop a “desk” made from several
dialog: other boxes.
text: A CHIMING/BOUNCING MESSAGE is seen on the screen... Paul
text: clicks on the message revealing a kitty-kat avatar, which
text: expands into a Chat Invitation from “julzRulz”.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (typed)
dialog: How did it go?
dialog: Paul TYPES his response...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How did what go?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Job? Italy? Job? Italy?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Job, yes. Smallest apartment in Britain,
dialog: yes. Italy, no. How are you?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I’m so sorry, Paul. I guess you'll have
dialog: to settle for visiting me in Bristol.
dialog: Hint. Hint. ;) :)
text: A beat as Paul flushes... He types...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'd love to, but the job starts tomorrow
dialog: and until I get the cast off my leg, it’s
dialog: too difficult for me to get around.
text: Paul grimaces at the lie.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (after a beat...)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: If I ask you something, promise not to
dialog: get offended?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Anything?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You are a girl--
dialog: (deletes the word girl,
dialog: replaces it with...)
dialog: --a woman, right?
text: He sighs with relief at her response and continues
dialog: “chatting.”
speaker_heading: BRADDON (0.S.)
text: I could feel the firming of her breasts
dialog: as she pressed them into me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR PHONE WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: Where Braddon is in mid-soliloquy as he and Paul stock
text: shelves with bluetooth ear-pieces...
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: “Be gentle,” said she. “Unicorns are not
dialog: meant for human love.” “But lady,” said
dialog: I, “I am only half human.” And I laid her
text: down and took her there, amidst the moss
text: and leaves of the forest floor.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And that was your weekend?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: In a nutshell. Yours?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry, but... Did you say you shagged a
dialog: horse?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: It’s a game, role-playing, like Dungeons
dialog: & Dragons but for real.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: So she was a girl, pretending to be a
dialog: horse.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: A unicorn!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right... Sorry. And you were--?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
text: A half-elf wizard from the Black Mages
dialog: Guild of Quilanthum.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: When’s the last time you had a bit of
dialog: fluff?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Em, well...
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She is a girl, by the way. My girlfriend.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: When shall we double-date then?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Um, she doesn’t really live here.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Where’s she live, then?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bristol.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Bristol? That’s miles from-- You have
dialog: actually met her, haven’t you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, we chat all the time...
text: Shows Braddon his phone-chat which shows a lengthy text-
text: thread between he and julzRulz.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: She keeps inviting me up for a visit,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, she looks like Cameron Diaz and...
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: And?
text: Suddenly Paul sees something over Braddon’s shoulder and
text: darts through the curtains into the back of the store.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BRADDON (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s crawled up his--
text: He turns to the storefront where Matthew enters
text: belligerently, wearing a blue janitor’s uniform and
text: carrying a smashed cell phone...
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: The service on this phone is total crap!
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: It can’t be bad as all that. I can see
dialog: quarter crap, or maybe even half--
text: As Matthew dumps the smashed cell phone on the counter.
speaker_heading: BRADDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Right, the thing is, in order for the
dialog: service to actually work, the phone
dialog: itself should really be in no more than
dialog: three or four pieces.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (threatening)
dialog: It’s under warranty.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Of course, but--
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: How ‘bout you gimme a phone that works
dialog: properly and I won’t cram this one down
dialog: your throat. Yeh?
text: Braddon glances at the cel phone Paul left on the counter,
text: then at the curtains at the back of the store.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Excellent.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAR PHONE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Paul and Braddon lock up for the night.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Oh, nearly forgot.
text: Flips Paul his phone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, right. Thanks.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: I took the liberty, while you were
text: cowering in the back...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I wasn’t cowering, I was-- Took the
dialog: liberty to do what?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: This Saturday, Swansea Railway Station.
text: She’s on the nine fifteen train.
text: Walks off leaving Paul dumbfounded...
scene_heading: EXT. SHOPPING ARCADE - NIGHT
text: As Paul catches up with Braddon.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: It's a bit difficult losing your
text: virginity someone a hundred miles away.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You invited her here?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: You did. As far as she knows. And what’s
dialog: this rubbish about a broken leg?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I told her that so-- She said she looks
dialog: like Cameron Diaz!
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: How awful.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It is!
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: In what universe could that be--
dialog: (realizing...)
dialog: You told her you look like someone famous
dialog: as well?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: A bit, yeah.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Robbie Coltraine? Jack Black? Madonna?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Worse.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Worse than Madonna?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A PHOTO OF BRAD PITT - TORN FROM A MAGAZINE
scene_heading: INT. TINY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Taped to a mirror-frame in which Paul is seen not coming
text: within a million miles of emulating Pitt’s hair-style.
text: Finally, he gives up and tears the photo from the mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. SWANSEA RAILWAY STATION - DAY
text: Where Paul waits nervously as the train arrives. He
text: practices several nonchalant leans against a pole before
text: giving up entirely.
text: PASSENGERS flood from the train as the doors open. Paul
text: searches through them, looking for a Cameron Diaz clone.
text: The train pulls away and the crowd thins until Paul is
text: alone on the platform. His heart sinks a little - she
dialog: stood him up.
speaker_heading: JULZ (0.S.)
dialog: Brad?
text: He turns around and has to hide his smile...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Cameron?
scene_heading: JULIE-ANNE “JULZ” COOPER, cute but short and thoroughly
text: relieved that she’s not the only one who exaggerated her
text: appearance, smiles back at him.
text: They smile at each other for a moment...
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Um, welcome to Port Talbot.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (laughing at him, but ina
dialog: good way)
dialog: Thank you.
text: They turn and walk towards the far end of the platform,
text: each taking turns stealing glances at one another.
dialog: 18.
text: At one point, their hands touch and Paul’s fingers close
text: around hers... The continue walking, neither speaking.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PORT TALBOT HIGH STREET - DAY
text: Still holding hands, Paul and Julz walk amidst shoppers.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You’re leg’s much better.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (touching his left leg)
dialog: Yeah, thanks. Ship-shape.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I thought it was your right leg?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, right. Um...
speaker_heading: YVONNE (0.S.)
dialog: Paul, is that you darling?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh god.
text: Yvonne appears through the crowd, carrying bags of food
text: from Sainsbury’s and an incredulous look on her face.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Well, bless my soul. Hallo, I’m Paul’s
dialog: mum.
text: Paul dies a little inside as Julz has to wrest her hand
text: from his to shake Yvonne’s hand.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Lovely to meet you. I’m Julz.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Paul, you didn’t tell me you were... Oh
dialog: you must come for dinner. My husband
dialog: would love to--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thanks, mum, but Julz has to be back to
dialog: the station by--
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (seeing Yvonne's
dialog: disappointment )
dialog: It's alright. I'd love to come. Can we
dialog: help you with these?
text: She takes several of Yvonne’s bags.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Thank you dear. Aren’t you lovely?
text: Julz looks at Paul. Mouths the word, “Okay?” Paul can’t
text: help but nod and smile/grimace. Julz sticks her tongue out
text: at him before Yvonne pulls her onwards...
speaker_heading: YVONNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now then, tell me everything about
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Where the four of them are packed around the small table
text: loaded with food.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: --but then I thought to myself, I haven’t
dialog: got the slightest interest in die-cast
dialog: aluminum figurines. So I got a job in the
dialog: pharmacy at Boots.

speaker_heading: YVONNE

speaker_heading: JULZ

speaker_heading: ROLAND

speaker_heading: ROLAND

speaker_heading: JULZ

speaker_heading: YVONNE

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULZ

speaker_heading: ROLAND
text: With all the chirping and singing, it’s

speaker_heading: ROLAND

speaker_heading: YVONNE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: YVONNE (0.S.)

dialog: It doesn’t matter.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: He was a tosser.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: An enormous tosser. But I’m well past
dialog: it... I don’t need that much love, I
dialog: don’t expect it anyway, not coming from
dialog: where I do. But, nothing ventured,

dialog: to take chances now and again, though
dialog: it'd be brilliant if it was on something
dialog: actually worthwhile for change.
text: Paul smiles... He wants to tell her he’s worthwhile, but

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: If you could be one person, who would you
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Well, seeing as I’m a dead ringer for

dialog: (flutters her eyelashes)
dialog: Then again, she’s got her own career,

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: ‘Can't be yourself. Have to be someone

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULZ

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: On the contrary. But, if I were someone

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You’ll get a kiss later for that one...

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: That's where you want to go, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m not good enough to sing

dialog: Maybe someday.
speaker_heading: JULZ

speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: What do you mean platonic? How can you be-

dialog: Is this-- This is! You are!
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She is.

speaker_heading: HYDRANGEA
dialog: Hydrangea.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right.

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Just as well, I’ve got the blue ribbon in

text: Pulls a flyer off the wall, hands it to Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL

dialog: Three thousand pound?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Mind you, it’s no amateur night. They get

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You’re a singer, then are you?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: (as if it’s obvious...)

speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: It that code?
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Oh. Right.
text: She drags him away, leaving Julz looking at the
text: embarrassed Paul with raised eyebrows...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Actually, he’s my boss.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You’re joking?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The less you think about him the better.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Only slightly progressed since last time. The boxes are

text: Julz marvels at the collection of opera posters and
dialog: flyers.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Wow. I knew you were into opera, but I
dialog: didn’t know you were completely mad for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m not fanatical about it or anything.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Okay, maybe just a little bit.
text: Julz looks at a yellowed, framed newspaper article...
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: What language is this?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Portuguese. It’s the--
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You speak Portuguese?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not at all. I had it translated though.
dialog: It's the story of Toscanini’s first
dialog: performance in 1886...
text: Realizes he’s probably boring her.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Go on.
text: She glances at his knitting needles on the bedside
text: tables... He’s relieved when she doesn’t ask...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He was a cellist in an Italian opera
dialog: company that was touring South America.
dialog: (points to the date)
dialog: One night in 1886, their conductor was
text: booed by the audience and literally
text: forced to leave the podium. In
dialog: desperation, the singers suggested their
dialog: assistant Chorus Master take over because
dialog: he knew the whole opera by heart.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: That’s a lot to memorize, is it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Um, yes it is. And though he had never
dialog: conducted anything before, Toscanini
dialog: threw aside the score and led a
text: sensational, two-and-a-half hour
dialog: performance completely from memory. He
dialog: was nineteen.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: And then he became quite famous, didn’t
dialog: he?
text: She’s seeing his deepest desires on his sleeve. He
text: realizes he’s gotten carried away.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: He smiles
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: For what? I wish I loved something that
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There must be something?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Not yet, anyway.

speaker_heading: JULZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Best get to my train.
scene_heading: EXT. SWANSEA RAILWAY STATION - DAY
text: Paul and Julz stand side-by-side, still holding hands as
text: her train pulls in, neither wanting the day to end.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I had a lovely day.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I had a lovely day.
text: An awkward beat. Paul has no idea what to do as the train
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Sooo, I'll see you when you get back
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: From where?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Venice, of course.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I told you, I’m not going to Italy.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You are. You're going to win that karaoke
dialog: competition and if the next time we speak
dialog: you’re not ringing me from a Venetian
dialog: gondola, I mightn’t think you can sing at
dialog: all.
text: Then she kisses him, deeply, soundly, with just a bit of
dialog: tongue.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (gobsmacked)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: See ya Brad.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bye Cameron.
text: Almost without thought, he pulls her to him and kisses her
text: again. Gradually realizing he might have been too forward,
text: as evidenced by the shy look on his face as their lips
dialog: part...
text: The smile that blooms in her mouth and eyes says otherwise
text: as she opens one of the train doors and climbs aboard.
text: He follows her down the train until she finds a seat. He
text: waves and smiles and she closes her eyes and kisses the
text: window between them. The glass steams from her breath and
text: she draws a heart around the imprint of her lipstick.
text: The train pulls away leaving Paul alone but brimming on

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well done.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Yeah thanks, mate. It’s a gift from--

speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: And now, singing... Blimey...
dialog: (squints)
dialog: Vesti la goober. The vocal stylings of
dialog: Paul Poots.
text: Braddon and Hydrangea clap wildly, shoving Paul onto the
text: stage. The audience quiets for a moment, taking in his

text: Paul opens his mouth to sing, but the crowd immediately
text: ignores him, beginning to chatter amongst themselves.
text: Paul begins to sweat as the music continues to play.
text: Braddon and Hydrangea spur him on...
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Go on!
text: But the crowd are getting rowdy with themselves. Paul’s
text: nerves are getting the better of him. The emcee stops the
text: music. Starts it again.
text: Braddon chews his thumbnail nervously as Paul begins to
dialog: sing...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Vesti la giubba, e la faccia infarina. La
dialog: gente page, e rider vuole qua. E se
dialog: Arlecchin ti'invola Colombina, ridi,

text: No one’s listening. The the music swells and his voice

dialog: above average and very loud...
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Tramuta in lazzi los spasmo ed il pianto
dialog: in una smorfia il singhiozzo e ‘1 dolor,
dialog: Ah!
text: Conversations begin to tail off and people have no choice

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ridi, Pagliaccio, sul tuo amore infranto!

speaker_heading: HOOLIGAN

dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: HOOLIGAN

speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: Or basic hair and makeup.

speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JULZ (V.O.)

scene_heading: ASST. CONDUCTOR

dialog: Good evening.
dialog: (paralytic fear)
dialog: It uh, must be bargain night, it only
dialog: costs one tenner to get in, instead of
dialog: the usual three...tenors.
text: A smattering of laughter from the crowd. Pavarotti notices
text: him for the first time, but seems less than amused.
text: Paul begins to sing; Rodolfo’s, “Che Gelida Manina", the
text: same aria Paul “conducted” in his room at his parents’
dialog: house.
dialog: He’s singing well, better than we’ve ever heard, eyes
text: tightly closed as he focuses on his breathing and pitch.
text: Finally his eyes open...and what he sees seems to deflate
text: his entire being, even as he continues to sing...
text: HIS POV; where Pavarotti’s full gaze is on Alessandra, who
text: although flattered, tries to turn his attention to Paul,
dialog: but to no avail.
text: Finally, the aria ends to polite applause. Ignoring Paul

speaker_heading: PAVAROTTI
dialog: Ah, si.
dialog: (turns to Paul; obviously
dialog: hasn’t heard a word)

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN

speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Perhaps you’re confused...see you’re the

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right. Um... Sorry, did we?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You stopped ringing me back.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Playing hard to get again?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just feeling sorry for myself.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Always flattering on a man.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He didn’t even know I was there.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: He’s a celebrity.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: He may be a great singer, but anyone that
dialog: famous can’t be anything but an ass of
dialog: intergalactic proportions.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It’s lovely to see you.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m an enormous idiot.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You are. And?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m truly sorry.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m an ass of intergalactic proportions?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Well said. Lucky for you, I’ve decided to
dialog: take you up on your offer.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You have?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Em, which offer exactly?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Seeing as your self-esteem’s down the
dialog: loo, and we’re never going to have a
dialog: proper go at a relationship living so far
dialog: apart, I decided to accept your offer
dialog: to...move in together. To give it, you
dialog: know, a proper go. Nothing ventured...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nothing gained.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: So...?
text: Paul stares dumbfounded... Realizes she’s hanging herself
dialog: out there for him...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh right! Yes, of course. That would be,
dialog: um...
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wonderful.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m an ass of intergalactic proportions.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Yes, though there’s still hope for you.
text: He reaches down to carry one of her suitcases but can’t
text: even lift it off the ground.
speaker_heading: JULZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I packed a few things.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We may need a bigger flat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. ABERAVON BREAKWATER - DAY
text: An immense seawall jutting out into the gray water.
text: Surfers and wind surfers brave the cold waters alongside
text: as Paul and Julz walk hand in hand.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: So, maybe the joke wasn’t the best idea.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: He was so goggly-eyed over Alessandra, I
dialog: could’ve pulled me trousers down and he
dialog: wouldn’t’ve noticed.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: That beautiful was she?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yes. Very.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: But in that Italian sort of way; all dark
dialog: and... Not my type at all.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Mmmm. It’s not the end of the world, you
dialog: know. There are loads of other operas.
text: They reach the end of the wall and sit, legs dangling over
dialog: the waves.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not for me. I went to Italy to...
dialog: Somewhere in there I got a bit outside
dialog: myself. Just because I won some silly
dialog: competition, I started to think...
dialog: Anyway, I’ve got my expectations well
text: back in line.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Ridiculous.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Really, I’m done with singing.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: So you say.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m serious, Julz.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I believe you, darling, but I know
dialog: better...
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh do you?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: The first time we ever chatted on-line.
dialog: Do you remember how you introduced
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: As Paul, I imagine.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You said you were a singer.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It was more impressive than saying I
dialog: worked in the produce department at
dialog: Tescos.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I don’t care where you work. I care that
dialog: you're happy, and that you’ll always love
dialog: me back.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (she just said she loves
dialog: me...)
dialog: I will, you know.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Good.
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Besides, as I recall, you promised you’d
dialog: sing for me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: “Someday.”
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Someday when?
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I love you as you love me, in the evening

speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: Nor was there a day when you and I did
dialog: not share our troubles.
text: Guests arrive in suits and dresses, picking their way
text: across the grassy cemetery which surrounds the church with
text: eroded headstones.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CYNWYND CHURCH - DAY
text: The chapel is nearly full of FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Paul
text: stands alone before the altar.
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: And when we shared them, they became
dialog: easier to bear;
text: Everyone stands as Julz appears, resplendent in a white
text: dress with veil, escorted by her FATHER.
text: Paul sees her and begins to choke up. She smiles at him,
dialog: telling him he’s going to be fine...
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You comforted me in my distress, and I
dialog: wept in your laments.
text: Julz reaches the front, kisses her father after he lifts
text: her veil and stands to face Paul before the altar.
text: The VICAR gives his benediction and they exchange rings...
text: Paul finally loses his composure and Julz kisses him to
text: pull him out of it.
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Therefore, may God’s blessing be upon
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT
text: Where Paul sings the English translation of Beethoven’s
dialog: Ich Liebe Dich (I Love You) to Julz before everyone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You, my life’s joy. God protect you, keep
dialog: you for me, and protect and keep us both.
text: Now it’s Julz turn to cry. He kisses her as everyone
text: stands and applauds, many people wiping their eyes.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: So you can sing after all.
dialog: 62.
text: Braddon is a disaster as rivers of tears stream from both
text: eyes. He turns to hug Hydrangea who bears him up for a
text: moment, before reaching back and removing his hand from
dialog: her ass.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT
text: Paul and Julz whirl and twirl at the center of the crammed

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: D’you want a drink?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Champagne please.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Back in a flash, Mrs. Potts.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Why thank you, Mr. Potts.
text: He weaves through the crowd to the bar where Roland is
text: holding court with a coterie of his friends from the mill.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello, Dad.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: (far from sober)
dialog: Paul, you remember Charlie and Bill from
dialog: down the mill.
text: (he and Bill share a laugh
dialog: at the rhyme)
dialog: And this here’s Matthew, the new chap.
text: Paul stops as he sees Matthew, his nemesis grinning coldly
text: at him. Matthew offers his hand.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Paul and I went to school together.
dialog: Felicitations an’ all that.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Maybe you'll sing us a pretty song as
dialog: well?
text: The others laugh hysterically.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe you’1l get knocked out by a girl
dialog: again.
text: Matthew goes cold. He’d love to take a swing at Paul but
text: knows better. Instead, he just smirks portentously until
text: Paul turns away from them.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: A champagne and a lager, please.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
text: Matthew’s only joking, Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How could you invite him?
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: I paid for half this bender, I can invite
dialog: who I like. Besides, he’s a good lad, and
dialog: a hard worker.
text: The implication being that Paul is not.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (getting his drinks)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: What’s wrong with Matthew?
text: They’re interrupted by Paul’s former Choirmaster (from the
text: opening montage).
speaker_heading: CHOIRMASTER
dialog: I say, young man. I don’t know where you
dialog: found it, but your vocal control has
dialog: improved by light years.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thanks very much, sir. I was in Italy for
dialog: a while, but I don’t really sing--
speaker_heading: CHOIRMASTER
dialog: I’m commissioned to conduct a production
dialog: of Aida in Bath. And you, sir, would make
dialog: a wonderful Radames.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Really?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: No no, he’s all finished with that
dialog: nonsense. He’1ll be getting an honest job,
dialog: earning an honest wage.
speaker_heading: CHOIRMASTER
dialog: There’s no pay, I’m afraid.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’ll take it.
speaker_heading: ROLAND
dialog: Bloody hell.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: As the door handle turns, then flips back to its original

text: as Paul and Julz, she in his arms, spill into the room...
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: No, no, on the bed. I couldn’t stand
dialog: another second in these torture devices.
text: He deposits her on the bed and helps her remove her shoes,
text: to her great relief.
speaker_heading: JULZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, that’s lovely. I shall never dance
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Famous last words.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Reminds me of someone I just married.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The lead tenor in Aida. I still can’t
dialog: believe it.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: This is the best wedding day ever...
dialog: Which reminds me.
text: She jumps to her feet and opens a cabinet, revealing a
text: beautiful antique gramophone and a mylar bag which she
text: hands to Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I got sparklies--
dialog: (flashes her rings)
dialog: --this makes it even.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not unless you'll be paying this off for
dialog: the next ten years.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Open it.
text: He removes a thin sleeve bearing a photo of--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Puccini.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: That’s an original recording from the
dialog: premiere at...
dialog: (grabs a slip of paper)
dialog: ...-La Scala, Milan on April twenty-fifth--
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Nineteen twenty six. Conducted by
dialog: Toscanini himself, but how--
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: E-bay, how else?
text: She places the disc on the gramophone and sets the
text: needle... The tenor, Miguel Fleta, begins to sing...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL FLETA
dialog: Nessun Dorma.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: This was recorded before Pavarotti was
dialog: even born.
text: She sits on the bed next to him and kisses him as the aria
text: unfolds...
speaker_heading: JULZ (CONT'D)
dialog: What is he saying?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nessun dorma. None shall sleep. Calaf has
dialog: been rejected by the woman he loves, a
dialog: princess.
text: Kisses him again as she starts removing her dress.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: What’s it always have to be a princess?
dialog: Why can’t checkout girls have great love
dialog: stories written about them?
dialog: (re: her dress)
dialog: Give us a hand.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: If she can guess his name by dawn, she
text: gets to call off the wedding and chop his
text: head off.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I like that bit.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (translating)
dialog: -.-my secret is hidden within me. None
dialog: will know my name. On your mouth I will
dialog: say it when the light shines.
text: She removes her undergarments and stands before him,
text: naked.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT’D)
dialog: And my kiss will dissolve the silence
dialog: that makes you mine.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: So kiss me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’ve never done this before.
text: She nods, knowingly, then helps him remove his shirt.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: So what happens to them?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Well, she tortures all of his friends who
dialog: refuse to reveal his name, but when dawn
text: comes, he kisses her and she falls--
speaker_heading: JULZ
text: --madly in love with him.
text: She pulls him down onto the bed as we linger on the

text: FADE TO BLACK.

scene_heading: INT. CAR PHONE WAREHOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: What? Oh.
text: Off Paul’s gesture, he pulls his half-hanging, pointy

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shall I leave you alone?
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: So there I am, right in the heart of
dialog: Morgol Forest, having blasted my way
text: through an army of Hobgoblins using a
text: spectacular array of spellcraft. When
dialog: whom do I see with her tongue down the
dialog: throat of some bloody hippogriff?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: As if unicorns and hippogriffs could ever
dialog: be together. You can look it up, it’s

speaker_heading: BRADDON

dialog: Creme de Menthe?
speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’m the lead. They’re counting on me.
speaker_heading: DR. THORPE
dialog: An appendectomy is invasive surgery. If

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How irreparable?
speaker_heading: DR. THORPE

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: I’1l thank you both not to talk about my

speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Yes, you’re right, dear. It’s just so--
dialog: Really, why can’t he just put himself
dialog: first for a change?
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Because then he'd be just like everyone

speaker_heading: YVONNE

text: He smiles bashfully then leads into Julz ear, whispering.
speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: You've no idea how much this means to me.
dialog: My whole life I never even had one true

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON
dialog: Because you’re a sissy.
speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: BRADDON

speaker_heading: JULZ

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can’t. No telling what shape my vocal

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Right... But then how will you know if

speaker_heading: PAUL

scene_heading: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT

speaker_heading: JULZ
dialog: Good enough for who? Bloomin’ Pavarotti?
dialog: If you want a final go on-stage, then
dialog: here’s your chance. Or, if you really

scene_heading: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
dialog: (into her walkie)

speaker_heading: PRODUCER #2

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good afternoon. I’m Paul.
text: Several thousand PEOPLE look on from the audience. His

speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: What are you here for today, Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: To sing opera.
text: Simon and Piers exchange an “oh crap” look. The audience

text: stares at the floor, face tight, expecting the worst.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: So you work at Car Phone Warehouse and
dialog: you did that. I wasn’t expecting that.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
