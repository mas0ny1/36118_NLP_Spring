dialog: A Screen Play
dialog: by Andrew M. Niccol
speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: A white title appears on a black screen.
dialog: <i>"As night-fall does not come at once, neither</i>
dialog: <i>does oppression...It is in such twilight that</i>
dialog: <i>we all must be aware of change in the air</i>
dialog: <i>- however slight - lest we become victims of</i>
dialog: <i>the darkness."</i>
dialog: Justice William O. Douglas
text: The title fades off, replaced by a second title.
dialog: <i>"I not only think that we will tamper with</i>
dialog: <i>Mother Nature, I think Mother wants us to."</i>
dialog: William Gaylin
text: The second title fades off, leaving a dark screen.
text: The darkness gradually gives way to a dawning light.
text: We are confronted with sight of a barren, empty landscape. A
text: wide expanse of wasteland.
text: Suddenly, without warning, an elephant tusk falls from the sky
text: and crashes onto the parched ground. The earth-shuddering
text: impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before
text: finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust.
text: The first tusk is quickly followed by a second, also dropping
text: from the heavens. It lands near the first. Another tusk
text: smashes to earth several yards away. Yet another comes crashing
text: into the foreground.
text: Finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE
text: In another region of the wasteland, a forest of tree trunks
text: suddenly rains down from the sky. The trunks thump to the hard
text: ground, also rebounding in slow motion. Cleanly sawn,
text: branchless, palm-like trunks, they come to rest in the dust only
text: to be followed by a second cascade of lumber.
text: When the dust finally clears. the felled tree trunks lie in a
text: huge, log-jam in the desert.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE
text: Next to descend from the sky, a torrent of firewood. One shower
text: after another, crashing to the plain. Enough chopped lumber to
dialog: fuel a thousand hearths.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE
text: Joining the rest of the debris is a deluge of slate - sheets
text: of shale from a great unseen quarry in the sky come slamming to
text: earth. Some of the pieces shattering, some rebounding into the
text: air until the granite litters acres of landscape as far as the
text: eye can see.
text: TITLES ARE SPACED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE PRECEDING
scene_heading: SEQUENCE. THE FINAL TITLE READS:
scene_heading: <i>T H E N O T - T O O - D I S T A N T F U T U R E</i>
text: The camera commences a long, slow pull-back from the pile of
text: elephant tusks. Gradually they are revealed as human
text: fingernails magnified many hundreds of times.
text: The tree trunks are mere hair follicles. The firewood,
text: whiskers. The slate, flakes of skin.
scene_heading: INT. INCINERATOR. EARLY MORNING.
text: A naked MAN, thirties, seen in profile, is crouched upon a metal
text: floor inside a small, brushed stainless steel tank, rubbing his
text: skin raw with a wire brush. JEROME MORROW.
text: Having completed his scrupulous ablutions, Jerome arches his
text: lean frame through the small, oval door of the metal room
dialog: with practised ease.
text: Securing the thick, fireproof windowed door behind himself, he
text: turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber. The gas
text: instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming
text: modern stainless-steel custom-made incinerator.
text: We refocus on a MAGNIFIED CLOSE UP of his exfoliated flesh in
text: the incinerator as it blackens, curls and burns.
text: Jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of
text: backless slippers.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. EARLY MORNING.
text: JEROME emerges from the incinerator room into a large, luxurious
text: loft-style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment -
text: arranged somewhat like a production line.
text: Long, scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along
text: one entire wall. Laid out on the benches in neat rows are
text: dozens of plastic bags - some filled, some unfilled. Instruments
text: on trays - various types of tweezers, scissors and other less
text: familiar utensils. Round, stainless steel containers filled
text: with hairs of differing lengths and other body matter.
text: JEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the benches.
text: EUGENE. He clutches an empty vodka bottle. He is snoring
text: lightly - sleeping off the night before. As JEROME gently
text: prises the bottle out of his hand, we are struck by the
text: similarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's.
text: Jerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surprising
text: ease. A wheelchair - a modern, ergonomic design. Jerome wheels
text: Eugene to a bedroom and, with some difficulty, hauls the larger
text: man onto the bed. Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co-
text: operates - his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight.
text: After covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bathroom
text: containing a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink,
dialog: shower and toilet.
text: Beside the toilet stands a large, industrial-style stainless
text: steel refrigerator.
text: Donning protective gloves, Jerome opens the liquid-nitrogen
text: cooled refrigerator. A cloud of condensed water vapor billows
text: out. Revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and
text: silicon pouches - some containing a yellowish liquid, some a
text: deep, red liquid.
text: In front of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list -
text: <i>"TRUFFLES, CIGS, VODKA"</i>. Jerome smiles to himself as he
text: retrieves the note along with one of the jars. He checks the
text: jar's label. Satisfied with the date written there, he breaks
text: the seal and pours the contents into the clear, silicon pouch of
text: an IV-like device lying on the steel bathroom counter.
text: He seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by opening the valve
text: on its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liquid
text: into the nearby toilet bowl, as one would test a syringe. We
text: remain on Jerome's face as he reaches between his legs and
text: inserts the pouch.
text: Reopening the refrigerator, Jerome slides out a tray containing
text: neat rows of slim, fingertip-sized plastic sachets filled with a
text: deep, red-colored liquid. He removes his gloves, selects one of
text: the sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the
text: end of his index finger. He prepares a second sachet for his
text: middle finger. Jerome then applies skin-colored cover-up makeup
text: to the sachets, blending them in with the color of his fingers.
text: JEROME, still dressed in his robe, climbs a large, spiral
text: staircase to the floor above.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. EARLY MORNING.
text: He emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large,
text: loft-stlye condominium. Through the floor to ceiling window
text: that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting
text: to leak into the night sky.
text: In the bedroom JEROME removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag.
text: Printed on the bag - <i>"Confidentiality Guaranteed"</i>. He emerges
text: from his bedroom, dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut
text: suit. He adjusts his tie in the mirror, careful not to disturb
text: the sachets attached to his fingertips.
scene_heading: INT. INVESTIGATOR'S POOL. MORNING.
text: A lone MAN swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to
text: be a pool of enormous length - yet he never reaches the pool's
text: end. We pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against
text: an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself.
text: Abruptly, the man stops and stands up - the fast-flowing current
text: instantly stilled. We glimpse the face of INVESTIGATOR LUCAS.
text: Thirties, he has a youthful yet rigid face. We have the
text: impression that he does not swim for pleasure.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX. MORNING.
text: It is still early as JEROME exits the building's underground
text: parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and proceeds
text: down the long straight driveway. He exchanges a wave with a
text: GARDENER trimming a lawn.
text: The whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its
dialog: conventional appearance.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION. DAY.
text: JEROME's car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road
text: leading to the parking lot of "GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION".
text: A sleek, modern, low-rise industrial compound boasting perfectly
text: manicured landscaped gardens.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION. DAY.
text: JEROME strides purposefully up to the entranceway with hundreds
text: of other GATTACA EMPLOYEES. He carries himself with a certain
text: arrogance, a cool detachment. All employees wear similarly
text: unconventionally-cut suits, short coiffed hair and robust tans.
text: The Gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and
text: women and a diverse range of ethnicities.
text: They filter through a row of channels supervised by SECURITY
text: GUARDS. Each channel contains a computerized security device,
text: featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a finger
text: under the watchful eye of a Security Guard.
text: Jerome gives a polite nod to a Guard as he places his index
text: finger in the groove. His fingertip is jabbed with the
text: finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken.
text: The blood specimen confirms Jerome's identity - an ID photograph
text: appearing on a computer screen.
text: Out of the corner of his eye, Jerome spies a young woman
text: entering through the adjacent channel. She is also sneaking a
text: glance in his direction - IRENE. Catching each other looking,
text: they both quickly avert their eyes.
text: As Jerome enters the computer facility of Gattaca Aerospace
text: Corporation he furtively glances at the pin-prick puncture in
text: his fingertip sachet.
text: SOMEWHERE IN DEEP SPACE.
text: A GATTACA spacecraft skirts an asteroid. Taking advantage of
text: the rock's gravitational pull, the craft slingshots deeper into
text: the black void. Then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze
text: in mid-space, suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward
text: again - the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course.
text: We pull back to reveal that the journey is merely a highly
text: realistic graphic representation on a GATTACA computer screen
speaker_heading: operated by JEROME.
text: Appearing simultaneously alongside the computer animation is a
text: seemingly never-ending column of computer instructions for this
text: celestial navigation - the incomprehensible language of the
dialog: computer programmer.
dialog: 140 #x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20{
scene_heading: 150 #x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00
scene_heading: 160 #xfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfe
text: Jerome is transported - plotting a path through the heavens.
text: As his fingers fly across the keys he does not once take his
text: eyes from the screen.
text: His is one of hundreds of ergonomically designed work stations,
text: arranged in ever-widening circles in a huge, curcular, well-
text: appointed if antiseptic room. Each curved desk contains a
text: computer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim,
text: transparent screen behind which is seated a PROGRAMMER,
text: designing software for the aerospace agency. At the center of
text: the room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing
text: outwards, from which operations are monitored.
text: Floor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only
text: concession to nature - a tinted view of a man-made, meticulously
text: landscaped garden.
text: Jerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a
text: discreet mini-vac. He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard.
text: DIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man
text: approaches. His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: You keep your work station so clean, Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: --Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?
text: The Director smiles at the notion and places a computer disc
text: on Jerome's desk.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: I reviewed your flight plan. Not one error
text: in a hundred thousand keystrokes. Phenomenal.
text: (placing a hand on Jerome's shoulder)
dialog: It's right that someone like you is taking us
dialog: to the Belt.
text: (glancing to notification on Jerome's screen)
dialog: You have a substance test.
text: The Director briskly departs, Irene in tow. At a nearby work
text: station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at
text: the mention of the test.
text: Jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his
text: ankle. However he surreptitiously produced one of Eugene's
text: transparent specimen bags from his sock. An EXTREME CLOSE UP
text: reveals the bag's contents - flakes of skin, hair follicles,
text: eyelashes, a fingernail. Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid
text: detection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his
text: keyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station.
text: He opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of
text: the bag. Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two
dialog: hair follicles.
text: Jerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the
dialog: testing lab.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - TESTING LABORATORY. DAY.
text: White-coated LAMAR, forties, buzzcut, a man's man, checks
text: JEROME's eyes with an instrument. Satisfied with his
text: examination, he passes a transparent plastic container to
text: JEROME. Standing directly in front of the technician with his
text: back to camera, Jerome opens his fly. A steady stream of urine
text: begins to flow into the container from Jerome's hidden pouch.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
text: (staring admiringly at the discharge)
dialog: Jerome...never shy. Pisses on command.
dialog: You've got a beautiful cock. I ever told
dialog: you that, Jerome?
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: (deadpan as he continues to urinate)
dialog: Only every time I'm in here.
text: Jerome hands the container to Lamara who seals and label it as
text: Jerome refastens his trousers.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: I see a lot of cocks. I speak from experience.
dialog: Yours is a beautiful example. Why didn't my
dialog: folks order a cock like that for me?
text: LAMAR pours the urine sample into a high-tech device where it
text: is instantly analyzed. The urine identifies Jerone while also
text: registering a negative drug reading. The computer reads
dialog: <i>"VALID"</i>.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (walking Jerome to the door)
dialog: If everything goes to plan, this could be the
dialog: last time I see you for a while. One week to
dialog: go. Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I'll tell you at the end of the week.
text: Jerome departs.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - RESTROOM. DAY.
text: JEROME enters the restroom and glances at the toilet stalls.
text: Only three in the bank of twenty is occupied. He tarries at the
text: mirror above the uniform line of basins, unnecessarily
text: reknotting his tie.
text: A toilet flushes and a COLLEAGUE exits one of the stalls. He
text: and Jerome exchange a nod. When the man has exited the restroom,
text: Jerome enters the man's vacated stall.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - TOILET STALL. DAY.
text: JEROME immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and
text: detaches a secreted stainless steel container.
text: With surprising swiftness and dexterity, Jerome removes an
text: extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair
text: into the toilet bowl. He inserts two replacement lenses from
text: the container and reattaches it in its hiding place.
text: Jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall. He checks in the
text: mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: Walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors,
text: JEROME becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex -
text: or to be more precise, a lack of noise. The incessant tapping
text: of computer keys has stilled.
text: As Jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the
text: reflection of his face, deep in thought.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
text: The most unremarkable of events. Jerome
dialog: Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days
text: away from a one-year manned mission to 951
text: Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt. Nothing so
dialog: unique in that. Last year over one thousand
dialog: citizens from every walk of life embarked on
dialog: some space mission or other. Besides,
dialog: selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed
dialog: at birth. He is blessed with all the physical
dialog: and intellectual gifts required for such an
dialog: arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second
dialog: to none.</i>
text: Jerome's gaze drifts to the sky.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: No, there is truly nothing remarkable about
dialog: the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I
dialog: am not Jerome Morrow.</i>
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DUSK - THIRTY-ODD YEARS EARILER
text: A starry sky. The camera tilts down to find palm trees
text: swaying against a setting sun.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: I was conceived in the Riviera. Not the
dialog: </i>French<i> Riviera.</i>
text: The camera tilts down further to find a Buick Riviera parked in
text: a deserted beachfront parking lot on a polluted stretch of
dialog: beach.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: The </i>Detroit<i> variety.</i>
text: Through the car's steamed windows we see Jerome's mother and
text: father, MARIA and ANTONIO, early twenties, making love.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: They used to say that a child conceived in love,
dialog: has a greater chance of happiness. They don't
dialog: say that any more.</i>
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC. DAY.
text: MARIA, wearing a medical gown, lies on an examining table, feet
text: in stirrups. A NURSE, forties, wheels an instrument tray
text: towards her. Maria suddenly disengages her feet from the
text: stirrups and swings her legs off the table.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I can't do this.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (misinterpreting the problem)
dialog: I told you, the government pays. It's all
dialog: taken care of.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No, you don't understand. I <i>can't</i>.
text: The nurse places a comforting hand on Maria's shoulder.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: The doctor will give you something.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (removing the hand, adamant)
dialog: I'm not doing it.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (trying to make her see reason)
dialog: Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
text: The remark stings Maria.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (softening her tone)
dialog: --I've read your profile. I don't
dialog: know about the father but you carry
dialog: enough hereditary factors on your own.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You can have other children.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (holding her swollen stomach protectively)
dialog: Not like <i>this</i> one.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (trying to be diplomatic)
dialog: Honey, look around you. The world doesn't
dialog: want one like <i>that</i> one.
text: Maria gets off the table and reaches for her clothes laying
text: across a chair.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (irate)
dialog: You don't know what it will be!
text: The nurse watches Maria as she dresses, genuinely bewildered.
speaker_heading: NURSE
text: (calling out to Maria as she disappears
dialog: out of the door)
dialog: The child won't thank you!
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM. DAY.
text: We focus on a crucifix dangling on a rosary. Tilting up we find
text: the rosary clasped between MARIA and ANTONIO's intertwined
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Those were early days--days when a priest
dialog: could still persuade someone to put their
dialog: faith in God's hands rather than those of
dialog: the local geneticist.</i>
text: Bathed in sweat, Maria gives a final push on the delivery table.
text: While still attached to his umbilical cord, the heel of the
text: NEWBORN BABY BOY is immediately pricked by a masked NURSE. A
text: minute drop of blood is inserted into an analyzing machine.
text: Even as the baby is put into Maria's arms, page after page of
text: data begins to appear on a monitor, pulsing warning signals
text: throughout the spreadsheets.
text: Two assisting NURSES exchange a look. Antonio senses something
dialog: amiss.
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Of course, there was nothing wrong with me.
dialog: Not so long ago I would have been considered
text: a perfectly healthy, normal baby. Ten fingers,
dialog: ten toes. That was all that used to matter.
dialog: But now my immediate well-being was not the
dialog: sole concern.</i>
text: Antonio turns his attention from his baby to the data appearing
text: on the monitor. We see individual items highlighted amongst the
scene_heading: data - <i>"NERVE CONDITION - PROBABILITY 60%", "MANIC DEPRESSION -
text: 42%", "OBESITY - 66%", "ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER - 89%"--
speaker_heading: JEROME (VO)
dialog: My destiny was mapped out before me--
dialog: all my flaws, predispositions and
dialog: susceptibilities - most untreatable to
dialog: this day. Only minutes old, the date and
dialog: cause of my death was already known.</i>
text: Antonio focuses on a final highlighted item on the monitor's
scene_heading: screen, <i>"HEART DISORDER - 99% - EARLY FATAL POTENTIAL.".
scene_heading: "LIFE EXPECTANCY - 33 YEARS"</i>.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: The name?
dialog: (typing details into birth certificate)
dialog: For the certificate.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Antonio--
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: (correcting her)
dialog: --No, <i>Vincent</i> Antonio.
text: With a computer stylus he signs the nurse's handheld screen.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACT HOME - BACKYARD. DAY.
scene_heading: 2-YEAR-OLD JEROME (REFERRED TO BY HIS GIVEN NAME OF "VINCENT"
text: FOR MOST OF THE FOLLOWING FLASHBACK) running with a toy rocket
text: falls more in clumsiness than fatigue. MARIA suddenly whisks up
dialog: the toddler.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let
dialog: you out of my sight.
text: Maria frantically listens to her young son's heartbeat. For
text: his part, Vincent appears surprised by the attention. Maria
text: places a portable oxygen mask over Vincent's mouth.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: I was born Vincent Antonio Luca. And from
dialog: an early age I came to think of myself as
dialog: others thought of me - chronically ill.
text: Every skinned knee and runny nose treated
dialog: as if it were life-threatening.</i>
scene_heading: INT. DAY CARE CENTER. DAY.
text: MARIA and ANTONIO drop off dark-haired 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT at a
dialog: Day Care Center.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: And my parents soon realized that wherever
dialog: I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.</i>
text: While HEALTHY CHILDREN play outside on tricycles, clamber over
text: jungle-gyms and finger-paint, the PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER shows
text: Vincent into a room where CHILDREN WITH OBVIOUS DISABILITIES
text: sleep on mats.
text: Maria wheels around and marches out of the center with Vincent
text: in her arms. Antonio follows close behind, pleading with his
dialog: wife to see sense.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: They put off having any more children
dialog: until they could afford not to gamble -
dialog: to bring a child into the world in what
dialog: has become the "natural" way.</i>
scene_heading: EXT. HOME. DAY.
text: ANTONIO reluctantly shows off his spotless Buick Riviera to a
text: prospective BUYER.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: It meant selling the beloved Buick.</i>
text: The two men haggle over the price while MARIA, holding VINCENT
text: in her arms, looks on. Finally money and a pink slip are
dialog: exchanged.
speaker_heading: <i>VINCENT (VO)
dialog: My father got a good price. After all,
dialog: the only accident he'd ever had in that
dialog: car was me.</i>
text: As the BUYER drives away, Antonio shrugs to Maria to hide his
dialog: disappointment.
scene_heading: EXT. GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.
text: ANTONIO, MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT exit a packed commuter
text: bus and enter a Genetic Counselling office building bearing
text: the sign - "PRO-CREATION".
scene_heading: INT. GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE. DAY.
text: A GENETICIST stares into a high-powered microscope as ANTONIO,
text: MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT are shown into the office by a
text: NURSE. On the counter beside the Geneticist is a glass-doored
text: industrial refrigerator containing petri dishes arranged on
text: racks several feet high.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (to the nurse, without taking
text: his eyes from his binocular microscope)
dialog: Put up the dish.
text: While Antonio and Maria take a seat in front of a television
text: monitor, the Nurse puts a labelled petri dish under a video-
text: equipped microscope. The Geneticist swings around in his chair
text: to greet his clients.
text: Four magnified clusters of cells - eight cells on each cluster
text: - appear on the television screen.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: Your extracted eggs...
dialog: (noting the couple's names from
text: data along the edge of the screen)
dialog: ...<i>Maria</i>, have been fertilized with...
dialog: <i>Antonio's</i> sperm and we have performed an
text: analysis of the resulting pre-embryos.
dialog: After screening we're left with two healthy
text: boys and two healthy girls. Naturally, no
dialog: critical pre-dispositions to any of the major
dialog: inheritable diseases. All that remains is
dialog: to select the most compatible candidate.
text: Maria and Antonio exchange a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: First, we may as well decide on gender.
dialog: Have you given it any thought?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (referring to the toddler
dialog: on her knee)
dialog: We would like Vincent to have a brother...
dialog: you know, to play with.
text: The Geneticist nods. He scans the data around the edge of the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: You've already specified blue eyes, dark
dialog: hair and fair skin. I have taken the liberty
dialog: of eradicating any potentially prejudicial
dialog: conditions - premature baldness, myopia,
dialog: alcoholism and addictive susceptibility,
dialog: propensity for violence and obesity--
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (interrupting, anxious)
dialog: --We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: (more diplomatic)
dialog: We were wondering if we should leave some
dialog: things to chance.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: You want to give your child the best possible
dialog: start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection
dialog: built-in already. Your child doesn't need
dialog: any additional burdens. And keep in mind,
dialog: this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you.
dialog: You could conceive naturally a thousand times
dialog: and never get such a result.
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: (squeezing Maria's hand)
dialog: He's right, Maria. That's right.
text: Maria is only half-convinced, but the Geneticist swiftly moves
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed
dialog: child?
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: (blank)
dialog: Er, no...
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: Some believe it is associated with creativity,
dialog: although there's no evidence. Also for
dialog: sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I like football.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (injecting a note of levity)
dialog: I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going
dialog: to be at least a head taller than you.
dialog: Prepare for a crick in the neck in
dialog: sixteen years time.
text: Antonio beams proudly.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (scanning the data on the screen)
dialog: Anything I've forgotten?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (hesitant about broaching the subject)
dialog: We want him--we were hoping he would get
dialog: married and have children. We'd like
dialog: grandchildren.
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (conspiratorial smile)
dialog: I understand. That's already been taken
dialog: care of.
dialog: (an afterthought)
dialog: Now you appreciate I can only work with
dialog: the raw material I have at my disposal but
dialog: for a little extra...I could also attempt to
dialog: insert sequences associated with enhanced
dialog: mathematical or musical ability.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (suddenly enthused)
dialog: Antonio, the choir...
speaker_heading: GENETICIST
dialog: (interjecting, covering himself)
dialog: I have to caution you it's not fool-proof.
dialog: With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.

scene_heading: INT. TRACT HOME. DAY.
text: A red pencil draws a mark on a doorway at the height of a
text: child's head. The child moves away and the name, <i>"ANTON 11"</i> is
text: written beside the mark by proud father, ANTONIO.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: That's how my brother, Anton, came into the
dialog: world - a son my father considered worthy
dialog: of his name.</i>
text: There is little physical similarity between 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON
text: and 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT standing beside him, apart from their
text: height. In fact Vincent is mortified to see that his younger
dialog: brother's mark is a fraction of an inch higher than the mark
text: beside his own name, <i>"VINCENT 13"</i>. Vincent runs from the room.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAY.
text: 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON sit together on a
text: windswept beach.
text: Anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of
text: his thumb with the sharp edge. He hands the shell to Vincent
text: who hesitantly follows suit.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: By the time we were playing at blood
dialog: brothers I understood that there was something

text: The two brothers press their thumbs together, merging the blood.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: And I'd need an awful lot more than
dialog: a drop if I was going to get anywhere.</i>
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. LATER IN THE DAY.
text: While ANTONIO and MARIA doze under a beach umbrella, ANTON and
text: VINCENT enter the water, diving through the waves. From above
text: we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other
text: beyond the breakers.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Our favorite game was "chicken". When our
dialog: parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside
dialog: the flags, as far out as we dared. It was about
dialog: who would get scared and turn back first.</i>
text: Suddenly VINCENT stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the
text: water, exhausted and fearful. He watches ANTON swim on into the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Of course, it was always me. Anton was by far
dialog: the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.</i>
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM. DAY.
text: A TEACHER gives a physics lesson. The bespectacled 13-YEAR-OLD
text: VINCENT has his arm energetically raised at each opportunity but
text: is never called upon. Eventually he lowers his arm in defeat.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: My genetic scarlet letter continued to follow
dialog: me from school to school. When you're told
dialog: you're prone to learning disabilities, it's
dialog: sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody.</i>
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
text: 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT stands at a cul-de-sac at the end of a long,
text: straight deserted street. He places a basketball in the middle
text: of the street to represent the SUN and begins to unwind the huge
text: reel of string attached to the ball. 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON walks a
text: pace behind him. Several yards along the trail a bead is
text: threaded through the string to represent the planet MERCURY.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: How many astronauts are there, anyway?
text: Vincent ignores him and continues to reel out the string.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: I bet <i>I</i> could be one.
text: Vincent stops and regards his younger brother with contempt.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You're standing on Venus.
text: Anton lifts his foot. There is a bead beneath it.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CAR / SATELLITE DISH. DUSK.
text: VINCENT has developed into a handsome 17-YEAR-OLD. His
text: spectacles hidden, he and a YOUNG WOMAN are necking in the front
text: seat of a beat-up car, parked overlooking a huge satellite dish.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: I was popular enough until it got around
dialog: that I wasn't a long-term proposition.</i>
text: The love-making intensifies. The YOUNG WOMAN moves down
text: Vincent's chest and unzips his fly.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Those who didn't know already could easily
dialog: find out for themselves. It was certainly
dialog: no problem coaxing the information out of me.</i>
text: We remain on Vincent's face as he climaxes. The YOUNG WOMAN
text: turns her head away from the spent Jerome and, out of his
text: view, trickles semen from her mouth into a clear specimen vial.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: I didn't blame them. You need to know if a

dialog: or life insurance or can hold down a decent job.</i>
scene_heading: INT. HOME. DAY.
text: In the living room of their modest home, the dark-haired, 17-
text: year-old, bespectacled VINCENT sits opposite his PARENTS. The
text: crestfallen Vincent has a book on his lap entitled "CAREERS IN
dialog: SPACE".
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (trying to break it gently)
dialog: Vincent, you have to be realistic. A
dialog: heart condition like yours--
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: --I don't care. I'll take the risk.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It's not just <i>you</i> they have to be concerned
dialog: about. Perhaps we could get you one of
dialog: those new pacemakers. They're not perfect
dialog: but--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (letting his frustration show)
dialog: For God's sake, Vincent, don't you understand.
dialog: The only way you'll see the inside of a space
dialog: ship is if you're cleaning it!
text: Vincent looks at his father in disbelief.
text: On a dinner table on the other side of the living room, 15-YEAR-
text: OLD ANTON looks up from the biological specimen he is studying
text: with a magnifying glass.
scene_heading: INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - WAITING ROOM. DAY.
text: 17-YEAR-OLD VINCENT hides his glasses in his pocket as he enters
text: a WAITING ROOM. He gazes around at other APPLICANTS.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: My father was right. It didn't matter how
dialog: much I lied on my resumÈ, my real C.V. was
dialog: in my cells. Why should anybody invest all
dialog: that money to train </i>me<i>, when there are a
dialog: thousand other applicants with a far cleaner
dialog: profile? Of course, it's illegal to discriminate -
dialog: "genoism" it's called - but no one takes the
dialog: laws seriously.</i>
text: As Jerome enters the office, we focus on the doorhandle he has
dialog: just touched.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: If you refuse to disclose, they can always
dialog: take a sample from a doorhandle...</i>
text: Vincent hesitates before shaking the PERSONNEL OFFICER's
text: outstretched hand.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: ...or a handshake...</i>
text: We focus on Jerome's envelope attached to his application form
text: sitting on the Manager's desk.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: ...even the saliva off your application form.</i>
text: Sitting opposite the manager, Jerome's face falls. The manager
text: puts a clear, plastic cup in front of Jerome.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: But for the most part we know who we are.
dialog: And if all else fails, a legal drug test
dialog: can just as easily become an illegal peek
dialog: at your future in the company.</i>
text: Vincent saves the Manager the trouble and exits the office,
text: leaving the cup where it sits.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAY.
text: 17-YEAR-OLD JEROME walks up the beach to find 15-YEAR-OLD ANTON
text: sitting with the YOUNG WOMAN Vincent had previously dated.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: I didn't blame Anton for his free ride. You
dialog: can't blame someone for winning the lottery.</i>
text: The Young Woman hastily departs.
text: LATER the two brothers face each other on the sand. Anton is
text: the more statuesque of the two.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (cocky)
dialog: You sure you want to do this?
text: Vincent's answer is to walk towards the water. Anton smiles
text: mockingly at his brother's grim "game face" and
text: follows.
text: From an aerial view we watch VINCENT and his younger brother, ANTON,
text: swim beyond the breakers.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: It was the last time we swam together.
text: Out into the open sea, like always,
text: knowing each stroke towards the horizon
dialog: was one we had to make back to the
dialog: shore. Like always, the unspoken contest.</i>
text: We watch the two young men swimming stroke for stroke. They
text: swim far out, beyond the point. Suddenly ANTON starts to slow,
text: his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the
text: water. He begins to sink like a stone. VINCENT, realizing
text: Anton is no longer beside him, turns back to lend support.
text: Vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him
text: back to shore. Finally the two boys are coughed up onto the
text: shallows. They collapse, just beyond the waterline, exhausted,
text: gasping for air. ANTONIO and MARIA arrive on the scene. ANTON
text: is the first to recover while VINCENT clutches his side, his
text: face screwed up in pain. Maria kneels down and starts to
text: administer to Vincent but his father, Antonio, is unable to
text: conceal his anger and contempt for Vincent.
speaker_heading: ANTONIO
dialog: Vincent, you damn fool! You could have killed
dialog: Anton with your ridiculous contest! Why should
dialog: he risk his life to save yours?! When are you
dialog: going to get it through your thick head--you
dialog: can't compete with your brother! Why try?!
text: Maria takes Antonio aside. Anton and Vincent exchange a look.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Why didn't you say anything?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Why didn't <i>you?</i>
text: (staring back at his father knowingly)
dialog: It's okay. It's the way they want it.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: It confirmed everything in the minds of
dialog: my parents - that they had taken the right
dialog: course with my younger brother and the
dialog: wrong course with me. It would have been so
dialog: much easier for everyone if </i>I<i> had slipped away
dialog: that day. I decided to grant them that wish.</i>
scene_heading: INT. HOME. NIGHT.
text: ANTON stands at the mantlepiece in the dimly-lit living room.
text: He gazes at a framed family portrait - Vincent's face has been
text: torn out of it. He suddenly spies VINCENT exiting the front
text: gate, carrying a suitcase. Anton goes to shout Vincent's name
text: but the words don't get out.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA. DAWN.
text: A pick-up truck, packed with a CLEANING CREW, pulls into the
text: rear of the building. They are no longer strictly the migrant
dialog: workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of
dialog: ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not
dialog: discriminate by race.
text: As VINCENT exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we
dialog: discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to
text: know as JEROME. The only visible differences are the glasses he
text: wears and his hair, still naturally dark.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Like many others in my situation, I moved
dialog: around a lot in the next few years, getting
dialog: work where I could. I must have cleaned
dialog: half the toilets in the state.</i>
text: We follow VINCENT through the course of a day. Cleaning
text: restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing
text: windows - gazing at the AEROSPACE WORKERS below. The building
text: is part of the Gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch
text: site. Throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, Vincent
text: spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky.
text: Jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up. Long after
text: the sun has set, Vincent is still working. Another rocket ship
text: lights up the darkness. Vincent gazes forlornly into the
dialog: heavens.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA - GLASS WALL. DAY.
text: VINCENT cleans a window from the outside, staring in at the
text: arrogant GATTACA EMPLOYEES entering the security channels -
text: a smaple taken from their fingertips. Jerome, in a trance,
text: constantly cleans the same spot of glass. He fails to notice an
text: Older Janitor, CAESAR, appear beside him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't
dialog: clean it too well.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (glancing to the Gattaca workers)
dialog: You might get ideas.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier
dialog: for you to see me when I'm on the other
dialog: side of it.
text: Caesar smiles at Vincent's cockiness.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA. DAY.
text: VINCENT empties garbage into a dumpster adjacent to Gattaca.
text: His attention is drawn to something in the trash. A discarded
dialog: manual on Celestial Mechanics and Navigation. He wipes food
text: residue off the corner.
scene_heading: INT. ASTRONOMY &amp; TELESCOPE SHOP. DAY.
text: A forest of telescopes on tripods in an astronomy shop. VINCENT
text: enters the store with a bucket and squeegee and immediately goes
text: to clean the storefront window. The STORE OWNER looks up from
text: his tabloid - "STAR" magazine.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Where's Earl?
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: He fell. Lucky it was only the second floor.
text: The owner nods and returns to his magazine. When he looks up
text: again one of his tripods is missing its telescope and Jerome is
text: nowhere to be seen.
scene_heading: INT. IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT. NIGHT.
text: JEROME returns to his bare apartment. He removes the cloth
text: covering the bucket to reveal a dumpy-shaped telescope snugly
text: wedged inside. He starts to pour over his collection of
text: textbooks. Other tattered space paraphenalia adorns the wall.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Of course the best test score in the world
dialog: wasn't going to get me in the front door
dialog: unless I had the blood test to go with it.</i>
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA. NIGHT.
text: While his fellow WORKERS sit on the steps at the service
text: entrance to Gattaca, passing around an unlabeled bottle of clear
text: liquor, VINCENT sits some distance away studying his text book.
text: In the absence of a computer, he practices typing commands on a
text: keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box.
text: A tiny, seedy-looking man, GERMAN, forties, appears from
text: nowhere and takes a seat beside him.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (offering his hand)
dialog: Vincent, I'm German--
dialog: (anticipating Vincent's response)
dialog: That's my name.
text: He looks the apprehensive Vincent up and down.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I think I could do something
dialog: (glancing to the text book)
dialog: provided you know what you're doing
dialog: and you can meet the terms.
text: Vincent pulls a plastic e-money card from his overalls.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: You got a photo of yourself?
text: Vincent produces a snapshot of himself - torn from the family
text: portrait. German feeds the snapshot into the pocket-sized
text: computer he carries. The picture is instantly scanned and
text: appears on the computer's small color screen. German returns
text: the photograph and hastily departs.
text: CAESAR, the elderly janitor, notices German's exit.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (to Vincent)
dialog: I thought I told you not to get any ideas.
text: High up the side of a building, washing windows, VINCENT pauses
text: occasionally to practice typing commands on his cardboard keys -
text: viewing a screen in his imagination - or the nightsky itself.
text: He hears his name being called.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: Vincent...Vincent...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (staring through his glasses)
dialog: German, is that you?
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: Vincent, come down. I've found him.

text: GERMAN leads VINCENT through a maze of corridors.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)

text: He gives a conspiratorial nod to another passing DNA BROKER,
text: both men carrying their palm-top computers.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (enthusiastically reading from data on

text: He has the heart of an ox. He could run
dialog: through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run.
dialog: Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I hope he's not just a body.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: No problem. Before he dropped out he was
dialog: an honor student, the right majors--
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How do I square the accident?
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (still reading data from his
dialog: palm-top computer)
dialog: It happened in Australasia. He checked
dialog: in yesterday. No family complications, no
dialog: record he ever broke his neck. As far as
dialog: anybody's concerned, he's still a walking,
text: talking, fully-productive member of society.
dialog: You just have to get him off the pipe and
dialog: fill in the last two years of his life.
dialog: (correcting himself)
dialog: Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
text: German has stopped walking as if they have arrived.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (looking around for a likely
dialog: candidate but finding none)
dialog: Where is he?
text: German reaches towards a PARAPLEGIC sitting in his wheelchair
text: in the stairwell directly in front of them, his head slumped, an
text: incriminating bong nestled in his lap. German pulls the man's
text: head up by the hair. EUGENE. Depsite the patchy, unkempt
text: beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking
text: similarity to Vincent. Vincent holds a mirror beside the face
text: of the lethargic Eugene to compare his own reflection.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
text: (smiling confidently
dialog: What did I tell you? Which one's the mirror?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (still not fully convinced)
dialog: That's the hair color in his profile?
text: German checks an entry in his computer: <i>"HAIR: BLONDE"</i>
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (touching his own dark strands)
dialog: I'd have to bleach my hair.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (irritated, impatient)
dialog: Why are you inventing problems? You two
dialog: are a couple of goddam clones. You look
dialog: so right together, I want to double my fee.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (a thought occurs, addressing the
dialog: paraplegic for the first time)
dialog: How tall are you?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (deadpan)
text: Four foot six.
text: Vincent grins, realizing that Eugene is referring to his seated
text: height. There is an instant connection between the two men.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (apathetic, still under the
dialog: influence of whatever he's been smoking)
dialog: Six one.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (to German, disappointed)
text: He's too tall.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You can wear lifts.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: There's a way.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTREET SURGERY. NIGHT.
text: In a primitive operating theatre, VINCENT lies on a table, his
text: lower legs masked off for surgery. The SURGEON switches on a
text: surgical saw and lines it up with handdrawn incision marks.
text: Metal struts are ready to elongate his legs.
scene_heading: INT. IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. DAY.
text: GERMAN wheels the dazed EUGENE into the apartment, cluttered
text: with space paraphenalia. One wheel of his rusting wheelchair is
text: flimsily held on with wire. VINCENT follows behind on crutches,
text: both lower legs in casts and cross-braces. Vincent signs the
text: contract German puts in front of him.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE A BAR. DAY.
text: EUGENE, glassy-eyed, strides out of a bar, past camera and into
text: the street. We hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. DAY.
text: EUGENE awakens with a scream, bathed in sweat, arms bound to a
text: bed - the only real piece of furniture in the room. VINCENT,
text: sitting on a crate beside him, soaking a towel in a bowl of
text: water, is taken by surprise. Eugene continues to scream and
text: thrash, fighting against his bindings. Vincent stuffs the towel
text: into Eugene's mouth and holds onto his arms.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued
dialog: a man who was already dead.</i>
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT - BATHROOM. NIGHT.
text: VINCENT holds EUGENE's head over the toilet bowl as he vomits
text: violently. Eugene's paralysis and Vincent's broken legs make
dialog: the operation doubly difficult.
text: Finally Eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit. He
text: drops to the floor in exhaustion. Vincent, also exhausted from
text: the effort of holding Eugene over the bowl, joins him on the
text: broken linoleum. Both men stare up at the ceiling that carries
text: a map of the constellation.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You okay, Jerome?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (ironically referring to
dialog: their mutual immobility)
dialog: Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight?
text: Vincent smiles.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: EUGENE turns his nose up at the plate of boiled meat and
text: potatoes that VINCENT puts in front of him. Vincent catches the
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I think I'd better choose the menu. After all,
dialog: you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning
dialog: how to be <i>you</i>.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Suit yourself.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (trying to be more diplomatic)
dialog: Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful
dialog: --I know you and that little broker--what do you
dialog: call him?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: German.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: You're both going to a lot of trouble--
dialog: (trying to be tactful)
dialog: Maybe you can con somebody into believing
dialog: you're me to get your foot in the door--but
dialog: once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm
dialog: sure you're sincere...
dialog: (glancing to the space paraphenalia)
dialog: ...but I was being groomed for something like
dialog: this myself. Even without the accident I don't
dialog: think I would have made it. My point is--how the
dialog: hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
text: Jerome merely stares back as if the thought of failure has never
dialog: occurred to him.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (shrugs and states it simply)
dialog: I don't know exactly, Jerome.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: At least you're honest.
dialog: (a thought occurs)
dialog: Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're
dialog: going to be Jerome, you may as well start
dialog: getting used to it.
scene_heading: NB: FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SCREENPLAY "VINCENT" IS REFERRED
text: TO AS "JEROME".
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: JEROME looks through Eugene's personal effects, including a
text: photograph album. He is drawn to a swimming medal inside the
text: album at a page displaying a photo of a wealthy, austere
text: MOTHER - Eugene evidently comes from money.
text: Even as he wheels into the room in his rickety wheelchair we see
dialog: that EUGENE has the bearing of someone of good breeding. He has
text: a bag of blood on his lap. More blood is being drawn from his
text: arm through an IV. Eugene catches Jerome looking at the album.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (guiltily closing the book)
dialog: I have to know where you come from.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: If anybody asks, tell them the truth--
dialog: your family disowns you. You are a
dialog: disappointment, Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (referring to Eugene's medal, impressed)
dialog: What about this?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Wrong color. It's silver.
dialog: (tossing the bag of blood to Jerome)
dialog: It's not easy living up to this.
text: Eugene wheels away.

text: replicate Eugene's signature.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (wheeling by, looking over Jerome's
dialog: shoulder at the signature)
dialog: It needs work.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (rueful)
dialog: You had to be a right-hander.

dialog: Noone orders southpaws anymore.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. DAY.
text: A pair of spectacles lie on the bed. JEROME, still wearing his

text: device. GERMAN hovering in the background, an OPTOMETRIST
text: custom-fits JEROME with gossamer thin contact lenses.

scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. DAY.
text: Hair already bleached and cut to match Eugene's hairstyle,
text: JEROME sits in a chair against a hastily erected white paper
text: backdrop. From his wheelchair, EUGENE puts the finishing
text: touches to Jerome's hair. He wheels himself out of the way.
text: The final accomplice in Jerome's deception, a BLACK MARKET
text: COMPUTER GRAPHICS DESIGNER, takes Jerome's photo with a video
text: camera. Manipulating the captured image, the Designer morphs

speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (marvelling at Jerome's earnestness)
dialog: God, you're serious, aren't you?
text: Jerome ignores him. Having learnt his lesson, he hands the
text: envelopes to EUGENE to lick the flaps.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. DAY.
text: JEROME is doing a late-minute cram on a geriatric computer from
text: the late 1990's. Checking the time, Jerome hurriedly picks up
text: the shirt that EUGENE has been ironing from a prone position on
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: It's not too late to back out.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: You don't know what a relief it is not to
dialog: be me. Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
text: Jerome contemplates the question for a moment.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (referring to the bladder bag he wears)
dialog: Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may
dialog: as well pay my rent.
text: Jerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he
text: inserts his urine device for the first time. The new improved
text: Jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA CORPORATION - TESTING LAB. DAY.
text: JEROME emerges from a bathroom and hands a TECHNICIAN his
text: plastic cup full of fraudulent urine and inserts it into the
dialog: analyzer.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (reading off the profile)
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (perplexed)
dialog: What about the interview?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (referring to the cup)
dialog: That was it.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA. DAY.
text: JEROME, scarcely able to disguise his delight, exits Gattaca,
text: trying not to stare at the superb specimens who are now his
dialog: "colleagues".
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
text: The majority of people are now made-to-order.
dialog: What began as a means to rid society of
dialog: inheritable diseases has become a way to design
dialog: your offspring--the line between health and
dialog: enhancement blurred forever. Eyes can always be
text: brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body
dialog: stronger, a life longer. Everyone seeks to give
dialog: their child the best chance but the most skilled
dialog: geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.</i>
text: In a nearby park MODEL CHILDREN from MODEL PARENTS play
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Anyone who is the product of an altered
text: DNA is proudly referred to as a "DAN",
dialog: "self-made man or woman", "man-child". </i>
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: JEROME wheels EUGENE out of their housing project. He takes in
text: the neighborhood for the last time. We focus on a POOR COUPLE
text: cradling an INFANT.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Those parents who, for moral or, more likely
dialog: economic reasons, refrain from tampering with
dialog: their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail
dialog: to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children
dialog: to a life of routine discrimination.</i>
text: We glimpse other PEOPLE in the neighborhood. They appear poor
text: but, for the most part, physically normal. However a pall of
text: gloom hangs over them.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Officially they are called "In-Valids"*. Also
dialog: known as "godchildren", "men-of-god", "faith births",
dialog: "blackjack births", "deficients", "defectives",
dialog: "genojunk", "ge-gnomes", "the fucked-up people".</i>
dialog: [* "IN-VALID" pronounced as in "an invalid license"]
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: They are the "healthy ill". They don't
dialog: actually have anything yet - they may never.
dialog: But since few of the pre-conditions can be
dialog: cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them
dialog: as if they were already sick.</i>
text: As they enter a car, driven by GERMAN, Jerome spies a beautiful
text: young GIRL, 11, sitting on the steps of the housing project,
text: staring forlornly into space. While there is no outward sign of
text: any deficiency, she is somehow aware that she is damaged goods.
text: Jerome glances in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: By means of a donor I have cheated the
dialog: system for the last four years to open doors
dialog: that would otherwise be closed to me.</i>
text: Jerome wheels Eugene into the palatial condominium complex where
text: the two men now reside.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA. PRESENT DAY.
text: We return to JEROME's reflection in the glass. Other GATTACA
text: EMPLOYEES are gradually gathering behind him.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen
text: quickly through the ranks of Gattaca. Only one
dialog: of the Mission Directors has ever come close
dialog: to discovering my true identity.</i>
text: We now see what Jerome has been gazing at through the window
text: the whole time - the sight that has brought a hush to the
text: complex. Through an open office door lies the body of a large
text: man - the MURDERED DIRECTOR, lying where he has just been
text: discovered, in a pool of his own blood.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: Strange to think, he may have more success
dialog: exposing me in death than he did in life.</i>
text: Jerome wipes his eye and also goes to investigate. We focus on
text: an extreme close up of his EYELASH. Loosened by Jerome's hand,
text: it breaks free and floats gently down to the floor where it
text: comes to rest.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION. MORNING.
text: DETECTIVE HUGO, late-forties, wearing a crime-scene hygenic suit
text: and gloves and a full clear mask - looking more like a surgeon
dialog: or a toxic waste worker than a detective - places a blood-
text: spattered computer keyboard alongside the Director's shattered
text: skull. The indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard.
text: Hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and
text: seals the likely murder weapon in a marked, transparent plastic
dialog: bag.
text: A CREW of similarly-suited homicide detectives systematically
text: vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic, industrial-
text: looking mini-vacs. Once each work space has been vacuumed, the
text: transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached, sealed and labelled.
text: OTHER DETECTIVES video the scene with camcorders. Video prints
text: spit out of the cameras for instant inspection.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA - LANDSCAPED GARDENS. DAY.
text: A silicon police tape cordons off the crime scene. From the
text: landscaped garden, a crowd of GATTACA EMPLOYEES view the
text: proceedings through the glass walls.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE 1
text: (staring at the Director's body)
dialog: Awful.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE 2
dialog: Yeah, awful it didn't happen <i>sooner</i>.
text: Nervous smirks from nearby employees. We focus on JEROME.
text: Standing slightly apart from the others, he does not appear to
text: share the joke, or perhaps even hear it. Jerome watches, wide-
text: eyed, as a DETECTIVE approaches his work station with a mini-
text: vac. A chill goes through Jerome as the detective's cleaner
text: passes over his desk.
text: Jerome is distracted by a smear on the window, obstructing his
text: view. Without thinking, he breathes on the glass and rubs the
text: smear away with his elbow. Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR
text: notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's
text: eyes. DIRECTOR JOSEF suddenly appears at Jerome's shoulder.
text: Standing a pace behind the Director, computer notepad in hand,
speaker_heading: is IRENE.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: You're lucky to be getting out of this.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: We're still going ahead as planned?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: The launch window is only open until week's
dialog: end. Tragic though this event may be, it
dialog: hasn't stopped the planets turning.
text: He glances towards a group of Detectives headed by HUGO.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: You'll have to excuse me, Jerome. I have to
dialog: meet with the authorities--naturally, we're
dialog: co-operating in any way, although I won't
dialog: tolerate a major disruption.
dialog: (as he departs)
dialog: I wish I was going with you, Jerome.
text: As the pair depart, Jerome and Irene exchange a glance. Irene
text: is also aware of Jerome's unease.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: We focus on JEROME's eyelash, still lying on the floor.
text: A huge crescent-shaped hair that fills the screen. Suddenly
text: there is a roar of a mini-vac and the eyelash is sucked up. We
text: follow the eyelash's journey, down the throat of the cleaner
text: into the specimen bag where it is sucked against the bag's
text: clear, plastic wall.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX. DAY.
text: The DIRECTOR's corpse is sealed in a plastic bodybag and wheeled
text: away on a gurney. The blood and other body matter from the
text: murder scene is sucked up by a portable wet-vac and the sample
text: bag appropriately labeled.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA - COURTYARD CAFETERIA. DAY
text: A chime sounds over the P.A. follwed by an announcement.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (OC)
dialog: Thank you for your co-operation. Please
dialog: return to your work stations immediately.
text: The PROGRAMMERS get to their feet en masse and begin filing into
dialog: the work room.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE 3
dialog: (sarcastic aside)
dialog: What, no counselling?
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA COMPUTER COMPLEX - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.
text: A WOMAN ASSISTANT whose keyboard was used in the attack has to
text: pause as a MAINTENANCE WORKER gives her work station a final
text: spray to return it to its former pristine condition. A new
text: keyboard is plugged into her monitor to replace the one taken as
dialog: evidence.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA COMPUTER COMPLEX. DAY.
text: JEROME opens his desk drawer to check his comb, now plucked
text: completely clean. He carefully places two of Eugene's hairs to
text: the comb and scatters another bag of fraudulent matter around
dialog: his work station.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - SIMULATOR ROOM. DAY.
text: In a large, bare room a simulator does a slow dance back and
text: forth on its hydralic legs, miming the path of the space
text: craft Jerome will soon be aboard. The simulation ends and
text: JEROME exits the simulator through a small door. IRENE
text: hesitantly approaches, carrying a slim electronic tablet.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Excuse me, Jerome. I'm sorry to bother you.
text: Jerome turns, not displeased by the interruption.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: No bother.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (referring to her notepad)
dialog: I've been asked to compile a log for the
dialog: investigators--they want to know everyone's
dialog: whereabouts last night.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Last night? I was at home.
text: Irene makes a note with her stylus.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.
text: Irene makes another note.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (wry smile)
dialog: Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about
dialog: <i>you?</i> Where were you last night?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I was at home.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Were <i>you</i> alone?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: So we don't know for sure about you, either.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (wary, wondering where the
dialog: conversation is headed)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Why don't we say we were together?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Why would we do that?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I have better things to do this week than
dialog: answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot.
dialog: Don't you?
text: Irene contemplates the question.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (gently pressing)
dialog: Well, shall we say we spent the evening together?
text: Irene is still unsure whether or not Jerome is serious.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know
dialog: what that was like.
text: Irene turns and departs. Jerome watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: The paraplegic EUGENE, seated by the window, meticulously cuts
text: a long fingernail into numerous clippings. He places the
text: clippings in small plastic bags and seals them. He then begins
text: to fill tiny sachets with blood. He turns as he hears JEROME
text: enter down the spiral staircase with the groceries.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: You didn't forget the truffles?
text: JEROME places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and
text: retrieves a bottle of vodka - the vodka incongruous-looking
text: beside the blood and urine specimens. Joining Eugene at his
text: workbench, he pours them both a drink.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (sensing something amiss, trying
dialog: to keep his humor)
dialog: Who died?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: The Mission Director.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (misinterpreting the deadpan remark)
dialog: You wish.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: They found him in his office this morning--
text: beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
text: Eugene takes in the news, a smile broadening across his face.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: What an act of benevolence--a service to the
dialog: community. So that's it. Now there's nothing
dialog: between you and ignition.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: He was still warm when they confirmed.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (confused by Jerome's attitude)
dialog: This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: The place is crawling with Hoovers.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
text: Jerome shoots him a glance for the inappropriate remark.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: That's not the point.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the
dialog: "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--
dialog: (glancing up to the night sky)
dialog: you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.
dialog: (gently chiding)
dialog: Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (still tempering Eugene's enthusiasm)
dialog: You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got
dialog: my final physical tomorrow.
text: Jerome wheels Eugene's chair to a specially constructed platform
text: that allows the wheels to spin in mid-air. Jerome tapes an
text: electrode to Eugene's chest and attaches the wire to a slim
text: recording device. Eugene begins to spin the wheel of the chair
text: faster and faster. Jerome monitors Eugene's steady heartbeat
text: through a set of headphones.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - COMPUTER COMPLEX. NIGHT.
text: The complex is virtually empty - only a handful of the hundreds
text: of PROGRAMMERS working late into the night. IRENE approaches
text: JEROME's work station on the pretext of delivering some
text: documents. Trying to act casually, she looks under the papers
text: on his desk, then opens the top desk drawer.
text: We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the comb lying there - the two
text: hairs trapped between the teeth of the comb. Irene removes one
text: of the follicles and drops it into an envelope she is carrying.
scene_heading: INT. 24-HOUR SEQUENCING LAB. NIGHT.
text: "SEQUENCING-WHILE-U-WAIT". Similar to a 1-hour photo lab, the
text: store - little more than a booth - displays a price list on the
text: wall. "FULL SEQUENCE - $80". IRENE waits in line with a cross-
text: section of other CUSTOMERS. She checks the contents of the
text: envelope that contains the hair.
text: The YOUNG WOMAN in line ahead of her allows the TECHNICIAN to
text: take a swab from her full lips with a Q-tip.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: How old?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: <i>Me?</i>
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (mustering patience, referring
dialog: to the Q-tip)
dialog: The <i>specimen</i>.
speaker_heading: YOUUNG WOMAN
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: I kissed him five minutes ago. A real good one.
text: Overhearing, several PEOPLE in the line snicker.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (long-suffering)
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
text: The technician hands the swab to an ASSISTANT. The Young Woman
text: is handed a number and takes a seat. Irene hands her envelope
text: over the counter. She too is handed a number. We follow
text: Jerome's follicle as another TECHNICIAN places it in an
text: analyzing machine.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. SEQUENCING LAB / PARKING LOT. NIGHT.
text: The TECHNICIAN returns the envelope to IRENE along with a
text: miniature compact disc.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: (remarking on the profile result)
dialog: 9.4...very nice.
text: Irene does not appear to share the technician's enthusiasm.
text: She emerges from the sequencing lab and enters her car. Taking
text: a palm-top computer from her purse, she inserts the disc into
text: the computer. Jerome's counterfeit genetic profile appears on
text: the screen. The details confirm her worst fears.
scene_heading: EXT. MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB. NIGHT.
text: JEROME and EUGENE, dressed to the nines, pull up in the car
text: to a darkened doorway in a poorly lit street. A VALET appears
text: out of the shadows. Familiar with the car, he goes immediately
text: to the trunk to retrieve Eugene's collapsible wheelchair.
text: Jerome tips the valet - a credit card wiped through a device.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB. NIGHT.
text: The chic, elegant establishment inside belies its darkened
text: exterior. JEROME wheels EUGENE into a decadent dinner club
text: full of an odd assortment of people. They are immediately
text: greeted respectfully by MICHAEL, the owner and maitre d'.
text: Jerome and Eugene are obviously regulars.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Good evening, gentlemen. Your table is ready.
dialog: (referring to Jerome's mission)
dialog: Not long now, sir. You'll be upstairs
dialog: before you know it. We're going to miss you.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff.
dialog: I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB. NIGHT.
text: In a secluded booth JEROME and EUGENE toast from a bottle of
text: 1999 vintage Bordeaux. Eugene drinks longer than Jerome.
text: Jerome dabs his mouth with a napkin. He fails to notice a
text: minute FLAKE OF SKIN dislodged from his chin. We follow the
text: flake as it comes to rest beneath the table.
text: LATER, Eugene and Jerome watch COUPLES dancing a samba on the
text: dance floor. A WAITER vacuums the table with a discreet,
text: handheld miniature vacuum while a WAITRESS clears the plates.
text: She accidentally drops a knife onto Eugene's leg.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
text: (aghast at the sight of his lifeless legs)
dialog: I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (smiling, a trace of bitterness)
dialog: Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured.
text: Eugene, the worse for drink, gropes for the waitress's leg but
text: she easily avoids his clumsy pass.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: You want to meet a real-life spaceman?
text: Jerome, always aware, scanning the club, suddenly spies
text: NAPOLEON, his Gattaca colleague, on the other side of the
text: room. Napoleon is taking a hit from a vial concealed in his
text: hand. Jerome abruptly turns his back to avoid being recognized.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Let's get out of here.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (knocking back his drink,
dialog: misinterpreting the hasty departure)
dialog: You're right, there's more atmosphere
dialog: where you're going.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CAR. NIGHT.
text: Driving along the freeway, Jerome's car suddenly dives down an
text: escape road. EUGENE looks sideways at JEROME.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You drive.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CAR. NIGHT.
text: The car careens around and around a small circular building -
text: a cloud of dust billowing up behind the car. We focus on a
text: BRICK wedged against the car's gas pedal.
text: EUGENE is at the wheel, JEROME in the passenger seat.
text: The hard turn is repeated with increasing recklessness, Eugene
text: fighting to control the bucking car.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (screaming in both fear and exhilaration)
dialog: I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Keep going!! Keep going!!
text: Finally the car spins to a halt in a cloud of dust. When the
text: dust settles it is revealed that they have been circling the
text: base of a huge satellite dish in a desolate location.
scene_heading: EXT. SATELLITE DISH. NIGHT.
text: EUGENE lies on the hood of the car, leaning against the
text: windshield, drinking from a bottle of vodka. In the
text: background, the unmanned satellite dish. JEROME relieves
text: himself against the building at the base of the satellite.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (gently chiding Jerome over the joyride)
dialog: You idiot. You could ruin everything
dialog: with a stunt like that.
text: Eugene spies a spacecraft launching from Gattaca city.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (gazing up into the night sky)
dialog: At least up there your piss will be worth something.
dialog: (smiling at the thought)
dialog: You'll all be showering in it, right?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (zipping his fly)
dialog: And drinking it. It's like Evian by the
dialog: time it's filtered.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (referring to the rocket ship)
dialog: What <i>is</i> that one?
text: Jerome doesn't bother to look in the direction of the craft but
text: merely glances to his watch. He joins Eugene on the hood of the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (looking at his watch)
text: 11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: How long do you stay up there before you go?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: A day or so.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: I still can't believe they're sending you to
dialog: the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be
text: born, on a mission to discover the origin
dialog: of life.
text: Eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You should be going instead of me.
text: Jerome taps Eugene's lifeless legs with his foot.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (glancing heavenwards, shaking his head)
dialog: You know I'm scared of heights.
scene_heading: INT. CRIME LABORATORY - AUTOPSY ROOM. NIGHT.
text: The body and clothing of the MISSION DIRECTOR, lying on a metal
text: examining table is scanned with a blue-light magnifying
text: instrument. Fingernail specimens are taken for analysis. In
text: another area of the laboratory, the labelled vacuum bags are
text: attached to analyzers and the contents sucked out and
text: automatically identified. ID names and photographs of GATTACA
text: EMPLOYEES begin appearing on a computer screen at high speed
dialog: along with other personal details - all data automatically
dialog: logged for later review.
text: The photographs and personal details of JEROME and IRENE flash
text: past, amongst the faces of other employees.
text: We focus on a magnified close up of JEROME'S EYELASH, still
text: clinging stubbornly to the side of its specimen bag. We
text: continue to follow its journey as it is finally sucked into the
dialog: analyzer.
scene_heading: INT. CRIME LAB - ANALYZER MACHINE. NIGHT.
text: Inside the machine, a minute, cell-thin sliver is sliced from
text: JEROME'S EYELASH and analyzed.
scene_heading: INT. INVESTIGATOR'S CRIME LAB. NIGHT.
text: A severed HUMAN TONGUE sits on a tray in a sterile, sealed
text: chamber. Using gloves that protrude through the chamber's glass
text: wall, face buried in a binocular eyepiece, the INVESTIGATOR
text: takes a swab from the tongue.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
text: (to the tongue, as he inserts the
text: tip of the swab into an analyzer)
dialog: Let's see what you've got to say for yourself.
text: A FEMALE ASSISTANT, looking on, hardly has time to smile at the
text: remark before information begins to appear on a nearby computer
text: terminal. The computer gradually builds a portrait of the owner
dialog: of the tongue using genetic predictors. The Investigator
text: wanders over to the window as his Assistant reads the
text: information from the screen.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
text: The tongue is male. Mature. Blonse hair.
text: Brown eyes. Light complexion. Between
dialog: 5'11 and 6'1. Pronounced Caucasian nose.
text: Thin lips. Weak chin. Lobeless ears.
text: Prematurely balding. Slightly bow-legged.
text: Broad shoulders. Barrel chest...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Blind.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (interest piqued)
dialog: <i>Blind?</i>
dialog: (mildly amused, checking the
dialog: monitor for himself)
dialog: The tongue is <i>blind?</i>
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Someone who is mindful that the blind
dialog: still speak.
text: The INVESTIGATOR is alerted by the chime of his nearby computer.
text: On the screen, he discovers the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT
text: and the accompanying flashing message: <i>TRACKING IN-VALID
scene_heading: 883000181105-10 - NEW DATA -</i>
scene_heading: INT. CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX - PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT.
text: Having plugged his car into an overnight charger, JEROME pushes
text: EUGENE in his wheelchair to the elevator. Bottle in hand,
text: Eugene leans over and vomits on the ground. Jerome shakes his
text: head resignedly. Eugene looks drunkenly up at Jerome.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit)
dialog: I'm sorry. Did you want it?
text: Jerome meets Eugene's gaze. There is a trace of bitterness
text: in Eugene's drunken smile.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Let me get it for you.
text: Eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the
text: elevator arrives and Jerome quickly wheels him away. Eugene's
text: head flops to the side as he passes out.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: JEROME unlocks EUGENE's condo and wheels his chair inside. We
text: see their reflection in a full-length mirror as Jerome pushes
text: Eugene to the bedroom. After removing Eugene's soiled clothing,
text: he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (maudlin, sobbing like a child)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (attempting to comfort)
dialog: It's okay, Eugene.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was
dialog: doing when I walked in front of that car--
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: --What car?--Go to sleep.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: --I walked right in front of it. I was never
dialog: more sober in my life.
text: Jerome looks at Eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his
text: shock at the revelation.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (grabbing Jerome by the collar)
dialog: I'm proud of you, Vincent.
text: Eugene's head falls back onto the pillow.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (smiling to himself)
dialog: You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
text: But Eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again.
text: Jerome pulls a blanket over him.
text: On the verge of leaving, Jerome's attention is drawn to a wall
text: on the far side of the room. Approaching the wall, near
text: Eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir
text: coming from inside the adjacent condominium. Jerome
text: contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead
text: - climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: JEROME fastidiously vacuums with an upright cleaner. Using a
text: hose attachment he cleans around a picture frame that contains
text: Jerome's original computer keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a
text: cardboard box.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX. DAY.
text: In the vast room of COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS we pull-focus to
dialog: discover that we have been filming the complex through the
text: transparent specimen bag containing JEROME'S EYELASH.
text: On the mezzanine floor overlooking the scene of the crime,
text: the INVESTIGATOR holds the bag, transfixed by the lash. The
text: lead homicide detective, DETECTIVE HUGO, finishes interviewing
text: a GATTACA SECURITY GUARD and approaches the Investigator.
text: A large telescope in the background.
text: Although Hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior, his
text: body language betrays his displeasure. Hugo clearly does not
text: relish the Investigator's involvement in his case.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: I don't understand why you were dragged out
dialog: here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your
dialog: time--a no-nothing case like this.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (gently rebuking his subordinate)
text: A man's dead, Detective.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log,
dialog: alibis, grudges...
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Grudges?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (looking out over the balcony)
text: I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes.
dialog: The Director was not...
dialog: (searching for the words)
dialog: ...universally loved. He was leading the
dialog: cut-backs in the program. You're looking at
text: a room full of motives.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
text: (shaking his head adamantly,
text: referring to the bag in his hand)
dialog: No, <i>this</i> is your man.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (not so convinced)
dialog: With respect, Sir--it may be the only
dialog: unaccountable specimen but the profile
dialog: suggests--
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: --What <i>about</i> his profile?
text: Hugo refers to a print-out of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT's profile
text: including his Genetic Quotient. (The fifteen-year-old photo of
text: Vincent now bears little resemblance to his assumed identity.)
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital
dialog: heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen
dialog: has been here but there's an 80 percent chance
dialog: the owner of that eyelash has already died
dialog: himself from natural causes.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (terse)
dialog: So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
text: Detective Hugo goes to comment further, then revises his
text: remark in his head before speaking.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it
dialog: likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: No. Not <i>likely</i>.
text: The Investigator's tone suggests that the identity of the
text: culprit is no longer a matter for debate. There is an awkward
text: pause before the Detective falls into step with his superior.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: I take it you're thinking along the lines of a
dialog: robbery gone sour--a thief disturbed in the act?
text: The Investigator merely shrugs.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Of course that doesn't jibe with what we
text: found. This was an angry killing.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
text: (glancing to the profile in Hugo's hand)
dialog: Who knows with these "deficients"? His profile
text: indicates a proclivity for violence.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (trying to appear co-operative)
dialog: I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for
dialog: any family or associate connections--
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: --I've already run it. There's no record
dialog: of any living relative.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: What a pity.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (irritated, glancing to the sample bag)
dialog: Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and
dialog: found. All we have to do is locate the man who's
dialog: minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
text: We focus on JEROME at his work station. Although he continues
text: to work, he clrarly feels the presence of the INVESTIGATORS on
text: the mezzanine floor behind him.
text: A MEDICAL DIRECTOR approaches the programmer in the neighboring
text: work station - NAPOLEON, the programmer Jerome encountered in
dialog: the nightclub the previous evening.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL DIRECTOR
dialog: Napoleon, you're late for your substance test.
text: Napoleon looks up, ashen-faced. Jerome intervenes.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Director, Napoleon's helping me today.
text: The Director regards both men suspiciously.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL DIRECTOR
dialog: Well, you take it <i>for</i> him, Jerome.
text: The Medical Director departs. Napoleon, stunned by the
text: reprieve, approaches Jerome's work station and pretends to
text: study the program on his computer screen.
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON
dialog: Why did you do that?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (exiting to the testing lab)
dialog: Don't worry about it.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - TESTING LAB. DAY.
text: From behind we observe JEROME standing in front of LAMAR,
text: issuing forth his steady stream of fraudulent urine.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - WORKOUT CENTER. DAY.
text: Twenty GATTACA EMPLOYEES, identically-outfitted men and women,
text: run in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake of
text: the picturesque grounds, never getting any closer to their goal.
text: They run at a steady 10mph on twenty identical state-of-the-art
text: treadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a
text: uniform row facing a floor to ceiling window. The strain is
text: beginning to show on many of the faces. The heartrate of each
text: employee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the
dialog: chest.
text: Outside in the sunshine the next batch of twenty EMPLOYEES
text: limbers up in readiness for their physical. JEROME's only
text: preparation consists of thoughtfully dragging on a
text: cigarette while staring out at the man-made lake. His
text: nonchalant attitude disheartens nearby colleagues, including
text: IRENE who is amongst a group of workers excused from the run
text: by benevolent, over-protective TRAINERS.
speaker_heading: TRAINER
dialog: You're excused, Irene. You may resume your duties.
text: On the way into the work-out facility Jerome stubs out his
text: cigarette in a stainless steel ashtray. Only we are aware of
text: the slim credit card-sized recording device that he furtively
text: slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand. As he
text: takes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the
text: cordless electrode to his chest, Jerome surreptitiously attaches
text: his device to the underside of the running machine's control
dialog: panel.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - WORK-OUT OBSERVATION ROOM. DAY.
text: From a mezzanine floor above the work-out room, LAMAR, the
text: medical officer, monitors computer read-outs displaying the
text: pace and pulse of the runners on each treadmill machine.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - WORK-OUT CENTER. DAY.
text: One by one the GATTACA EMPLOYEES drop out until JEROME is the
text: sole remaining runner. Several of the other employees stand
text: around and watch Jerome run as they towel off.
text: He appears under little duress, staring directly ahead,
text: seemingly in a trance. As we focus on his chest, only we are
text: aware of the sound of his furiously pounding heart making a lie
text: of his calm exterior.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - WORK-OUT OBSERVATION ROOM. DAY.
text: Jerome's heart registers a far more measured beat on the
text: computer in the observation room. The DIRECTOR is at LAMAR's
text: shoulder, beaming proudly.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (marveling at Jerome's heartrate)
text: Six miles later it's still beating like a
dialog: Goddamn metronome. I could play piano by that
dialog: heartbeat of his.
text: The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO enter the observation room,
text: escorted by IRENE.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: Director Josef, this is our lead Investigator.
text: The two men exchange a polite handshake. However the
text: Investigator is immediately taken with the SOLE RUNNER with his
text: back to him, on the treadmill below.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: How often do you test, Director?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: Often.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Surely you know what you have.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: We have to be certain. Once they're up, we
dialog: can hardly turn the boat around.
text: On the treadmill below, Jerome glances to his watch as he runs,
text: the distress starting to show. Caught up in the conversation,
text: Lamar has forgotten to end the work-out. Remembering, he
text: finally presses the "WARM-DOWN" button, slowing the treadmill.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (still marveling at Jerome)
dialog: I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd
dialog: still be there.
text: We focus on Jerome's recording device attached to the bottom of
text: the control panel. It clicks to a stop, indicating that the
text: bogus heartbeat recording has ended before the workout.
text: The heartbeat monitor in the observation room suddenly races
text: from 80 to 250 beats per minute. Lamar catches the discrepancy
text: out of the corner of his eye but before he can take a second
text: look, Jerome has whipped his electrode from his chest. The
text: physician shrugs it off as a glitch in the machine.
text: The Investigator has turned his back on Jerome to face the
dialog: Director.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: We believe we have a suspect.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: What a relief.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (referring to the profile of VINCENT
text: on Hugo's computer notepad)
text: This unaccountable specimen was found in
text: the south wing corridor.
text: In the room below, Jerome nonchalantly steps off the treadmill,
text: stealthily retrieves the recording device from beneath the
text: control panel and returns it to his cigarette pack.
text: He casually wipes off drops of sweat from the machine with a
text: towel, briefly glances to Irene with the Investigators and exits
text: to the locker room.
text: The Director idly regards the image of VINCENT on Hugo's
text: handheld screen. He does not recognize the face.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
text: An age enhancement is being prepared as
dialog: we speak.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: (referring to his assistant)
dialog: Irene will make it available to security.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - LOCKER ROOM. DAY.
text: JEROME wears his assured smile all the way along the corridor
text: and into the now empty locker room. He exchanges a cheery
text: greeting with an exiting COLLEAGUE, enters a shower stall,
text: closes the door behind him and promptly collapses on the shower
dialog: stall floor.
text: The effects of the gruelling work-out are only now apparent. No
text: longer sucking up the pain, he gulps air into his oxygen-starved
text: lungs, his heart looking for a way through his tightened chest.
text: He writhes in agony on the white-tiled floor - a brutal reminder
text: of the physical frailty he seeks to disguise.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA - GARDEN. LUNCHTIME.
text: In Gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens JEROME, dressed and
text: recovered from his ordeal, joins his COLLEAGUES for lunch at one
text: of the umbrella-covered tables. While most of the others pick
text: at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication,
text: Jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray.
text: The sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from
text: his colleagues. Jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by
text: liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat.
text: However when Jerome looks over towards IRENE, she avoids eye
text: contact. When she abruptly gets up and leaves, Jerome follows -
text: thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby
text: trashcan. A janitor reaches for the napkin. It is the Old
text: Janitor, CAESAR, from Jerome's former life.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.
text: The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA - WIND FARM. AFTERNOON.
text: A forest of wind turbines, supplying energy to the aerospace
text: complex. However the blades of the turbines are motionless in
text: the still afternoon. JEROME finally catches up with IRENE. She
text: turns, unsurprised by his appearance. Standing beside her, he
text: looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (eyes fixed on the view)
dialog: We were looking at each other. You stopped.
text: Irene, also keeps her gaze ahead.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (shrugging as if it makes
dialog: no difference to him)
dialog: We were just looking.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I know about you.
text: Jerome turns to her, startled, trying to read her face. Irene
text: takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long, dark hair from
dialog: her head.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (offering the hair to Jerome)
dialog: Here, take it.
text: Jerome, confused, takes the hair - more in reflex than intent.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (a challenge)
dialog: If you're still interested, let me know.
text: Jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment, then
text: deliberately lets it fall to the grounf.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (never taking his eyes from her)
dialog: Sorry, the wind caught it.
text: Irene meets his gaze. There is not a breath of wind. The
text: hair lies, plainly visible on the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA AEROSPACE COMPLEX. AFTERNOON.
text: As JEROME and IRENE walk between the wind turbines, Jerome
text: pretends not to notice that Irene keeps furtively checking the
text: pulse on her wrist. They pause in the shade.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (as if making conversation)
dialog: Have they found our friend?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Friend?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: It was a mercy-killing after all.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: They found an eyelash.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: In the South Wing.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Does it have a name?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Just some In-Valid. Vincent--
dialog: (trying to come up with the last name)
dialog: --somebody.
text: Jerome turns away to disguise his alarm. He quickly recovers.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: (a smile playing around her lips)
dialog: You celebrate, Jerome?
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDO. NIGHT.
text: EUGENE talks irritably on the phone, examining a container from
text: a newly opened case of hair bleach.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: --I know what I ordered. I ordered "Honey
dialog: Dawn" and you sent me "Summer Wheat".
text: JEROME descends the staircase, taking the steps two at a time.
text: He immediately goes to the refrigerator, removing trays of
text: samples. Eugene abruptly hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: JEROME (OC)
dialog: Call German.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Any particular reason?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (collecting up sample bags from
dialog: the work bench)
dialog: We can't stay here.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: They think I offed the Director.
text: Eugene wheels himself over to Jerome, unconcerned.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: What makes them think that?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: They found my eyelash.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (a flicker of anxiety)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: In a corridor.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (blasÈ once again)
dialog: Could be worse. They could have found
dialog: it in your eye.
text: Jerome half-smiles despite the situation.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (resuming his collection of samples)
dialog: Come on--we're taking off.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go.
dialog: Not on your life--
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: --You don't understand, they'll make the
dialog: connection, they'll hoover again. We should
dialog: cut our losses.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (angrily grabbing a tray from Jerome's hands)
dialog: Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting
dialog: like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash
dialog: to you. They won't believe that one of their
dialog: elite navigators could have suckered them for the
dialog: last five years.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: They'll recognize me.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: How could they recognize you?
dialog: (referring to the torn photo of
text: 20-year-old Vincent on the wall)
dialog: <i>I</i> don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a
dialog: choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession,
dialog: turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out--
dialog: find out what we can but change nothing. This is
dialog: a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken
dialog: worse heat than this.
dialog: (angry now)
dialog: Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go
dialog: belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I
dialog: wouldn't have bothered. You can't quit on me
dialog: now. I've put too much into this.
dialog: (returning the samples to the fridge)
dialog: Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>. I had other offers,
dialog: you know. I could have rented myself out to
dialog: somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in
dialog: there and finish the job myself?
dialog: (meeting Jerome's gaze)
dialog: We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like
dialog: we planned.
text: Jerome slumps down in a chair, Eugene's tirade starting to get
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: And keep your lashes on your lids where
dialog: they belong. How could you be so careless?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (reluctant admission)
dialog: I think I was crying.
text: Eugene is uncomfortable at the notion.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Well save those tears.
text: Jerome shrugs awkwardly and pours them both a drink.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You really had other offers?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I'm sure I could have.
scene_heading: INT. CONDOMINIUM - INCINERATOR. NIGHT.
text: The naked JEROME scrapes away at his skin with even greater
text: ferocity than usual. After exiting the incinerator, he deposits
text: all the incriminating trash he has collected during the day into
text: the furnace and ignites the gas.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: From outside, a car horn sounds. JEROME, in a formal suit and
text: spectacles, abruptly enters the condominium. He goes to a
text: closet and starts searching through Eugene's clothes.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Mind if I borrow a tie?
text: EUGENE is more interested in the car parked outside the
text: condominium. IRENE sits in a convertible Citroen DS, dressed in
text: a classic but provocative black suit. Unaware that she is being
text: observed she touches up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: So it's not just the Hoovers who've got
dialog: you rattled.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You're the one who said not to change anything.
dialog: She's my ear to the investigation.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I've got enough on my mind without that.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: If you say so.
dialog: (referring to the ties in Jerome's hand)
dialog: The stripe.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (agreeing with the selection)
dialog: Good choice.
text: Jerome fumbles with the knot. From his chair, Eugene knots
text: Jerome's tie for him. Jerome is intrigued that for once Eugene
text: is abstaining - he has not touched his drink.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Not thirsty?
dialog: (referring to the fridge)
dialog: We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I don't feel too good. I think I'm still
dialog: drunk from last night.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Never stopped you before.
dialog: (regarding Eugene's head)
dialog: And for God's sake stop plucking your hair.
dialog: Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure
dialog: you wouldn't go bald.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: If I were you I'd worry about myself.
dialog: (nodding to Jerome's spectacles)
dialog: Haven't you forgotten something?
text: Jerome pockets the spectacles and enters the bathroom for his
text: contact lenses. The horn sounds outside the window a second
text: time and Jerome hastily exits. We stay with Eugene. Irene
text: catches a glimpse of him before he moves away from the window.
text: Jerome emerges from the building.
text: As the couple drive away, Eugene wheels himself to the full
text: length mirror. He regards his own reflection for a moment and
text: opens the mirror - a disguised door opening into the adjacent
text: apartment. A cloud of condensed water vapor billows out.
text: GERMAN, the DNA Broker, emerges with an ENGINEER.
text: He sends the engineer on his way and joins Eugene at his desk.
text: Eugene hands German a credit card that he wipes through his
dialog: computer.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: We still need to overhaul the back-up generator.
dialog: (fixing Eugene with a penetrating stare)
dialog: What's going on, Eugene, I thought he was going
dialog: away, not you--you going on vacation?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: You got it, German.
speaker_heading: GERMAN
dialog: (nodding thoughtfully)
dialog: You deserve it.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM. NIGHT.
text: JEROME and IRENE step over feet, apologizing as they go,
text: eventually finding their seats in a box in a sold-out concert
dialog: hall.
text: On the stage below, a YOUNG PIANIST - a teenage prodigy - has
text: already taken his place at the keys of a grand piano. The
text: pianist removes his white gloves and begins to play - an
dialog: extremely complex and beautiful piece we have never heard
text: before. IRENE looks to JEROME. He is clearly caught up in the
dialog: music.
scene_heading: EXT. IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT. NIGHT.
text: The music from the piano recital continues under the following
text: contrasting action. A huge, brooding housing project. PEOPLE
text: hang around on street corners. Menace in the air - a feeling of
text: impending violence.
text: Suddenly unmarked police cars appear from all directions,
text: blocking any escape route. Dozens of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES
text: pour out of the cars and onto the street.
text: People scatter, many running straight into the arms of the
text: Detectives. OTHERS, spilling out of the housing project, are
text: also immediately apprehended.
text: The Detectives quickly weed out those suspects not fitting
text: Jerome's description - WOMEN, OLD MEN and TEENAGERS. They are
text: shepherded off the street. A line of IN-VALIDS is formed
text: several hundred yards long. Detectives begin to laboriously
text: move along the line, taking finger-prick blood samples from each
text: suspect - instantly confirming their identities with portable
text: analyzers worn on their hips.
text: As if having the idea at the same time, TWO SEPARATE MEN
text: suddenly bolt from the line, knowing that their blood will
text: incriminate them. Other Detectives, watching for such escape
text: attempts, esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting
text: police van.
text: With the raid under control, DETECTIVE HUGO indicates to the
text: INVESTIGATOR that it is safe to exit his car. The Investigator
text: appears irritated, only half-glancing at the TWO MEN already in
text: custody, apparently certain that neither one is his suspect.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (enthusiastic)
dialog: Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.
text: The Investigator clearly does not share Hugo's enthusiasm. The
text: Detective offers the Investigator an age enhanced photograph,
text: computer-generated from the last existing photo of VINCENT as
text: a 20-year-old.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: This is the age enhancement we're working with.
text: The Investigator ignores the photo, preferring instead to trust
text: his own eye as he wanders along the line of suspects.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (referring to the line-up)
dialog: As you requested, we've kept the parameters
text: wider than usual.
text: The MEN they scrutinize are hardly mutants - the differences
text: between an IN-VALID and a DAN are subtle at best. Some shorter,
text: some wearing glasses, some with receding hairlines or bald, many
dialog: with no discernable physical difference at all. The
text: Investigator is only halfway down the line before he turns and
text: starts walking back to his car.
text: The mystified Detective Hugo follows his superior.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
text: The Investigator wheels on Hugo, suddenly angry, clearly unused
dialog: to having his judgement questioned.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: --There's that word again. I have a feeling
dialog: This man doesn't play the odds, Detective. Not
dialog: exactly a slave to probability. Is it "likely"
text: that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for
dialog: fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come
dialog: to us now like a lamb?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (taken aback by the outburst)
dialog: Is there something more we should know about this
dialog: suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid
text: have shown up at the scene of four serious
dialog: felonies. Do you need any more than that?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent
dialog: citizens have left specimens at as many crime
text: scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile
dialog: radius around Gattaca. Hoover some of the classier
text: establishments. Random car stops.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: We're already getting complaints about
dialog: frivolous search.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: This is a murder investigation. The public
dialog: should be happy to co-operate, to get this
dialog: disease off the streets.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL. NIGHT.
text: A standing ovation. The YOUNG PIANIST on the stage bows deeply,
text: soaking up the applause of the AUDIENCE. The pianist tosses one
text: of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an
text: adoring FAN. The second glove he tosses up to the box where
text: JEROME and IRENE are standing. Jerome snares the glove out of
text: the air and immediately hands it to Irene. She promptly slips
text: the glove on her own hand.
text: The glove fits snugly over her five fingers. However one finger
text: of the glove remains unfilled. Jerome is stunned to realize
text: that it is a six-fingered glove.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (catching his look of astonishment)
dialog: You didn't know?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (trying hard to convince)
dialog: Yes...<i>yes</i>...
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (picking up a resentment, confused)
dialog: You're angry--
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Why would I be angry? It was beautiful.
text: He quickly turns away to lead the applause. On stage, the
text: pianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd. Both his
text: hands contain a perfectly formed extra finger.
scene_heading: INT. IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - PROSTITUTE'S BOUDOIR. NIGHT.
text: From an upstairs window we observe the INVESTIGATOR's car
text: cruise slowly back into the squalid housing project. A MAN is
text: buckling his pants at the window.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Shit! One of those Hoovers is back.
text: A prostitute, VALERIE, a slender, sylphlike beauty, joins him at
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: It's alright. He's here to see me.
text: Her client looks at her askance. Despite her assurances, he
text: hurries into his clothes anyway.
speaker_heading: VALERIE
text: (to an unseen woman in the next room)
dialog: Sonja, I can't see anyone else tonight.
scene_heading: INT. IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - PROSTITUTE'S BOUDOIR. NIGHT.
text: The INVESTIGATOR, sits up in the bed, glass in his hand.
text: VALERIE lies on the tangled sheets, naked, making no effort to
text: cover herself. She regards the Investigator curiously.
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: I don't understand you, Investigator.
text: The Investigator glances idly in her direction.
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: (teasing good-naturedly)
dialog: You hunt us by day and fuck us by night. Do
dialog: you only get it up for In-valids?
text: The Investigator smiles and rejoins her on the bed.
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Wouldn't you be happier with one of your
dialog: made-to-order whores?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (gently stroking her hair)
dialog: You are so beautiful, are you sure you <i>weren't</i>
dialog: altered? This is not the face, the body, of
dialog: a Godchild. How could something so lovely
dialog: be a product of chance?
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Is that what keeps you coming back?
dialog: (meeting his gaze)
dialog: Look at you. Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes.
dialog: Do you ever wonder what they would see if they
dialog: weren't quite so perfect? They will never see
dialog: what <i>I</i> see.
text: The Investigator tries to laugh off her assertion but his
text: tight-lipped smile betrays his displeasure.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (a cruel edge to his voice)
dialog: You have so much wrong with you, you'll
dialog: be lucky to see next year.
text: He roughly forces himself on top of her but she remains defiant.
speaker_heading: VALERIE
dialog: Are you so much more alive, Investigator?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (parting her legs)
dialog: I'm not paying you to talk.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. IRENE'S CAR. NIGHT.
text: IRENE drives, JEROME at her side. Cars are being flagged down
text: by uniformed POLICE OFFICERS. Irene slows down behind the car
text: in front. Spying an OFFICER shine a flashlight in the eyes of
text: the MALE DRIVER up ahead, Jerome wipes the contact lenses from
text: his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger window when Irene
text: is not looking.
text: An OFFICER approaches Jerome and, without a word, opens an
text: electronic testing kit worn on his hip. He removes a sterilized
text: Q-tip and motions for Jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape
text: a culture. Jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth,
text: feigning embarrassment.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (conspiratorial)
dialog: Better not.
dialog: (nodding in Irene's direction)
dialog: Don't want to give you a contaminated
dialog: specimen...if you get my meaning.
text: IRENE plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop.
text: We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of Jerome's hand as he furtively
text: retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff. With the
text: hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from
text: his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment.
text: The cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle
text: and places it in a receptacle in his kit. After a short moment
text: the hair confirms JEROME's driving ID which appears on the kit's
text: electronic screen. As the cop departs, Irene looks
text: questioningly at Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (answering her unasked question)
dialog: You never know where those swabs have been.
text: Irene nods, however clearly not convinced. She shakes the doubt
dialog: from her mind.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I want to show you something.
text: She accelerates away. We see the road ahead from Jerome's POV.
text: Without his contact lenses, it is a blur.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S CLUB. NIGHT.
text: After closing time, suited DETECTIVES vacuum the club in which
text: Jerome and Eugene dined the previous evening. MICHAEL, the
text: owner, looks on disdainfully. Waiting in the background, the
text: regular CLEANERS - most likely In-valids themselves - smirk to
text: each other, enjoying watching the cops do their work for them.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN HIGHWAY. NIGHT.
text: With no place to turn the car around, IRENE parks on the cliff
text: side of the six-lane highway. In the darkness she dashes from
text: the car and, without a second thought, runs directly out into
text: the heavy commuter traffic. Easily negotiating the on-coming
text: cars, she emerges safely on the other side of the highway.
text: JEROME, rounding the car from the passenger side, is about to
text: follow, when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb. We focus
text: on his eyes, deprived of the benefit of their contact lenses.
text: From Jerome's POV, we see that the headlights rushing towards
text: him are nothing but a series of fast-moving blurs - blurs that
text: merge together. He is unable to distinguish between the
dialog: vehicles or judge their distance.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (calling back urgently from the
text: other side, mindful of the light
dialog: beginning to leak into the sky)
dialog: Come on! We'll miss it!
text: Irene stares expectantly back at Jerome with her 20/20 vision,
text: unaware of his predicament. Jerome puts a foot off the curb at
text: the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on-coming car.
text: Irene is taken-aback at his mistiming. Does she detect a squint
text: on Jerome's face? To Jerome, the figure of Irene on the other
text: side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels
text: her expectation. He touches the spectacles, still in his
dialog: pocket, but they are an unthinkable option.
text: He shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly-
text: flowing highway. He makes up his mind - he cannot allow himself
dialog: to be shamed, even at the risk of life and limb. Hardly even
text: glancing at the traffic, he suddenly bolts blindly across the
text: road. Headlights hurtling towards him, cars fortuitously
text: brushing past his heels, horns blaring. Jerome makes a final
text: leap to the haven of the far curb, the rush of air from a large,
text: fast-moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk.
text: Irene is stunned by the near miss. She is about to comment but
text: Jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Come on. We'll miss it.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAWN.
text: JEROME and IRENE huddle beneath an overcoat as the sun crests
text: the horizon, staining the sky with an ochre blush.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What did I tell you?
text: Jerome nods. However, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing
text: but an out-of-focus, abstract ink blot.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I envy you, Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You'll be next.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I don't think so. The only trip I'll make
dialog: in space is around the sun--
dialog: (letting a handful of sand
dialog: slip through her fingers)
dialog: --on this satellite right here.
text: Irene turns to Jerome.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (blurting out what's really on her mind)
dialog: --Listen, I don't want to waste your time
dialog: and I <i>really</i> don't want you to waste <i>mine</i>.
dialog: I don't know what you're after but I have
dialog: a feeling I'm not it.
text: Irene suddenly takes Jerome's hand and puts it up her
text: sweater, onto her breast. Although taken aback, Jerome makes
text: no effort to withdraw his hand.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (enjoying his unease)
dialog: It's here. My heart.
dialog: (adding quickly)
dialog: I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a
dialog: drug maintenance program, blood thinners,
dialog: diet--
dialog: (slowly removing his hand)
dialog: I just want you to know what you'd be getting
dialog: yourself into.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: What exactly is wrong?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing
dialog: symptoms in my late-fifties.
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: But unless they come up with something between
dialog: now and then, I won't live much past 67.
text: Jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the
text: statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Of course I think about it every day.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (still not quite recovered from his surprise)
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: INT. POOL. MORNING.
text: The INVESTIGATOR swims his race with the unseen opponent. The
text: Investigator's ASSISTANT, carrying a phone, tries to attract his
dialog: attention.
scene_heading: EXT. JEROME'S POOL. MORNING.
text: JEROME sits at his own poolside in his robe, feet dangling over
text: the edge, smoking a cigarette. EUGENE, from his wheelchair, is
text: applying bleach to Jerome's hair and eyebrows with gloved
dialog: hands.
text: At the same time, Jerome plays a sleight-of-hand game with a
dialog: syringe.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: How was your evening?
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: You <i>are</i> a catch. No doubt she's worried that
dialog: she would lower the standard of your offspring.
dialog: Everybody wants to "breed up".
dialog: (idly curious)
dialog: What's wrong with her?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (trying to be blasÈ)
dialog: You know how it is with these altered births
dialog: --somebody told her she's not going to live
dialog: forever and she's been preparing to die ever
dialog: since.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (adamant)
text: She doesn't <i>have</i> to know. She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
text: The camera travels down Jerome's scarred legs to find that the
text: pool is completely drained. We now realize that it never
dialog: contained water.
text: A BARREN WASTELAND.
text: A desolate landscape, resembling the surface of the planet Mars.
text: We pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding
text: desert through a circular aperture.
scene_heading: INT. CRIME LAB. DAY.
text: The INVESTIGATOR lifts his head from the eyepiece of an
text: electron microscope through which he has been examining a tiny
text: fragment of skin - the skin is identified as belonging to 20-
scene_heading: YEAR-OLD VINCENT. DETECTIVE HUGO stands at the Investigator's
text: side - his attitude more respectful in light of the discovery.
text: Detective Hugo points out a location on a computer-generated
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (chagrined)
text: The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant.
text: The employees are all accounted for.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (shifting the view of the map
dialog: to include the Gattaca complex)
dialog: No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have
text: shown up there in the past.
text: The Investigator understands the significance. They wander over
text: to a blow-up photograph of the 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: We have to consider the possibility that he's
text: playing somebody else's hand.
text: A smile gradually broadens across the Investigator's face.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (taking a perverse pleasure in the
dialog: slowly dawning revelation)
dialog: Of course. He's a "de-gene-erate".
dialog: (glancing to a photo of the
dialog: Gattaca crime scene)
dialog: He works at Gattaca. Why else would we find
text: the eyelash near the washroom? Nobody stops to
dialog: take a leak during a murder.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (quickly covering himself)
dialog: It's still possible the eyelash specimen came
text: from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown
text: in through an open window.
text: The Investigator appears not to be listening, his mind made up.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (mind racing)
dialog: He was afraid of being exposed. That's why he did it.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: It is hard to believe he could be one of
dialog: their elite workers. You've seen their
dialog: security system. They know who works there.
dialog: (referring to 20-year-old Vincent's profile)
dialog: Even if you ignore the man's expiration date,
text: his profile suggests that he doesn't have the
dialog: mathematical propensity let alone the stamina
dialog: to pass their physicals.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Don't underestimate these imposters.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (skeptical, referring to a file of
dialog: Gattaca employee ID photos)
text: None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (smiling to himself)
text: A man can change his face--but blood is forever.
dialog: Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Intravenous.
text: Hugo's mouth drops open at the mention of "intravenous".
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (immediately protesting)
dialog: You know their workforce. Two-thirds at
dialog: least fall into the category. We'll be
dialog: closing down their operation for days.
dialog: (seeking a compromise)
dialog: At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: Blood. From the vein.
text: The Investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest.
text: The Detective and his ASSISTANTS exchange looks of exasperation
text: behind the Investigator's back.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA. DAY.
text: JEROME, drinking water, stands in front of a large video
text: bulletin board. Among other things, it displays the electronic
text: mugshot of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT alongside the recent computer
text: generated age enhancement of his face.
text: Some distance away, CAESAR, the elderly janitor, discusses the
text: mugshots with a YOUNGER JANITOR.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Look like anybody to you?
speaker_heading: YOUNGER JANITOR
dialog: Not to me.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?
text: Jerome half-smiles, realizing that the conversation is for his
dialog: benefit. Having made it clear that they do not intend to expose
text: their former colleague, the two janitors continue their rounds.
text: Jerome crushes his paper cup. Forgetting himself, he
text: drops the cup into the wastebasket.
scene_heading: INT. CRAFT. DAY.
text: JEROME familiarizes himself with the interior of a spacecraft
text: under the supervision of DIRECTOR JOSEF and the MISSION
text: COMMANDER. The screen that Jerome sits at is identical to the
text: one he operates in the computer complex - displaying asteroid
dialog: 951 Gaspra.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: --Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key.
dialog: (warming to his theme)
dialog: Back to the beginning of the book--the life we
dialog: became. With the original building blocks who
dialog: knows how far we can take "the godding".
speaker_heading: MISSION COMMANDER
dialog: (wry smile)
dialog: Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be
dialog: last year's model by the time we're done.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (smiling back)
dialog: I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander.
text: Irene enters the craft.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Excuse me, Mr Morrow. The investigators have
dialog: begun their testing.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE JOSEF
dialog: This is so inconvenient, Irene. They can
dialog: make an exception for Jerome.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I'm afraid not.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: I apologize, Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: It's not yor fault, Director.
dialog: (afterthought)
dialog: If your predecessor were still around
dialog: we may not be going to Gaspra at all.
dialog: That's what <i>I</i> would call inconvenient.
text: Jerome exits the craft with Irene.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA CORPORATION - CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: A line of MALE GATTACA EMPLOYEES snakes out the door and down
text: the corridor. The INVESTIGATOR walks slowly down the line,
text: trying to eyeball his suspect. Concentrating on the shorter,
text: dark-haired men in the line, he looks straight past JEROME.
text: However, as the Investigator ignores him and walks by, we see a
text: haunted look in Jerome's eyes.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - TESTING LAB. DAY.
dialog: Every available TECHNICIAN is working to accommodate the testing
text: of the thousand or so PROGRAMMERS. Twelve testing stations
text: operate simultaneously. A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE supervises each
text: station. JEROME reaches the head of the line. He notes an
text: exiting COLLEAGUE holding a cotton ball to his arm.
text: A NURSE directs Jerome to LAMAR's testing station. Lamar
text: deposits the previous patient's labeled vial into a blood
text: carousel under the watchful eye of a large DETECTIVE, clearly
text: not relishing his assignment. Jerome rolls up his sleeve.
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: (referring to the table lined with syringes)
dialog: What's with the plungers, Lamar? What are
dialog: you doing, opening a blood bank?
text: The syringes are clearly not Lamar's idea.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that
dialog: my testing methods may have been compromised.
text: Lamar inserts a fresh syringe into Jerome's arm. As Lamar draws
text: the blood, Jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm
text: violently, causing the needle to bend and buckle, exiting the
text: skin from a second puncture point.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Damn!!
text: Having pulled away from Lamar's grasp, Jerome withdraws the bent
text: needle himself, blood still squirting from his vein.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (grabbing a nearby wad of gauze)
dialog: Jesus--I'm sorry, Jerome.
text: The large Homicide Detective winces and turns away from the red
text: arcing spray, a splash of blood spattering his shoes. In the
text: midst of the commotion, with his practised sleight-of-hand,
text: Jerome removes the vial from the syringe and replaces it with
text: another concealed vial.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (unfazed, putting Lamar at his ease)
dialog: You must be out of practise, Lamar.
text: Lamar hurriedly takes the syringe from Jerome.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (examining and removing the
dialog: switched vial from the bent syringe)
dialog: I've got enough here.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (regarding the squimish detective,
text: as he holds the gauze to his arm)
dialog: Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
text: The Detective notices the spatter of blood across his brogues
text: and, with a look of disdain, wipes it clean. He tosses the
text: incriminating tissue down a hygenically sealed garbage shoot.
text: Lamar places Jerome's labelled vial in the carousel where it is
text: immediately analyzed by the computer. Jerome's "legitimate"
text: Employee ID code appears on the screen - <i>"VALID"</i>. Another
text: EMPLOYEE enters the testing lab.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA. DAY.
text: JEROME exits the testing lab with the gauze held to his arm.
text: IRENE is standing outside the door.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: So you didn't do it after all.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (joking darkly)
dialog: I guess somebody beat me to it.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - MEZZANINE FLOOR. LATER IN THE DAY.
text: From above, the INVESTIGATOR and HUGO observe the final EMPLOYEE
dialog: exit the testing lab.
text: LAMAR, following the employee out of the lab, throws a look of
text: vindication to the two cops.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: That's the last.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Something's not right.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (losing his patience)
text: He's not here. It's a blind alley.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (resolute)
dialog: No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: We don't have the manpower.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Get it. From outside, if you have to.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: From what budget?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (angered by Hugo's excuses)
dialog: I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if
dialog: you question my authority one more time!
text: The INVESTIGATOR turns his back on his subordinate and idly
text: contemplates the nearby telescope. Hugo resignedly relays the
text: news to Director Josef who is standing some distance away.
text: Josef's immediate reaction is to march towards the Investigator,
text: Hugo trailing behind. DIRECTOR JOSEF collects himself as he
text: notices the Investigator's hand on the telescope.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: Would you care to look--in the telescope?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Thank you, no.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: (still referring to the telescope)
dialog: One look through there and you would know why
dialog: I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations
dialog: any further.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (unfazed)
dialog: You're so unconcerned that you have a killer
dialog: in your midst.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of
dialog: a threat. I don't think you have any concept
dialog: of what we do here--how meticulous our
dialog: preparations must be. We are about to send
text: twelve people through 140 million miles of
text: blackness to rendezvous with an object the size
dialog: of a house and the color of coal. So it's rather
dialog: critical to point them in the right direction.
dialog: And we certainly don't need you looking over our
dialog: shoulders. Besides, I don't believe there is
dialog: any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us. I
dialog: don't see too many other dead bodies littering
dialog: the place.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (surveying the mostly empty facility)
dialog: No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones
dialog: tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one
dialog: further sweep. If he does not work here, then
dialog: there should be no other trace of him.
dialog: (to Hugo)
dialog: I think you'd better get some people out of bed,
dialog: Detective.
dialog: (a thought occurs)
dialog: In the meantime we can re-check his favorite
dialog: haunt.
text: Director Josef quietly seethes.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (to Josef, referring to the telescope)
dialog: You see, Director, I prefer my microscope.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. DAY.
text: JEROME readies himself for an evening out - a bandage around his
text: arm from the needle puncture. EUGENE wheels himself in.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (slightly guilty)
dialog: I'm sorry. I've got plans.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (feigning hurt)
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (referring to his bandage)
dialog: She's already got her doubts. I have to act
dialog: like nothing's wrong.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
text: Jerome ignores the remark.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Where are you taking her?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Michael's.
text: Eugene looks at him askance.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Everybody goes there.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (incredulous, glancing around the room)
dialog: You may as well invite her here.
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: (afterthought as he picks up his jacket)
dialog: Will you be okay?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Don't worry about your little pin cushion.
dialog: To be honest, I'm looking forward to having
dialog: the place to myself.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (seeing through the bravado)
dialog: We'll still be able to talk when I'm away.
dialog: The conversation will just keep getting longer.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and
dialog: say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes
dialog: later I reply, "Not bad. How are you?"
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I guess I'd better have something important
dialog: to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S CLUB. NIGHT.
text: IRENE and JEROME step off the dance floor of the smoky, decadent
text: dinner club and take a seat at their table. Irene is agog at
text: the strange assortment of PATRONS, the cigars, the laden dessert
text: trolleys. It is all slightly off from the pristine world she is
dialog: accustomed to.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What <i>is</i> this place?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (wry smile, enjoying her fascination)
dialog: You've never been here?
text: (a dessert trolley is wheeled up)
dialog: Let me order for you.
text: Jerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley. Jerome
text: savors a spoonful. Irene is tempted but then remembers herself.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I'd better not.
text: She reaches for her elegant pill box. Jerome takes another
text: spoonful.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: So sure of what you can't do. Do you even
dialog: know what it tastes like, Irene?
text: Irene goes to deny it but cannot.
text: MICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow.
text: Irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger
text: when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table
text: immediately hoovered. Michael whispers in Jerome's ear.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Take the side door.
text: Jerome looks up in time to see DETECTIVE HUGO coming through the
text: front entrance with several other DETECTIVES.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: (to his colleagues)
dialog: Check for lenses, hairpieces--
text: A Detective shines a flashlight in the eyes of a MALE PATRON.
text: A SECOND DETECTIVE tugs the hair of a SECOND PATRON. Jerome
text: takes Irene by the hand and escorts her out of the side exit.
text: Several other COUPLES make for the parking lot.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Why are we leaving?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (attempting to explain the hasty exit)
dialog: Those checks take forever.
scene_heading: EXT. MICHAEL'S CLUB - SIDE ALLEY. NIGHT.
text: Spilling out of the exit, JEROME and IRENE find a burly
text: plain clothes DETECTIVE barring their way. Before the Detective
text: can say a word, Jerome has wrapped his fist in his jacket sleeve
text: and smashed him in the face. He continues to beat the Detective
text: until he lies motionless on the ground.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Jerome!
text: Spying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot.
text: Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What about the car?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (grabbing her by the hand)
dialog: Let's walk.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Who are they?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (holding his bruised knuckles)
dialog: It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here.
text: Jerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by
text: moonlight. Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: My medication. I left it back there.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: We'll get it later.
dialog: (forcing her to look him in the eye)
dialog: Irene, please.
text: Irene realizes his seriousness. She begins to run with him.
text: The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated. They are only
dialog: halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo
text: look in their direction.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S. NIGHT.
text: The INVESTIGATOR is grilling MICHAEL, the club's owner. The
text: investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini-vacs in
text: the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (an accusing tone)
dialog: You run a clean establishment.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Are you a health inspector?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (showing Vincent's mugshot)
dialog: Do you recognize this man?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My eyes aren't so good.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: I bet.
text: Hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered
text: his fallen colleague.
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Sir.
text: The Investigator hurries to him.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (to the still dazed Detective,
dialog: examining his injuries)
dialog: Did he hit you with his fist?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: (head in his hands)
text: More like a hammer.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (reprimanding the beaten Detective)
dialog: Don't touch your face. Don't swallow.
dialog: Don't spit.
dialog: (to Hugo)
dialog: Quick, clean his teeth.
text: Hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try
text: to pick skin from Jerome's knuckles from between the Detective's
text: teeth. The Investigator finds the hidden side door.
scene_heading: EXT. DESOLATE LOT. NIGHT.
text: JEROME and IRENE continue to sprint across the enormous vacant
text: lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and
text: water. Just as the gate opens in the distance, Jerome hurls
text: Irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side.
text: Irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (upset, a strangled protest)
dialog: Are you trying to kill me? Are you?!
dialog: Don't you understand, I can't do that!
text: Jerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You just did.
text: Irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just
text: negotiated, realizing what she has just done.
text: From across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing
text: cry from the center FIGURE.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR (OC)
dialog: Vincent! Vincent!
scene_heading: EXT. MICHAEL'S. NIGHT.
text: The INVESTIGATOR is about to cry out Vincent's name once again
text: when he realizes DETECTIVE HUGO and the other DETECTIVES are
text: watching him, askance.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (to Hugo, covering his frustration)
dialog: What are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: Where do we start?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: (handing the Investigator Irene's pill box)
dialog: We caught them trying to flush these, Sir.
text: The Investigator carefully examines the heart pills.
scene_heading: EXT. IRENE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
text: JEROME walks IRENE to the steps of her apartment. Jerome thinks
text: about departing but Irene takes him gently by the hand.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: So sure of what you can't do.
text: Jerome follows her inside.
scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: JEROME and IRENE climb a staircase to her bedroom. Without
text: another word they begin to make love.
text: LATER THAT NIGHT, JEROME cannot sleep. He rises quietly so as
text: not to disturb IRENE. He silently opens the double-windows of
text: the upstairs bedroom. He carefully gathers his pillow from the
text: bed and shakes it out of the window.
text: Slowly Jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor. In the moonlight
text: we see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a single hair lying on the
text: floorboards. Jerome bends and picks up the hair, trying to
text: identify it in the dim light. On his hands and knees he tries
text: to clean the floor with a towel. Irene turns over in the
text: bed. Jerome freezes but she continues to sleep. He realizes he
text: may be spreading even more of his skin and hair over the floor.
text: Overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task, he
text: begins to quietly weep.
scene_heading: EXT. A FIELD. DAWN.
text: A light shroud of mist hangs over the trees that encircle a
text: grassy clearing beyond Irene's building. Something lies in the
text: center of the clearing.
text: We jump-cut to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of two or three blades of
text: grass. Bristles rain down on the blades. Withotu access to his
text: incinerator, the crouched, naked figure of JEROME disposes of
text: his whiskers, skin and hair in an open field. His clothes sit
text: in a neat pile at his side. He pours glycolic acid over his
text: body and scrubs at his back, feet and hands with a brush. There
text: is a haunted, tortured look in his eyes as he tries desperately
dialog: to rid himself of himself.
scene_heading: INT. POOL. MORNING.
text: The INVESTIGATOR swims obsessively in his aquatic treadmill.
scene_heading: INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT. LATER THAT MORNING.
text: Back in the bedroom, JEROME, partially dressed, holds IRENE
text: in bed. She softly touches the scars on his shins.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (referring to the shins)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?
text: It's the exact height of the front fender.
dialog: (shrugs)
text: Looked right instead of left.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (comforted by the thought)
dialog: So you're not so smart after all.
dialog: (awkward about raising the subject)
dialog: I want you to know--if it ever came to it--
dialog: I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg
dialog: Bank. In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--
dialog: (quickly covering herself again)
dialog: --<i>if</i> it came to it.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--
dialog: (searching for an appropriate body part)
dialog: --nose.
dialog: (stroking her face)
dialog: How perfect does your child have to be?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (mildly irritated by what she
dialog: perceives as his mocking)
dialog: You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment
dialog: you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't
dialog: for who you are--<i>what</i> you are? Don't you get
dialog: <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children
dialog: will be able to live to a ripe old age unless
dialog: they do something foolish?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they
dialog: won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or
dialog: <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
text: Irene is taken aback by Jerome's passion, regarding him in a new
dialog: light.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. MORNING.
text: EUGENE urinates into a large plastic container while drinking
text: bottled water at the same time. He already has several other
text: containers of urine on the table beside him.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA. MORNING.
text: The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO keep a wary eye on the
text: outfitted DETECTIVES re-vacuuming the empty computer complex
dialog: with their mini-vacs.
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: (reading newspaper)
dialog: My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (shrugs, ambivalent)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: These new personality corrections I've been
dialog: reading about.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: You worried about the cost?
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: Not that.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (regarding Hugo with a condescending smile)
dialog: They said the same thing about myopia and
dialog: obesity. You think your children would be
dialog: less human if they were less violent, angry,
dialog: spiteful? Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human. From
dialog: where I sit the world could stand a little
dialog: improving.
text: We dwell on one DETECTIVE in particular, snatching a garbage
text: bag from CAESAR, the janitor.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Don't touch that. It's evidence.
text: He puts a pile of discarded paper cups aside for later testing.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA CORPORATION. LATER THAT MORNING.
text: In the vast, empty Gattaca complex the INVESTIGATOR inspects a
text: specimen bag containing Jerome's paper cup with DIRECTOR JOSEF
text: and DETECTIVE HUGO.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: Positive saliva match. The cup was
dialog: definitely used since the original sweep.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: So we have two choices. Either our suspect
text: came back to the murder scene for a drink of
dialog: water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...
text: (looking out over the empty complex)
dialog: ...he <i>is</i> here.
dialog: (resolute)
dialog: We test again. You're right, Hugo, this was a
dialog: desperate act. Someone had a lot to lose that
dialog: night--perhaps their place in line.
dialog: (to Director Josef)
dialog: I'd like the profiles of everyone with an
dialog: upcoming mission.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: (nervous)
text: Twelve have a mission within the week.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: This time I will supervise each test personally.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. GATTACA. MORNING.
text: JEROME and IRENE walk towards the entrance to Gattaca. Spying
text: the Homicide Investigation trucks parked at the rear of the
text: building and the silhouette of the INVESTIGATOR in the doorway,
text: Jerome pulls up sharply. Irene notices his unease.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I forgot something--something at home.
dialog: I'll see you later.
text: Jerome kisses her. Irene, also aware of the trucks,
text: interrogates Jerome with her eyes.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I'll miss you.
text: Jerome is still focussed on the entranceway.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (looking skywards)
dialog: --when you go away.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: We could go together one day.
text: Irene considers the idea. She enters Gattaca alone.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - COMPUTER COMPLEX. DAY.
text: IRENE prepares a stack of ID photos of CREW MEMBERS for the
text: INVESTIGATOR. She closely inspects the doctored photo of
text: JEROME, hesitating before adding it to the file.
text: The camera dwells on JEROME's vacant work station. The
text: INVESTIGATOR curiously regards the empty chair. He is
text: accompanied by DETECTIVE HUGO, DIRECTOR JOSEF and IRENE.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: He's the only absentee.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: A little nausea. Quite common.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: At least it's nothing contagious.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR JOSEF
dialog: (unduly agitated)
dialog: I will not permit any further testing on the
dialog: eve of a mission. We're already counting
dialog: backwards.
text: The INVESTIGATOR ignores Josef and takes a pocket knife from his
text: jacket. He prises out the "ESC" key from Jerome's keyboard,
text: places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (picking up a phone)
dialog: I'll call and let him know.
text: The Investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from
text: Irene's hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Let's not spoil the surprise.
dialog: (to Irene)
dialog: I understand you can show us the way.
text: The anxious Director Josef calls out to protest one further
text: time but the Investigator is on his way out of the door.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GATTACA. DAY.
text: Outside the entrance to Gattaca, trying to hail a taxi, JEROME
text: is startled to see a car carrying the INVESTIGATOR, DETECTIVE
text: HUGO and IRENE roar out of the driveway. JEROME calls on his
text: portable wristphone.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. DAY.
text: EUGENE, at his window, filling sachets as usual, hesitates
text: before answering the phone.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JEROME (OC)
dialog: How would you like to be yourself for the day?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: I was never very good at it, remember?
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM / HALLWAY. DAY.
text: With a look of resolve, EUGENE hangs up the phone.
text: He wheels his chair up to the sweeping staircase and regards the
text: first of many dozen steps. The daunting staircase spirals away
text: above him.
scene_heading: INT. INVESTIGATOR'S CAR. DAY.
text: HUGO drives. The INVESTIGATOR looks to IRENE in the rear seat.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (taunting)
dialog: You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?
text: He hands her the pill box found in Michael's.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: You think you have problems?
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDO/JEROME'S CONDO. DAY.
text: Having wheeled his chair out of sight, EUGENE eases himself out
text: of his wheelchair and onto the floor. Using his elbows,
text: commando-style, dragging his lifeless legs behind him, he
text: proceeds to crawl across the floor and up the first step of the
text: long spiral staircase. We observe his agonizingly slow progress
text: up a staircase that, from Eugene's point of view, appears to
dialog: have doubled in length.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX. DAY.
text: The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO emerge from their car with
text: IRENE in tow. They take in the impressive complex - the
text: Investigator gets a glimpse of the empty pool. They approach
text: the intercom at the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. DAY.
text: EUGENE, bathed in sweat, finally crests the landing of the
text: staircase. No respite. As he drags himself across the floor
text: the internal phone rings. He frantically stretches up and
text: knocks the phone off its hook so he can talk from his prone
text: position on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. CONDOMINIUM - LOBBY. DAY.
text: IRENE is on the phone, closely watched by the INVESTIGATOR and
scene_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO.
speaker_heading: EUGENE (OC)
dialog: (through intercom, no trace of his distress)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (a moment's hesitation)
dialog: Jerome--?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. DAY.
text: With no mean effort, EUGENE finally manages to replace the phone
text: on its cradle. He desperately crawls up onto the sofa.
text: However, spying the upright vacuum cleaner in the open closet,
text: he is forced to crawl there and remove the vacuum bag. He
text: frantically crawls back towards the sofa and stuffs the bag
text: behind a cushion.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. DAY.
text: IRENE enters the door deliberately left ajar, closely followed
text: by the INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO. EUGENE is propped up on
text: the sofa, TV remote control placed in his useless hand to cover
text: his paralysis. He has a stainless steel bowl next to him and
text: has crossed his lifeless legs for a more natural effect. Eugene
text: calmy motions the confused Irene towards him.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Where's my kiss?
text: The Investigator scrutinizes Irene's reaction. With only the
text: merest hesitation she takes her cue from Eugene and kisses
text: him affectionately on the forehead. She perches herself on the
text: arm of the sofa. Eugene takes the opportunity to rest his
text: arm on her leg.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Good to see you're feeling better.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: It's about the Director.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (feigning boredom)
dialog: Again?
text: The Investigator slowly circles Eugene, regarding him with the
text: utmost scrutiny. He compares his face to the doctored Gattaca
text: ID photo - a passable likeness. Eugene bends towards the bowl
text: and dry retches.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Forgive me for not getting up.
text: Irene puts a comforting hand on Eugene's shoulder.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (to the Investigator)
dialog: Couldn't we do this another time?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: I don't believe so.
text: Detective Hugo takes a seat in the chair beside the sofa and
text: unpacks a syringe from the kit he carries.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: This won't take a moment.
text: Detective Hugo swabs Eugene's inner arm. All eyes are trained
text: on the tip of the needle as it punctures the vein.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (reassuring to Irene, referring to
text: the blood flowing into the syringe)
dialog: It's okay. Maybe they can find out what I've got.
text: Under the Investigator's watchful eye, Detective Hugo withdraws
text: the syringe and immediately inserts a small amount of the blood
text: into the portable analyzer he wears. Naturally, it confirms
dialog: that Eugene is Jerome.
text: Irene does her best to conceal her shock. Hiding his
text: frustration, the Investigator distractedly tours the room while
text: Hugo packs up his gear. The Investigator idly toys with
text: the telescope pointed out of the window.
text: Next he wanders towards the closet and reaches for the doorknob.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Mind if I take a leak?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: As long as you don't do it in my closet.
text: (nodding to the other side of the room)
dialog: Over there.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM - BATHROOM. DAY.
text: The INVESTIGATOR immediately pulls a specimen bag from his
text: jacket pocket and closely inspects the stainless steel toilet
text: and sink. They are both spotless. The shower stall is also
text: scrupulously clean. He flushes the toilet and exits.
text: Lost in thought, the INVESTIGATOR approaches the closet again
text: and wheels out Jerome's upright vacuum cleaner. He is
text: disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside. The
text: Investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and
text: produces a mini-vac from Detective Hugo's crime bag.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (to Eugene, referring to ther mini-vac)
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Clean the whole house if you want.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (taking Eugene's lead)
dialog: Actually, the kitchen needs doing.
text: The Investigator switches on the mini-vac to take a specimen
text: from the floor, then promptly kills the machine. Looking down,
text: the Investigator notices the trail of Eugene's perspiration
text: on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase.
text: Eugene, reading the Investigator's mind, goes to call out but
text: the words remain frozen on his tongue. Hugo follows his
text: superior as they start to descend the stairs. Irene and Eugene
text: are left staring at one another.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO - STAIRCASE. DAY.
text: JEROME catches the merest glimpse of the INVESTIGATOR and
text: DETECTIVE HUGO before he slips behind a doorway in Eugene's
dialog: condominium.
text: Jerome anxiously regards Eugene's empty wheelchair sitting
text: there. On the stairs, Hugo's phone rings.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO (OC)
dialog: (into phone, increasingly encouraged)
dialog: Yes?...Yes...<i>yes</i>...
text: The Investigator is already at the foot of the stairs in
text: Eugene's condo when the Detective calls to him.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: (urgent, to Investigator)
dialog: Come quickly. We <i>have</i> him.
text: The Investigator's eyes light up. He retraces his steps
text: up the staircase after Detective Hugo.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. DAY.
text: JEROME, white as a ghost, climbs the stairs, emerging into his
text: own condominium. He embraces the beaming EUGENE, still sitting
text: on the sofa.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (numb)
dialog: How are you, Jerome?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Not bad, Jerome.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: How the hell did you get here.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: I could always walk. I've been faking it.
text: Jerome almost laughs, despite the situation. Only now does he
text: notice Irene on the other side of the room, her mind racing.
text: She looks at Jerome and Eugene together and runs from the
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: Irene.
text: Jerome goes to follow but Eugene stops him.
scene_heading: INT. CRIME LABORATORY. DAY.
text: An EXTREME CLOSE UP of dried blood - brittle and cracking - on
text: a pair of soiled latex gloves. A latex head mask, suit of
text: clothes and shoe covers are similarly caked. The INVESTIGATOR
text: and DETECTIVE HUGO watch as a white-coated FORENSIC TECHNICIAN
text: feeds a minute sample of the dried blood into an analyzer.
text: The INVESTIGATOR wanders over to a one-way glass window through
text: which he can observe DIRECTOR JOSEF, sitting numb but strangely
text: serene in an interrogation room. The Investigator, in a state
text: of shock himself, cannot yet bring himself to believe what is
text: plainly obvious.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
text: (gazing at the Director, struggling
dialog: to come to grips with the turn of events)
dialog: This can't be him.
text: The Detective regards his superior incredulously, intrigued that
text: he could still cling so stubbornly to his theory in the face of
dialog: such overwhelming evidence.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (intrigued)
text: We found his spit in the dead director's eye.
dialog: He's signed a confession--supplied us with the
dialog: suit he wore on the night. What more do you
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
text: (a trace of desperation, grasping at straws)
text: Luca could still be an accomplice.
text: The Investigator turns away, unwilling or unable to accept the
text: explanation. Hugo regards the Investigator with a trace of
text: sympathy. He furtively retrieves the Investigator's tissue
text: from the trash.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA. DAY.
text: JEROME sits in a formal briefing room with the other CREW
text: MEMBERS of his mission, receiving their final pre-flight
text: instructions. LAMAR looks on approvingly.
speaker_heading: MISSION COMMANDER
dialog: --Finally, I'd like to welcome Navigator Morrow
dialog: on his debut mission--if we get lost out there,
text: nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like
dialog: Jerome.
text: Jerome looks up bashfully.
speaker_heading: MISSION COMMANDER
dialog: (adopting a more serious tone)
dialog: I'm gratified that there is no longer a cloud
dialog: hanging over tomorrow's launch. Now we can put
dialog: this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate
dialog: on the task at hand. I don't have to tell you how
dialog: important this mission is--the Belt could hold
dialog: the key to the origin of life - why we are what
dialog: we are.
dialog: (injecting a note of levity)
dialog: I know many of you have been asking that
dialog: question about <i>me</i> for long enough.
dialog: (referring to a projected photograph
text: of a misshapen asteroid behind his head)
dialog: Gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so
dialog: many beautiful secrets?
text: Polite smiles from his colleagues.
speaker_heading: MISSION COMMANDER
dialog: Enjoy your final evening with your families.
dialog: We'll all be a year older when they see
dialog: us next. And don't be late tomorrow. You
dialog: don't want to miss this.
text: We focus on Jerome. He appears to have his head in the heavens
dialog: already.
scene_heading: INT. CRIME LAB. NIGHT.
text: The tormented INVESTIGATOR lies on the floor of his lab, staring
text: at the ceiling. he winces in discomfort. He is lying on
text: something. He rolls over and retrieves the irritation from his
text: pocket. It is the "ESC" computer key he prized from Jerome's
dialog: keyboard.
text: He gazes at the key for a moment and then gets to his feet. He
text: resurrects an old fingerprint kit from a cupboard. Carefully
text: removing the key from the specimen bag - marked, "MORROW,
text: Jerome" - he begins to dust it for a fingerprint.
text: He places the key under a camera. The enlarged print appears
text: on the lefthand side of his computer screen. The word "MATCH"
text: blinks onto the screen. However the face that appears from the
text: computer's databank is not that of "MORROW, Jerome" but
text: "LUCA, Vincent". The Investigator regards the photograph in
dialog: disbelief.
text: DETECTIVE HUGO casually enters the lab, something odd in his
text: nonchalant demeanor.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Hugo! I've found him!
speaker_heading: HUGO
dialog: I've found him too.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (not listening, referring to his discovery)
dialog: A fingerprint. There's something to be
dialog: said for nostalgia.
dialog: (realizing what Hugo has said)
dialog: What did you find?
text: Hugo puts a specimen bag on the counter. It contains the
text: Investigator's discarded tissue. The Investigator does
dialog: not recognize it.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: (interest piqued)
dialog: Where did you get this?
text: The Investigator immediately deposits the tissue into an
dialog: analyzer.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HUGO
dialog: (referring to the tissue)
dialog: But this man does share some common
dialog: characteristics with your suspect. Not so
dialog: many but <i>enough</i>. It appears the eyelash
dialog: has a brother--of a kind.
text: The Investigator realizes the significance and looks guiltily
text: to Hugo. Hugo exits the lab, leaving the Investigator to stare
text: at his own FACE in his analyzing machine.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - JANITOR'S LOCKER ROOM. NIGHT.
text: CAESAR, the old janitor, enters the locker room. He is about to
text: wearily open his locker when he senses another presence in the
dialog: room.
text: He turns to find JEROME sitting there on a bench. Although
text: clearly delighted, CAESAR tries to disguise his pleasure.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: So you've finally seen sense and come back
dialog: to your old job, Vincent.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Not yet, I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No? What's keeping you?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I guess I'm a slow learner.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: (looking up through the
dialog: small window)
dialog: Well, while you're up there, maybe you could
dialog: tidy the place up a bit.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
text: The two men embrace, Caesar breaking off before Jerome.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: And don't go getting everybody lost out there.
dialog: You'll give us a bad name. You won't have
dialog: me to keep an eye on you, you know.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (glancing to Caesar's locker)
dialog: By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (happy to oblige)
dialog: I'll take care of it.
text: Jerome departs. Caesar watches him go and turns back to his
text: locker. He opens it to find a brand new, high-tech telescope
text: sitting inside.
text: The old janitor gets over his surprise and beams broadly -
text: he looks back in Jerome's direction but he has gone. The
text: old janitor cannot help himself and reverently reaches for the
text: telescope's eyepiece.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX. NIGHT.
text: In the dimly-lit, empty computer complex, JEROME takes a last
text: look around. He sits at his computer, one final time replaying
text: the graphic representation of his path through the cosmos that
text: he is on the eve of taking for real.
text: He notices the key missing from his keyboard. Instantly
text: realizing the significance, he rises from his seat to flee.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Vincent--
text: Jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name
text: and the voice that calls it.
text: He makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his
text: pursuer. The Investigator steps out of the shadows.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Vincent, what are you running from?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (disturbingly calm)
dialog: From Vincent.
text: The two men face each other for the first time in a long
text: time. The Investigator is transfixed by Jerome's face -
text: scarcely able to believe his eyes.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Has it been so long, you don't remember
dialog: who I am?
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: (nodding to the Investigator's badge)
dialog: Maybe it's <i>you</i> who's forgotten.
dialog: (meeting his gaze)
dialog: What are you doing here, Anton?
text: It is finally apparent the Investigator is Jerome's younger
text: brother Anton [AS WE SHALL REFER TO THE INVESTIGATOR FOR THE
text: REST OF THE FILM].
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: I could ask <i>you</i> the same question.
dialog: (glancing to the impressive complex)
dialog: I have a <i>right</i> to be here, <i>you</i> don't.
text: Jerome smiles at him condescendingly.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: You almost sound like you believe that.
speaker_heading: ANTON
text: (ignoring the remark, extending his hand)
dialog: Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far
dialog: as you can go.
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: (refusing Anton's hand, glancing
dialog: to the telescope above them)
dialog: There are a few million miles to go yet.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (adamant)
text: It's over.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton,
dialog: to see me fail?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: It's for the best.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (increasingly angered)
dialog: God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do.
dialog: In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't
dialog: need rescuing. But <i>you</i> did, once.
text: Anton is clearly stung by the memory.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (goading)
dialog: Well? You have all the answers. How is that
dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (resolute)
dialog: You didn't beat me that day. I beat <i>myself</i>.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Who are you trying to convince?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I will prove it to you. Come swim with
dialog: me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.
text: Jerome regards Anton with a knowing smile. Somewhere in Gattaca
text: a phone rings.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. IRENE'S CAR OUTSIDE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX. NIGHT.
text: IRENE, sitting in her car outside Jerome's condominium, hangs up
text: her portable phone. In her agitation, her finger involuntarily
text: goes to her pulse. She catches herself and removes the finger
text: from her wrist as if it has burned her. She exits the car.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM/EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: IRENE quietly knocks on Jerome's door but there is no response.
text: Trying the handle, the door opens. Her curiosity takes her
text: inside. All is quiet. IRENE calls out.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Hello.
text: No reply. Irene hesitantly ventures further, drawn to the
text: spiral staircase. She tentatively makes her way down the stairs
text: and into Eugene's dimly lit condominium. With wonder and
text: reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on
text: Eugene's work benches. She opens the refrigerator in the
text: bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets. Finally she
text: regards the empty incinerator.
speaker_heading: EUGENE (OC)
dialog: Quite something, isn't it?
text: Irene turns.
text: Eugene has entered through the mirrored door, not at all
text: displeased by her unexpected visit.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (referring to the incinerator)
dialog: That's where we get rid of the traces of him
dialog: although we never truly succeeded.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I've been looking for him. Do you know where
dialog: he is?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (unconcerned)
dialog: He's probably leaving some more of me
text: around the place before he goes.
text: Eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Don't be deceived, Irene. These are
dialog: just the clothes. He has to wear them.
dialog: Something I could never do.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What's wrong with him?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (sympathetic smile)
dialog: You have more in common than you know.
text: Irene's hand involuntarily goes to her heart.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: But they say <i>his</i>is already ten thousand beats
dialog: overdue. I have my doubts.
dialog: (wry smile)
dialog: For all my gifts, they could never engineer
dialog: me a heart like Vincent's.
text: Irene turns back to the incinerator, lost in though.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.
text: JEROME and ANTON walk down a dune together towards the beach not
text: far from Gattaca - an ocean beach pounded by an angry, black
text: sea. Jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end
text: of his thumb. A drop of blood oozes out. He offers the shell
text: to Anton but Anton does not take it.
text: Both men begin to disrobe. The brothers stand beside each other
text: on the sand once again - Anton still the more athletically-built
dialog: of the two.
text: Together, they enter the raging surf. Diving through the
text: breaking waves, they begin to swim.
text: In the moonlit night, we watch their two bodies swimming side by
text: side. They swim a long distance, Anton waiting for his brother
text: to tire. But the pace does not slacken. Anton pulls up in the
text: water. Sensing his brother is no longer beside him, Jerome also
text: pulls up. They tread water several yards apart.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (attempting to conceal his distress)
dialog: How are you doing this, Vincent? How
dialog: have you done <i>any</i> of this?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Now is your chance to find out.
text: Jerome swims away a second time. Anton is forced to follow
text: once again. Angry now, gritting his teeth, Anton calls
dialog: upon the same determination we have witnessed during his
text: constant swimming in the pool. He puts on a spurt, slowly
text: reeling in Jerome.
text: Anton gradually draws alongside Jerome, certain that this effort
text: will demoralize his older brother. But Jerome has been foxing -
text: waiting for him to catch up. Jerome smiles at Anton. With
text: almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again. Anton is
text: forced to go with him. They swim again for a long distance.
text: It is Anton who gradually becomes demoralized - his strokes
text: weaken, his will draining away. Anton pulls up, exhausted and
text: fearful. Jerome also pulls up. However his face displays none
dialog: of Anton's anxiety.
text: They tread water several yards apart. The ocean is choppier
text: now. The view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the
text: peaks of the waves.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (panic starting to show)
dialog: Vincent, where's the shore? We're too far out.
dialog: We have to go back!
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (calling back)
text: Too late for that. We're closer to the other side.
text: Anton looks towards the empty horizon.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: <i>What</i> other side? How far do you want to <i>go?!</i>
dialog: Do you want to drown us both?
dialog: (becoming hysterical)
dialog: How are we going to get <i>back?!</i>
text: Jerome merely smiles back at his younger brother, a disturbingly
text: serene smile.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (eerily calm)
dialog: You wanted to know how I did it. That's
dialog: how I did it, Anton. I never saved anything
dialog: for the swim back.
text: Anton stares at Jerome, aghast. The two men face each other in
text: silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling
dialog: ocean.
text: Jerome turns and heads back towards the shore. Anton is left
text: alone with the terrifying realization. The only sound, the wind
dialog: and the water.
scene_heading: EXT. CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: JEROME, dishevelled and distressed, arrives back at the
text: condominium. He notices IRENE standing at the edge of the pool.
text: She turns. He approaches her. They stand several yards apart.
text: Looking into each other's eyes, they do not speak. Jerome
text: abruptly pulls a hair from his head - for once one of his own.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (wry smile, offering the hair to Irene)
dialog: Here, take it.
text: Irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (echoing Irene's words from
dialog: their first encounter)
dialog: If you're still interested, let me know.
text: Irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then
text: deliberately lets it fall to the ground.
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: (never taking her eyes from him, echoing
dialog: Jerome's words from their first encounter)
dialog: Sorry, the wind caught it.
text: Once again there is not a breath of wind. The hair lies,
text: plainly visible on the edge of the pool.
text: From an upstairs window, EUGENE observes the couple.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: We watch the silhouette of IRENE and JEROME making love in
dialog: the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: EUGENE, sitting in his darkened room, unscrews the cap of a
text: plastic container and places it on a nearby table. We remain
text: on Eugene's face as he opens his fly.
scene_heading: INT. JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: IRENE and JEROME lie in bed together after making love. For
text: once Jerome is able to sleep unconcerned. It is Irene who lies
text: awake, head against JEROME'S chest, listening to the sound of
text: his erratically beating heart. However it has a soothing
dialog: effect on her.
text: She kisses Jerome and reluctantly rises from the bed.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (awakening)
dialog: A year is a long time.
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: Not so long--just once around the sun.
text: Jerome smiles. For once Irene seems to be looking forward
text: to the trip. She exits the room.
scene_heading: INT. INCINERATOR. MORNING.
text: Inside the incinerator, JEROME scrapes away at himself - for the
text: final time. He wistfully regards the brush in his hand.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. MORNING.
text: JEROME, dressed for his departure, emerges down the spiral
text: staircase into Eugene's condo. Jerome notices several suitcases
text: at the foot of the stairs.
text: EUGENE wheels into the room.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I have your samples ready.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples
dialog: where I'm going.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (meeting Jerome's gaze)
dialog: No, but you might need them when you get back.
text: Eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door. The
text: water vapor billows out. Jerome regards Eugene.
text: Eugene leads Jerome inside for the first time.
text: Inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators.
text: They contain thousands of blood and urine specimens.
text: Jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
text: EUGENE points out an extra specimen of semen in the first
dialog: refrigerator.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: There's an extra specimen. I wish I
dialog: could give it to her myself.
dialog: (afterthought)
dialog: But then, you always were better at being me.
text: Eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (struggling to come to terms
dialog: with the discovery)
dialog: Why have you done this?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
text: (as he seals the mirrored door)
dialog: In case you get back before I do.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (glancing to the suitcases)
dialog: I'm travelling too.
text: Jerome goes to question Eugene's travel plans but thinks better
text: of it. He kneels before his friend and embraces him.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I got the better end of the deal. I just
dialog: lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
text: Jerome smiles and hugs Eugene a final time. Eugene stuffs an
text: envelope into Jerome's pocket.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (referring to the note,
dialog: glancing heavenwards)
dialog: Not until you're upstairs.
text: Jerome exits. Eugene watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. GATTACA - DEPARTURE LOUNGE. NIGHT.
text: JEROME enters a large holding area along with his other eleven
scene_heading: CREW MEMBERS.
text: Jerome's heart sinks as he recognizes LAMAR, greeting the crew
text: for one final unexpected substance test. His colleagues
text: groan good-naturedly but it is clearly far more than an
text: inconvenience to Jerome. He looks towards the door he has just
text: entered but there is no way back. One by one the crew are
text: ushered behind a screen. Before he can think of a way out, it
text: is Jerome's turn. He enters the cubicle.
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: (as he takes the plastic cup from Lamar)
dialog: What's this, Lamar?
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: New policy.
text: From behind, we see Jerome unzip his fly. However for once
text: Jerome does not urinate on cue - unused to operating his own
text: equipment in front of the physician.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (intrigued by the
dialog: out-of-character discharge)
dialog: Flight got you nervous?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: There's a problem, Lamar.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (apparently not listening)
dialog: Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome? He's
dialog: a big fan of yours. He wants to apply here.
text: Jerome realizes he has no choice. Resigned to his fate, he
text: begins to fill the cup.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: (as he urinates)
dialog: Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up
dialog: and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: --Unfortunately my son's not all that they
dialog: promised. But then, who know what he could do.
text: Lamar takes the cup from Jerome in his gloved hand. Jerome
text: anxiously watches his sample poured into the analyzer.
text: Confirming Jerome's worst fears, the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT
text: appears on the computer screen. However Lamar does not look at
text: the screen. He stares Jerome in the eye.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: For future reference--
dialog: (a brief glance to where
text: Jerome has just zipped his fly)
dialog: --righthanded men don't hold it with their
dialog: left. It's just one of those things.
text: Never lookig at the screen, Lamar presses a button marked,
dialog: "VALID".
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (knowing smile)
dialog: Have a safe trip, Vincent.
text: Jerome exits up a long enclosed escalator, realizing that Lamar
dialog: has known all along.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: EUGENE knocks back a vodka. With a certain reverence he places
text: his silver medal around his neck.
scene_heading: INT. ESCALATOR. NIGHT.
text: At the top of a long escalator, the door to a craft is secured.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT.
text: Eugene's wheelchair, empty, sits beside the door of the
dialog: incinerator, also secured.
scene_heading: EXT. LAUNCHPAD. NIGHT.
text: A CLOSE UP of the flame of a rocket's engines igniting - the
text: ball of fire engulfs the launchpad - filling the screen.
scene_heading: INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM - INCINERATOR. NIGHT.
text: Inside the incinerator another ball of fire - this time
text: engulfing the unseen figure of EUGENE. We glimpse the medal
text: around his neck, melting in the fierce blaze.
scene_heading: EXT. GATTACA - LAUNCHPAD. NIGHT.
text: As we have seen so often in the past, a rocket launches into
text: the sky over Gattaca - however on this occasion it carries
dialog: Jerome.
scene_heading: INT. SPACECRAFT. NIGHT.
text: We focus on JEROME's face - seeing little if any of the craft.
text: Jerome's eyes are closed. His head is still - alarmingly still.
dialog: Could the launch itself have been too much for him? He hear the
text: thoguhts in his head.
speaker_heading: <i>JEROME (VO)
dialog: We came from the stars so they say, now
dialog: it's time to go back. If I was conceived
dialog: today, I would not get beyond eight cells,
dialog: and yet here I am. In a way they were
dialog: right, I don't have the heart for this world.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The question is, why am I having so much
dialog: trouble dying?</i>
text: Jerome's eyes blink open. He holds the letter from Eugene in
text: his hand. It contains no words, merely a lock of EUGENE'S hair
dialog: - for once preserved solely for its sentimental value. The
text: hair, weightless, floats off the page.
text: We focus on a porthole looking out upon a starscape.
speaker_heading: A STARSCAPE
text: As we pan across the constellations, a title is superimposed
dialog: upon the starscape:
dialog: <i>In a few short years, scientists will
dialog: have completed the Human Genome Project,
dialog: the mapping of all the genes that make
dialog: up a human being.
dialog: After 4 billion years of evolution by the
text: slow and clumsy method of natural selection,
dialog: we have now evolved to the point where we
dialog: can direct our own evolution.</i>
text: The first title is replaced in the heavens by a second title.
dialog: <i>If only we had aquired this knowledge
dialog: sooner, the following people would never
dialog: have been born:</i>
text: A succession of portraits and photographs of RENOWNED and
text: HISTORIC FIGURES fades in and out of the constellations - the
dialog: accompanying titles list their affliction rather than their
dialog: accomplishments.
