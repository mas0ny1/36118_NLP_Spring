text: RUBEN BRANDT (45) is alone in the railcar, sitting by the

text: through the empty hallway. The train goes into a tunnel. The
text: hallway is dark. He goes in to the bathroom. He washes his
text: hands while whistling.
text: Suddenly, a little boy appears in the background. The boy
text: wears breeches and a shirt, stands in the bathtub and stares
text: Ruben in the face.
text: Ruben wakes up in the railcar. Another boy (FRANK DUVENECK’S
text: WHISTLING BOY, 8), holding a snail, is sitting in front of
text: him, stares straight into his eyes while whistling.
text: A window abruptly falls open and a strong gust of wind slaps

text: The moment Ruben leaps over and catches the girl by her thin

text: Ruben screams with pain, trying to pull his hand out of the
text: girl's mouth, but the girl is much stronger and she slowly
text: pulls him out of the train.
text: Ruben is struggling to no avail. He desperately turns his
text: head towards the boy, seeking help. The boy watches
text: indifferently and keeps whistling his tune.
text: Only Ruben's feet remain in the railcar; but to his horror,
text: he notices the approaching lights of a locomotive on the
