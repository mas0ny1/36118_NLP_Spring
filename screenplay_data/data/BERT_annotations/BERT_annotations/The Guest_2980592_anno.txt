dialog: August 12, 2013
dialog: (Final shooting draft)
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING
text: In the light of early morning, a young man RUNS along the
text: side of a country road. He has a MILITARY RUCKSACK slung
text: over his shoulders and is wearing an ARMY uniform.
text: The young man’s hair is cropped short and he has an
text: athletic build. Although he is running steadily at a fast
text: rate, the man’s breathing is quiet and regular.
text: The man in the army uniform continues to run as an old
text: PICK-UP TRUCK appears in the distance behind him.
scene_heading: INT. ANNA’S CAR - EARLY MORNING —- CONTINUOUS
text: ANNA PETERSON, a pretty 20 year old with dark hair,
text: drives the pick-up truck down the country road. Her eyes
text: are tired and her mascara smeared, as if she has been up
dialog: all night.
text: Anna looks through her windshield at the man running on
text: the side of the road. He is running in the same direction
text: that Anna is driving, so she sees only his back.
text: Anna frowns slightly at this sight, then continues
text: driving, moving past the young man as he runs along.
text: Glancing at her rearview mirror, Anna watches his figure
text: recede into the distance behind her.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - A HALF HOUR LATER
text: Anna pulls her truck into the driveway of a single-story
text: house surrounded by fields of dead grass. Two other cars
text: are parked in the driveway, an SUV and a station wagon.
text: Paper HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS hang outside of the house,
text: and a homemade GHOST stands in the front yard, facing the
text: street, its eyes black holes etched into white bedsheet.
text: Anna climbs out of the truck. Behind her, the sun is
text: beginning to rise, filling the sky with pale light.
text: Anna regards the ghost standing in front of her, then
text: heads towards the house.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MORNING
text: Anna opens the front door to the house and enters, moving
text: quietly, as if trying to not be heard.
text: Anna softly shuts the door behind her. She turns and sees
text: her father, SPENCER PETERSON, 40s, seated on the couch in
text: the dim morning light, watching her. He is wearing slacks
text: and a dress shirt and holding a mug of coffee.
text: Anna slumps back against the closed front door, startled.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh. Hey.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You’re up early.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Not really. Where have you been?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I worked late, then went over to
dialog: Kristen's. I told mom.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: It’s six in the morning, Anna.
text: Anna moves from the door, towards the hallway.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, um. I fell asleep. Sorry.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: If you're going to stay under our roof,
dialog: you need to respect our rules.
text: Walking down the hall, Anna replies without looking back.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I said I was sorry.
text: Alone, Spencer stands in the front room, facing the hall.
text: The sound of Anna CLOSING her bedroom door is audible.
text: Spencer turns to the mantle above the fireplace. A
text: plastic jack-o’-lantern sits next to photos of a young
text: man smiling, in various settings. This is CALEB PETERSON.
text: There is a shot of Caleb in a football uniform and, most
text: recently, a posed shot of him in an army uniform,
text: standing with a group of soldiers in front of a military
text: vehicle. An AMERICAN FLAG is folded into a glass frame
text: that hangs over these photos.
text: Spencer exhales, his shoulders slumping.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING
text: Luke and Spencer sit across from each other at the dining
text: room table. Luke is eating breakfast cereal.
text: LAURA PETERSON, Anna’s mother, enters the room with a
text: travel mug of coffee, which she sets in front of Spencer.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Thank you.
text: Laura sits down and begins sipping from a mug of tea.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Do you know when Anna got in last night?
dialog: I didn’t hear her.
text: Spencer hesitates.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: I think I heard her come in just before
text: midnight. Her car’s in the driveway.
text: Laura nods absently. Spencer turns to Luke.
speaker_heading: SPENCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Luke. You asked any girls to the fall
dialog: dance yet?
text: Luke flushes and looks down at his cereal bowl.
speaker_heading: SPENCER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s a no?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I told you, dad. I’m not interested in
dialog: any of the girls at my school.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Ah, well. Wait ‘til you get off to
dialog: college. You done with breakfast?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Spencer rises to his feet and kisses Laura on the cheek.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: See you later.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Okay. Drive safe.
text: Luke gets up from the table, shouldering his backpack.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Bye, mom.
text: Spencer and Luke exit through the front door.
text: For a long moment, Laura stands in the suddenly quiet
text: room, staring off into space. Then she blinks and begins
text: collecting the used dishes from the dining table.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY
text: Laura sits on the sofa, in front of the television. The
text: TV set is on off and she is not looking at it, her gaze
text: resting somewhere in the middle of the floor.
text: The doorbell RINGS.
text: Laura looks up, startled. She clumsily rises to her feet,
text: straightens her clothing, then moves to the front door
text: and opens it.
text: The YOUNG MAN in army uniform who Anna saw running is
text: standing on the porch, facing away from the door, as if
text: surveying the front yard. He is still carrying his
text: rucksack, his back to Laura.
text: Laura gasps, her eyes widening. The young man turns to
text: her, smiling politely. He is very good looking, in a
text: boyish way, with very short blond hair. This is DAVID.
text: David takes in Laura’s expression. He frowns, concerned.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mrs. Peterson?
text: Laura blinks, swallowing.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yes, um, I’m sorry. I just...
dialog: (trails off)
dialog: Who are you?
text: David extends his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My name is David, Mrs. Peterson.
text: They shake hands, briefly.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew your son, Caleb. We served
dialog: together. We were friends.
text: Laura takes this in.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Won’t you come inside?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you, ma’am. That would be nice.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: David sits at the dining room table, his rucksack on the
text: floor next to him. His hands are folded on the table in
text: front of him. He looks around the room with interest.
text: From the kitchen, Laura calls out to him:
speaker_heading: LAURA (0.S.)
dialog: Are you sure I can’t get you anything?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe just some water would be nice.
text: Laura comes into the room with a glass of ice water,
text: which she hands to David.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, ma’am.
text: David drinks the water, obviously very thirsty.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: How, um, how did you get here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I ran. I needed the exercise.
dialog: (off Laura’s look)
dialog: From the bus station, I mean. In town.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: But that must be at least twenty miles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I guess so. Probably about that.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You ran all that way?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, ma’am. Of course, I didn’t exactly
dialog: know how far outside of town you all
dialog: lived when I started. The guy at the bus
dialog: station who gave me directions made it
text: sound like it was only a mile or two.
text: David smiles ruefully.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: When did you, um, get out?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was just discharged on Wednesday. I
dialog: came straight here from Fort Kennilworth.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You came here first thing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. I wanted to come by sooner, but I
dialog: couldn’t get leave.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I was discharged because I was
dialog: wounded. I was in a military hospital for
dialog: a bit, so it wasn’t really the kind of
dialog: thing I could get leave from. But don’t
dialog: worry, it was just a bit of shrapnel in
text: my back. I’m right as rain now.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No, I mean, why, um-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, why I’m here? Well, like I said, me
dialog: and your son, Caleb, we were pretty
dialog: close. I was with him when he died.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (strained)
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, ma’am. And one of the things he
dialog: asked was for me to check on you all.
dialog: You, and your whole family here. And he
dialog: wanted me to tell you that he loved you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: He specifically wanted me to tell each
dialog: one of you that he loved you and that he
dialog: was thinking of you guys up until the
dialog: end. I said I’d do that, so here I am.
text: Laura nods slowly.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Would you hold on a moment, please?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course.
text: Laura rises from her chair, exiting the room. David
text: drinks from his glass of water.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - LAUNDRY AREA - MOMENTS LATER
text: In a small laundry area, Laura leans over the washing
text: machine, SOBBING, a dish towel clamped tightly over her
text: mouth to muffle the sound.
text: After a moment, Laura straightens, as if trying to
text: compose herself. She rubs her face with the dish towel.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Laura enters from the hallway, her face dry but still
dialog: flushed.
text: David is no longer in the dining room. Laura looks
dialog: around.
text: David is standing in the front room, his rucksack on the
text: floor next to him, in front of the mantle. He is looking
text: over the photos of Caleb, surveying each one.
text: Laura moves into the room behind David. He turns to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s me.
text: David points at the photo of the soldiers posing in front
text: of the military truck. Laura moves up closer to look.
text: In the photo, leaning against the tank a few feet away
text: from the other soldiers, is a YOUNGER VERSION OF DAVID,
text: his head shaved. He is squinting into the camera.
text: Laura blinks, examining the photo.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Well, I’1l be.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I remember that day.
text: David looks at the photo in silence for another second,
text: then leans down and lifts his rucksack.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: It wasn’t my intention to upset you,
dialog: ma’am. I probably should have called
dialog: first, but I don’t own a phone yet and I
dialog: guess I just wasn’t thinking. I’m going
dialog: to be on my way, but I’d like it if we
dialog: could exchange emails or something.
text: As David turns away, Laura reaches out and grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No!
text: David turns towards her, surprised.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: Um, Anna, Caleb’s sister, she works
dialog: nights, so she sleeps late. But I’m sure
dialog: she'd like to meet you. Won’t you stay a
dialog: bit longer?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’re not just saying that to be polite?
dialog: Because you don’t need to be.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I’m not. Please stay. It’s nice having
dialog: you here and I’d like to hear more
dialog: about... about you and Caleb.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well. Alright.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna lies on her bedsheets in her underwear, her eyes
text: closed. The sound of LAUGHTER echoes in the house.
text: Anna's eyes blink open. She looks around, puzzled.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Both David and Laura are sitting on the sofa. Laura is
text: smiling, listing to David tell a story.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ---and so Caleb and me, we figure, well,
dialog: that sounds more like a challenge than
dialog: anything else. So that night, after he
dialog: falls asleep, we kind of crept over to
text: his cot with a tube of superglue-
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh no!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, nah, we didn’t do anything too bad to
dialog: him - though we could have.
text: Anna enters the room, wearing a short-skirted DINER
text: UNIFORM. David immediately rises to his feet. Anna
text: regards him with confusion.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: There you are! Anna, this is David.
text: David walks over to Anna, extending his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m very pleased to meet you. Caleb told
dialog: me a lot about you.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: David just got discharged this week. He
dialog: was friends with your brother.
text: Anna politely takes David’s hand and releases it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You knew Caleb?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, ma’am. I promised him I’d check in
dialog: on you guys if anything happened, so,
dialog: here I am.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: “Ma'am”? Okay. Where do you live?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I’m originally from just outside of
dialog: Louisville.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: But I was thinking maybe I’d head down to
dialog: Miami or Fort Lauderdale, see if I can’t
dialog: find work as a bartender or something.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What about your family? Are they in
dialog: Louisville?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, ma’‘am. My folks are both gone, and
dialog: that’s it for me. I didn’t have a big
dialog: family like you all do.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh. I’m very sorry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't be. They died when I was a kid.
dialog: Long time ago. I don’t remember it or
dialog: nothin’.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So where are you staying?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I noticed a motel off the highway on the
dialog: way here, so I'll likely stay there. And
dialog: then I’1l be on my way tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh, no, no. You'll stay with us while
dialog: you're here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I couldn’t put you all out.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Nonsense. We’d love to have you. We have
dialog: plenty of room. Why... you could stay in
text: Caleb’s old room.
text: Anna stares at her mother.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: We insist.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I won’t argue. Just for tonight, though.
text: Anna clears her throat.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’ve got to get to the diner. So, um...
dialog: Nice to meet you, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Likewise. Very nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I guess I’1ll see you again later.
text: Anna glances at her mother, then leaves the house through
text: the front door. Laura turns to David.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Let me show you your room.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The door to a small bedroom opens and Laura steps inside,
text: followed by David, who surveys the room.
text: The bedroom is adorned with sports posters and trophies,
text: as well as a framed high school diploma. The bed is made.
text: A stack of folded clothes rests on the floor.
text: Laura looks quietly around the room.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: There are clean towels in the bathroom if
dialog: you’d like to freshen up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That would be nice.
text: Laura smiles and moves to exit.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Mrs. Peterson. Are you sure you’re
dialog: comfortable with me staying in here?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Of course. I mean, it’s not like it’s
dialog: going to any use.
dialog: (blinks)
dialog: It'll be a good thing for us.
text: Laura exits the room, shutting the door behind her.
text: David stands completely still, alone in the bedroom. He
text: then slowly turns, looking around the room.
dialog: 12.
text: Caleb's old bedroom has a large window, through which
text: trees in the front yard are visible. Power lines lead
text: along the narrow road that passes the house.
text: After a moment, David moves to sit on the bed. He sits
text: without moving, looking straight ahead.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
text: A BELL RINGS and students flood the school hallway,
text: moving to their lockers and exiting the school. Paper
text: Halloween decorations line the walls, and a large orange
text: sign at the end of the hallway reads:
scene_heading: “SIGN UP FOR FALL DANCE - MAPLEWOOD BARN, OCTOBER 31st,
text: HALLOWEEN NIGHT!”
text: Luke carries his backpack slung across both shoulders,
text: his thumbs in the straps.
text: Up ahead, three older boys in football jerseys are
text: laughing, two of them shoving each other. Luke lowers his
text: head, looking at the floor as he walks forward.
text: One of the boys, MIKE, a senior, notices Luke slouching
text: towards them. He glances at his friends.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, watch this.
text: The group of seniors part to let Luke walk between them.
text: At the last moment, Mike spins and SHOVES Luke into the
text: wall BY HIS FACE.
text: Luke slumps against the lockers, holding his face. Mike
text: addresses him as they pass by.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking pussy.
text: The other two seniors, IAN and JASON, laugh. The three
text: boys continue down the hallway.
text: Luke stays leaning against the wall, holding his face
text: with both hands.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA'S CAR - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Laura sits at the steering wheel of an SUV parked outside
text: the high school. Teenagers boisterously cross the street
text: in front of her vehicle, shouting at each other.
dialog: 13.
text: The passenger door opens and Luke climbs into the SUV,
text: setting his backpack on the floor. He shuts the door
text: after him and fastens his seat belt.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Hey there. How was your day?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It was good.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Great.
text: Laura starts the car and pulls away from the curb.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Luke sits quietly across from David at the dining room
text: table. They are alone in the room. Luke addresses David.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You knew my brother?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I did, pretty well, yeah. He wanted me to
dialog: tell you he loved you.
text: There is a short pause.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
text: David and Luke continue to sit in silence.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Laura and Spencer stand in the hallway nearby, speaking
text: intently in whispers.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Laura, we can’t just invite a stranger to
dialog: stay with us, even if he says he was
dialog: friends with Caleb!
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: He’s in the photo of Caleb’s squad! It’s
dialog: not like he’s some stranger!
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: What if he’s got the, uh, the P.T.S.D. or
dialog: whatever it is? A lot of these guys
text: coming back, they have problems.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That is just great, Spencer. You know,
dialog: what if Caleb had come back different?
text: Spencer glares at Laura.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: That’s not at all fair.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Laura and Spencer's whispered conversation is just barely
text: audible from the dining room, the words unintelligible.
text: David and Luke sit at the table, as before. David looks
text: towards the hallway as if Laura and Spencer's
text: conversation is clearly audible to him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your parents are fighting about me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. They argue a lot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Huh.
text: David considers Luke, then points up towards his own eye.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You look like you got hit or something.
text: Luke reaches up self-consciously and touches his face,
text: the side of which is red and swollen, near his eye.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, I- I got hit with a football in gym
dialog: class. I wasn’t paying attention.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That can happen.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Spencer walks into the dining room from the living room,
text: his shoulders tense. He speaks with flat cheer.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Okay. Well. We’re very glad to have you
dialog: here, David. Will you have a beer? I’m
dialog: having one.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Suit yourself.
text: Spencer exits the room, towards the kitchen. Laura enters
text: the dining room from the living room.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Dinner will be ready in an hour. Luke,
dialog: you should do some homework.
text: Luke rises from the table and exits. Laura smiles kindly
text: at David, then moves into the kitchen.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILL - NIGHT
text: Anna lies on a blanket that is positioned on the side of
text: a hill, staring up at the night sky. Next to her, ZEKE
text: HASTINGS, mid-20s, lights a marijuana pipe and exhales
text: smoke up into the cool air.
text: Anna’s truck and a van that belongs to Zeke are both
text: parked near a gravel road behind them. MUSIC plays from a
text: tinny battery-powered boombox next to their blanket.
text: Anna checks the time on her cell phone, sighs, and sits
text: up. She begins pulling on her boots.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’ve got to go home.
text: Zeke offers the pipe to Anna, who shakes her head, tying
text: her bootlaces. Zeke lights it again, inhaling.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: This friend of your brother’s, he
dialog: sticking around?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t know. I hope not.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Why not? You said you liked him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I said he seemed nice. That’s not the
dialog: same thing.
text: Anna finishes tying her boots.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Okay. Why don’t you like him?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t not like him.
text: Zeke rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just... I mean, you kind of knew
dialog: Caleb. We’ve all... I know mom and dad
dialog: have been trying to move on. It’s not
dialog: like they don’t have enough reminders of
dialog: him in this town. Hell, they’ve kept that
text: bedroom like a shrine to him.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I mean, that seems normal. Your kid dies.
dialog: That’s hard.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We just don’t need a walking, breathing
dialog: reminder of Caleb hanging around right
dialog: now, you know?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Yeah. Totally.
text: Anna turns to Zeke to kiss him goodbye. Zeke embraces
text: her, pulling her back onto the blanket, kissing her
text: again. Anna laughs.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You sure you can’t stay longer?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m going to be late as is. But I’m sure
dialog: we can find some time at the party
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Great.
text: Anna returns Zeke’s smile, then rises from the blanket,
text: grabbing her purse. She crosses behind Zeke, heading to
dialog: her truck.
text: Zeke watches as Anna climbs inside her pick-up truck. She
text: starts its engine and drives away. Zeke then turns to
text: stare out over the hill, again lighting his pipe.
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
text: Luke is doing homework on the living room floor, papers
text: spread in front of him. David sits cross-legged next to
dialog: Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: The sine is the angle of the ship’s
dialog: anchor cable, so the cable is the
dialog: hypotenuse, and what we need to find out
text: is the distance down to the ocean bottom,
dialog: so that’s the opposite. Do you see?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Not at all. I was never too good at this
dialog: stuff, I guess that’s why I went into the
dialog: military. You don’t need to know much
dialog: there. Can’t you just punch those numbers
dialog: into a computer and it’1l do it for you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Maybe. But it doesn’t take that much
dialog: longer to just work it out for yourself.
text: Spencer is seated in front of the television, drinking a
text: beer. He glances over, watching David work with Luke.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So you're kind of smart, huh?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I guess so. I can give you an easy one.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, no thanks.
text: The front door opens and Anna enters the house. She shuts
text: and locks the door behind her.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: How did work go?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Good. Not too busy.
text: Spencer finishes his beer and rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: David, sure I can’t get you a beer?
text: David looks at Spencer, then nods.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know, I will have one.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’1l take one, too.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Nice try.
text: Spencer turns away.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m twenty-one in a month!
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: And you can have all the beer you want
dialog: then, assuming you buy it yourself.
text: Spencer exits. Anna takes in David and Luke.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are you helping him with his homework?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not exactly.
text: Spencer returns, carrying two bottles of beer. David
text: rises and takes one. Anna moves to the hallway.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Stay here, be sociable.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m not feeling so great. I think I’m
dialog: just going to lie down.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Suit yourself.
text: Anna exits the front room.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna enters the hallway, moving towards her bedroom.
text: Anna stops at the door to Caleb’s room. She hesitates.
text: Spencer’s voice can be heard in the front room. David
text: says something imperceptible in reply and Spencer laughs.
text: Anna turns the doorknob to Caleb’s room and steps inside.
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna walks into Caleb’s room, leaving the door behind her
text: open. The room appears much as before. David’s rucksack
text: rests on the floor, mostly empty.
text: Anna looks towards the doorway, then crouches down and
text: peers into David’s rucksack. She reaches inside,
text: searching its contents.
text: The bag contains only undergarments, socks, and a tube of
text: deodorant. Anna straightens up.
text: Anna looks around the room, taking in Caleb’s belongings.
text: She sighs, then sits down on the bed.
text: Anna looks down at the pillow she is sitting on. She
text: shifts her weight and lifts up the pillow.
text: A polished PISTOL is beneath the pillow on Caleb's bed.
text: Anna takes this in, then carefully puts the pillow back
text: into place over the gun, as before.
text: Anna starts to stand up, looking to the door. DAVID IS
text: STANDING in the doorway to the room, WATCHING HER.
text: Anna gasps and quickly stands, taking a step back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey there.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I, um, I’m sorry. I just... I just come
dialog: in here sometimes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, it’s okay. I’m sorry to have
dialog: interrupted you. Don’t mind me.
text: David moves quietly from the doorway, towards the
text: bathroom. Anna rapidly exits Caleb’s bedroom, heading
text: towards her own room.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Anna enters her bedroom, shutting and locking the door
text: behind her. She looks around her room, breathing quickly.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Spencer and David sit in front of the television, several
text: empty beer bottles in front of them. They are watching a
text: sports show, the volume low. Spencer’s voice is slurred.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: You see, Allan, he’s only been there four
dialog: years. But since he’s got a degree,
dialog: suddenly he’s regional manager.I know
text: Laura, she wonders what's going on, if
dialog: I’m ever going to make any money.
text: Spencer goes silent, immersed in thought.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your wife seems to respect you, sir.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So what about you? What are your plans?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I haven't really given that much thought.
dialog: Figured I'd get on a bus tomorrow, head
dialog: towards Florida and start looking for
dialog: work. I’ve done contracting work before,
dialog: I’m sure I could find something.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: That's crazy. You... you should stay with
dialog: us a couple more days. Look for jobs
dialog: online.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I couldn’t impose on your hospitality any
dialog: longer, sir.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: No, that’s... and what’s with this “sir”
dialog: business? My name’s Spencer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Stick around, at least until you know
dialog: where you’re going. Okay?
text: David looks like he is thinking, then nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe just a couple more days.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Great.
text: Spencer finishes his beer, then looks at the bottle.
text: David reaches for a bottle on the table and finishes it
text: in several gulps, setting it down.
speaker_heading: SPENCER (CONT'D)
dialog: One more round to celebrate, then I’ve
dialog: got to get to bed. You can hold your
dialog: liquor, huh?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: You tired?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I don’t need much sleep.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Well. You have no idea what I’d give to
dialog: be your age again.
text: Spencer rises to his feet, heading towards the kitchen.
text: David watches him leave.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: In Caleb’s bedroom, David lies on the bed, fully dressed.
text: He is visible by moonlight coming in through the window.
text: David lies completely still. A breeze moves the barren
text: branches of the tree outside; they shift, CREAKING. David
text: glances over at this sound.
text: After a moment, David quietly rises from the bed.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Dozens of students pour out of the high school at the end
text: of the school day. Luke slouches among them, looking at
dialog: the ground.
text: Luke glances up, then stops when he sees DAVID SEATED in
text: the driver’s seat of Laura’s SUV at the edge of the
text: school’s parking lot.
text: Luke looks around, then walks over and gets into the car.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Luke shuts the passenger door, glancing over at David.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I told your mom I could pick you up from
dialog: school today. That cool?
text: Luke nods. David surveys the students exiting the school.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t you, like, have any friends?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I have lots of friends.
text: David looks over at Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just not, like, here. Like, online.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah.
text: David continues looking at the kids exiting the school.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Are we going?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: In a little bit.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You should show me who hit you yesterday.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I got hit with a football.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
text: Luke meets David’s eyes, then lowers his gaze.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing bad.
dialog: 23.
text: Luke looks at David, as if considering. He then points.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Over there.
text: David follows Luke’s gaze. A group of older students,
text: including Mike, Ian and Jason, surround two pick-up
text: trucks in the parking lot, one of their stereos playing
text: loud music.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All of them?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, most of them give me a hard time.
dialog: Those two guys, Mike and Ian, are the
dialog: worst. Those guys are real assholes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Which is which?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Ian's the big one, Mike’s the guy with
dialog: blond hair.
text: David watches as one of the pick-up trucks is driven away
text: by Jason. Mike and Ian climb into the second truck with
dialog: their girlfriends.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we go now?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
text: David starts the car and drives off the parking lot,
text: moving after Mike and Ian’s pick-up truck.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR DIVE BAR - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Driving Laura’s station wagon, David FOLLOWS the pick-up
text: from a distance, letting some cars get between them.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Luke watches David drive with growing concern. David
text: remains focused on the pick-up truck ahead of them.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 24.
text: Up ahead, the pick-up turns into the parking lot of a
text: small DIVE BAR. Jason’s pick-up truck is already parked
text: in the lot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They’re going to a bar?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, this place will serve you if you’re
text: on the football team.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I could use a drink. How about you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I could use a drink.
text: David steers the station wagon into the bar’s parking
text: lot. David opens his car door, then looks back at Luke.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You coming?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well. I’1l be inside if you change your
dialog: mind.
text: David climbs out of the car and shuts the door. Luke
text: watches him walk to the bar through the windows.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Luke hesitantly opens the door to the dark bar. It is
text: nearly empty, manned by a lone BARTENDER. David sits
text: alone at a table, facing the back of the bar, drinking
text: beer from a bottle.
text: The only other patrons are two OLDER MEN seated at the
text: bar and a group of FOUR HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR GUYS,
text: including Mike, Ian and Jason, who are gathered with an
text: equal number of GIRLS their age in two booths.
text: David looks up as Luke enters and waves him over.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Luke, over here, man.
dialog: 25.
text: Luke glances over at the bartender, then makes his way to
text: David's table, head lowered. Music blares from a jukebox
text: in the corner. Mike, Ian and their group stare at Luke.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Look at this shit. What the fuck?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Maybe that’s his boyfriend or something?
text: Luke ignores this. He sits down across from David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey.
text: David waves the bartender over. The bartender, a man in
text: his 30s, warily approaches their table.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I’m going to have to see some I.D.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's fine, he’s my brother, he’s just
dialog: going to chill with me.
text: Luke gives David a quick look. Off the bartender’s
text: reluctant gaze, David nods over at the booths where the
text: seniors are seated.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you I.D. all of them?
text: The bartender sighs.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you know how to make a fireball?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Cinnamon schnapps and Tabasco sauce, yep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s my drink of choice. Let me get one
dialog: of those, a coke for my brother, and I
dialog: can’t help but notice that those ladies
dialog: over there are drinking cheap beer. That
dialog: seems like a shame. I'd like to buy them
text: each a blowjob shot.
text: The bartender blinks down at David.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Are you serious?
text: David places a $100 bill on the table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am, yes.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Did you want to buy anything for their
dialog: fellas?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Do I look like I'd like to buy something
dialog: for their fellas?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Might be the polite thing to do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure, okay, fine. Okay, I’1l buy each one
dialog: of those guys there a cosmopolitan.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Ah. I don’t know what you’re going for,
dialog: but I was thinking a beer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: No. Blowjob shots for the ladies, and a
text: cosmopolitan for each of the guys.
text: David taps the $100 bill on the table, then lays another
text: on top of it.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You keep the change on that.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You got it.
text: The bartender lifts the two bills and quickly heads
text: behind the bar. Luke is regarding David.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Are you, like, rich?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Cash is easy to get.
text: David hums to the music on the jukebox, drumming his
text: fingers on the table. A moment later, the bartender
text: approaches David's table, setting down drinks.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Here’s your coke, and here’s your
dialog: fireball. Got their shots and cosmos
text: coming right up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks.
text: The bartender moves back behind the bar. David pushes his
text: fireball shot towards Luke. Its contents are red and
text: cloudy.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to try it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sure.
text: Luke reaches forward and takes a small sip. He
text: immediately sets the shot down, coughing.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah! God!
text: Luke reaches for his coke and takes several deep gulps,
text: then sets it down. His eyes are watering.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's like hot peppers. You drink that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
text: David takes a sip from the fireball. It appears to have
dialog: no affect on him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: How do you do that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You get used to it.
text: Behind Luke, the bartender crosses to the booths with a
text: tray filled with drinks. He hands out Irish cream shots
text: to the girls and pink martinis to the guys. The girl
text: seated next to Ian starts laughing loudly.
text: All of the seniors turn to look towards David, who
text: ignores them. Luke watches them apprehensively.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Uh... they look kind of annoyed.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. You said they play football? Caleb
dialog: used to play for the same school?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. He was really good.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But they still mess with you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. The guys at my school hate me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
text: Luke says nothing. Behind them, Ian rises, holding his
text: cosmopolitan. He walks towards David’s table, followed by
text: another one of the seniors, BLAIR.
text: Luke lowers his head. Ian reaches the table, martini
text: glass in hand. Blair moves to stand behind him. Ian
text: regards the seated David.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Hey, thanks for the drinks, man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I don’t want it, though. You can have it.
text: Ian FLINGS the contents of his glass into David’s FACE.
text: David sits, the drink running down his face. He calmly
text: wipes his eyes, then reaches for his FIREBALL SHOT.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah. Maybe you could try this instead?
text: David lightly tosses the fireball shot into Ian’s face.
text: Ian takes a step back, blinking. Then he SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: My eyes!
text: Ian hunches forward, clutching his eyes and HOWLING with
text: pain. Blair moves towards him, confused. David LAUGHS,
text: then rises to his feet.
text: David reaches past Blair and TAPS Ian’s shoulder.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey, over here.
text: David ducks back and Ian, blind, SWINGS his fist out. He
text: HITS BLAIR in the face, knocking him to the floor.
text: David again bursts into LAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha. Wow. Okay.
text: David stops laughing. He steps forward and PUNCHES IAN IN
text: THE NECK. Ian DROPS TO THE FLOOR.
text: Mike and Jason are moving towards David, who turns to
text: face them. Jason attempts to tackle David. David brings
text: his knee up into Jason’s face, sending him flying back.
text: Luke is on his feet, but seems to not know what to do. He
text: is abruptly SPUN AROUND by Mike, who PUNCHES LUKE in the
text: face, knocking him to the floor.
text: Luke lies on the floor, dazed. Mike moves to KICK Luke,
text: but is HIT FROM BEHIND WITH A POOL CUE by David. The
text: stick BREAKS across Mike’s back.
text: Mike falls to the ground next to Luke. Through Luke’s
text: blurred vision, he can see David stomping on Mike’s KNEE,
text: then ANKLE. BONES CRACK. Mike SCREAMS.
text: Luke blinks, losing consciousness.
text: Blair staggers to his feet. He grabs an empty beer bottle
text: and swings it down at David’s head.
text: David neatly sidesteps, pins Blair’s arm and pulls the
text: bottle from his grasp. He then SMASHES the bottle across
text: Blair's face, then JABS the BROKEN BOTTLE NECK into
text: Blair's shoulder.
text: Blair looks down, startled. BLOOD is dribbling from the
text: bottle neck protruding from his jersey. Blair’s eyes roll
text: up and he FAINTS, falling to the floor.
text: David looks around the room. Luke, Blair, Jason and Mike
text: are unconscious on the floor; Ian is sobbing underneath a
text: table, holding his eyes. The remaining senior girls are
text: cowering away from David in a booth.
text: David leans down and gently SLAPS Luke’s face.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Luke. Wake up.
dialog: 30.
text: Luke’s eyes open.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool.
text: David rises and approaches the bar. The bartender is
text: holding a sawed-off POOL STICK, frozen in place behind
text: the bar. The two old men shrink away from David.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys should get out of here.
text: Without a word, the two old men get up and exit. David
text: turns to the bartender, who defensively raises his pool
text: cue. David ignores the weapon.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Call the police and tell them the truth:
dialog: a gang of high school kids came in here
dialog: and demanded you serve them drinks. You
dialog: tried to I.D. them but they threatened to
dialog: cause trouble. There was a fight. You
dialog: didn’t really get a good look at the
dialog: other guys.
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Maybe they were from out of town.
text: The bartender looks at David.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Otherwise, I imagine you and this place
dialog: could get in trouble for serving minors.
dialog: I mean, this is what happens. Here.
text: David takes two more $100 bills from his pocket and sets
text: them down on the bar.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: For the damages.
text: The bartender hesitates, then lowers his pool stick.
text: David turns and pulls Luke to his feet. They exit, David
text: leading Luke out into the sunlight.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - - GARAGE - DAY - A HALF HOUR LATER
text: David pulls Laura’s SUV into the house’s garage, its
text: automated door closing behind them. He and Luke climb out
text: of the car. Luke winces, touching his head.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Ow. I think I have a concussion.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, you definitely have a concussion,
dialog: dude. You were out.
text: David walks to the door leading inside. Luke follows him
text: as they enter the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Luke and David enter the kitchen. David crosses to the
text: freezer, gathers a handful of ice cubes and drops them
text: into a dishcloth.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Should I go to the hospital?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: For, like, my brain.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh. No, it’1ll be fine. I used to get them
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh. Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Here.
text: David hands Luke the makeshift ice pack and they walk
text: into the front room.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Luke and David enter the front room. Laura and Anna are
text: seated, Anna sketching in a notebook. Laura rises when
text: she sees Luke holding the ice pack to his bruised face.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Luke! What happened?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I got in a fight with some guys at
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Are you okay?!
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, I’m fine. David helped me out.
text: Anna looks over at David, seeing his bloody knuckles.
text: Without looking at Anna, David puts his hands in his
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Some seniors were just picking on me. It
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Why were they picking on you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know. I’m going to my room, okay?
text: Luke exits. Laura turns quickly to David.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Is he alright?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, ma’am, he’s fine.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Did he get in any trouble with the
dialog: school? The police didn’t...?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, ma’am, no one saw. It’s just the
dialog: usual high school stuff. I told him I’d
dialog: teach him some self defense when he’s
dialog: feeling up to it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I’m sure that’s exactly what he needs.
text: David looks over at Anna.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Well. I’m relieved you were there.
text: David smiles. Anna, looking annoyed, rises to her feet.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m going to get ready for Kristen’s.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Anna, can I talk to you for a second?
dialog: 33.
text: Anna looks at Laura, who pointedly gestures for Anna to
text: join her in the kitchen.
text: Anna exits into the kitchen with Laura. They converse in
text: the kitchen in heated but barely audible whispers.
text: David sits down on the sofa, his face settling into a
text: blank mask. He stares straight ahead.
text: Anna’s VOICE comes from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ANNA (0.S.)
dialog: Really?! You're going to play that card?
text: Laura’s reply is inaudible. A moment later, Anna storms
text: out of the kitchen. She clears her throat.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: David, would you like to come to a party
dialog: with me tonight?
text: David looks up at Anna.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure, that sounds nice.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (barely concealed annoyance)
dialog: Great. I’m going to leave around seven.
text: David rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ll get ready, then.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna steps into the hall, wearing a small robe and
text: carrying clothes. She looks at the closed bathroom door.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Great.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Luke, I need to shower!
text: The bathroom door immediately opens and David steps out
text: in a haze of steam, wearing a towel around his waist.
text: David appears almost unnaturally fit, each muscle
text: defined. His tanned torso is also covered with flushed,
text: thick SCARS from dozens of cuts and wounds.
dialog: 34.
text: David moves towards the door to Caleb’s room, edging past
dialog: Anna
text: in the narrow hallway.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry. I wanted to shave.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, I- I’m sorry, I thought Luke was-—
dialog: Never mind.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m going to go get dressed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, um... You do, you do that.
text: As David faces away from Anna to enter Caleb’s room, a

scene_heading: PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - EVENING - LATER
text: enters the front room, wearing a black tank top and
text: tights with the outline of a skeleton printed on them.
dialog: Anna
text: stops when she sees David, who is quietly seated on
text: the couch, waiting for her. He is dressed in a
text: fashionable dress shirt and slacks.
text: David looks at Anna, then down at his own attire.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I, uh, borrowed some of Caleb’s clothes.
dialog: I hope you don’t mind. He was about the
dialog: same size as me, and I don’t own much in
dialog: the way of nice clothing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It’s fine.
text: Anna moves towards the front door. David rises.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You look nice.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
text: David follows Anna outside.
scene_heading: EXT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT - A HALF HOUR LATER
text: David and Anna walk from her car to Kristen’s house, a
text: small, unattractive duplex. Anna turns to face David.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So, look. This isn’t a big deal or
dialog: anything, but this isn’t just Kristen’s
dialog: place. My boyfriend, Zeke, lives here,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn’t know you had a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, well. Neither do my parents. And I
dialog: wouldn’t mind keeping it that way, at
dialog: least for now, if it’s alright with you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I won’t say anything. It’s none of my
dialog: business.
text: Anna nods gratefully. She rings the DOORBELL.
text: A moment later, KRISTEN, an attractive girl the same age
text: as Anna, opens the front door. Kristen is wearing CAT
text: EARS and a tail. She quickly hugs Anna, then takes in
text: David, who nods politely at her.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Who’s this?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is David, he was friends with my
dialog: brother, Caleb. I told you about him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Fine, thank you.

scene_heading: INT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Kristen leads David and Anna into her house, where a
text: small party is underway.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: Zeke’s out back, smoking. He was waiting
dialog: for help to carry the kegs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I‘ll bring them in. Where are they?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
text: In Zeke’s van. It should be unlocked.
text: David exits. Kristen leans towards Anna.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I am potentially interested in getting to
dialog: know your brother's friend.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Have at it.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Any pointers? Likes or dislikes?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Uh... He was in the army?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN

scene_heading: EXT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna and Kristen stand outside with Zeke and his friend
text: CRAIG, smoking. Craig offers a blunt to Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ugh, I wish. I can’t smoke tonight.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What, your houseguest?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, he’s-—
text: David emerges from the yard, CARRYING TWO KEGS. He has
text: one propped on his shoulder and is carrying the other
text: with one hand.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasn’t sure where you’d want these.
dialog: Back here?
text: Kristen gives Anna an incredulous look, then quickly
text: turns to David.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Yeah, here. Hang on, I'll get the tap.

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Craig-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure.
text: David takes the proffered blunt and inhales deeply.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: David passes the blunt back to Craig, who then pointedly
text: offers it again to Anna, who grimaces.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks.
text: Anna takes the blunt and inhales.
scene_heading: INT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT - AN HOUR LATER
text: MUSIC blares inside Kristen’s house and a few people are
text: dancing in her living room. Anna watches David from
text: across the room; David is conversing with Kristen.
text: Zeke approaches Anna and hands her a cup of beer.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m fine.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: You want to-?
text: Zeke gestures with his head back towards his room. Anna
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: On the other side of the room, David turns to watch Zeke
text: and Anna exit, then looks back to Kristen.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: -so what I told him was, even if I could
dialog: still trust you... Oh, goddammit.
text: Kristen trails off, looking at the door. A group of THREE
text: GUYS have walked in, glaring around the party
text: antagonistically. David follows her gaze.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who are they?
text: One of the guys, DREW, immediately locks eyes with
text: Kristen. He strides towards her.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Uh, that is my ex. The one I was telling
dialog: you about.
text: Drew comes up to Kristen and David. He ignores David, his
text: attention on Kristen.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey. I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I’m busy right now, Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I’ve been calling you all week, then I
dialog: hear you’re having a party tonight? What
dialog: the fuck?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I’m talking to my friend. You're being
dialog: rude.
text: Drew GRABS Kristen’s arm, pulling her away from David.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Listen, just come here-
dialog: 39.
text: David steps forward and GRIPS Drew’s WRIST, TWISTING IT,
text: causing Drew to release Kristen. Kristen takes a step
text: back, wide-eyed.
text: Startled, Drew yanks his arm away from David, facing him.
text: People at the party turn, noticing the altercation.
text: The TWO GUYS Drew came in with MOVE UP behind him. David
text: glances at them, but remains focused on Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking asshole.
text: Drew SHOVES David, pushing him back.
text: David shifts his weight slightly, then reaches out, GRABS
text: DREW'S HEAD and SMASHES IT INTO THE WALL, SHATTERING a
text: framed photo. Drew falls to the floor, unconscious.
text: Drew's two friends are frozen, staring at David. David
text: nods at Drew’s prone body.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get him out of here.
text: The two exchange a look, then lift Drew by his arms and
text: drag him out of the party. There is a round of APPLAUSE
text: from the rest of the party. Craig shouts out:
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Fuckin’ awesome!
text: David reaches down and picks up the photo he broke with
text: Drew's head. It is a photo of Kristen as a teenager, ina
text: cheerleader uniform.
text: Kristen is staring at David breathlessly. David carefully
text: picks broken glass out of the picture frame.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry about your photograph. I’1l buy
dialog: you a new frame.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: No, don’t worry about it. Did you- Did
dialog: you want to see the rest of the house?
text: David looks at her.
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - KRISTEN’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: David and Kristen make out in her bedroom, on her bed,
text: the lights dim. Kristen has her shirt off and is on top
text: of David, kissing him.
text: After a moment, Kristen stops, pulling slightly away.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Seems like you’re not really into this.
text: David blinks. Then he smiles and, in a swift motion,
text: rolls on top of Kristen, moving against her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I am.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Oh. You are.
text: David leans down and kisses Kristen’s neck, gripping her
text: wrists and pinning her to the bed.
scene_heading: INT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: David and Kristen emerge from her bedroom and cross to
text: the couch, where Craig is sitting, smoking marijuana. He
text: grins at them.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: There you guys are. Thought you’d left
dialog: your own party, maybe found a better one.
text: Craig offers the pipe to David while Kristen lights a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I’m good.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Cool. Hey, I wanted to say to you, man,
dialog: we're not, like, hippies or anything. I
dialog: wanted to say, I totally support what you
dialog: guys are doing over there. You need
dialog: anything here, you let me know.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Support us how?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I mean, like, I believe in what you guys
dialog: are doing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But you wouldn’t support us by, like,
dialog: enlisting?
text: Craig looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Nah, I mean, like... I’ve got asthma, you
dialog: know? Makes that kind of like...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: I’m just messing with you, man.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh no, cool. I mean, cool, I knew that.
text: Kristen rises from the sofa, patting David’s arm.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I’ll be right back.
text: David watches Kristen leave. Craig grins again.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: She’s fun, huh?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
dialog: (leans forward)
dialog: Could you get me a gun?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I mean, yeah, hell yeah. I can get youa
dialog: gun. What do you need a gun for, man?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m a soldier, dude. I like guns.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sure. I know a guy. It’ll be a few
dialog: hundred though, more for something fancy.
dialog: You got cash?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I do.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sure. I can set something up. Let me get
dialog: your number.
text: David pulls out a disposable cell phone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m using a burner right now. The
text: number’s on the back.
text: David hands the phone to Craig, who punches the number
text: into his own phone.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Perfect.
text: Anna comes into the party from the hallway, followed by
text: Zeke. They appear to be engaged in heated discussion.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Why is it even a big deal if I go on
dialog: tour? It’s three weeks, maybe. So what?
text: Anna turns to David.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: David, are you ready to go?
text: David takes his phone from Craig and rises.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure.
text: Zeke steps in front of Anna. David watches him.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Look, wait. Can we just talk about this?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I have to go, Zeke. Call me tomorrow.
text: Zeke turns away, exhaling.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Whatever.
text: Zeke exits the room. Anna blinks, then looks to David.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Let’s go, okay?
text: David nods. He shrugs at Kristen, then walks with Anna
text: towards the front door.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: EXT. KRISTEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
text: David and Anna walk to her car. Anna takes her keys out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ll drive.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, I’m fine.
text: David quickly steps in front of Anna. He touches the side
text: of her face, peering into her eyes. Anna inhales,
text: surprised, but does not shrink away.
text: David moves his hand down and smoothly pulls the keys
text: from her grasp.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ll drive. You're stoned.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wait. How are you more sober than me?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m bigger than you.
text: David unlocks Anna’s car and opens the passenger door for
text: her. Anna hesitates, then climbs inside.
scene_heading: INT. ANNA’S CAR - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
text: David drives quickly, shifting gears. Anna, in the
text: passenger seat, lights a cigarette. David glances at her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please put on your seat belt.
text: Anna fastens her seat belt. Her CD of 1980s goth music is
text: playing a slower song. David glances at her.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to talk about it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, it’s just... it’s nothing. We had an
dialog: argument. Old stuff. Zeke... When we
dialog: first started dating, I loved that he was
dialog: in a band. But now I’m saving up for
dialog: college, and he just isn’t moving on, you
dialog: know? Like, he doesn’t even have a job.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, he’s a drug dealer.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He’s not a drug dealer!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He sells drugs sometimes. Like, to
dialog: friends, to make extra cash.
text: David reaches up and adjusts the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well. If he’s messing things up with you,
dialog: then he’s a fool, and you don’t need to
dialog: worry about it.
text: Anna makes an incredulous noise. David looks over at her.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m serious. I mean, hell, if I'd hada
dialog: girl like you back home, you better
dialog: believe I wouldn’t have gone over to the
dialog: Middle East to get shot at.
text: Anna looks over at David. She smiles.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks.
text: David drives in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I like this music.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You do? It’s just a mix I made. I can
dialog: make you a CD if you’d like.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Can you put this song on it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. Of course.
text: David steers the car down the narrow road leading to
dialog: their house.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: David and Anna walk down the hallway together, towards
text: their bedrooms. They reach the door to Anna’s room first.
text: They stand near each other in the narrow hallway.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So, uh. Goodnight.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Goodnight. Thank you for inviting me out.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, um, no problem. Goodnight.
text: Anna enters her bedroom, shutting the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna stands just inside her bedroom door. She can hear
text: David's footsteps moving away, entering Caleb’s room.
text: Anna sighs and crosses her bedroom, taking off her shirt.
text: She collapses onto her bed, looking up at the ceiling.
text: After a moment, Anna rises from her bed. She moves over
text: to her bookshelf and pulls out a BLANK CD and a marker.
text: Anna writes on the CD: “MIX FOR DAVID.” She then moves
text: back to her bed and opens her laptop.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Anna leans back on her bed, slipping on her headphones.
text: She stares out the window, nodding her head slightly,
text: listening to the mix she just made. Anna smiles slightly,
dialog: to herself.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT WINDOWS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Through the front windows of Anna’s bedroom, she is
text: visible lounging on her bed, listening to her MUSIC
text: loudly on her headphones.
text: Anna shifts her position, closing her eyes. Without
text: opening them, she reaches up over her head and TURNS OFF
text: THE LIGHT. Anna’s room goes dark.
text: In the room next to Anna’s, also visible through the
text: front windows, David sits on Caleb’s bed, perfectly
text: still. He stares out the window, into the darkness
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Wearing an undershirt and pajama pants, Anna walks into
text: the kitchen and starts making herself tea.
dialog: 46.
text: Glancing outside, Anna sees David pacing in the backyard,
text: speaking into his disposable cell phone. His voice is
text: barely audible from inside.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: An orthodontist? I don’t... No, I don’t
dialog: need that. Fingers, yes.
text: David turns, pacing as he speaks into the phone. Anna
text: moves to the side of the window, out of view.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: As soon as possible. I already feel like
dialog: I’ve waited too long. Money’s no issue.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: David continues speaking into the phone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I understand money’s an issue for you. I
dialog: just meant I have it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I can be there. I’1l keep this phone in
dialog: case anything comes up and you need to
dialog: reach me. Copy.
text: David hangs up. He looks towards the house.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna sits on her bed, her netbook propped in front of
text: her. A military webpage is up on the screen. Anna speaks
text: into her cell phone.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, his name is David Andersen Collins.
dialog: I think I can tell you what unit he
dialog: served in if that helps.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, nothing’s wrong. He was friends with
dialog: my brother and we just heard he’s back,
dialog: so any contact information you could give
dialog: me would be helpful.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes, that’s my cell phone. Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. FORT KENILWORTH - VETERANS AFFAIRS OFFICE - DAY
text: A woman wearing an army uniform, SERGEANT HALWAY, speaks

scene_heading: SGT. HALWAY
dialog: Okay, ma’am. I’1l call you when I have
dialog: any information. Goodbye.
text: Sergeant Halway taps a button on her headset, terminating
text: the call. She looks at her computer screen.
text: The screen shows a records search form for a David

scene_heading: INT. KPG BUILDING - HALWAY - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: AUSTIN, a KPG employee in his 30s, strides quickly down a
text: hallway. He is carrying a FOLDER bearing a KPG logo and
text: speaking into a Bluetooth device.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Tell Fort Kenilworth that David Collins
dialog: is deceased. Just give them the official
dialog: version. We’ll take it from here.

text: as he continues down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. KPG BUILDING - MEETING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: In a meeting room, a man in a black suit, MAJOR CARVER,
text: sits at a long table across from three KPG EXECUTIVES in
text: similar attire. One of them, HENDRICKS, is speaking.
speaker_heading: HENDRICKS
dialog: I’m meeting with the rest of our board
dialog: next week to discuss the future of our
dialog: work with the military in light of
dialog: Project Aegolius’ dissolution. Richard
dialog: has some further information on that.
dialog: Richard?
text: Major Carver nods.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: I can’t get into too many details, nor
dialog: would you want me to. However, I can say-
text: There is a KNOCK on the door, interrupting Carver.
dialog: 48.
text: The door OPENS and Austin leans in, holding the folder.
text: He looks quickly at Major Carver.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I’m sorry to interrupt. Something’s come
dialog: up.
text: Major Carver looks at Austin, then nods, rising.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: You’1l have to excuse me.
text: Hendricks nods curtly. Major Carver exits the room.
scene_heading: INT. KPG BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Major Carver walks alongside Austin down the hallway,
text: rapidly perusing the contents of the folder.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: When did Fort Kenilworth receive this
dialog: call?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: About an hour ago, sir.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Have you I.D.ed the caller?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Not confirmed, but she gave her name as
dialog: Anna Peterson.
text: Major Carver stops walking.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Peterson...?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: She’s the sister of one of our nullified
dialog: subjects. Caleb Peterson.
text: Major Carver looks quickly at Austin.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Home address is in there.
text: Major Carver closes the folder and begins walking again,
text: quickly. Austin hurries after him.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Get me on the next flight. If we need to
dialog: charter something, do it. And I’m going
dialog: to need some shooters.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: If anyone asks what’s happening, what do
dialog: I tell them?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Make something up. No one outside of this
dialog: circle can know that any of our subjects
dialog: are still active, understood? If KPG gets
dialog: any blowback on this, you and I will both
dialog: be hung out to dry. Got that?
text: Austin nods.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Call me when you have a plane booked.
text: Austin quickly turns and heads down the hall as Carver
text: continues in the other direction.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK QUARRY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A pick-up truck is parked inside an abandoned rock
text: quarry. Craig stands next to the truck, along with an
text: older man, HIGGINS, who has tattooed hands.
text: David walks down into the quarry, appearing over its
text: horizon, carrying his rucksack. Craig and Higgins turn at
text: his approach.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: That him?
text: Craig nods and raises a hand in greeting; David returns
text: the wave as he approaches.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: Where’s your car?
text: David gestures behind him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I parked a way’s back. I felt like a
dialog: walk. I’m not late, am I?
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: No, you’re on time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: Before we start anything here, I’d like
dialog: to see that you’ve got some cash on you,
dialog: if you don’t mind.
text: Craig shrugs apologetically, but David is already
text: reaching into his rucksack. He takes out a thick envelope
text: of $100 bills, opening it for Higgins to see.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That should be good?
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: Yes, indeed.
text: David pockets the envelope. Higgins faces the truck.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Craig here didn’t seem to know exactly
dialog: what you might be looking for, so I
dialog: brought a few options.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good.
text: Higgins unlocks an aluminum box in the rear bed of the
text: pick-up truck, raising its lid. It is filled with
text: FIREARMS and boxes of BULLETS.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: You looking for a rifle or a handgun?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Handgun.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: Figured so. Now, some of these guns might
dialog: have numbers on them, and some don’t. The
dialog: prices vary, but they’re all in top
dialog: condition and ready to fire. Here...
text: Higgins reaches into the box and removes four handguns,
text: as well as two boxes of bullets. He carries this load
text: over to a flat rock area, followed by Craig and David.
text: Higgins sets down the guns, laying them out.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS (CONT'D)
dialog: You’ve got your Beretta there, I’m sure
dialog: you’re used to that one. Don’t know if
dialog: you've fired this before. Nine millimeter
dialog: Witness Elite. Similar weapon, but I
dialog: prefer the recoil action, almost no kick.
text: Higgins hands David a chrome pistol. David opens the
text: chamber, checking the gun, then begins rapidly TAKING THE
text: GUN APART, checking each piece. Higgins watches him.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS (CONT'D)
dialog: You army?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: Navy, myself. ‘Course, that was some time
dialog: ago.
text: David snaps the pieces of the pistol together,
text: reassembling it. He nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s fine.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: So. You'll take the Elite, then?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I’1l take all of them.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: All of the handguns?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. Everything. All your guns.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: You got the money for that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I’m going to kill you.
text: Craig goes still.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Uh, David...
speaker_heading: HIGGINS
dialog: Now, don’t get funny with me, boy.
dialog: 52.
text: Higgins reaches behind himself and pulls a SMALL REVOLVER
text: from a holster in his belt. He aims the gun at David.
speaker_heading: HIGGINS (CONT'D)
dialog: If you think I’d come-
text: David reaches out and GRABS the wheel of the revolver in
text: Higgins’ hand, holding it tightly.
text: With his other hand, David snatches up another revolver
text: and SNAPS IT OPEN.
text: Higgins, eyes suddenly wide, tries to COCK THE REVOLVER,
text: pulling the hammer back. The wheel rotates slightly, then
text: David squeezes the gun harder, STOPPING IT.
text: The bullet loaded in Higgins’ small revolver is just a
text: centimeter away from being under its hammer.
text: Using his free hand, David grabs a bullet and loads it
text: into the revolver without looking. He snaps the chamber
text: wheel in and raises the gun to aim it at Higgins, COCKING
text: IT. Higgins’ face goes slack. Craig stares, frozen.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Craig spins and starts RUNNING towards the quarry’s exit.
text: David pulls the trigger on the revolver aimed at Higgins.
text: The hammer hits an empty chamber. The gun CLICKS.
text: Higgins grabs onto the small revolver he is aiming at
text: David with BOTH HANDS-just as David pulls the trigger of
text: his revolver a third time, SHOOTING HIGGINS IN THE FACE
text: and BLOWING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD OFF.
text: As Higgins’ body jerks back, David yanks the small
text: revolver from his grasp.
text: Craig is RUNNING AWAY in the distance, nearing the exit
text: to the quarry, frantically scrambling up its slope.
text: David aims the small revolver out, inhales, then slowly
text: EXHALES. He shifts the gun so that it is pointed just
text: slightly in front of Craig and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
text: The gun FIRES.
text: For a fraction of a second, nothing happens. Then the
text: back of Craig’s head EXPLODES from the bullet’s impact
text: and Craig falls to the ground, his dead body skidding
text: through the gravel from its momentum.
text: David regards the two corpses in front of him for a
text: moment, then stands and wipes the small revolver clean on
text: his shirt. He kneels and places it in Higgins’ hand,
text: closing Higgins’ fingers around it multiple times.
text: David turns around. He collects all of the handguns and
text: bullets from the rock, placing them in his rucksack.
text: David then climbs into the back of the pick-up truck to
text: peer inside the aluminum box.
text: The box contains two single barrel SHOTGUNS and an
text: ASSAULT RIFLE, as well as boxes of bullets. David lifts
dialog: these out.
text: Beneath the assault rifles is a GRENADE. David looks at
dialog: it.

speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We're in here!
text: Spencer enters the kitchen, looking pale.
speaker_heading: SPENCER

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What-? Spencer, what is it?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: They found Allan, my boss. He’s been
dialog: missing from work the last couple of

text: Spencer takes a quick drink of whiskey.
speaker_heading: SPENCER (CONT'D)
text: They found him and his girlfriend dead.
dialog: They'd both taken pills, I guess he had
dialog: some prescriptions... It looks like a
dialog: suicide pact kind of thing.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh my god! But that- That doesn’t make
dialog: any sense. He was...
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Totally normal. Yeah. The police are
dialog: investigating. There was nothing in their
dialog: wall safe, but it wasn’t broken into...
dialog: but she had some bruises... I guess we'll
dialog: have to see what the police say.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Maybe one of them was like, dying of

speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: I guess we’ll find out.
text: Spencer finishes his drink.

speaker_heading: SPENCER (CONT'D)

dialog: As soon as corporate heard, I got a call.
dialog: They're offering me the same salary as

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh! That’s...
text: Laura trails off. Spencer nods and pours himself another
text: whiskey. He glances towards the doorway.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Hey, David. I didn’t hear you come in.
text: David is standing in the kitchen doorway, holding

dialog: hear about your colleague.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: That’s okay. Thank you. Care for a drink?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure. I'll be right back.
text: David exits, carrying his bags. Anna looks at her
text: parents. Her cell phone, in her pocket, rings.
text: Anna checks the number, then quickly exits the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna moves into the living room, answering her phone. She
text: speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Zeke?
scene_heading: INT. ZEKE’S VAN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke is speaking into his cell phone as he drives his van
text: down a side street. He is visibly upset.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Hey, Anna. I just- can you talk now?
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna looks towards the kitchen, then turns away.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Not really. I’m at home. What’s going on?
scene_heading: INT. ZEKE’S VAN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke turns the van around a corner, holding his phone.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: It's Craig, babe. They found him out in
text: the woods. Dead. He got shot.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna stares out the front windows, shocked.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What? But- who... Do they know who-?
speaker_heading: ZEKE (ON PHONE)
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. ZEKE’'S VAN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke continues talking into his phone as he drives. He
text: checks his side mirror and frowns.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: He was with some guy... I don’t know all
dialog: the details. Can you come meet me later?
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM
text: Anna looks out the windows. Behind her, out of view,
text: David stands on the stairs, very still, watching her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, of course. I have something else I
dialog: need to talk to you about, too.
scene_heading: INT. ZEKE’S VAN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke frowns, looking into his side mirror as he drives.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 57.
text: From behind Zeke, a POLICE SIREN chirps to life. Blue and
text: red POLICE LIGHTS FLASH.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit, babe, I got to go. Call you back.
text: Zeke quickly hangs up his phone, tossing it into the
dialog: passenger seat.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna frowns, the phone still to her ear.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What? Hello?
text: Anna looks down at her phone. Behind her, David audibly
text: moves forward, walking into the front room.
text: Anna spins to face David, startled. She looks down at her
text: phone again, then pockets it.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. I... I’m going out for a bit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
text: Anna opens the front door and quickly exits the house.
text: David watches through the windows as Anna climbs into her
text: car and drives away.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - NIGHT - ONE HOUR LATER
text: Anna enters a small, old-fashioned diner, looking around.
text: The diner is nearly empty, with just a few customers.
text: Kristen, wearing a diner uniform, quickly moves from
text: behind the counter and embraces Anna. Kristen looks as
text: though she has been crying.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. I just heard about it from Zeke.
dialog: How are you doing?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I’m fine... I just don’t get it. Who'd
dialog: want to hurt Craig? He was friends with
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I know. Can you sit down?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Yeah. I have to finish out my shift, but
dialog: Sebastian said I can take a break.
text: Anna and Kristen move over to an empty booth.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT STOOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: David and Luke sit out on the front stoop. In front of
text: them, the two PUMPKINS have been placed on a layer of
text: newspaper covering the concrete, along with two knives.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So how does this work?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: First you make a hole at the top, so you
text: can reach in and scoop all the guts out.
text: Luke takes a steak knife and begins sawing a hole in the
text: top of the pumpkin, with effort. David picks up a knife
text: and starts to do the same. David then stops, examining
dialog: the knife.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your parents’ knives suck.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: David sets down the steak knife he is holding, then
text: removes a BUTTERFLY KNIFE from his pants pocket.
text: Luke stares as David FLIPS the butterfly knife open.
text: Using the gleaming blade, David easily cuts a hole in the
text: top of his pumpkin.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s better.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Do you carry that on you, like, all the
dialog: time?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This knife? Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Just in case.
text: David resumes carving his pumpkin.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna and Kristen sit across from each other in a diner
text: booth. Anna drums her fingers, looking worried.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Something else happened... It’s kind of
dialog: weird. I called the army base David said
dialog: he was from. They told me David Collins
dialog: died a week ago. He was in a military
dialog: hospital in Idaho, there was a fire from
text: some oxygen tanks. About twenty people
dialog: died, David Collins was one of them.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Okay, so... wrong David Collins. Common
dialog: name. Come on, it’s the military.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: David Andersen Collins. The woman I
dialog: talked to emailed me a photo of him.
text: Brown hair, round face, acne problem.
dialog: Looked like a nice guy. Not David.
text: Kristen regards Anna seriously.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: You’re really worried about this?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. I am. A little.
dialog: Kristen considers.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Does David have any I.D.? Credit cards?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’ve never seen him use a wallet.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: What about his phone? He has a burner,
dialog: right? Why don’t you check some of the
dialog: numbers he’s called? Your brother knows
dialog: computers. Have him look them up.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. That’s a good idea. Thanks.
text: One of Kristen’s coworkers, a man wearing a bandana and
text: GRILL CHEF apron, stops by the booth. He speaks quietly,
text: nodding at a pair of seated customers.
speaker_heading: GRILL CHEF
dialog: Hey, Kristen. I think that couple’s been
dialog: done for a bit.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I’ve got it. Thanks.
text: Kristen rises. Anna does the same.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Call me when you get off, okay?
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I will. Take care of yourself.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You too.
text: Anna exits the diner as Kristen moves to a table.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM/DINING ROOM/KITCHEN -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: David and Luke carry their completed pumpkins in from
text: outside. Luke’s jack-o’-lantern is an ornate ghoulish
text: face, with detailed facial features. David’s is a
text: geometrically precise, traditional jack-o’-lantern.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you want some advice, Luke?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sure.
text: David sets his pumpkin and the butterfly knife down on
text: the kitchen table. He removes his jacket and tosses it
text: onto a nearby chair in the living room.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Never let anyone pick on you. Otherwise,
dialog: you'll carry it with you forever. Those
dialog: guys at school, they’re bigger than you?
text: Luke sets his jack-o’-lantern down on the kitchen
text: counter. He looks at it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then bring a knife to school. If they
dialog: take it away from you and beat you up, go
dialog: to their houses at night and burn them
dialog: down with their families inside. What’s
dialog: the worst they can do?
text: Luke does not look particularly convinced by this.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Here.
text: David CLOSES the butterfly knife and hands it to Luke.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep it.
text: Luke takes the knife from David. He awkwardly opens it,
text: using both hands, and then shuts it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You’re giving this to me?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, man, it’s yours. I’ve got others.
text: The front door opens in the next room. Luke quickly
text: POCKETS the knife as Anna steps inside. David looks over
text: at her from the kitchen, smiling.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, care to join us?
text: Anna looks at the chair in the front room, where David's
text: jacked is draped. She casually moves towards it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ah, no, probably not. Mom and dad around?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They went to the store. Your mom’s going
dialog: to make pumpkin pie.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That’s cool.
text: Anna looks up. David is setting his pumpkin on the
text: kitchen counter, next to Luke's.
text: Anna feels the pocket of David’s jacket, then stops when
text: her hand touches his CELL PHONE. She quickly slips
text: David's disposable cell phone out of his pocket and exits
text: into the hallway, clutching it in her hands. Neither
text: David nor Luke look at her.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Anna enters her room and quickly shuts the door behind
text: her. She puts some MUSIC on her stereo, a loud goth song.
text: Anna snaps David’s phone open, scrolling so that its
text: screen displays recent calls. Anna takes her own cell
text: phone out and SNAPS A PICTURE of David's phone screen.
text: Anna scrolls further through David’s recent calls; there
dialog: are only a few more.
text: Suddenly David's phone RINGS LOUDLY, vibrating in her
text: hand. Anna freezes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Shit.
text: Anna spins for the door to her room, moving quietly.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna rapidly crosses the hallway. She opens the door to
text: Caleb's room, then spins back into the hallway.
text: Anna ducks back into her bedroom and shuts the door. A
text: moment later, David enters the hallway, holding the
text: receiver to the Petersons’ CORDLESS PHONE to his ear.
text: David walks down the hallway. His cell phone is audible
text: RINGING near the end of the hallway, its noise muffled.
text: David heads towards the sound.
text: David stops at the door to Anna’s room, listening to her
text: muffled music.
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna stands just inside the door to her room, not moving.
text: Silence, then Anna can hear David’s FOOTSTEPS in the
text: hallway, moving away.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David continues walking towards the sound of his ringing
text: cell phone. He opens the door to Caleb’s room.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: David's cell phone is on the floor of Caleb’s room,
text: RINGING and vibrating.
text: David hangs up the cordless phone receiver and his cell
text: phone stops ringing. He reaches down and picks it up off
text: the floor, smiling mildly.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: David closes the door to Caleb’s room and walks back
text: towards the front room.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna moves over to her bed and sits heavily on it,
text: exhaling. She puts her head in her hands.
text: Anna’s cell phone RINGS, startling her. She looks it,
text: frowns, then answers hesitantly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. CITY JAIL - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke stands at the end of a concrete hallway lined with
text: JAIL CELLS. He holds the receiver of a pay phone.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Hey, uh, it’s me.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Anna smiles, starts to speak into her phone, then stops.
text: Her smile drops from her face.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What...? I don’t... I don’t understand.
dialog: They found the gun that killed Craig...
dialog: in your van?
scene_heading: INT. CITY JAIL - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke looks up and down the jail hallway, speaking quietly
text: into the phone.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Yeah. It was wiped clean. They got an
dialog: anonymous tip or something.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, I mean, all they’1l say to me is it
dialog: was anonymous. Yeah, I know.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna looks shocked as she speaks into the phone.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, you’re innocent!
scene_heading: INT. CITY JAIL - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Zeke lowers his head. When he speaks into the receiver,
text: his voice is thick, as if he’s trying to muster bravado.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Yeah, I know, but... Then they searched
dialog: my room, and they found some other stuff.
dialog: You know. So, it looks like I might have
dialog: to do a bit of time. They haven't set
dialog: bail for me yet ‘cause of that.
text: There is a long silence while Zeke listens.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I have a lawyer. He’s calling
dialog: Kristen, it’s okay. That’s why I called
dialog: you. I just wanted to hear your voice.
text: A PRISON GUARD steps into the hallway.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: PRISON GUARD
dialog: Hastings, wrap it up!
text: The prison guard leaves the hallway. Zeke rolls his eyes,
text: swallows, then speaks into the phone.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: I gotta go, baby. I love you. Yeah. No. I
dialog: love you too, babe. I gotta go. Bye.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Anna, crying, hangs up her phone. It drops from her hand.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM/DINING ROOM/KITCHEN -
scene_heading: NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna walks down the hallway from her bedroom, moving into
text: the front room. Her mascara has run down her face and she
text: is sniffling.
text: Luke is doing his trigonometry homework on the living
text: room floor. He glances up at Anna, confused.
text: In the dining room, David is setting the table for dinner
text: while Laura prepares food in the kitchen. Spencer is
text: seated at the dining room table, reading. He looks up at
text: Anna, taking in her distraught state.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Anna? What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My, um, my friend Craig died today. He
dialog: was murdered.
text: Laura and Spencer look at each other, shocked.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh my goodness. That shooting at the
dialog: quarry?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We just heard about that on the radio.
text: Laura crosses quickly to Anna.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And... and they arrested Zeke for it,
text: they found the gun in his van. But he
dialog: didn’t do it. They were good friends.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Zeke?
text: Spencer sets down his book.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: I’m sorry, Anna, but if they arrested
dialog: your ex-boyfriend, it could be for a good
dialog: reason. Zeke Hastings was never exactly a
dialog: pillar of the community.
text: Anna's eyes blaze with fury.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He’s not my ex-boyfriend, dad, he’s my
dialog: boyfriend! I never stopped seeing him!
dialog: I’m twenty years old, I can date who I
dialog: want!
text: Spencer’s face flushes.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: As long as you’re in this house-
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You know absolutely nothing about him!
dialog: You don’t know Zeke at all!
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: I know he’s a druggy burn-out who started
dialog: dating my daughter when she was seventeen-
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh yeah? Oh really?
text: Anna and Spencer are both shouting now. Anna POINTS AT
text: DAVID, who is standing by the table, holding silverware.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: What about him? Everyone's best friend
dialog: there. What do you know about him?
text: Spencer opens his mouth, confused.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I called the military base he said he was
dialog: from, and they said he was dead!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Then they sent me a photo of him that
dialog: wasn’t him! What do you think of that?
text: Spencer looks towards David hesitantly. Laura and Luke
text: both look confused. David laughs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Military intelligence for you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: (to Spencer)
dialog: Ask him to show you his I.D.! He’s not
dialog: David Collins! We don’t know who he is!
text: Spencer again looks to David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was part of a special forces unit when
dialog: I was injured, so they should be
dialog: providing a cover story to any civilians
dialog: who ask about me. That’s a good thing.
dialog: But I did get my dog tags back. They’re
dialog: right here.
text: David sets down the forks in his hand. He reaches into
text: his pants pocket and hands a pair of METAL DOG TAGS to
text: Spencer, who looks at them. They bear the name “COLLINS,
scene_heading: DAVID ANDERSEN.”
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t like to wear them because, I
dialog: don’t know. I like having them with me,
dialog: though. As for my I.D., I don’t have a
dialog: current license, but I’ve got my
dialog: documents in my bag. Should I go...?
text: David gestures towards Caleb’s room. Spencer shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: That won’t be necessary. Anna, I think
dialog: you owe David an apology.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No fucking way.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: You watch your mouth, young lady!
text: Spencer stops and takes a breath.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: SPENCER (CONT'D)
dialog: I am very sorry about your friend Craig.
dialog: But as for Zeke Hastings and his crew, I
dialog: have it on good authority that they’re a
dialog: bunch of pot dealers! You know why they
dialog: arrested Zeke for the murder? Because he
dialog: probably did it, Anna!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Anna turns and storms back down the hallway, to her room,
text: passing Luke. Spencer and Laura stand for a moment,
text: looking after her, then Spencer turns to David.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: David, I am very sorry about that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s okay. She’s upset. I probably should
dialog: have explained the special forces thing
dialog: earlier, but we’re not really supposed to
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: No. I understand. Beer?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, please.
text: Spencer moves towards the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna sits on her bed, tears running down her face. Music
text: plays on her stereo.
text: Anna blinks, then turns on her phone and brings up the
text: picture she took of David’s phone screen.
text: There are five entries. One number appears three times as
text: missed calls. Anna takes a breath.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay. Kristen.
text: Anna taps one of the numbers, then scrolls through her
text: contacts, bringing up “CRAIG.” Craig’s number matches the
dialog: last number that called David’s phone.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Craig...
dialog: 69.
text: Anna goes back to the photo. Only one number remains.
text: Anna frowns at it, then opens up her netbook. She punches
text: the phone number into an internet search page.
text: There is a soft KNOCK on Anna’s door.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: The door opens and DAVID steps inside, shutting the door.
text: Anna quickly SHUTS HER NETBOOK, turning to face him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey.
text: David crosses the room and sits down on the floor, facing
text: Anna. She does not move.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about
dialog: Craig. He seemed like a really cool guy.
text: Anna says nothing.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: And Zeke getting arrested... Again. I’m
dialog: very sorry.
text: Anna again says nothing. David looks around the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you don’t need me here in this
dialog: stressful time. I’m not helping you,
dialog: which is a shame, because I’d promised
dialog: your brother Caleb I’d do anything I
dialog: could to help your family. But just so
dialog: you know, I'll be moving on in two days.
dialog: So, you don’t have to put up with me much
dialog: longer. Okay?
text: Anna does not respond. David leans forward.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good.
text: David leans back. He looks over at the stereo. On top of
text: the stereo is the CD with “MIX FOR DAVID” scrawled on it.
dialog: 70.
text: David smiles, reaching for the CD.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this the CD you made me?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Uh. Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is it done?
text: Anna nods. David rises, holding the mix CD.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. I can’t wait to listen to it.
text: Anna says nothing. David crosses to the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sure you'll feel better about this
dialog: whole thing soon, when you get some
text: perspective on it.
text: Anna does not respond. David exits the room, closing the
text: door behind him.
text: Anna waits a moment, then quickly moves to her door and
text: LOCKS IT, her hands trembling. She sits back on the bed.
scene_heading: INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Major Carver emerges from an elevator into a dimly lit
text: parking garage, carrying a small suitcase. He is holding
text: his phone with his other hand, rapidly SPEAKING into it.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: I want every contractor within a hundred
dialog: mile radius. I don’t care where they come
dialog: from, KPG, ex-military or whatever. I
dialog: need a team mobilized by the time I land.
text: Major Carver briefly listens to the phone as he crosses
text: over to his car.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘ll give them the necessary mission
dialog: specs in person. We can’t risk a leak on
dialog: this.
text: Major Carver hangs up the phone as he climbs into his
text: car. He starts its engine and drives out of the garage.
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: INT. ANNA’S CAR - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY
text: Anna drives. In the passenger seat, Luke examines her
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You took a picture of David’s phone?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. I paid for a reverse directory
dialog: thing to look that number up online. It
dialog: said it’s the unlisted landline of this
dialog: doctor in Miami. His name’s Peter
dialog: Boddington. Except he’s not a doctor
dialog: anymore. He got his license taken away
dialog: two years ago when he performed a face
dialog: lift on this lady while he was drunk.
text: Luke hands Anna’s phone back to her.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So David knows the guy? Maybe it’s his
dialog: uncle or something?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's what I want to find out.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So what do you need me to do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I need to talk to the police. The cops
dialog: found those drugs in Zeke’s room and
dialog: assume they’ve got their guy. The
text: investigation’s closed. Zeke’s lawyer is
text: telling him to take a plea.
text: Luke looks mildly suspicious.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: To get them to reopen it, I need all the
dialog: information I can get. You remember how
dialog: you stole a password for that database to
dialog: do research on your paper last year?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. I got in trouble when I told dad
dialog: about it.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, do something like that again. Find
dialog: out anything you can about this guy.
text: Luke looks pensive.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Do you really think David killed Craig
dialog: and that other guy?
text: Anna steers the car down the country road.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. I do.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay. I’1l see if I can find anything. A
dialog: lot of arrest reports are public record,
dialog: I’1ll check those first.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you, Luke. I’1l be at the diner all
dialog: day, so just call me on my cell if you
dialog: find anything.
text: Luke nods.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Luke walks into a full classroom. He moves down an aisle
text: in between the rows of desks, his head lowered.
text: Luke sits at an empty desk and immediately takes out his
text: netbook, opening it to an internet browser.
text: JASON is seated behind Luke. He has a BANDAGE over his
text: NOSE and his face is BRUISED. Jason regards Luke
text: balefully, then reaches and POKES LUKE WITH HIS PENCIL.
text: Luke exhales but says nothing.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Hey, faggot.
text: Luke does not respond, typing into his netbook. Jason
text: takes out a pencil sharpener and begins meticulously
text: SHARPENING his pencil.
text: Jason looks over Luke’s shoulder. Luke’s browser window
text: is open to a news story. The headline reads “DISGRACED
scene_heading: PLASTIC SURGEON TO PAY $2 MILLION IN DAMAGES.”
text: Jason jabs Luke in the back with the sharpened pencil.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: JASON (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, what's that? You looking for someone
dialog: to do your sex change operation?
text: Luke turns around and PUNCHES JASON IN HIS FACE. The
text: punch is quick but largely ineffective.
text: The classroom explodes with surprise, several students
text: standing to look. Jason, startled, reels back in his
text: seat. Then he flushes with rage and stands up.
speaker_heading: JASON (CONT'D)
dialog: You little bitch-
text: Jason grabs Luke with one hand, PULLING HIM UP OUT OF HIS
text: SEAT, and PUNCHES HIM with the other.
text: Luke staggers back, falling to land right near a
text: chalkboard at the back of the room. There is a wooden
text: YARDSTICK leaning against the wall next to him.
text: Jason touches his bruised face where Luke hit him, then
text: furiously strides forward.
text: The YARDSTICK, swung by Luke, catches Jason across the
text: MIDDLE OF HIS FACE. It breaks in half, splinters flying
dialog: everywhere.
text: Jason STUMBLES BACK, holding his injured face. He YELLS
dialog: with pain.
text: Luke stands at the back of the classroom, holding the
text: remains of the shattered yardstick, catching his breath.
text: He smiles slightly.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - SECRETARY’S OFFICE - DAY - LATER
text: Luke sits in an outside waiting area adjoining the school
text: principal’s office. A disapproving SECRETARY glares at
text: him from across her desk. Luke stares at the floor.
text: The door opens and Laura enters, with David. Laura
text: immediately crosses to Luke. David follows.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Luke nods.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m fine.
text: The secretary addresses Laura.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mrs. Peterson?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yes, that’s right.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mister Alston will see you now. Please
dialog: step inside.
text: Laura looks at David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Just a second.
text: David kneels down in front of Luke.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: This kid called me a faggot, so I broke a
text: yardstick on his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay. Did you hurt him?
text: Luke uncomfortably shrugs. David smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Awesome. No problem.
text: David rises and turns to Laura.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’‘1l go in with you.
text: David and Laura enter the principal’s office.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mr. Alston addresses Laura and David. Laura looks
text: extremely upset. David appears calm.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: Due to our school’s zero tolerance policy
dialog: on violence, I’m afraid we have no choice
dialog: but to expel your son. That’s pending the
dialog: decision of the board, but I’m afraid
dialog: it’s fairly certain.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: But...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did the kid call him?
text: Mr. Alston pauses.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The kid, you know, what’s-his-name that
dialog: Luke hit in the face. What did he call
dialog: Luke?
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: I don’t-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did he call him a faggot?
text: Mr. Alston looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: I believe that’s what was said, yes. But
dialog: that’s no excuse-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So that makes it a hate crime.
text: Mr. Alston is silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A hate crime. And I’d like to know how
dialog: many others have been perpetrated against
dialog: her son under your watch. A gay student
text: targeted with physical violence finally
dialog: defends himself, and you're... what?
dialog: Suspending him?
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: We could consider suspension...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. You couldn't. I’1l be interested to
dialog: see what the board thinks of you when
dialog: this is front of the entire country. Not
dialog: to mention our lawyers.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Laura)
dialog: Do you want to sue them?
text: Laura is totally frozen.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I... I don’t...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Mr. Alston)
dialog: We’re suing you and the school board.
text: David rises to his feet, pulling Laura with him. Mr.
text: Alston addresses them desperately.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: I didn’t even know he was gay!
text: David just shakes his head, moving towards the door.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: What about after school detention?
text: David stops moving.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: A month?
text: David considers, then nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That seems fair.
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: After school detention. We’1ll put him to
dialog: work helping the prom committee set up
dialog: for the fall dance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We’ll agree to that. But I do not want to
dialog: hear anything further about this young
dialog: man being harassed. We understand each
dialog: other?
speaker_heading: MR. ALSTON
dialog: I think we do, Mister... Who are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m a friend of the family. Good day.
dialog: 77.
text: David exits, pulling Laura with him out of the
dialog: principal's office.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David and Laura walk up to Luke, who is still seated
text: miserably in the secretary's office. David points at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: After school detention for a month.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
text: David holds out his palm. Luke hesitates, then slaps it.
text: David turns the slap into a quick fist bump.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: See you later.
text: As David turns to leave, Luke suddenly rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: David? Can I talk to you for a second?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
text: Luke glances over at Laura, who still looks somewhat
text: dazed. David turns to Laura.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to step out into the hall with
dialog: Luke for a moment, if that’s okay.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh. Certainly.
text: David and Luke exit the secretary's office, out into the
text: hall. Laura sits down in the seat Luke just vacated. The
text: secretary glares at her. Laura does not notice.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
text: David and Luke speak quietly, leaning up against a row of
text: lockers in the deserted hallway.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So, she thinks you killed Craig. And
dialog: she’s trying to make a case to the
text: police, so they’1l let her boyfriend go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anna told you all this?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: David smiles, as if mildly amused.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you think I killed Craig?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don’t care. But that’s why she wanted
dialog: me to check out that plastic surgeon in
dialog: Florida. She wanted to know what the
dialog: connection was there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, why would I need a plastic surgeon?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: To change your appearance. Like, the
dialog: bones in your face. And maybe scar up
dialog: your fingers so you don’t have prints.
text: David stops smiling.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, at least that’s what I figured. I
dialog: know you’re not really David Collins, I
dialog: looked him up right after Anna said that.
dialog: So, maybe you don’t want people to know
dialog: who you are. A surgeon who would do that
dialog: sort of thing is probably pretty rare. I
dialog: mean, there’s probably rules against it.
dialog: But that doctor, well, I guess he needs
dialog: the money, so he’d do that kind of work.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s an interesting theory.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m not going to tell anyone about it.
dialog: And no one will believe Anna. She doesn’t
dialog: have anything against you. You killed
dialog: dad's boss too, right?
text: David says nothing, regarding Luke curiously.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t care. I’m not going say anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Because we’re friends.
text: David blinks at Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. Of course we are.
text: Luke smiles.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay. I just wanted you to know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did Anna tell anyone else about this?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m not sure. Her friend Kristen, maybe?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
text: David walks back towards the office, his face blank.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA'S CAR - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: David drives Laura’s SUV, with her in the passenger seat.
text: He is frowning slightly. Laura stares straight ahead,
text: through the windshield.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That was an... eye-opening meeting for
dialog: me. I’m sorry I wasn’t of more help.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Oh, no problem.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I... I guess I just realized that I don’t
dialog: know my own son very well. I haven’t been
dialog: paying much attention to him. That
dialog: he’s... homosexual... It doesn’t change
dialog: anything, of course.
dialog: 80.
text: Laura looks to David for a response. David drives as if
text: not really listening.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I should talk to Luke when he
text: comes home. Make sure he knows he can
dialog: tell us anything. That we’1ll love him no
dialog: matter what. Do you think... do you think
dialog: that’s a good idea? To talk to him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. Sounds like a solid plan.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yes. I think we haven’t been talking
dialog: enough.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I really have to thank you, David. I
dialog: don’t know what we would have done if you
dialog: weren’t here. Not just today, with Luke,
dialog: but... everything. I’m very grateful.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Really, Mrs. Peterson. It’s no problem.
text: They continue to drive in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - SIDE YARD - DAY - LATER
text: Laura, a clothespin held between her lips, hangs a white
text: sheet out on a clothesline. Several more sheets and
text: articles of clothing are already hung.
text: David stands beside Laura, holding a laundry basket. He
text: hands her a towel, the last item in the basket.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ll go get the rest.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Okay. Thank you, David.
text: David nods and walks through the yard, towards the rear
text: of the house, carrying the laundry basket.
text: Laura clips the towel to the clothesline by its corners,
text: straightening it. She then looks behind her.
text: Two large, BLACK SUVs are pulling into the DRIVEWAY of
text: the Petersons’ house. Laura regards this, puzzled.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - LAUNDRY AREA - DAY -— CONTINUOUS
text: David removes clothes from the washing machine, piling
text: them into the laundry basket.
text: David suddenly straightens, as if listening to something.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - SIDE YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Laura watches as the two black SUVs come to a stop in
text: front of the house.
text: The doors to both SUVs open and SEVEN MEN in MILITARY
text: POLICE UNIFORMS climb out. The passenger in the first SUV
text: is a weathered looking man; this is MAJOR CARVER.
text: The seven men approach Laura, fanning out in their
text: formation. She looks at them, confused.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Excuse me, ma’‘am. Are you Anna Peterson?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No, she’s working at the diner... I’m her
dialog: mother. What’s she done?
text: The Major shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: No, it’s fine, ma’am. Your daughter, she
text: put in a phone call to Fort Kennilworth a
dialog: couple of days ago asking about a man
dialog: named David Collins.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: That's right, she did.
text: The Major nods to the man next to him, who hands him a
text: manila envelope. The Major removes a PHOTOGRAPH of DAVID.
text: In the photo, David is slightly younger, his head shaved
text: on one side, and is wearing a hospital gown. He stares
text: blankly into the camera.
text: Major Carver shows the photo to Laura. He looks tired.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: You wouldn’t happen to have seen anyone
dialog: resembling this man, would you?
text: Laura nods at the photo, frowning.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yes, that’s David. He-
text: At that moment, David comes out from behind the house,
text: carrying the laundry basked filled with clothing.
text: David stops moving when he sees the seven men. The seven
text: military policemen stare at David in wide-eyed shock,
text: Major Carver's mouth agape.
text: Then they all REACH FOR THE GUNS IN THEIR HOLSTERS, the
text: DRIVER of the first SUV fumbling for his.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Get him!
text: As the military policemen all STEP FORWARD, David drops
text: the laundry basket and PULLS A PISTOL out from the back
text: of his waistband.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Oh, shit-
text: The driver is closest to David; David SHOOTS THE DRIVER
text: TWICE in the NECK. The driver's BLOOD sprays across the
text: white sheet Laura just hung as he falls back.
text: Laura SCREAMS AND RUNS for the house, just as three of
text: the M.P.s OPEN FIRE at David.
text: David RETURNS FIRE, RUNNING towards the house just as
text: Laura disappears through the front door.
text: David SHOOTS ANOTHER of the M.P.s as he RUNS, hitting him
text: in the head. The M.P. drops to the ground, dead.
text: David's GUN CLICKS EMPTY just as he reaches the window to
text: Caleb's bedroom. He LEAPS THROUGH THE WINDOW, shattering
text: the glass with his arms.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - DAY -— CONTINUOUS
text: David crashes into Caleb’s bedroom, rolling OVER THE BED
text: and landing in a crouch behind it.
text: Outside, the remaining M.P.s target the broken window of
text: the bedroom, all of them firing, SPRAYING its interior
dialog: with bullets.
text: David glances down. He has a BULLET WOUND in his left
text: arm. Blood soaks the fabric of his shirt.
dialog: 83.
text: David reaches under the bed, grabbing a white T-shirt and
text: TEARING AWAY a strip of fabric with his TEETH.
text: BULLETS continue to spray the wall above David and the
text: bed in front of him. He loops the strip over his arm,
text: then tugs it TIGHT, creating a BANDAGE OVER THE WOUND.
text: Caleb's trophies and framed photos are shattered by
text: bullets as the M.P.s fire into the room. Dust and debris
text: rain down on David as he REACHES UNDER THE BED.
text: There is a pause in the fire from outside. The next
text: instant, one of the M.P.s appears outside the shattered
text: window, aiming his rifle in at David.
text: David RISES with the ASSAULT RIFLE he stole from Higgins
text: in his hands. He OPENS FIRE, spraying the M.P. outside
text: the window with BULLETS. Blood bursts from the M.P.’s
text: neck and face as he falls back into the front yard.
text: David's rifle CLICKS EMPTY. From outside, Major Carver
text: can be heard screaming.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (0.S.)
dialog: Get him! Don’t let him get away!
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: One of the M.P.s spins away from the open trunk of one of
text: the SUVs, holding an M249 MACHINE GUN. He BRACES IT
text: against the short WALL surrounding the Peterson’s home.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David drops the rifle and grabs his DUFFEL BAG. He turns
text: and RUNS out of the bedroom, entering the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David runs into the hallway, moving to pass the open
text: doorway to Anna’s bedroom.
text: As he does so, the window in Anna’s bedroom SHATTERS with

scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Major Carver delivers covering fire through Anna's
text: bedroom window while two of the M.P.s move to either side
text: of the window. The remaining gunner M.P. loads an
text: AMMUNITION BELT into the M249.
text: Major Carver pauses in his fire, nodding to the two M.P.s
text: at the house. One of the M.P.s steps into the window.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The M.P. climbs in through Anna’s window, his partner
text: remaining outside, gun at the ready.
text: The M.P. steps into Anna’s room, looking around. The room
text: is SILENT except for debris and broken glass occasionally
text: dropping to the floor.
text: The M.P. holds up his hand and gestures forward,
text: indicating for his partner to follow him inside. The
text: second M.P. steps in through the window as the first M.P.
text: shifts forward.
text: There is the BOOM of a SHOTGUN BLAST and the first M.P.’s
text: ankle EXPLODES. He crumples to the floor with a SCREAM
text: and is promptly SHOT IN THE FACE, silencing him.
text: The second M.P. pivots and opens fire with his automatic
text: rifle, SPRAYING ANNA’S BED with BULLETS. As he does so,
text: David SLIDES OUT from under the bed on his back, stopping
text: right at the M.P.’s feet.
text: David is aiming a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN UP at the M.P.
text: David PULLS THE TRIGGER, hitting the M.P. in the side.
text: The force of the blast lifts the M.P. off his feet,
text: knocking him back OUT THE WINDOW.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The M.P. falls to the ground directly outside of the
text: window, blood flowing from his wound. He does not move.
text: Major Carver turns to the sole remaining M.P., who is
text: manning the M249 MACHINE GUN.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Fire!
text: The gunner M.P. OPENS FIRE, SPRAYING the outside of

scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David crawls from Anna’s room as bullets DESTROY its

text: As David makes his way down the hallway in a MILITARY LOW
text: CRAWL, 5.7mm BULLETS SLAM THROUGH THE WALL above him,
text: moving in a line towards David as he quickly moves
text: forward ON HIS ELBOWS.
text: Each slug BURSTS THROUGH the wall just over David as he
text: crawls forward, filling the air behind him with DUST AND
speaker_heading: DEBRIS.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The M.P. manning the M249 SWIVELS THE GUN to follow
text: David's path in the house, PUMMELING THE FRONT of the
text: house with BULLETS. Spent bullet casings spill out onto
text: the ground around him.
text: The gun abruptly runs out of bullets, its BELT reaching
dialog: its end.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David rises and runs through the front room, towards the

scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY -— CONTINUOUS
text: David hits the kitchen floor, skidding to a stop near
text: Laura, who is crouched, the cordless phone in her hands,
text: dialing a number.
text: David glances at Laura, then spins and yanks opens a
text: drawer next to the kitchen sink. He pulls out a KNIFE,
text: then snatches the phone from her hands, SHUTTING IT OFF.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
text: Laura stares at David. She is trembling.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: David, what-? What’s happening? Who are
dialog: those men?
text: Outside, the M249 machine gun remains SILENT. David holds

dialog: 86.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The gunner M.P. RELOADS the smoking machine gun,

scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY -— CONTINUOUS
text: David slowly rises, peering out the kitchen window into
text: the side yard. It is empty. He crouches back down next to
dialog: Laura.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I really am sorry about this, Mrs.
dialog: Peterson. I’m afraid I haven’t been fully
dialog: honest with you.
text: Laura takes this in, watching David. David looks down at
text: the knife in his hand.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It would take too long to explain. This
dialog: is not what I wanted. I wanted to help. I
dialog: considered it my mission to assist you
dialog: all while I was here. There were just...
dialog: too many complications.
text: Laura is staring at David, her face streaked with tears.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What are you talking about? Why are those
dialog: men here? They're trying to kill you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They are, yes. If it was up to them,
dialog: they’d keep me in a prison cell forever.
dialog: I can’t have that.
text: Laura takes this in. She swallows, moving away from David
text: just slightly. He watches this.
text: At that moment, Major Carver SHOUTS FROM OUTSIDE:
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (0O.S.)
dialog: Just give yourself up! Come out with your
dialog: hands empty and we won’t shoot you!
dialog: 87.
text: David looks down at the knife in his hand, touching its

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Did you... Did you even know my son?
text: David's gazes up at the windows and doorways.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I did. And I can tell you, he would
dialog: understand what I have to do here.
text: David looks over at Laura. His expression is blank.
text: A look of realization comes into Laura’s eyes. She
text: quickly turns from David, SCREAMING:
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: He’s here in the kitchen! Help-
text: David reaches out and STABS LAURA IN THE HEART.
text: Laura stares down at the blade protruding from her chest.
text: She then looks up at David, tears falling from her eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Laura exhales, DYING. She sits back on the kitchen floor,

text: The sound of the M249 SHOOTING into the house’s hallway
text: thunders through the house as Major Carver cautiously
text: steps into Caleb’s room, looking around.
text: The room has been mostly destroyed. Major Carver kneels
text: down, checking under the bed, then rises. He moves out
text: towards the hallway.
text: The sound of the machine gun firing comes to an abrupt
text: STOP. Major Carver goes still, listening in the SILENCE.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The gunner M.P. waits, holding the smoking M249 ready to

speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Fuck!
text: Major Carver runs over to the driver's corpse in the yard

text: The SUV begins driving in pursuit of David, slowly,
text: LURCHING on its two FLAT TIRES.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David quickly steers the SUV down the country road.
text: SMOKE is rising from around the SUV’s hood. There is a

text: off into the fields, RUNNING.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK SUV - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Major Carver slowly drives the lurching SUV down the
text: country road in pursuit of David.
text: In the distance ahead of him, the wreck of Laura and
text: Spencer's cars is visible. Another car has stopped near
text: the crashed vehicles, its emergency lights blinking.
text: Major Carver frowns, driving towards the accident.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Major Carver drives the lurching SUV over to the crashed
text: vehicles. An ELDERLY MAN is standing by Spencer's car,
text: looking in through his window. The elderly man’s CAR is
text: in the road behind him, its emergency blinkers on.
dialog: 91.
text: Major Carver stops the SUV and climbs out of it. He walks
text: over to the crashed vehicles. The elderly man turns
text: towards him, his expression concerned.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: I already called for an ambulance... but
dialog: I’m afraid I think he’s dead.
text: Major Carver looks in at Spencer’s corpse, then
text: straightens. He pulls out a billfold and shows his badge.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Military police. I need your vehicle.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: What? But I-
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Are the keys in it?
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: Yes... but...
text: Major Carver climbs into the elderly man’s car. He starts
text: it and pulls the car into a quick U-turn, speeding away
text: down the country road. The elderly man stares after him.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna is working at the diner alongside Kristen. She sets
text: a milkshake down on the counter, then moves to clean off
text: a table.
text: The door to the diner SWINGS OPEN. Major Carver hurriedly
text: strides into the diner. He surveys its patrons and
text: employees, who all look back at him.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Anna Peterson?
text: Anna steps forward, puzzled.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That’s me.
text: Major Carver shows Anna his badge.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: My name is Major Carver. Military police.
dialog: I need you to come with me, please.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Whoa. I’m not going anywhere. What’s
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: It’s about David, Ms. Peterson. He isn’t
dialog: who you think he is.
text: Anna hesitates, then sets down her cleaning cloth.
text: Kristen steps forward, addressing Anna.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Is everything alright?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I think so. I'll call you later, okay?
text: Kristen nods. Anna exits the diner with Major Carver.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Major Carver holds Anna’s door open for her. She climbs
text: into the passenger side of the vehicle. He then gets in,
text: starts the car and drives out of the parking lot.
text: A few seconds later, another car drives into the parking
text: lot. David is at the steering wheel. He brings the car to
text: a stop in the middle of the parking lot.
text: David climbs out of the new car. The inside of its
text: windshield is SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD, but it is otherwise
text: empty.
text: David walks towards the diner.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. DINER - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: David opens the door and walks into the diner. He looks
text: around, surveying the diner’s few patrons.
text: Kristen, seeing David, cautiously moves from behind the
text: counter and crosses to him. She flashes a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: Hey! I was starting to think I wasn’t
dialog: going to see you again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi. Is Anna working?
text: Kristen hesitates. David steps closer to her, his smile
text: friendly and charming.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: She just left.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh yeah? Where was she going?
text: Kristen takes a hesitant step away from David.
speaker_heading: KRISTEN
dialog: I’m not sure exactly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: To pick up Luke?
text: Kristen says nothing, staring at David. David sighs, the
text: smile dropping from his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Never mind.
text: David pulls a REVOLVER from his pocket and SHOOTS Kristen
text: IN THE CHEST.
text: Patrons scream as Kristen’s body falls to the floor.
text: David turns away and walks towards the exit. As he does
text: so, he removes the GRENADE he took from Higgins from his
dialog: pocket.
text: David PULLS THE PIN and tosses the grenade over his
text: shoulder, to the floor.
text: David exits the diner, walking towards the car he was
text: driving. SCREAMING is audible inside the diner, then the
text: GRENADE EXPLODES. The diner’s windows SHATTER OUTWARDS.
text: David opens his car door. The diner is silent, smoke
text: billowing from its shattered windows. A CAR ALARM is now
text: BEEPING in the parking lot.
text: David gets into the car and pulls out of the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. ELDERLY MAN’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Major Carver drives the car down the street, Anna in the
text: passenger seat. He is speaking into his cell phone.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: What? Okay. Copy. We’re on our way.
text: Major Carver hangs up his cell phone.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: We're going to the Maplewood Barn to get
dialog: your brother. The police couldn’t send a
dialog: car there. They’ve got their hands full.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You need to tell me what’s going on. Who
dialog: are you? You came here for David?
text: Major Carver hesitates, then answers.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Yes. The soldier you know as David was
dialog: one of the subjects of a medical
text: experiment. His spine was damaged in
dialog: combat, and even after surgery, he was in
dialog: pain. He volunteered for a procedure that
dialog: would turn off his pain receptors and
dialog: allow him to consciously regulate the
text: flow of adrenaline in his body.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: The idea being that if we could get
dialog: soldiers to control their fear responses,
dialog: push their adrenaline when they needed
dialog: it, we’d lose less men. But it changed
dialog: our subject. While we had him under
dialog: study, he killed several people and
dialog: escaped. He burned their bodies so it
dialog: would confuse us; we thought he’d died in
dialog: the fire initially. By the time we
dialog: figured out what he’d done, the trail was
dialog: cold.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Maybe you should have tested your
dialog: procedure on a subject who wasn’t a
dialog: psychopath.
text: The Major sighs.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: By all accounts, he was an ideal soldier,
dialog: well liked by everyone. He was chosen in
dialog: part for his empathy levels. I don’t
dialog: know. If you didn’t have to feel guilt or
dialog: sadness, would you choose to?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And if you didn’t, how would that affect
dialog: your behavior?
text: Anna blinks.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’m calling my brother.
text: Anna takes her cell phone out of her pocket and dials a
text: number while Major Carver drives.
scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - DANCE FLOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Luke stacks BALES OF HAY in the corner of a dance floor,
text: next to a GRIM REAPER DUMMY holding a FLAMING LANTERN.
text: Luke’s cell phone RINGS in his pocket.
text: Luke reaches into his pocket and takes out his small cell
text: phone, looking at it.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Peterson, is that a cell phone?
text: Luke turns. MR. LYLES, the teacher in charge of
text: detention, is regarding him from nearby on the dance
text: floor. He crosses to Luke.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES (CONT’D)
dialog: Didn't I tell you, phones off? Hand it
dialog: over. You'll get it back after detention.
text: Luke shrugs and hands Mr. Lyles his cell phone as it
text: stops ringing.
scene_heading: INT. ELDERLY MAN’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: In the passenger seat, Anna frowns, holding the phone to
text: her ear, then speaks into it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Luke, if you get this message, call me
dialog: right away. It’s important.
text: Anna hangs up her cell phone, then begins typing on it.
text: Major Carver glances over at her.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sending him a text.
text: Major Carver nods as a police car SPEEDS PAST them on the
text: road, heading in the opposite direction, siren blaring.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s that cop car going?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Somebody attacked your diner right after
text: we left it. Presumably our subject.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Yeah. I’m sorry. It was called in as an
dialog: explosion. I don’t know anything else.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wait... Are... Is anyone alive?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: I don’t know. It’s possible that he’d
text: leave some wounded to keep them busy.
text: Anna stares at Major Carver.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wait. Where are my parents? You haven’t
dialog: mentioned my parents.
text: Major Carver grimaces and says nothing. The Maplewood
text: Barn is ahead of them.
text: Anna's voice grows panicked.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: What about my parents?! Tell me!
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
text: They’re both dead. He killed them both
dialog: before we could stop him. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What? Why... Why would he...?
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Anna blinks, her eyes filling with tears.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don’t understand. They... they weren’t
text: a threat to him.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: David has neurological conditioning, Ms.
dialog: Peterson, designed to protect both him
dialog: and the experiment. If he feels like his
dialog: identity may be compromised, he’s
dialog: programmed to clean up all loose ends. I
dialog: doubt he could stop himself now even if
dialog: he wanted to. It’s why we need to get you
dialog: and your brother somewhere safe.
text: Major Carver parks the car in front of the barn. Anna is
text: staring straight ahead out the windshield. Her face is
text: streaked with tears, but her expression is blank.
text: Major Carver looks over at Anna.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to stay here, or...?
text: Anna‘s voice is flat.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. I need to get my brother.
text: Anna exits the car. Behind her, the sun is setting.
scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - MAZE ENTRANCE —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Major Carver opens the front door to the barn, which is
text: adorned with Halloween decorations. He and Anna find
text: themselves facing a MAZE ENTRANCE shaped like the mouth
text: of an enormous JACK-O’-LANTERN.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: For the fall dance, they do Halloween
dialog: mazes to get in and out. You enter in
dialog: pairs. It’s a tradition.
text: Major Carver steps forward, entering the jack-o’-

speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Inside the Halloween maze, Anna and Major Carver step

speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Major Carver and Anna make their way down a narrow
text: hallway, its walls lined with wooden slats.
text: As Major Carver passes a closed doorway, the door
text: suddenly RATTLES. A canned SCREAM emits from BEHIND THE
text: DOOR. Major Carver jerks back.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Goddammit! What in the hell?
text: Mr. Lyles’ voice comes from within the building as Anna
text: and Major Carver move quickly from the narrow hallway,
text: into the next maze chamber.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES (0.S.)
dialog: Who’s in here?
text: Major Carver shouts in response to Mr. Lyles:
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Military police! I’m here for Luke
dialog: Peterson. How do I get through this maze?
text: There is a silence, then Mr. Lyles’ voice comes again.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES (0.S.)
dialog: Left, right, right, left, left, right,
text: left, then straight.
text: Major Carver grunts and moves forward, followed by Anna.
scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE —- BUTCHER ROOM -
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Major Carver and Anna enter a white room with FAKE BLOOD
text: SPLATTERED over its walls. Rubber CORPSE PARTS and

dialog: up at this.
scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE - CHECKERED HALLWAY -
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Continuing deeper into the maze, Major Carver and Anna
text: make their way down a red and white checkered hallway.
text: ANIMATRONIC CLOWNS rotate back and forth in the corners,
text: their arms pivoting quietly.
dialog: 99.
text: At the end of the hallway, a STROBE LIGHT FLASHES. Anna
text: and Major Carver walk towards the pulsing light. It is

scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - DANCE FLOOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna and Major Carver emerge from the maze out onto the
text: dance floor decorated with pumpkins and bales of hay.
text: Dried leaves and a mirror ball hang from the ceiling.
text: Luke and Mr. Lyles are standing near the center of the

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Luke!
text: Anna runs to Luke and HUGS HIM. Luke lightly returns her
text: hug, confused.
text: Major Carver crosses to Mr. Lyles, showing him his BADGE;
text: the two engage in quiet conversation. Luke watches this.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We need to go right now. Come with-
text: Abruptly, the lights in the building GO DARK. A spotlight
text: hits the MIRROR BALL above them, which begins spinning,
text: reflecting swirling spots of light over the floor. A FOG
text: MACHINE starts WHIRRING in the corner.
text: The first notes of the GOTH SONG that David and Anna
text: listened to in her car echo through the space. The MUSIC
text: plays from overhead speakers installed for the dance.
text: Major Carver draws his PISTOL. Mr. Lyles stares at this.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Who else is in here?
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES
dialog: No one. It’s just the two of us. This is-
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Where are the lights controlled from?
text: Mr. Lyles looks up at a loft overhanging the dance floor.
text: It is dark; no one is visible.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES
text: Up there. There’s a DJ booth in the
dialog: attic...
text: Major Carver looks quickly around.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: We need to get out of here. Now. Where’s
dialog: the back exit?
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES
dialog: Follow me.
text: Mr. Lyles turns towards a corridor entrance leading out
text: to the building’s rear exit. Major Carver moves after
text: him, gesturing for Anna and Luke to follow.
scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - EXIT MAZE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
text: Mr. Lyles moves quickly into a MAZE OF MIRRORS, using a
text: small FLASHLIGHT to illuminate their path.
text: The mirrors reflect the flashlight’s BEAM in dozens of
text: patterns, each wall of the maze giving off the illusion
dialog: of infinite depth.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES
dialog: It’s just this way...
text: Mr. Lyles ducks around a corner, vanishing from view,
text: although several of his reflections are still visible.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Slow down.
text: Major Carver, tensely holding his pistol by his side,
text: looks back at Anna and Luke, who are following him. He
text: moves after Mr. Lyles.
text: Mr. Lyles’ reflections can be seen rounding another
speaker_heading: CORNER.
speaker_heading: MR. LYLES
dialog: Almost there now...
text: Visible in the reflections on the walls around them, a
text: DARK SHAPE steps out in front of Mr. Lyles, CROSSING IN
text: FRONT OF HIM. The shape vanishes.
text: Mr. Lyles goes silent. He takes a step back.
dialog: 101.
text: Major Carver, Anna and Luke round the corner, entering
text: the same mirrored corridor as Mr. Lyles. He stands with
text: his back to them.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: Sir?
text: Mr. Lyles turns and Major Carver's face is SPRAYED WITH
text: BLOOD. Mr. Lyles’ throat has been SLASHED; his neck yawns
dialog: open.
text: Mr. Lyles crumples and falls to the floor, dead, as Major
text: Carver raises his gun. He shouts to Anna and Luke:
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Run! Go out the other way! Go!
text: Anna grabs Luke’s arm, turns and RUNS, heading back out
text: through the mirror maze.
text: A SHAPE moves in front of Major Carver in his reflections
text: and he finds himself FACING David.
text: David is holding a BLOODY BOX CUTTER. David's voice
text: ECHOES through the maze.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello, sir.
text: Major Carver quickly raises his gun and FIRES. The MIRROR
text: in front of Major Carver SHATTERS, David's reflection
text: cracking into shards just as it quickly MOVES.
text: Major Carver spins quickly around to see David RUNNING
text: TOWARDS HIM, down the short corridor.
text: Major Carver aims his gun at David and FIRES as David
text: moves to one side in an evasive pattern, CLOSING THE
text: DISTANCE between them.
text: The BULLET HITS David in the side, blood bursting from
text: his wound. He does not appear to notice this.
text: The Major tries to shoot David again, FIRING just as
text: David moves to the side of his gun arm. The bullet hits
text: another mirror, BREAKING IT.
text: David SLICES OPEN the Major’s wrist with the box cutter,
text: drawing the BLADE UP TOWARDS HIS ELBOW. The Major gasps,
text: grabbing at David, dropping his gun. Blood POURS out from
text: his arm as he SHOVES David away.

scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - EXIT MAZE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
text: Major Carver drops to the floor of the mirror maze,

text: feet, but falls forward.
speaker_heading: MAJOR CARVER
dialog: You... you...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’re going to bleed out in about a
text: minute. Maybe two.
text: Major Carver says nothing. He begins CRAWLING FORWARD
text: through the fog, towards the entrance to the maze.
text: David WATCHES this, then leans down and picks up the
text: Major’s gun from the floor. The Major continues crawling
text: away from David, creating a thick trail of arterial blood
text: on the floor that is visible as the fog wafts around him.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You shouldn’t have followed me.
text: Major Carver continues crawling away from David, on his
text: elbows, seemingly focused on some distant goal. He
text: collapses at the entrance to the mirror maze.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what you expected.
text: Major Carver reaches forward with his uninjured arm, then
text: he goes still. His eyes slowly close as the fog pools
text: around him on the floor.
text: David looks down at Major Carver's corpse. He considers
text: the gun in his hand, then sets it down in the growing
text: pool of blood around Major Carver's body.
text: David calmly turns and walks towards the dance floor,
text: leaving the Major’s gun next to his body.

scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - MAZE ENTRANCE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

text: Looking through the crack in the door, Anna can see that
text: the door is CHAINED SHUT.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Shit.
text: Anna turns back, facing the halls of the maze leading

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Anna, it’s just David. I don’t know

scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE —- JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Anna and Luke hurry deeper into the maze, rounding
dialog: another corner.
text: Luke and Anna find themselves in a CHAMBER in the maze,
text: filled with barrels and debris, designed like a JUNKYARD.
text: There is a stack of barrels in one corner that appears
text: designed for a maze employee to hide behind in order to
text: jump out and scare people. A GORE-STREAKED dummy is
text: propped in front of the barrels.
text: Anna quickly pulls Luke towards the stack of barrels.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I need you to hide in here. Okay?
text: Luke looks at the hiding space, then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What? No way. Look, Anna, David was
dialog: probably just after that army guy. Let’s
dialog: just... Let’s go talk to him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Luke. He killed mom and dad. They're

text: Luke blinks. He smiles hesitantly.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, he didn’t. You’re just saying that.

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please. Just hide here, okay? I’m going

dialog: Luke.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I’1l come back for you.
text: Anna turns and runs deeper into the dark maze.
text: Anna turns a corner, then another. She finds herself
text: facing a DEAD END.
text: Hurriedly, Anna backtracks to her last turn, going the
text: other direction, disappearing from view.
text: On the other side of the maze wall from Anna, David walks
text: deeper into the maze, turning corners, still holding the
text: BLOODY BOX CUTTER in front of him. David speaks LOUDLY.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m really sorry about this, guys.
text: David turns another corner. A scarecrow leans against one
text: wall of this corridor. David ignores it, calling out.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I tried to think of another way to do it.
dialog: Any other solution.
text: Hidden behind the barrels, Luke goes quiet. David's
text: FOOTSTEPS are audible near him. FAKE LIGHTNING FLASHES
text: from a source overhead.
text: Moving carefully, Luke peers out between the barrels. As
text: Luke watches, David steps into the chamber, looking
text: around. David moves forward, holding the BOX CUTTER.
text: David slowly WALKS PAST LUKE’s hiding place, SCRAPING the
text: BLADE against a chain link fence that lines the corridor.
text: He continues speaking as he MOVES AWAY.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you guys hiding? There’s no point. I

text: breathing. He watches as David moves away from him,
text: nearing the chamber’s exit.
text: David comes to a stop at the chamber’s exit. He looks
text: around, then goes perfectly still, listening.
text: Luke silently reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
text: BUTTERFLY KNIFE David gave him. Luke holds it in one

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. Where are you?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Luke? Come on out, buddy. I’m not going
dialog: to hurt you.
text: Inside the hiding space, Luke shifts his weight slightly,
text: clutching the knife.
text: David SPINS AROUND, STARING at Luke’s hiding space.
text: To Luke, it appears as if David is staring directly at
text: him, but from David’s perspective, he can only see the

text: the hiding space.
text: Luke holds his breath. His hands shake slightly.
text: David takes a step forward, towards the stack of barrels.

text: A CRASHING sound comes from the other side of the barn,

text: David looks down and, with his foot, shifts around the
text: FOG that covers the floor, revealing the pool of blood
text: that surrounds Major Carver.
text: Major Carver's GUN IS MISSING. David smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hmm.
text: As the fog shifts back, David's eyes narrow. He kicks at
text: the fog again. It parts, revealing the corridor floor.
text: BLOODY FOOTPRINTS, from Anna’s sneakers, lead away from
text: Major Carver's body, back towards the dance floor.
text: David smiles. Crouching slightly, the box cutter in front
text: of him, David moves silently, shifting the fog in front
text: of him with his feet, following the bloody footsteps.
text: David stops at the dance floor entrance, looking around.
text: The fog is thick, covering the dance floor, illuminated
text: in swirling spots by the spinning mirror ball.
text: David kicks at the fog in front of him. It parts,
text: revealing ANNA’S SNEAKERS, which rest on the dance floor
text: directly in front of David.
text: David looks up. Anna is STANDING BEHIND HIM in the
text: mirrored corridor, aiming Major Carver's pistol at his
text: back. Her feet are BARE.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You killed my parents.
text: David blinks, shifting his weight almost imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I did, yes.
text: In a sudden movement, David SPINS AROUND. ANNA FIRES.
dialog: 108.
text: The bullet catches David IN THE CHEST, knocking him back
text: onto the dance floor.
scene_heading: INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - DANCE FLOOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
text: The fog parts as David falls heavily to the floor. He
text: does not move.
text: Anna steps from the mirror maze, the gun in her hand
text: aimed down at David. The fog shifts back in, OBSCURING
text: DAVID from view.
text: Anna hesitates, then steps forward, WAVING her free hand
text: in front of her, WAFTING the fog from her path.
text: David is NO LONGER ON THE FLOOR in front of her.
text: Anna spins around and is STABBED IN THE LEG with the box
text: cutter BLADE. It tears into her flesh through her tights.
text: She falls to the floor, YELLING in pain.
text: David is crouched in the fog, the front of his shirt
text: soaked with his BLOOD. He grins at Anna, his teeth
text: bloody, then LUNGES FORWARD at her.
text: Anna AIMS THE PISTOL at David. David KNOCKS IT ASIDE,
text: gripping Anna’s wrist as she FIRES.
text: The bullet hits the GRIM REAPER dummy in the corner of
text: the room, knocking it over. It falls forward, onto a bale
text: of HAY. Its LANTERN sends FLAMES out onto the hay.
text: David WRENCHES the pistol from Anna’s grasp. It goes
text: skittering across the floor, disappearing into the fog.
text: David reaches out and GRABS Anna’s NECK with both hands.
text: He tightens his grip, CHOKING HER. They struggle, both of
text: them crouched in the fog on the dance floor, MUSIC
speaker_heading: BLARING.
text: Anna CLAWS at David's hands as he compresses the arteries
text: in her neck. She struggles, going to her knees,
text: frantically trying to pull back his fingers.
text: David exhales with exertion. Behind him, the bale of HAY
text: is STARTING TO BURN, the flames filling the fog around
text: them with FLICKERING LIGHT that illuminates David’s face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Stop it. It’ll be over in just a second.
dialog: 109.
text: Anna stares up at David, her eyes glassy from lack of
text: oxygen. She continues to try to pull away his fingers,
text: but without strength, pawing desperately at his hands.
text: David regards Anna calmly, continuing to strangle her.
text: Anna’s hands drop to her sides. Her head slumps forward.
text: A KNIFE BLADE STABS into David’s back, then is WRENCHED
speaker_heading: BACK OUT.
text: David turns around, releasing Anna, who falls to the
text: dance floor, COUGHING and sucking in air.
text: LUKE is standing directly in front of David, holding the
text: BLOODY butterfly knife in his hand. He stares at David
text: tearfully, shaking.
text: David coughs, BLOOD flecking his lips. He holds out his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Luke-
text: Luke STEPS FORWARD AND STABS DAVID in the chest.
text: David stumbles back, the knife sticking out from his
text: chest. He hits the wall near the fog machine and slides
text: down it, smearing it with blood.
text: David sprawls on the floor, his back to the wall, blood
text: flowing from his multiple wounds. He swallows, looking
text: down at the knife in his chest, then looks up at Luke,
text: his eyes half open.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...
text: Luke stares at David.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You did... You did the right thing. I
dialog: don’t blame you. Don’t... feel bad.
text: David smiles slightly at Luke, then looks over at Anna,
text: who is still crouched on the floor.
text: David opens his bloody mouth, as if trying to say
text: something to Anna, then his eyes close.
text: David exhales and GOES STILL.
text: Luke stares at David, then quickly reaches down to help
text: Anna to her feet. The FLAMES are building behind them,
text: igniting a curtain covering the wall.
dialog: 110.
text: Anna leans against Luke. When she speaks, her voice is
text: raspy.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. Are you?
text: Luke nods. Anna regards Luke for a moment, then they make
text: their way towards the dark maze leading to the front
text: entrance. Behind them, the flames have ENGULFED the far
text: wall, and the fire is BUILDING steadily.
text: Luke supports Anna as she limps slightly, her arm across
text: his shoulders.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
text: Anna and Luke stand near the back of an ambulance in the
text: parking lot for the barn. Anna still has her arm across
text: Luke’s shoulders.
text: Behind them, the fire in the building appears to have
text: been extinguished, SMOKE RISING from the building’s burnt
text: portions. FIREMEN carry equipment to their trucks. The
text: large parking lot is filled with black SUVs and police
text: cars with LIGHTS FLASHING.
text: At the back of the ambulance, a PARAMEDIC shines a light
text: into Anna's eyes, then glances over at Luke.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: You sure you're both feeling okay?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. We’re fine.
text: A volunteer FIREFIGHTER runs up to the paramedic.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: Hey, they could use you inside. There’s
text: bodies in there.
text: The paramedic nods quickly, turning away from Anna and
text: Luke. He jogs over towards the building with the fireman.
dialog: 111.
scene_heading: EXT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - REAR ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER
text: The paramedic and fireman move to join a group of
text: emergency workers waiting outside the rear entrance to
dialog: the barn.
text: Firefighters in full protection gear, including hoods and
text: breathing masks, are moving in and out of the building.
text: The sound of fire deterrent foam SPRAYING is audible
text: within. Smoke billows out from the door.
text: The paramedic looks to the volunteer firefighter.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: What’s the deal?
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: Guess there’s two bodies in there, both
dialog: of them burned up pretty bad. One of the
dialog: guys said their teeth are missing, got
dialog: knocked out, so I don’t know what the
dialog: deal is. Soon as they give us the clear,
dialog: we go in.
text: The paramedic nods, watching masked men in full body
text: protection gear exit the building.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: At the rear of the ambulance, Luke leans over and rests
text: his head on Anna’s shoulder. Anna puts her arm around
text: him. She looks around, surveying the activity around the
text: smoldering building.
text: As Anna watches, one of the masked fireman emerges from
text: behind the building. He turns his head around in all
text: directions, then looks over at Anna.
text: Anna notices the masked fireman watching her. She blinks,
text: tired, then turns away, staring out into the distance, at
text: the dark night sky. Next to her, Luke closes his eyes.
text: The masked fireman watches Anna and Luke for another
text: moment, then turns and LIMPS AWAY, disappearing into the
text: darkness of the field behind the building.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
