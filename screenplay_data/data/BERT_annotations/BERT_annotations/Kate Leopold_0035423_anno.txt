speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY
text: CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.
text: The credits begin to roll.
text: Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in
text: preparation for a formal reception.
text: Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.
text: Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.
text: Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.
text: Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.
text: Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with
text: decorative garnish.
text: Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting
text: enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey,
text: pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and
text: flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering,
text: sour look.
text: The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared
text: silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet
text: throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing
text: a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The
text: valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.
text: The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.
text: Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet,
text: selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From
text: beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A
text: weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.
scene_heading: EXT. ESTATE - DAY
text: The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a
text: dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon,
text: he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He
text: sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.
text: In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the
text: estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - EVENING
text: Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly
text: scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway.
text: Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling
text: the staff to clean up the mess.
scene_heading: SERIES OF CLOSE UPS
text: Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.
text: A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.
text: Hot water is poured into a bath.
text: Carriages begin to arrive.
text: Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.
text: Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.
text: He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat
text: of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens
text: a corset around his mid-section from behind.
text: Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.
text: He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver
text: saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch
text: himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.
text: He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet
text: sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold
text: thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and
text: saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.
text: Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his
text: hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: Fine linen undervest slides over his head.
text: Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.
text: The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.
text: A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.
text: A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.
text: An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails
text: to the knees is fitted to his torso.
text: His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.
text: His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.
text: His cheeks are pinched.
text: A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.
text: Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He
text: raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a
dialog: waffle:
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You dance like a herd of cattle,
dialog: Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman
text: who lights up the room... simply by
dialog: leaving it.
text: He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO,
text: a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold
text: in the looking glass.
speaker_heading: UNCLE OTTO
dialog: Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join
dialog: us downstairs after completing this
dialog: one-sided flash of wit?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle
dialog: Otto. No one really listens to anyone
dialog: else. If you attempt it, you will
dialog: see why.
speaker_heading: UNCLE OTTO
dialog: You judge everything too severely. I
dialog: wonder what would happen if you were
dialog: to cast that critical eye inward?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You do not wonder at all. You merely
dialog: ask in order to state your own
dialog: opinion.
speaker_heading: UNCLE OTTO
dialog: We are all concerned about you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Ahh, here it comes.
speaker_heading: UNCLE OTTO
dialog: Your life does not seem to have any
text: direction. At the age of 25 a man is
dialog: too young to do anything well. At 35
dialog: he is too old. Now is your time to
dialog: take action. Tell me, what is it you
dialog: want to DO with your life?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: I do not know.
speaker_heading: UNCLE OTTO
dialog: (just as weary)
dialog: Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
text: (he slaps Leopold's
dialog: face twice rather
dialog: quickly)
dialog: Wake up! This is your one and only
dialog: life. Every man has the chance to
dialog: make a difference. DO something!
text: Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I am most grateful for your
dialog: surveillance and for your sympathy.
dialog: I assure you there is no need for
dialog: concern. I am as effectual and
dialog: attentive... as my position allows.
speaker_heading: UNCLE OTTO
dialog: Life is not position, Leopold. It is
dialog: action.
dialog: (he straightens
dialog: Leopold's tie)
dialog: I will see you downstairs promptly.
dialog: In the appropriate frame of mind.
text: He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers.
text: The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy.
text: Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.
text: Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He
text: hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...
speaker_heading: THE VALET
dialog: (grandly)
dialog: Go spread joy.
text: Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian
text: society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance
text: card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is
text: MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting
dialog: God.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically
text: into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly
text: SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.
text: Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing
text: suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out
dialog: of frame.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of
text: 19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away
text: shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows
text: into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams
text: up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky
dialog: teeth.
text: Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of
dialog: immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he
text: maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except
text: her enormous bosom.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You dance like an angel, Miss
dialog: Fairchild. You light up the room. I
dialog: thank you.
text: Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card,
text: sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.
text: He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She
text: scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around.
text: Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Good evening. I do not believe I
dialog: have had the pleasure.
text: The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes
text: he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: ...Julia Carlson.
text: Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (slightly tipsy)
dialog: You are not from the area, are you?
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (smiles and shakes
dialog: her head "No")
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: This is my estate.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: Really?
dialog: (looking around the
dialog: room)
dialog: Well it's not home but it's much...
text: Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There
text: is a hubbub amongst the guests.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
scene_heading: Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It is a scandal nonetheless.
text: Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Miss Carlson, do me the honor?
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (smiling seductively)
dialog: Truly I would be in your debt. Any
dialog: admonition would be erased simply by
dialog: presenting a partner as lovely as
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: No, no. Really, I...
text: Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck,
text: takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.
text: They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA-
text: BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson,
text: shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I suppose we really ought to sing
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh, golly.
text: They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their
text: emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes
text: freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Thank you for the dance. It was
dialog: lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Not at all. It was most enlightening.
text: There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes
dialog: midnight.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: I really must be going.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I won't hear of it.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (moving away from him)
dialog: No, I'm quite late as it is.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I shall see you to the door...
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (stopping him
dialog: resolutely)
dialog: You're very sweet. I had a wonderful
dialog: time.
text: (she watches him,
text: memorizing his face.
dialog: Then firmly)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He
text: watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard
text: door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the
text: dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes
text: back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She
text: is once again writing in her notebook.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Miss Carlson?
text: Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS.
text: Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped,
text: MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting
text: a weird glow.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Good God...
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: What are you...? You frightened me.
text: Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What sort of mechanism is this?
text: Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Answer me!
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: It's perfectly all right. It's...
text: Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside.
text: Carlson FREEZES.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (carefully,
dialog: deliberately)
dialog: Listen to me. Please. Move very
text: slowly. Step out of the machine.
dialog: Step out and I'll explain whatever
dialog: you want to know.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What is this? Who are you?
text: His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: Oh, God.
text: She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away,
text: accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls
text: from the machine.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (suddenly frantic)
dialog: Get out of there! Get out now!
text: The machine LIGHTS UP.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Miss Carlson... I...
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: No!!!
text: The compartment door snaps shut.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: Shit!!
text: There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Blackness fills the screen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. N.Y.C. LABORATORY - 1995 DAY
text: The compartment door slides OPEN revealing DR. KAU, 30's, an
text: Asian doctor with a THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT. Her face full of
text: enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Shit!!
text: She turns to her co-workers, warning them.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Shit!!
text: She looks back at Leopold.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Shit!!
text: Her co-workers, DR. PLODDER, austere, authoritative, DR.
text: DRAKE, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Good God!
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Everybody stay calm... Lock the front
dialog: door.
text: Dr. Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious
dialog: Leopold.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: No, no, no. You mustn't touch him.
dialog: The consequences could be
dialog: catastrophic.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
text: He could be hurt, or even dead.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: ...All right. Touch him.
text: They approach Leopold. Dr. Kau finds Carlson's note pad on
text: the ground next to Leopold. She reads the last entry.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: ...But I'm stuck and it's only a
dialog: dance and he IS the seventh Duke of
dialog: Albany...
text: They all look at one another, then back at Leopold.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Carlson...!
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: (racing from the room)
dialog: Give me a minute...
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: INT. LAB - KATE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: KATHERINE COLES, a radiant workaholic, types frenetically
text: into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard
dialog: not to sound upset.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Who's upset? People fall in love,
text: they have to climb back out.
dialog: (she laughs but she
dialog: is not smiling)
dialog: So, what? We'll just be friends now,
dialog: Right?
text: She stops typing and listens for a while. She runs her hand
text: through her hair.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
dialog: (using her middle
text: finger she pushes up
dialog: her glasses)
dialog: No. I'll just think of this as
text: surviving another dating accident.
dialog: Take care or good luck or whatever
dialog: I'm supposed to...
text: The line goes dead.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...say... Goodbye.
text: Dr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly
text: becomes very centered.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
text: She's back.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: That's impossible! She wasn't supposed
dialog: to return until...
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Kate. It's Carlson. Something went
dialog: wrong.
text: He hands her Carlson's note pad. Slowly, she sits down.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...The 7th Duke...
scene_heading: INT. LAB - DAY
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (all business, reading
dialog: from a printout)
dialog: ...of Albany. He was the... IS the
dialog: son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no
dialog: actual importance until he vanished
dialog: at the turn of the century without a
dialog: trace. It was a sensation. In the
dialog: 30's they even made a movie about
dialog: him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald
dialog: Coleman.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: (absently)
dialog: I love Ronald Coleman.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Despite much speculation and a nation
dialog: wide investigation, a body was never
text: found. He was never heard from again.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Until now.
text: There is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: We've altered the course of history.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: We never should have started this...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: What are we going to do? We can't
dialog: keep him here. Imagine if anyone
dialog: found out!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now,
dialog: no one would believe such a stupid
dialog: mistake could be made because no one
dialog: would believe any of this is possible.
dialog: So. We fix this. We keep this to
dialog: ourselves and we fix it. Fast.
text: They all nod in agreement.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st
dialog: priority: Locate Carlson. Drake,
dialog: determine the reciprocal correlation's
dialog: connected to the 19th century. Work
dialog: 24 hours a day if necessary. In the
dialog: meantime... one of us will have to
dialog: take charge of him.
text: She forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives
text: her away.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: This is a major scientific
dialog: opportunity. It doesn't get any better
dialog: than this. Imagine. Researching the
dialog: behavior, the physical and emotional
dialog: characteristics of a century ago!
dialog: Utilizing technology available to us
dialog: today... He's a gold mine!
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And while he's here, he's ours. Any
dialog: volunteers?
text: No one moves.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked
dialog: will be responsible. Agreed?
text: They nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them
text: in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally:
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: I'll do it.
text: All the scientists face her.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: You'll look after him?
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: No, I meant I'll pick the name.
text: She reaches in. They wait with mounting suspense. Finally
text: SHE TURNS TO KATE. The scientists follow her gaze. A beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Fine.
text: Leopold stirs. He blinks at the group.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Where...? What has happened?!
text: The doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround
text: Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee
dialog: aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge
text: research team. A project funded by
dialog: the government of the United States.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (regarding their
dialog: appearance with
dialog: distaste)
dialog: Oh. Americans. I see...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes, um... For the past six and a
dialog: half years we've been conducting
dialog: scientific experiments on density
dialog: and flexibility in the dimensions of
dialog: time and space.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came
text: upon a formula utilizing Tachyons...
dialog: particles traveling faster than the
dialog: speed of light, which allowed us
dialog: to... fold time so to speak.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Yes. Bend it between the cracks of
dialog: the dimensions.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Yes.
text: They all laugh nervously. Leopold does not.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Now, while that wasn't the original
dialog: purpose of our experiment, we opted
dialog: to pursue it, well, privately, on
dialog: our own.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
text: Borrowing funds already provided.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We journeyed to your time because it
dialog: was the quickest path to follow. We
dialog: debated long and hard whether we
dialog: should use this knowledge at all.
dialog: Believe me, it was never our intent
dialog: to disturb the past...
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Merely to discover if the expedition
dialog: were possible. As your presence here
dialog: confirms... we are very disturbed.
text: Leopold nods at them as if they are insane.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: The problem facing us is not only
dialog: HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you
dialog: see?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We certainly don't want to
dialog: miscalculate. Send you to a different
dialog: era entirely.
text: Leopold starts to speak.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Rest assured, no harm will come to
dialog: you. You'll be well looked after by
dialog: Dr. Coles.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What
dialog: do you mean, get me back home?...
dialog: Where am I?
text: Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for
dialog: the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting
text: and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting.
text: The doctors are silent.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Answer me!...
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Would you have me believe... I am
dialog: being detained, at present in the
dialog: HEREAFTER?... The time to come?
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: It is the year nineteen hundred and
text: ninety-five.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: ...19...?
text: Leopold leaps up. The doctors follow him around the room.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You're insane! All of you! This is
dialog: impossible!
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Leopold, calm down!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: A voyage through time! What do you
dialog: take me for? Did you bring me here
dialog: by force?
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: We're scientist, not seditionists.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (truly panicked)
dialog: Let me out of here! I won't stand
dialog: for this another moment!
text: He's out the door.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - DAY
text: Leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit
text: hallway, the doctors close behind.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, wait!
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: You don't know what you're doing.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Just listen to what we have to say!
text: It is too late. Leopold throws open the door and runs
text: upstairs.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Blinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights.
text: Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car
text: alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: 19...?
text: The doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Kate and Dr. Kau talk quietly. Leopold, tightly holding onto
text: his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter
dialog: disbelief.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Squab.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Squab?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I remember reading they ate a lot of
text: squab.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Squab... Do you have a squab?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (quietly. On the verge
dialog: of panic)
dialog: I don't know!
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Pull yourself together!
dialog: (turning to Leopold)
dialog: Are you all right back there?
text: Leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds,
text: magnified. Perspiration runs down the side of his face. Kate
text: watches him in her rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're going to be fine you know.
dialog: There's nothing to worry about. I
dialog: have everything under control.
text: Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (quietly to Dr. Kau)
dialog: We'll never get away with this.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt.
text: His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly
text: rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out
text: on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes
text: his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.
text: There is a KNOCK on the door.
text: Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of
dialog: dignity.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How are you feeling?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I thought you might like some tea.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I insist on being returned home
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I understand. We're doing our best.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I wish to speak with your employer,
dialog: Dr. Coles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're speaking to him.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You are not suggesting that you are
dialog: Dr. Coles?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Miss... uh?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dr. Coles. If you like, you could
dialog: call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's
dialog: too much, how about just plain Kate?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: A WOMAN of science?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hard to believe?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: But a woman's brain cannot obtain
dialog: enough knowledge to posses a truly
dialog: scientific mind.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (jotting this down)
dialog: Interesting. Nevertheless, we've
dialog: come a long way baby.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Are you attempting to be humorous?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm attempting to be informative
text: it's just coming out humorous.
text: Leopold regards her dubiously.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (clinically)
dialog: Look, modern social science clearly
dialog: states that a woman's place in society
dialog: marks the level of that civilization.
text: A science career for a woman is now
dialog: almost as acceptable as being a...
dialog: a... waitress. Cream and sugar?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Young lady, I... Surely it is not
dialog: expected that I remain here with you
dialog: indefinitely... Unchaperoned?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (pen poised)
dialog: Does that make you nervous?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Certainly not!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Then what are you getting so red
dialog: about? It's a very large apartment...
text: with locks on all the doors.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The idea! My dear Miss Coles...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dr. Coles.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Honey...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (she puts the pad
dialog: down)
dialog: Let's get one thing straight right
dialog: now. My name is Kate or Katherine or
dialog: if you insist Dr. Coles.
dialog: (she rises)
dialog: Take a good long look, Leopold. I am
dialog: a 20th century American woman with a
dialog: Doctorate and a commission and
dialog: independence. I am not your "young
dialog: lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your
dialog: "honey." Is that clear?
text: Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Honey... For the tea.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...I'll get it for you.
text: Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard
text: searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear
text: and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries
text: posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the
dialog: toaster.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Thank you... Has it been decided
dialog: what it is I am to do while I am
dialog: being held here?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, just some laundry, the cooking,
dialog: a little light housework...
text: Leopold doesn't react.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (clearing her throat)
dialog: I took the liberty of preparing a
dialog: simple schedule to efficiently utilize
dialog: your time while incorporating you
dialog: into my routine.
text: (she hands him a
dialog: schedule)
dialog: As you can see, my day begins with
dialog: meditation and yoga from 6:30 to
text: 7:00.
text: She moves in close to him, making Leopold uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and
dialog: change and at 7:15, we breakfast
dialog: together. 7:45 we begin the days
text: work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to
dialog: observe you in your natural routine
dialog: as I research the data that will
dialog: enable you to return home. At 1:15
dialog: we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a
dialog: daily questionnaire, I type up my
dialog: notes. At precisely 6:15 you will
dialog: enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then,
text: at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while
dialog: making dinner as YOU write down any
dialog: questions that come up during your
dialog: day. At 7:00, we dine together. If
dialog: you need me at any time you may ring
dialog: this bell.
text: She rings a tiny dinner bell. He is about to speak.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have
dialog: computer science class, Tuesdays I
dialog: have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm
dialog: usually home by 9:15. During these
dialog: periods you may read any of the books
dialog: I've picked out for you in your room.
dialog: I organize my next days work at 10:30,
dialog: 11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in
dialog: bed.
text: (she takes a breath,
dialog: smiles at him)
dialog: Next day we begin again. Simple?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: (after a beat, with
dialog: great dignity)
dialog: ...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?
text: Kate is forced into a stunned silence.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S VOICE
dialog: Kate? I'm home.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Your father?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sort of. My brother.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Visiting?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: For the past two years. Charlie can
dialog: never know about this project. We'll
dialog: tell him you are a... overly
dialog: distinguished colleague staying here
dialog: as our guest. From Canada. Which
dialog: would explain your lack of familiarity
dialog: with our customs and so forth
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (aghast)
speaker_heading: A CANADIAN?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Make yourself comfortable. I'll check
dialog: in on you later. I think this is
dialog: going very well, don't you?
text: Leopold looks at her blankly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay. If you need anything, just
dialog: ring.
text: Kate tinkles the bell, fumbles for the knob and heads out.
text: P.O.V. still on Leopold.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Charlie!
text: Leopold reacts.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (V.O.)
text: (screaming just as
dialog: loud)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (still shouting)
dialog: Come here I wanna talk to you.
text: Leopold listens at the door. He slowly opens it, takes two
text: steps out, peers around the corner, then quickly steps back
text: in. He takes a DEEP FRIGHTENED BREATH and slowly deflates.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - MORNING
text: Charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by
text: his paintings. He is a likable twentysomething with a big
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (removing his coffee
text: from the table,
text: setting it on a
dialog: coaster)
dialog: RINGS! And what did I say about you
dialog: smoking in the house?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You were against it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Correct. You're back early.
dialog: (She takes away his
dialog: cigarette)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey!... Are you all right? You look
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Funny ha ha or funny odd?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Both.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That all depends. How was your trip?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If it was good I'll tell you the
dialog: truth. If it was rotten I'll have to
dialog: butter you up first.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Butter me up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Have you been working out? No, I'm
dialog: really starting to see results. Are
dialog: you comfortable there on the couch?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there
dialog: the next few nights.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You have to be out of here by 8 and
dialog: you can't be back before 6. We have
dialog: an important man working with us
dialog: with very unusual needs. The company
text: is insisting he stay here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What about a hotel?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: This man requires around the clock
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I meant for me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thank you, Charlie.
dialog: (she kisses his
dialog: forehead)
dialog: I owe you one.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You owe me nine. What am I supposed
dialog: to do all day?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (as if having an
dialog: epiphany)
dialog: You could get a job!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate, the entire point of being an
dialog: artist is that I don't have to work.
dialog: Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, I can't tell you much because...
scene_heading: KATE AND CHARLIE
dialog: I'm not allowed to discuss what goes
text: on at the office.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be
dialog: interesting to have someone else to
text: talk to. It gets so quiet around
dialog: here sometimes I feel like I've gone
dialog: deaf.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Does he have a label?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's exactly like his name.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Then you owe me ten.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room.
text: Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up
text: to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright
text: fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to
text: rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large.
text: He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button
dialog: ON.
text: Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before
text: an excited crowd.
text: Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of
text: him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously,
text: slams the power OFF.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Horrible!
text: He quickly scurries out the hallway.
text: He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself,
text: he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he
text: purposefully steps back inside.
text: He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted
text: by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that.
text: He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly
text: examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.
text: He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks
text: the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment
text: in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.
text: Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the
text: lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: He's from Canada...
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie
text: banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (finally)
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's called Hamburger Helper.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It is beyond help. Please serve the
dialog: next course.
text: He pushes his plate away.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm afraid there is no next course.
dialog: If you make a list of the foods you
dialog: like, I'll pick them up at the store
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is all food here this... textured?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mine's good.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Please understand, I am used to a
dialog: different sort of preparation. Where
dialog: I come from a proper meal is the
dialog: result of reflection and study. A
dialog: recipe is merely a theme which an
dialog: intelligent cook can plan each time
dialog: with variation.
text: Charlie gives Kate a look.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Several courses are served. Menus
dialog: are often prepared days in advance,
dialog: timed to perfection. It is said,
dialog: without the culinary art, the
dialog: crudeness of reality would make life
dialog: unbearable.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: In Canada?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: (after a beat. Firmly)
dialog: In Canada.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We have a saying here. "Shake and
dialog: shake the catsup bottle, none will
dialog: come and then a lot'll."
text: He pours catsup on his dinner.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How interesting.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Since you're such an expert on fine
dialog: cuisine, why don't you make dinner
dialog: tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It should be obvious to you that I
dialog: am NOT a domestic. You may take my
dialog: plate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I have my own, thank you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who died and made me Cinderella?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Young man, there is a distinct
dialog: impertinence to your voice.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's part of my charm.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Suppress it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Leopold... Since you're our guest
dialog: here, there are several cultural
dialog: events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie
text: has season tickets to the ball game.
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to take that in?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What is it??
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Or the Opera or the Ballet?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What is it??
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie, there's no rule that says
dialog: everyone has to be interested in
dialog: baseball.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, but I believe there is a rule
dialog: that says everyone has to have HEARD
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles, your brother Charles
dialog: attitude and demeanor are
dialog: unacceptable. If I am to stay on
dialog: here you must have a serious talk
dialog: with him regarding respect and
dialog: civility.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: CHARLES, could you help me with the
dialog: dessert in the kitchen?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: In the kitchen?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: IN the kitchen. Excuse us.
text: Kate and Charlie leave. The camera remains on Leopold, sitting
text: alone, calmly sipping his wine. VOICE OVER FROM THE KITCHEN:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't believe this guy!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Try to be nice to him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm always NICE!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Please Charlie, as a favor to me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He gives me the creeps.
text: Leopold reacts. He listens self-consciously.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's different that's all.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What was that crack about domestics?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie, this is important to me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're not going out with him, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm
dialog: not a lost cause.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys
dialog: you bring home.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I've done countless favors for you!
dialog: Now I'm asking for just one little
dialog: thing...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, all right! All right! All right!
text: They emerge from the kitchen, beaming.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: We forgot the dessert.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know,... I don't know if I
dialog: mentioned it... but that is one fine
text: looking suit.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - 6:30 A. M.
text: Radio alarm clock -- 7:45 a.m. Louis Armstrong begins to
text: sing, "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." Dressed in yoga
text: clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position. She bangs
text: the gong and closes her eyes. A bell rings. Kate flinches
text: but does not open her eyes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (too sweetly)
dialog: What is it, Leopold?
text: The bell rings louder, interrupting Kate's routine.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (eyes closed, screaming
dialog: like a fishwife)
dialog: WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?!
text: Leopold's bell rings with determination. Kate is off the bed
text: and out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Kate enters and stops short. Leopold sits at the table ringing
text: a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the
text: blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is
text: BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every
text: cupboard door is OPEN. Garbage disposal runs FULL BLAST.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: (calmly amidst the
dialog: chaos)
dialog: I cannot seem to find the tea...
text: CLOSE UP: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open
text: closet. Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No... No... No. Good God, no!...
dialog: Perhaps...
text: He tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes.
text: CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING
text: Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom. Kate checks
text: her schedule and bangs on the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, your time is up! What's he
dialog: got, a girl in there?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "Whitecap"
text: marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He
text: picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder.
text: It SPRAYS.
text: CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He
text: discovers the clapper has been stolen.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON
text: Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks
text: up and stops suddenly.
text: Leopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of
text: Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap,
text: bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses
text: foppishly.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I should like to read about modern
dialog: currency during my bath tonight. See
text: that the tub and basin are scrubbed
text: up. Remnants remain of this afternoons
dialog: shave.
text: Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of
text: clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing
dialog: skis.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
text: He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book.
text: Each are wearing a walkman.
text: He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously
text: until they look up.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - DAY
text: Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian
text: customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other.
text: A beat.
text: Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles
text: papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman.
text: She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty
text: room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer,
text: she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the
text: window and looks out.
scene_heading: INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the
text: brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment.
text: He moves to the window and looks out.
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly
text: pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON
text: Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: In our last session you intimated
dialog: there was a symmetrical system
dialog: regulating the social order of
dialog: conformity spanning your era. I found
dialog: this particularly intriguing If I
dialog: can just find it in my notes...
text: A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then
text: turns back, excited.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The fire brigade!
text: Kate stares at him blankly. She munches RICE CAKES and drinks
text: water FROM THE BOTTLE. A beat. She returns to her notes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: This is insufferable! I refuse to be
text: spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled
dialog: about any longer. I have yet to
dialog: venture outside this cell. Before I
dialog: go mad a more suitable arrangement
dialog: must be found.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Found it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (startled)
dialog: A resolution?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No I meant I found my notes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I can hear you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (under control now)
dialog: Miss Coles, as we are to remain here
dialog: together, there are certain conditions
dialog: I insist are met and maintained. I
dialog: no longer wish to be peeped at,
dialog: mocked...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I never...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Or interrupted. Jot this down.
dialog: Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner
dialog: at 8. A horse should be made available
dialog: from 1 to 3.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A horse? In New York City?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about
dialog: your style of dress. I do not care
dialog: for it.
dialog: (Kate looks up)
dialog: I cannot believe it is the prevailing
dialog: taste for women to appear masculine
dialog: and unkempt. If this is the fashion,
dialog: have it altered.
text: Kate rises.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: That is all for the present.
text: He grandly hands her a napkin.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: CRUMBS, my dear!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (infuriated)
dialog: Thank you!
text: Brushing herself off, she heads to the door.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted
dialog: with many women in my time, yet I am
dialog: compelled to say that the modern
dialog: woman is by far the least attractive
dialog: I have ever encountered.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (rising to the occasion)
text: And I have a news flash of my own.
text: Leopold waits.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!

speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Peach.
text: They dig in.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Any luck?
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No
dialog: information exists detailing what
dialog: happened to Carlson. I've been working
dialog: for weeks and I'm not any closer
dialog: than when I began... How are you
dialog: doing?
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: My cholesterol level is up 70 points.
text: Kate enters, exhausted, deposits an armful of papers on Dr.
text: Drake's desk. Kate has pencils tucked behind her ear, through
text: her hair, and in her mouth.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Thank you, Kate... How're you managing
dialog: with Leopold?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear?
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Nothing. I was just asking.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight.
dialog: Everything's under control.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Keep up the good work.
dialog: (after she's gone)
text: She seemed a little scattered. Do
dialog: you think everything's all right?
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Katherine Coles is the most capable
dialog: person we have on this project. If
dialog: anyone can handle the delicacy of
dialog: this situation, Kate can.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: So there's nothing to worry about?
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Absolutely not.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: GONE? GONE WHERE?!
dialog: (Charlie shrugs)
dialog: Charlie we've got to find him!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (working on a VERY
speaker_heading: STERN portrait of
text: Kate at her computer)
dialog: Are you crazy? This is the first
dialog: time all week my eyes aren't darting
text: to the top of my sockets every five
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: When did he leave?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know. An hour ago? He said
dialog: he wanted to take a walk.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And you let him?? He's not allowed
dialog: to go outside!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is he being punished?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We've got to find him! You stay here
dialog: in case he finds his way back. And
dialog: while you wait you'd better pray
dialog: he's all right. If anything happens
text: to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING
dialog: we've worked for will have been
dialog: destroyed.
text: She heads out the door. Charlie follows.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate, calm down.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand?
text: (she grabs her coat
dialog: and purse)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's the big deal? Who is this
dialog: guy?
text: Kate takes a LONG pause.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold... is not really from Canada.
scene_heading: EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Peaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills.
dialog: Suddenly:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (V.O.)
dialog: OH MY GOD!!!
text: The pigeons take flight.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING
text: Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both
text: ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING
text: brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified,
text: caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed.
text: A motorist pulls along side of him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN MOTORIST
dialog: You stupid fucking son of a bitch.
dialog: Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron.
text: Leopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads
text: into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT
text: Kate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with
text: mounting anger.
speaker_heading: CABBY
dialog: What're ya waiting for lady? An
dialog: invitation?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
text: She continues searching, trying hard to remain calm.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
text: Huge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles.
text: Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled
text: BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He
text: enters a deli.
scene_heading: INT. DELI - NIGHT
text: Leopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has
dialog: none.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (to the counter man)
dialog: $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?
speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: You gotta problem with that?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It seems rather pricey to me.
speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: So don't buy one.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I shan't.
speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: So shan't!

speaker_heading: LEOPOLD

speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: Get the fuck outta here.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: May I remind you, merchant, that I
dialog: am the customer in this establishment
dialog: and as such require your attention
dialog: and the utmost respect. I do not
dialog: accept this modern convention of
dialog: desecrating one's patrons with such
text: contemptuous disregard.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE WOMAN
dialog: You tell him.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Need I add that without our patronage
dialog: you would not own that unwashed

speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: Where do you get off? You don't even

speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing.
speaker_heading: COUNTER MAN
dialog: Not in my store you're not.

speaker_heading: LEOPOLD

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD

text: hastily backs up along side Leopold.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold! Leopold, get in.
text: Leopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and
text: helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - 4 A.M.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (nearly in tears,
text: trying to dry him
dialog: off)
dialog: Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're
dialog: all right. I didn't think I'd ever
dialog: find you. You had us all so worried.
dialog: Oh, Leopold!
text: She hits him hard.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don't you ever go out again without
dialog: my permission, do you hear me? I was
dialog: frantic. You could have been killed
dialog: a hundred times over. I never would
dialog: have known.
text: She rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She
text: pulls herself together and looks at him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, are you all right?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (looking deep into
dialog: her eyes for the
dialog: first time)
dialog: I wish to go home.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (badly shaken)

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: I don't know. It's just Leopold.
dialog: Like Cher. Or Goofy.
text: Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Never mind they just walked in. Jesus.
dialog: You look horrible.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie, don't start. I haven't been
dialog: this angry at you since you got me
dialog: into that pyramid thing last year.
dialog: If you make a wisecrack I'm going to
text: burst into flame.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look
dialog: horrible.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm too tired for this now. I'll
dialog: just save it up and kill you tomorrow.
text: Help Leopold out of his things and
dialog: lets get him to bed.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I've something to say. To the both
dialog: of you. I... Nothing is what it seems.
dialog: After witnessing mere weeks of this
dialog: age it is painfully apparent I am
dialog: outside of my acquaintance... I don't
dialog: know how to proceed. I frankly... am
dialog: in need of assistance. I'm sorry.
dialog: I'm not very good at this. In the
dialog: event you have missed it, I am
text: apologizing.
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: About time.
text: (he shakes Leopold's
dialog: hand reluctantly)
dialog: Welcome back.
dialog: (he leaves)
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don't mind him. His heart would be
dialog: in the right place if he had a heart.
dialog: Surliness runs in my family.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I understand. It practically races
dialog: through mine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one
dialog: that's not at my expense. That's
dialog: good.
text: They look at each other just a second too long.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: We'd better get to bed... That is...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes... I start work...
text: (she looks at her
dialog: watch)
dialog: in three and a half hours.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh, dear.
text: They self-consciously head to their respective rooms.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's fine. I'm used to it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You mustn't get too used to it. You'll
dialog: find life passes you by awfully
dialog: quickly.
text: Kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and
text: is moved. She catches herself quickly however.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Thank you for...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (waving it away)
dialog: Oh!
text: They stand at their bedroom doors.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Well, goodnight then.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold?... I don't have a clear
dialog: handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong
dialog: keeping you confined to the apartment
dialog: all this time. I don't know when
dialog: you'll be able return home... Tomorrow
dialog: I'll start preparing you for the
dialog: outside world. And... We'll find
dialog: your way back. I promise.
text: Leopold smiles, still shaken. A beat. They slowly close the

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING
text: Leopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes?
text: Leopold enters. Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at
text: Leopold. Leopold immediately turns, facing the door.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was
dialog: merely... I didn't...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Is there something you want, Leopold?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I merely wanted to see... that is,
dialog: inquire, on your availability, for
dialog: an outing... My assimilation and so
dialog: forth.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of
dialog: us. I'll be out in a minute.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes, of course. Splendid.
text: He reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob.
text: He finally finds it and goes out.
text: Kate smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY
text: Kate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip
text: Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Are you certain this is correct?
text: Kate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods
text: approvingly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Certainly I'm certain.
text: Leopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend
text: it. Kate leads him into Barney's.
scene_heading: INT. BARNEY'S - DAY
text: Leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit.
text: He looks FANTASTIC. A fact that is not lost on Kate.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Now really. Isn't this better?
text: Kate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away.
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY
text: Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes.
scene_heading: INT. GRISTEDES MARKET - DAY
text: Kate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Allow me.
text: Kate walks ahead. Leopold, maneuvering a cart with a broken
text: wheel, hasn't the knack and bangs into everyone and everything
text: in the aisle.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE UPS: Leopold scrutinizing vegetables in cans, cereals
dialog: for kids, bottled water, instant soup, feminine hygiene
dialog: supplies.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The check out line. As their groceries are being rung up,
text: Leopold spots The Sun, a newspaper with the headline: Woman
text: Sees Satan in her Microwave Oven. Leopold eagerly shows Kate.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Have you seen today's paper?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Put it back.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Back!
text: Leopold reads the paper totally enthralled.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm.
text: Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles, why is it you are not
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Women are longer defined by the men
dialog: they're married to, Leopold. I have
dialog: a career. I haven't found a man who
dialog: fits in with that yet.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yet people still marry?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: I've heard of cases.
text: They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I suspect there is something wrong
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: There's nothing wrong with me!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Perhaps it is the way you present
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: There is some sort of problem when a
text: woman reaches thirty and insists on
dialog: remaining single.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You think I'm THIRTY?!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Do I look THIRTY to you?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It was an arbitrary number.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You chose it specifically opposed to
dialog: a lower number.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I didn't mean it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...Thirty!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I apologize... How old are you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: I'm thirty! But you're the first
dialog: person whoever told me I looked it!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window. He takes a
text: good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside.
text: Kate continues down the block.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And it's not that I insist on
dialog: remaining single. Believe me. Everyone
dialog: dreams of finding somebody to share
dialog: their life with. To give someone all
dialog: the love they've been hoarding since
dialog: they were a kid. I'm no different.
dialog: But one has to be sensible. I have a
dialog: career and a life that's filled
dialog: with...
text: She looks around. Leopold is gone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not again...
text: She starts off down the street, stops, and enters ROBERTA'S,
text: an upscale boutique.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY
text: Kate races in. Leopold talks with a saleslady.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do I have to do? Put a leash
dialog: around your neck?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (to the saleslady)
dialog: She is the woman to whom I was
dialog: referring. You see the problem?
speaker_heading: SALESLADY
dialog: (giving Kate the once
dialog: over)
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (staring down at her
text: clothes then back at
dialog: the two of them)
dialog: What?... What?
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY
text: From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others
text: with irritation.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: This is ridiculous. I don't have
dialog: time to...
dialog: (she shrieks)
dialog: Do you know what this dress costs?
dialog: Let's get this over with. I'm coming
text: out. Nobody laugh.
text: Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE
text: that she is STUNNING.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Satisfied?
text: Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...What?
text: She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands
text: behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You have a lovely face.
text: Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at
text: herself for a long while.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: We'll take the dress.
text: They become aware of their close proximity. They nervously
dialog: part.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and
text: hands him the remote control.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: The drug of the 20th century.
text: She aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's
text: spellbound.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Dinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits
text: on the sofa watching the TV.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, your dinner's getting cold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm coming.
text: He does not move a muscle.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and
text: watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys
text: this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold
text: grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (making notes)
dialog: It's a guy thing.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control.
text: Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold.
text: She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to
text: capture a better look at his face.
text: After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand
text: and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types.
text: Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She
text: looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.
text: Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to
text: the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly
text: mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.
text: She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins
text: pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.
scene_heading: INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes
text: area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and
text: several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for
dialog: solutions.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...Now within that astronomical
dialog: structure, Dr. Drake here is searching
dialog: for a pathway between your time and
dialog: the present. He'll find it too if
text: his arteries don't harden first.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Astounding.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Once that is discovered, the search
dialog: begins for the exact time and date
dialog: travel will be possible.
text: They move to Dr. Kau's area.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (to Dr. Kau)
dialog: How are you proceeding?
text: Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don't take it personally. Once Dr.
dialog: Kau starts working, you just have to
text: wait until her batteries run down.
dialog: We're all pretty much like that.
text: They head into Kate's office.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The complexity of this equation is
dialog: astonishing? Can you really comprehend
dialog: all that?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (simply. Almost
dialog: apologetically)
dialog: I'm a genius.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: That is to say, you all are.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thank you. And may I say that
dialog: sometimes, in DIM light, you're not
dialog: so bad yourself.
text: They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm
dialog: late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: May I accompany you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You mayn't.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I am not certain I understand therapy.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No one does. That's why therapists
dialog: can charge so much.
text: As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high
text: heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What exactly transpires during
dialog: therapy?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Leopold. A gentleman does not ask
dialog: those questions. Come on, we'll get
dialog: you home.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I am perfectly able to travel homeward
dialog: myself.
text: Kate looks at him skeptically.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Really! I have finance and our
dialog: address. I shall take a cabbie.
text: Kate hesitates.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You are late. I insist. I am NOT a
dialog: child. Dr. Coles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: All right. Don't bite my head off.
text: She shakes her head and walks out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet
text: behind, Leopold cautiously follows.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR
text: Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back,
text: grimaces noticeably at the smell.
text: Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into
text: the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.
text: He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around
text: to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands
dialog: NOSE to NOSE with the nun.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I can't seem to...
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Oh, for heaven's sake...
text: The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as
text: the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.
text: He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in
text: the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly
text: against the glass.
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING
text: Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray
text: Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a
dialog: distance.
scene_heading: INT. DANCE STUDIO - EVENING
text: Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on
text: the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of
text: breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.
scene_heading: MRS. PINCUS
dialog: I was worried. I thought you weren't
dialog: going to make it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (smiling happily)
dialog: Miss my lesson? This is the only
dialog: thing I have to look forward to all
dialog: week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?
text: Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her
text: purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.
text: An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps
text: her hands together loudly.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: All right, kids. Pair up!
text: The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their
text: gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying
text: the floor.
text: The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick
text: their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly,
text: elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while
text: Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music
dialog: plays.
text: The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate
text: dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a
text: beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING
text: look spread across her face.
text: The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the
dialog: music.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sweating)
dialog: I am!
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Dancing should not be work. It should
dialog: be a vacation the body takes from
text: the mind. Let the music wash over
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: It is!
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Repeat after me: I've got the muusic
dialog: in me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I've got the muusic in me.
scene_heading: INSTRUCTOR &amp; KATE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I've got the muusic in me!
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Keep telling yourself that.
text: Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away.
text: Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved.
text: LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling
text: couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her
text: imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps,
text: muttering to herself, dancing alone.

dialog: Look at her face! We have to get her

speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Christine, this morning I spoke with

dialog: about canceling the project.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: What?! They can't do that!
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: There's still time. Nothing has

speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: This is rather difficult for me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...Uh huh...?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I have been in the salon contemplating
dialog: the reception I have received by the
dialog: various tradesmen I have visited.
dialog: I've determined I am lacking the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of what??
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Social skills.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I realize our association has been
dialog: rather distant and I bear you no ill
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can imagine my relief.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The fact is... I need help.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why not ask Kate?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I would appreciate the masculine
text: point of view.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke.
text: Leopold looks worried. Charlie puts down his brush.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well? Let's see... I guess we could
dialog: start by removing that great big
dialog: stick from up your... Let's start
dialog: with your walk.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: My walk?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don't walk right.
dialog: (gently)
dialog: You strut.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (very defensive)
speaker_heading: STRUT?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Strut strut strut. You walk into the
dialog: bathroom it's like I'm watching a

speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I will not.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You
dialog: asked for my help. Trust me on this.
text: As Leopold struts across the room Charlie shakes his head
text: and spontaneously begins to hum Sousa's Stars and Stripes
text: March. Leopold becomes more and more agitated. As the song
dialog: crescendos:
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: That's enough! Really! You walk.
text: Charlie hops up, casually walks around the room and begins
text: to hum a more relaxed version of Stars and Stripes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (between choruses)
dialog: See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.
text: Leopold begins humming the more casual version of the song
text: and mimics Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's better. Now, try to enjoy
dialog: your walk. It's a beautiful day. The

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: VOICE OVER: Charlie and Leopold joyously singing The Stars

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Leopold, are you wearing a corset?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD

dialog: number?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Pretty.
text: Charlie stops the music and places a headset over Leopold's
text: ears. Leopold watches calmly. Charlie selects a song.
text: Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears. His mouth
text: opens wide.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.
text: After a bit, Charlie turns the music off. Leopold's shoulders
text: go down but his mouth stays wide open. Astonished.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: Charlie and Leopold walk through the park. A rubber softball
text: hits Leopold squarely on the head.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What in the world...?
text: A couple race over. The man is BLACK. The woman is WHITE.
text: Their child, ELIZABETH, 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: She's another Babe Ruth. We had no
dialog: idea. Are you okay?
text: Leopold regards them curiously.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What do you have to say for yourself,
dialog: Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm sorry!
text: Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't
text: speak. After a long moment:
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is this your child?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at
dialog: Leopold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: C'mon honey, lets go.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I want my ball.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Just a moment!
dialog: (bending down to
dialog: Elizabeth, firmly)
dialog: Pick a hand.
text: She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left.
text: Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from
text: his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: My mother's name was Elizabeth.
dialog: (then to her parents)
dialog: She's a beautiful child. You're very
dialog: lucky.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What do you say, Elizabeth?
text: Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost
text: in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza
text: pies, and pot pies.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I understand pumpkin pies, pizza
dialog: pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone
dialog: would explain Eskimo pies.
text: He eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange
text: a worried look.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You smoke Camel's, you wear Old
dialog: Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew.
text: It's revolting.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: The pudding tonight is excellent.
dialog: Another thing I've noticed, everyone
text: is in a great rush today. Instant
dialog: Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick,
dialog: Minute Maid. You'll find there's
dialog: much to be said for moderation and
dialog: languor.
text: He eats another spoonful.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Mmmm. Is it tapioca?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's margarine.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (taking the spoon out
dialog: of his mouth)
dialog: It's marvelous.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, I'm off.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Me too. Work to do. Where are you
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine.
dialog: It's this coffee house we go to.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Say hello to Dennis for me.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dennis is this really good looking
dialog: friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's
dialog: alive because SHE doesn't know how
text: to flirt.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: As a rule I don't like to associate
dialog: with really good looking people. It
dialog: makes me feel really... I don't
dialog: know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And he always picks up the check.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's a wonderful idea! Leopold
dialog: mentioned how he wanted to meet...
dialog: People of quality was it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ahhhhh?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: If you'd rather I didn't go...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to
dialog: hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going
dialog: to think you don't want him to go.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh it's not that. It's just that
dialog: it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all.
dialog: I'm not sure you'd have such a good
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: A little ribald humor? I'm not as
dialog: big a stick in the mud as you might
dialog: think! I'd enjoy a gay night out,
text: kicking up my heels.
text: There is an awkward pause. Leopold is so enthusiastic and
text: sincere that despite a feeling of disaster Charlie relents.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Finish off your Parquet and we'll
dialog: go.
text: Charlie gives Kate a look of death as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT
text: Charlie and Leopold approach Caffeine, a trendy coffee house.
text: Charlie looks in the window.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There they all are. Now one more
dialog: thing. Throw the words "like" and
dialog: "you know" into a sentence whenever
dialog: possible. It's how people talk today.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Proper speech does not cease to exist
text: simply because it is ignored.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Charles, you needn't fret. I have
dialog: the walk down pat. I will not give
dialog: myself away. Like.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (looking in the window)
dialog: Oh shit!
dialog: (correcting himself)
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Patrice. See that girl? The blonde
text: one? She's so inconceivably hot.
scene_heading: INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT
text: Patrice, a tall blonde sits at a large round table, talking.
dialog: She is very beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: She's very pretty.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She's mine.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay. I guess we should go in. I
dialog: don't suppose we could tell everyone
dialog: you don't speak English?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Of course not. Let's go inside.
text: Leopold walks his casual walk inside, followed by a very
text: reluctant Charlie.
scene_heading: INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT
text: Charlie's friends are sitting at a table talking. They are a
text: relaxed and friendly group. Charlie and Leopold approach.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (ad lib greetings)
dialog: Charlie! Where've you been? etc.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend,
dialog: Leo.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Waz up?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Waz up?
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: How are ya?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How are ya?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Leo's staying with us for a while.
text: Charlie pulls out a chair for Leopold but Leopold sits next
text: to Patrice instead. Patrice takes out her cigarettes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: Help yourself.
text: Leopold takes a cigarette, lights one for Patrice, then his
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Thank you, my dear.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (at a loss)
dialog: Um?...
dialog: (all look at Charlie)
dialog: ...I have nothing to say.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You did not tell the truth about
dialog: Patrice, Charles.
scene_heading: DENNIS AND BILL
dialog: CHARLES??
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What did I tell you, LEO?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: He informed me you were inconceivably
dialog: HOT, but I think you're lovely.
dialog: Exceptionally lovely.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: Thank you, Leo.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to the waitress)
dialog: Check please.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT
text: The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and
text: the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the
text: fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the
dialog: same bench.
text: Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at
text: Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just drop it Leopold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I
dialog: am not interested in her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hah!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: In any case the problem is not with
dialog: me but with you.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You have no idea what it takes to go
dialog: about courting a woman. From what
dialog: I've witnessed tonight, it is
dialog: symptomatic of your entire generation.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (almost speechless)
dialog: You are some piece of work, Leopold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Now I do not wish to get personal...
text: Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old
text: woman. She rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: But you have been of great assistance
dialog: to me and I feel this is one area
dialog: where I can be of some real help.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm fascinated. Go on.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Now, why was I successful with this
dialog: young lady and why did you so
dialog: miserably fail?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What makes you think she likes you?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Well she gave me the number of her
dialog: telephone and I assumed it meant...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: As I see it, the girl hasn't an
dialog: inkling of your intentions. And it's
dialog: no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry
dialog: Andrew.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: A Merry Andrew.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I am not!!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Everything plays like a farce to
dialog: you. The more wit, the less courage.
dialog: I believe the modern woman desires
dialog: passion, protection, sensitivity. No
text: woman wants to be romanced by a
dialog: buffoon.
dialog: (the old woman shakes
dialog: her head)
dialog: Banter and repartee are fine but you
dialog: must add to that a different sort of
dialog: playfulness.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You think I should pounce?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm saying you must treat her with
dialog: respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude
dialog: pass. A woman of Kate's stature would
dialog: never respond to an artificial tactic.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You said Kate.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate?
text: The old woman nods.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: We are discussing your problem.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not anymore. You like my sister.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Charles...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She has trouble with men, you know.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Perhaps she has not met the right
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She has met the right one. HUNDREDS
text: of times. But she pulls back. She
dialog: cuts herself off. You turn around
dialog: and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: One never can tell.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Does Kate know how you feel?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Have you made your intentions known
dialog: to her?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think
dialog: you're all talk and no action. What
dialog: are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I do not know if there is a future
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well Leopold, no one ever does...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes.
text: She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his
dialog: closet.
text: A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the
text: bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of
text: the bed and starts to read.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (reading out loud)
dialog: Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out --
text: slow soulful kissing... Woman as
dialog: equals??
text: She flips a page.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Who drove the Chevy to the levy and
dialog: why was it dry?
text: Kate smiles. She flips the page.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Eyes shine when she talks about...
text: science. Raises her voice when she
text: knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY,
dialog: BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when
text: I see her smile. Most beautiful when
dialog: she's angry. Honorable heart...
text: Peasant feet.
text: The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the
text: notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door;
text: glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries
text: from the room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as
text: Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close
text: together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ooops. Bread and butter.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Bread and butter. It's an old
dialog: saying... Well not to you I guess.
dialog: You say it when you pass someone in
text: a cramped space. As close as bread
dialog: and butter.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So. Did you have a good time last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It was very interesting.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Did you find that person of quality?
text: Leopold looks at her a moment.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes. I did.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well... fine.
dialog: (there is a pause)
dialog: I guess it's time to turn in.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Goodnight.
text: She reaches her door. Leopold stops her.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Kate?
text: She turns. Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of
text: inaction returns.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Goodnight.
text: (he slowly closes the
dialog: door)
scene_heading: INT. PATRICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He
text: looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over. Charlie
text: knocks. She opens the door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hi. I brought you some flowers.
text: He hands her the flower filled painting.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: Charlie!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering
dialog: if you would do me the great honor
dialog: of accompanying me to the cinema
dialog: tonight. And allowing me the privilege
dialog: of escorting you to dinner afterwards.
text: Patrice shyly studies the painting.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does
text: not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Gracing me with your conversation
dialog: and company would mean the world to
dialog: me.
text: There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: Um... 7:00?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: 7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.
text: They smile at each other for a long moment.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (silently mouthing)
dialog: Goodbye.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Goodbye.
dialog: (she closes the door)
dialog: It worked!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Of course it did.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea
dialog: what to do next!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Charles. Leave everything to me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not so fast, buddy. You're next.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time
text: and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and
text: doesn't know how to proceed.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Good morning. You're up early.
text: She moves to her computer on the other side of the room.
text: Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out
text: her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm terribly sorry!!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Happens all the time...
text: She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her
text: computer. There is a pause.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was
dialog: wondering...
text: She stops working and looks at Leopold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: What it is you're working on.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh. It's my computer.
text: She resumes her work.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see. Actually I meant the work
dialog: itself.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm researching the correlations
dialog: between your time and the present.
text: Leopold stares blankly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh.
text: Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I have never seen a woman work as
text: diligently and extensively before.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's made me the man I am today.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It's quite a beautiful day, have you
dialog: noticed? Perhaps you would permit
dialog: yourself some time off and grant me
dialog: the privilege of escorting you around
dialog: the city this fine Spring afternoon.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've
dialog: got too much work to do. Ask Charlie
dialog: though. He'll go with you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the
dialog: same. It is YOUR company I am seeking.
text: Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see. Some other time then.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes... Thank you.
text: Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment
text: then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair.
text: After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with
text: her foot and starts banging on the top of it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh for crying out loud. Would you
dialog: look at this? Leopold? The computer's
text: on the blink again.
dialog: (she bangs harder)
dialog: Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Maybe if you...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: NO, no, it does this all the time.
dialog: Just have to wait it out.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Darn.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: ...Perhaps it is a sign?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, you think?
dialog: (she smiles at Leopold)
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate
text: follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I... I must have gotten a funny
dialog: horse...
text: Leopold turns and rides around Kate.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Allow me.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: Bethesda fountain. Boats on Central Park Lake. Couples in
text: Sheeps Meadow.
text: Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps
text: Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse
text: through the greenery of Central Park.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - THE THALIA - DAY
text: A revival house. On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring
dialog: Ronald Coleman.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
text: Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M &amp; M's, and large
text: drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.
text: The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He
text: involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's
text: shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is that supposed to be my hair? Do
dialog: you see how they think my hair looks?
text: Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she
text: too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close
text: to him.
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY
text: Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza,
dialog: The Metropolitan Museum.
scene_heading: EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - DAY
text: Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - DAY
text: Modern art exhibit. Leopold stares blankly at an empty white
text: canvas. He turns to Kate questioningly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's simplicity in it's purest
text: form. It speaks volumes in it's
text: nothingness. Whiteness representing
text: emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak.
dialog: Bleak!
text: Leopold eyes the painting skeptically. They move to the next
dialog: object d'art. A toilet.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Aaand this represents...?
text: They burst into giddy laughter.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Absolutely nothing.
text: They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's
text: smile fades.
text: CLOSE UP: A painting of privileged Victorian society.
text: Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: I'd almost forgotten how beautiful
dialog: it was. Truly. Beautiful.
text: Kate smiles sadly at Leopold. They slowly walk out.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: We hear keys in the lock and laughter outside as Kate and
text: Leopold enter.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: M &amp; M's, CBS, FBI.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: VIP, VHS, VCR.
text: They collapse on the couch.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know. K.D. Lang.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I don't know how you keep up with
dialog: it. I'm exhausted.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So am I.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'll tell you what. Why don't I
dialog: prepare dinner tomorrow night? I
dialog: never have before. I mean even before
dialog: I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I
dialog: can't imagine what it'll taste like,
dialog: but I don't think it will be any
dialog: worse than your cooking.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A blind date.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh, I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, that just means I haven't met
dialog: him before. It was set up through
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A hazard of single life... I'm turning
dialog: in.
text: Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Another time then.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It's quite all right.
text: As she gets to the door, she stops.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold? I had a wonderful time today.
dialog: I can't remember the last time I
dialog: took the day off and just played.
dialog: I'd forgotten how beautiful this
dialog: city can be... I want to thank you
dialog: for that.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The pleasure was mine.
text: Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining
text: room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs
text: into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold.
dialog: Are you sure you can teach me
dialog: everything there is to know?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (from the bathroom)
dialog: Just don't swipe the silverware and
dialog: give yourself away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nobody's talking to you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It is very simple. I will be your
dialog: date. Just behave as you normally
dialog: would and I'll correct you along the
dialog: way. Now, escort me in.
text: Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat,
text: Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first.
text: Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom
text: in a tight BLACK dress.
text: Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie
text: sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now what?
text: Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head.
dialog: Hard.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: No name calling.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Well, really!
text: Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits,
text: Charlie pushes the chair in to hard.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You're not shoveling coal into a
text: furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in
dialog: gently. Gently. Try it again.
text: Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains
text: standing, not sure what to do next.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Well, sit down!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now don't burst a vein or anything,
dialog: but there are quite a few knives and
dialog: forks here. How do I know what each
dialog: one's for?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Merely start from the outside and
dialog: work your way in.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What kind of beer should I order?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Beer!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I WAS KIDDING!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How do I look?
text: Leopold and Charlie stand. Kate poses in the gown picked out
text: by Leopold. Leopold smiles brightly.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You look exquisite, Katherine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (almost sadly)
dialog: Thank you, Leopold.
text: She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say. Finally
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is a tie I'm wearing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You look very nice, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes. I know.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That must be him.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Your bland date?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Blind date.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't
dialog: use to many big words. You'll scare
text: the poor slob away.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (moving to the door)
dialog: This is always the scary part.
dialog: (she sings)
dialog: "Open the door to my, Mystery Date."
text: She opens the door and looks straight up. Leopold and Charlie
text: peer in closer to get a better look. In the doorway stands
text: LARRY, great looking, very tall, a winner.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hi. Kate?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Larry?
text: Kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, I'm off.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (giving Larry the
dialog: once over)
dialog: Kate, may I have a word with you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (as they cross the
dialog: room)
dialog: I DON'T like the look of him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Cad. I can spot one a mile away.
dialog: (he helps her with
dialog: her coat)
dialog: I shall escort you out myself. I
dialog: will act as your chaperone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That isn't necessary. I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It is no trouble.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Goodnight, Leopold.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Goodnight.
text: She is gone. Leopold stares after her, dejected.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
text: Kate and Larry are led to their table. Larry sits down. Kate
text: remains standing.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (she sits)
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So. How am I doing?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: How am I doing? First date. You
dialog: pleased? You disappointed?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Undecided.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I see.
text: He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling
text: Kate. She laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So. What did Jeannie say about me?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: About you? Ah, she said you were
dialog: tall.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: 6'3.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And nice looking.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thank her. And that you persevere
text: ardently on Wall Street.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, I work there...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: That must be very interesting.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You've obviously never worked on
dialog: Wall Street.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (laughing along for
dialog: the hell of it)
dialog: No.
text: Their laughter subsides. After a beat:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What else did Jeannie say about me?
scene_heading: INT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT
dialog: The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie
text: and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go
text: first just as Leopold has instructed.
text: The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a
text: look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the
text: table and takes his seat.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: Have I told you how much I liked
dialog: your painting?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Twice.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: If you get tired of hearing about
dialog: it, let me know. I have to admit I
dialog: was sort of surprised when you called.
dialog: I didn't think you liked me, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: When I first saw you, I thought...
dialog: (he makes his jaw
dialog: drop down to the
dialog: floor)
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: What do you think now?
text: Charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart. Then he
text: makes his jaw drop again. Patrice laughs happily.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
text: Kate and Larry are eating their dinner.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Aaand that's about all Jeannie said.
dialog: What did Jeannie say about me?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: She said you were enormously sexy,
dialog: had a great body, but you don't put
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Quite a compelling portrait.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: Would you say it's an accurate
dialog: portrait?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (leaning into Larry)
dialog: A masterpiece.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room
text: table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while
text: he pours a glass of wine.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
text: As they eat their dinner Larry drones on.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So this guy wants to invest $50,000
dialog: in a stock that's no good. Here's
dialog: what I do...
text: Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else.
text: She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the
text: proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices
text: her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins
text: to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
text: Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long
text: while. Finally she looks up at Larry.
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP OF LARRY
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm telling you the guy was a DICK!
dialog: A total ASSHOLE!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (jarred awake)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking
dialog: about. Hello?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (realizing her feelings
dialog: for Leopold, smiling
text: radiantly at Larry)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: Then as she leaves, a parting shot.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don't get up.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold?
text: The living room is dark and empty. She goes through the living
text: room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold?
text: His bedroom is empty. He is not there.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, Leopold...
text: She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.
text: Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of
text: Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress.
text: She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is
text: touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Bread and butter.
text: He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head,
text: inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You're back early. Did you enjoy
dialog: your date?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (happily)
dialog: No.
text: She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Here, you've got some...
text: He wipes his face making it much worse.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is it gone?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No.
text: She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each
text: other and become serious.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: A funny thing happened to me on my
dialog: bland date this evening, Leopold. I
dialog: really can't explain it. This puffed-
text: up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn
dialog: kept popping into my mind all night
text: long at the most inopportune times.
dialog: I couldn't get rid of him.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How inconsiderate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, it was. The harder I tried,
dialog: the more persistent he became. He's
text: conceited and inflated and unseasoned
dialog: and it doesn't seem to matter...
dialog: He's 134 years old but I can't get
text: him out of my head.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is he there right now?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Right here. Larger than life.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'll protect you...
text: They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Dr. Coles, would you grant me license
dialog: to dine with you tomorrow evening at
dialog: eight o'clock?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Permission granted.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Until tomorrow, then.
text: They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first.
text: They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the
text: kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He
text: carries a casserole dish.
text: A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing
text: an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (a little startled)
dialog: You look beautiful.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: YOU do. What have you got there?
text: Leopold opens the casserole dish.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hamburger Helper!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I know you like it.
text: Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL
text: MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair.
text: This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow
text: throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful
text: World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Tell me more.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Um, where was I? So after my father
dialog: died I had to go to work.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Have you had many jobs?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Many. I got fired from all of them.
dialog: I'm the most unskilled person I know.
dialog: But they were just survival jobs
dialog: while I was still in school. I always
dialog: knew I wanted to go into science
dialog: like my father. And I did.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Do you miss him?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think about him every day. He was
dialog: courtly, just like you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I think you are a remarkable woman
dialog: Katherine Coles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You just don't get out much. You'd
dialog: be surprised how remarkable I'm not.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No, it is you who would be surprised.
text: They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They
text: kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They
text: look at each other, deciding.
text: Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Kate...
text: Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads
text: him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two
text: figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the
text: figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: PATRICE
dialog: Morning.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is
text: set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from
text: the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see
text: each other for the first time.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Good morning.
text: They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look what you've done!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It's nothing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Nothing? My own mother never made me
dialog: a breakfast like this.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I will have to have a talk with her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Kate...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: About last night...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Please sit down.
text: He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Kate, I had never before been a
dialog: considerate man. I had, with
text: astonishing complacency, squandered
dialog: my life, waiting for some incentive
dialog: to force me into action. You have
dialog: made me see how rare our time here
dialog: really is. I am most beholden to you
dialog: Kate. And always will be.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: I sense the word "BUT" entering into
dialog: this any minute now.
text: Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively,
text: bracing for worst.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming
dialog: my wife.
text: Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Shall I take that as a "yes"?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I love you, Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's entirely beside the point...
dialog: You're moving way too fast here.
dialog: Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's
dialog: obvious the first one went well...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Where I come from that's pretty much
dialog: the way it works.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, even though last night we...
dialog: loved each other, that doesn't mean
dialog: this morning we're engaged. It just
dialog: doesn't work that way now.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (taking a ring off
dialog: his fingers and
dialog: placing it on hers)
dialog: I have loved you since I first set
dialog: eyes on you. I cannot imagine my
dialog: life without you beside me. I want
dialog: to marry you, Kate and make an honest
dialog: woman of you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh Leopold, sit down.
text: They switch places. Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Relationships these days are much
dialog: more complicated than that. Women
dialog: today have certain freedoms that men
dialog: have been taking advantage of for
dialog: centuries. You must have been aware
dialog: of that. If you think about it
dialog: clearly, it should be obvious to you
dialog: that marriage between us is out of
dialog: the question.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Do you not love me Kate?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (almost inaudible)
dialog: Don't ever think that...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Then consider my proposal.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'll think it over but I can tell
dialog: you now the answer is...
text: He kisses her. It's impressive.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Possibly.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (a knowing smile)
dialog: I need you beside me. I will not
dialog: give up easily.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Do what you have to do...
text: Charlie enters. Kate and Leopold become extremely
text: selfconscious.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Morning.
scene_heading: LEOPOLD AND KATE
dialog: (too casual and too
dialog: chipper)
dialog: Morning!
text: Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite
text: right. He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the
text: table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Coffee?
text: Kate nods. As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: I would like some coffee.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Of course. Say when.
text: She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: When.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry.
text: As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring. He
text: eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.
text: Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him,
text: looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a
dialog: beat:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Uh huh.
text: All smile privately and sip their coffee without another
dialog: word.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB - NIGHT
text: Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors
text: in earnest.
text: She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes
text: in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and
text: breaks.
speaker_heading: DR. KAY
dialog: (calling from her
dialog: office)
dialog: Kate, are you all right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Fine! I'm fine.
text: She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her
text: mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has
text: SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.
text: She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window
text: around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she
text: stares back at the paper on her desk.
text: She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of
text: Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her
text: mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.
text: Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper.
text: She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment,
text: she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles
dialog: away.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering.
text: Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at
text: Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles
text: sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She
text: snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY
text: Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock
dialog: Museum.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Leopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On
text: the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun
dialog: control.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Public office is apparently still
text: the last refuge for the incompetent.
dialog: Show me a man who does not want his
dialog: gun registered and I'll show you a
dialog: man who should not own a gun. What
dialog: is a pee-pee girl?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What are you reading?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The Village Voice. After much
dialog: consideration, I have decided it is
dialog: time I join the work force.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: As a pee-pee girl?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Perhaps not that, but I am determined
dialog: to acquire honest employment.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold, I don't know if that's such
dialog: a good idea.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Kate, my life back home was beneficial
dialog: to no one. I want my new life to
dialog: have value. I won't make the same
dialog: mistakes twice.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You have to be patient.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I could conceivably wait my whole
dialog: life away.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're awfully cute when you get
dialog: causey.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I will not waste any more time. I
dialog: must make a difference.
scene_heading: INT. BLOOMINGDALES - DAY
text: Customers fill the aisles. In the center of it all, Leopold
text: is hard at work. He holds a bottle of perfume.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Try our fragrance? Would you like to
dialog: try our new fragrance today?
speaker_heading: RICH CUSTOMER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It is called, POISON.
text: He squirts some at her.
speaker_heading: RICH CUSTOMER
dialog: Oh! I don't think so. Have you got
dialog: PASSION?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: RICH CUSTOMER
dialog: Elizabeth Taylor's Passion?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Next aisle over.
text: She leaves. Leopold looks after her.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Give your mother-in-law what she
dialog: really deserves this season. Give
text: her some POISON.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S LABORATORY OFFICE - MORNING
text: The doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (the doctors remain
dialog: silent)
dialog: What's the matter?
text: There is a long pause. Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are
text: on to her. She puts down her pen.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So you know.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: We had to go through your computer
dialog: to access information. Your
dialog: calculations have been verified and
text: the final course has been set. Leopold
dialog: goes back a week from Friday 1:17
dialog: a.m.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: How long were you going to keep it a
dialog: secret, Kate?
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Were you even going to tell us at
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Not sure? What can you be thinking?
dialog: You can't alter the course of history
dialog: and assume everything will be okay.
dialog: It won't be. He has his own destiny
dialog: to fulfill in his own time.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You don't understand.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: He's going back, Kate.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
text: It's over.
text: Kate nods. The doctors slowly leave the room and close the
text: door. Just the sound of the clock ticking.
text: Kate sits at her desk very still.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No... No, no, no.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Charlie knocks and enters.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There you are. I've only been
text: hollering for the last...
text: He sees her face. Kate's eyes are red and swollen. She lays
text: out Leopold's belongings.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate? What is it? What happened?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (very detached)
text: It's time. Leopold's going back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yup. I'll get his things together.
dialog: Tell him tonight.
text: He goes to her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don't look so fine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well I am. It was wonderful having
dialog: him here, Charlie. He was of
dialog: invaluable assistance to the project.
dialog: (she shrugs)
dialog: I'll miss him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You'll miss him?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!
text: Kate remains silent.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Kate, don't do this. Please. It's
dialog: not right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What am I supposed to DO, Charlie??
dialog: I can't go back. He can't stay. I
dialog: can't let him go. I'm not equipped
dialog: to deal with this, Charlie. I don't
dialog: know how.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be
dialog: the ice princess.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (beginning to tear up)
dialog: I'm not!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You are. You can't live your whole
dialog: life under a microscope. You've got
dialog: to tell him how you feel.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (breaking down in his
dialog: arms)
dialog: It's too much, Charlie. It's just
dialog: too much.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You owe it to him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I didn't know I could feel like this.
dialog: I really didn't know.
scene_heading: INT. FANCY FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: So I looked him right in the eye and
dialog: said, 'Ego is nature's compensation
dialog: for mediocrity.' I turned and I
dialog: walked. He never said a word... He
dialog: probably didn't understand it...
dialog: Kate?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (cold)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Are you all right? You're awfully
dialog: quiet.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: How was your day?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (taking a long pause)
dialog: It's time.
text: Leopold looks at her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We're sending you back.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: (slowly pushing his
dialog: plate away)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: A week from Friday, early morning.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out
dialog: of our hands. We can't POCKET people
dialog: from history like stolen jewels. We
dialog: haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll
dialog: miss you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do you want me to do, fall apart?
dialog: You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't
dialog: solve anything.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Who is this woman sitting across
dialog: from me?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do you want me to say, Leopold?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Tell me that you love me as I love
dialog: you. Let me hear you say it.

dialog: table.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I will not do this. I'm sorry.
text: We starts out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm.
text: His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he
text: winds up walking along Central Park South.
text: Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly.
text: He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's
dialog: head.
text: He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the
text: skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays
text: his face against the horse's head, torn.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: Kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee
text: boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her
text: way through the cookie dough. Leopold enters through the
text: front door, DISHEVELED.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Good God. Look at you. You look awful.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You should see what I'm looking at.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I went back to the restaurant. They
dialog: told me you went out looking for me
dialog: right after I left.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That was pound cakes ago. Where were
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I had a lot to think over.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Just where I stand around here.
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: We should have come up with something
dialog: together. I might have been spared
dialog: ten or seventy pounds.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Is that an apology?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm sorry for what I said.
text: Leopold goes to her. He gently prys cookie dough from her
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes you are...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'm not going. I'm staying here with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But? You can't! We have no right
dialog: to...
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: It is my destiny. It is my decision.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Have you thought about what you'd be
dialog: sacrificing? Your influence? Your
dialog: authority?
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Your family, your whole way of life,
dialog: everything?
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're not just feeling sorry for me
dialog: because I ate the contents of the
dialog: refrigerator, are you?
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I love you, Kate. The single most
dialog: miraculous event in my life was not
dialog: how I arrived here, but that when I
dialog: did, I found you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (overwhelmed)
dialog: Here comes the mushy part!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: After much consideration I've come
dialog: to the conclusion I no longer desire
text: a large estate with a full staff and
text: ornate grounds.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's good, because if you're staying
dialog: I'll probably get fired again. What
dialog: do you desire?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: A beautiful wife, a small home in
text: the middle of nowhere, lots of
dialog: children, and fine schools with PMS
dialog: meetings every other Sunday.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...PTA?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: PTA.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I love you too. I do, Leopold. I
dialog: love you, too.
text: They kiss.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Leopold and Kate sit calm and resolute. The doctors are in
text: an uproar.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: This is outrageous! I won't allow
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The decision is not yours to make.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: Do you realize what you're saying?
dialog: You're tampering with fate,
dialog: preordinance, and God himself.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: We do that every day, doctor. It is
dialog: called CHOICE.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Dr. Carlson is still over there. You
dialog: can't simply abandon her. We have to
dialog: get her back.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Do you think I'm not aware of that?
dialog: Do you think a minute goes by that I
dialog: don't feel responsible for her? But
text: SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Only one person can return. The
text: capsule accommodates only one person.
text: Leopold has to find her.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: Perhaps she does not wish to return.
dialog: Perhaps she's found greater happiness
dialog: in her new life. It happened to me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe
dialog: she's of more important use back
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Julia Carlson died in the Center
dialog: Factory fire of 1897, two years after
text: she arrived. She was 37 years old.
text: There is a stunned silence.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: Dear lord.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: She was a friend, Kate. She was never
dialog: expected to sacrifice her life for
dialog: this experiment. I won't be a party
dialog: to it. I know what I'm asking...
dialog: There's no way we can force you to
dialog: go. Just think it over.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - 2:30 A.M.
text: A clock is ticking loudly. Kate and Leopold lie back to back.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're going back aren't you?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
text: I keep seeing that poor woman's face.
text: She was terrified.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You said you wouldn't leave me...
dialog: I've never been lucky. Not one time.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Six months ago I wouldn't have given
dialog: it another thought. I wouldn't have
dialog: lost a moment's sleep. You've changed
dialog: me, Kate. There is no turning back.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's
dialog: what's tearing me up inside. Either
dialog: way I lose... You've changed me too.
dialog: I can't go back to my old life
dialog: anymore. I can't live like that again.
text: God my heart is pounding like a drum.
dialog: I've never been so scared in my life.
dialog: Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take
dialog: me with you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You don't realize what you're saying!
dialog: You don't understand the kind of
dialog: life you'd lead. What you'd be giving
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'd be with you.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I can't ask that of you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Just ask me... Just ask.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Come back with me.
text: She slowly turns. She embraces him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes!
scene_heading: EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - NIGHT
text: Dressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through
text: the street. She is clumsier than usual.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Where are you taking me?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: This is something I've wanted to do
dialog: for a long time.
text: She takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign:
speaker_heading: ROSELAND.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leopold?
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: This will be very therapeutic.
text: He takes her arm and escorts her in.
scene_heading: INT. ROSELAND - NIGHT
text: Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and
text: Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls
dialog: her close.
text: This time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they
text: shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more
text: than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold
text: holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - EARLY MORNING
text: Large screen computers are working overtime. Kate, Leopold,
text: and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule. It is nearly
dialog: time.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: The time tables have been set. Just
dialog: strap yourself in and you'll be fine.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: You have only a twenty four hour
text: leeway before the machine is set to
dialog: return to us. You must find Carlson
dialog: within that time frame and get her
dialog: on board or there will be little
text: chance of her finding a way back.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I understand.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: It's been a real pleasure. You have
dialog: a much nicer smile than Ronald
dialog: Coleman.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: The privilege was mine.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Goodbye Leopold, and thank you.
dialog: (she gives him a kiss)
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Oh, my.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you...
dialog: as soon as possible. I'll see to it
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: See that you do.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: You have my word on it.
text: The doctors leave.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
text: Four minutes and counting.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye.
text: He sticks out his hand.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Goodbye.
dialog: (impulsively Leopold
dialog: embraces Charlie)
dialog: I shall miss you Charles, more than
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're
dialog: the only one who knows how to program
dialog: the VCR... Take care of my sister.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: You better. Take care of yourself
dialog: too while you're at it... So long.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't have any words for this.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I will see you soon.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: You'll be with me all the time.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know. I brought you something.
text: She takes out a ring and slips it on his finger.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So you wouldn't forget me.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Kate...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So you wouldn't think this was all a
dialog: dream.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don't forget about me.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I love you, Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wait for me.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: For as long as it takes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I will come back to you! I will!
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: I'll be waiting.
text: They kiss again for the last time.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: It's time Leopold.
text: Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they
dialog: part.
text: Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself
text: in. He places one hand on the red lever and the other against
text: the glass pane on the door. Kate comes over and places her
text: hand over his. Wordlessly, they say goodbye.
text: After a moment, Dr. Kau gently moves Kate away. Dr. Plodder
text: silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: 9 8 7 6 5 4...
text: Leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving Kate's,
text: his hand still against the glass.
text: Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: 3 2 1!
text: Dr. Plodder drops his arm signaling Leopold. Leopold pulls
text: the lever, still gazing at Kate. There is a blinding FLASH
text: of light, then darkness.
scene_heading: INT. LAB - MONTHS LATER
text: Kate raises her head. She sits at her desk surrounded by the
dialog: doctors.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: I cannot in good conscience let you
dialog: go. It's out of the question.
scene_heading: DR. DRAKE
dialog: I can't be a part of it either Kate.
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: DR. KAU
dialog: It's too big a risk.
text: Kate rises and moves to the window. She is a full NINE MONTHS
scene_heading: PREGNANT.
speaker_heading: DR. PLODDER
dialog: We cannot guarantee your child's
dialog: safety. It's that simple.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: He's waiting for me. I can feel it.
dialog: Oh, Leopold...
text: She gazes out the window, searching the horizon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A SMALL FARM HOUSE - EVENING
text: Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old,
text: rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as
text: puppets he carries on a conversation. JULIA CARLSON pulls up
text: in her car.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (yelling inside)
dialog: MOM??
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: You're Leo aren't you? You don't
dialog: remember me but I knew you when you
dialog: were yea big.
text: (she holds her hands
dialog: an inch apart)
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your
dialog: mothers.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: We had spaghetti at our house 4 times
dialog: this week.
text: Kate comes out on the porch. She looks lovely.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leo you don't have to holler like
dialog: that. I'm not deaf...
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: Kate?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ...Carlson?!
text: The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Carlson, I don't believe it. It's
dialog: been... I don't know how many years.
dialog: What are you doing here.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: I came to see you, sweetie.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You remember my son, Leo?
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: We've just been getting acquainted.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, come inside. Come inside.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living
text: room before joining her.
text: Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is
text: furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (covering her agitation)
dialog: Would you like some tea? I wish you
dialog: had called before you come over. It
dialog: would have given me a chance to
dialog: straighten up the house... myself...
dialog: my life. Tell me what you've been up
dialog: to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard
dialog: you received some big endowment or
dialog: something. I was going to write,
dialog: then call, but...
text: She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently
text: she has to put it down.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: It's all right, Kate. I understand.
text: There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a
dialog: lot of time to get your affairs in
dialog: order... And I warn you, it's nearly
dialog: impossible for an intelligent woman
dialog: back there.
text: Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would
dialog: be proud. We're aware of your
dialog: situation but we felt when the time
dialog: came, you deserved the option.
text: Kate nods, trembling slightly.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Who was that lady?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Just an old friend.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: What she want?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (she looks at Leo)
dialog: Nothing important. You brush your
dialog: teeth?
text: Leo shows off his teeth.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Then give your old mom a hug and go
dialog: to bed.
text: (Leo gives her a hug
dialog: and a kiss)
dialog: Good night, cookie.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Good night.
text: Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the
text: house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear
text: are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.
text: She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits
text: down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in
dialog: thought.
text: She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls
text: out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE PHOTO ALBUM
text: Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings,
text: magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.
text: A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he
text: departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for
text: a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It
text: is the same ring Kate gave him.
text: A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to
dialog: establish a scientific center researching studies in time
dialog: and space.
text: A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure,
dialog: marching to give women the vote.
text: A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY,
text: stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing
text: to his ring.
text: A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing
text: a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded
text: by academia and subtly points to his ring.
text: A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with
text: Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.
text: A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting
text: regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one
text: hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against
text: his chest, showing off the ring.
text: An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in
dialog: bombings.
text: A tear falls on the page.
text: Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera
text: follows her gaze past her property...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER
text: LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time
text: as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate,
text: older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.
text: Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children,
text: approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's so YOUNG, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He's old enough.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look at that idiotic expression on
text: his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: He's happy.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Of course he's happy. All weddings
dialog: are happy. It's the living together
dialog: afterwards that causes all the
dialog: trouble.
text: Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet
text: hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.
text: Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room,
text: over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the
text: guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds,
text: Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.
text: Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's.
text: Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not
text: wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, you're so young... I love you,
dialog: Leo. Always remember that...
text: From behind, her shoulders shake as she cries.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Mom, we're only moving to Denver.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know, cookie. I know.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT
text: From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console.
text: A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the
text: darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps
text: herself in and smiles tearfully. Their voices echo in the
dialog: lab.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know. Me too.
text: They embrace each other for the last time.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What will I do without you, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Live happily ever after.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: (pushing the intercom
dialog: button)
dialog: Kate, it's time.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: (emotionally)
dialog: Here. It's a letter for my father.
dialog: Tell him about me and... um, tell
dialog: him I love him. I want him to know
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leo...
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Mom, I want you to go.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But...
text: He puts his finger to her lips. He looks to his wife then
text: back at Kate. He nods his head.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Go.
text: They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: Ready!
text: Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft,
text: the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson
text: raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: 9, 8, 7...
text: Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye.
text: She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away,
text: staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.
speaker_heading: CARLSON
dialog: 3, 2, 1!
text: There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone. The others stand
text: there motionless, stunned.
text: The screen is BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT
text: A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate.
text: A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn,
text: stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The
text: creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed,
text: rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses
text: a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance
dialog: floor.
text: In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very
text: distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young
text: woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.
speaker_heading: FLIRT
dialog: (brushing his shirt
dialog: front)
dialog: I just love a starched white shirt.
dialog: It's so elegant.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: FLIRT
dialog: Skeeky.
speaker_heading: LEOPOLD
dialog: Yes. You dance like an angel Miss
dialog: Beall. You light up the room around
dialog: you. I thank you.
speaker_heading: FLIRT
dialog: (with a big smile)
dialog: Thank YOU.
text: The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a
text: sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the
text: staircase.
text: The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every
text: turn as Kate searches each male face.
text: In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up
text: the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up
text: the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff,
text: flouncing down the stairs.
text: Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks
dialog: for Leopold.
text: Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs.
text: He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns
text: around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.
text: The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.
text: Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then
text: STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold
text: stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at
text: her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her
text: his hand.
text: The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their
text: eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT
text: AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her
text: shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone.
text: They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment
dialog: of youth, when they fell in love.
text: Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He
text: rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands
text: are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he
text: wraps his arms tightly around her.
text: MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes
text: a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count
text: silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.
dialog: THEY DANCE...
text: An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.
scene_heading: LORD WHITEHEAD
dialog: Who is that dancing with Leopold?
scene_heading: LADY WHITEHEAD
dialog: I've never seen her before.
text: Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze
text: into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.
text: At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The
text: rest of the world dances around them.
text: Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO
scene_heading: SCREEN.
text: The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate
text: and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly
text: point to their rings.
text: Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for
dialog: studies in physics.
text: The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to
text: include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.
text: The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It
text: shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching
text: chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly
text: into the camera, they show off their rings.
text: SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...
text: Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost
text: in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...
