speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHES, KENT - DUSK
text: A BOY runs across the dark, flat wilderness of the North
text: Kent marshes. A bitterly cold December evening, the misty
text: light is fading and the boy races as if trying to outrun
dialog: the darkness.
text: This is PHILLIP PIRRIP - ‘PIP’. He is eight years-old.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH, MARSHES - DUSK
text: A small, squat church sinks on the boggy ground. A yew
text: tree - PIP snaps off a twig and adds it to the forlorn
text: bunch of wintery sticks he carries.
text: A modest tombstone bears the inscription;
dialog: Here lies PHILLIP PIRRIP late of this Parish. Also
text: GEORGIANA, wife of the above. Also ALEXANDER, BARTHOLOMEW,
scene_heading: TOBIAS, ABRAHAM, ROGER.
text: Five tiny lozenge-shaped graves mark the childrens’ final
dialog: resting place.
text: PIP lays his modest tribute and sets about brushing away
text: the weeds and dead-leaves that clutter the grave -
text: - as an IMMENSE FIGURE looms behind him and snatches him
text: up. PIP goes to cry out, but a filthy hand is clamped
text: across his mouth as he is hoisted, weeping and struggling,
text: into the air.
speaker_heading: THE CONVICT
dialog: Hold your noise! Hold your noise, you
dialog: little devil, or I'll cut your throat!
text: The convict is a formidable figure, immense and
text: terrifying, his head and face brutally shaven and scarred.
dialog: His name is MAGWITCH, though we won’t hear this spoken
text: aloud for some time.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Tell us your, name! Quick!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Pip!
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Once more! Give it mouth!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Pip! Pip, sir!
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 2.
text: Then PIP is flipped upside down, held by his ankles,
dialog: shaken.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Got wittles on you, boy? Tell me!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No, sir!
text: - then upright again, he’s seated on a tombstone, his
text: tiny face held in massive, manacled hands.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: What fat cheeks you ha’got. Darn me if I
dialog: couldn’t eat em. Where’s your mother?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: There, sir!
speaker_heading: (MAGWITCH flinches -)
dialog: ‘Also Georgiana’, with my father. ‘late
dialog: of this parish’. My brothers too.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: An orphan, eh? Who d’you live with?
dialog: That's supposin’ I let you live.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: My sister, sir - Mrs Joe Gargery, wife of
dialog: Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, sir...
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Blacksmith, eh?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You know what a file is?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: And you know what wittles is?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Yes, sir, food, sir.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: (breath hot on PIP’s face)
dialog: Now I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.
dialog: There’s a young man hid with me in
dialog: comparison with which I am an angel, has
text: a secret way of getting at a boy, and at
text: his heart, and at his liver, so that they
text: may be roasted and ate. It is in vain for
text: a boy to hide from that young man. A boy
dialog: may lock his door, may tuck himself up,
dialog: may draw the clothes over his head, and
dialog: that young man will softly creep and
text: creep his way to him and tear him open...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 3.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers in the ear of the
dialog: terrified boy)
dialog: You bring me tomorrow morning early, at
dialog: yonder battery, that file and them
dialog: wittles - never daring to say a word -
dialog: and I will do what I can to keep that
dialog: young man out of your insides.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: (PIP nods)
dialog: Speak it out!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Yes, sir!
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Now. Get you home.
text: PIP turns, tumbles away, pausing just long enough to turn
text: and see the convict disappear into the misty graveyard.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHES, KENT - DUSK
text: PIP runs towards home as fast as he can. His stride slows.
text: A gibbet hangs over the road, empty but still sinister in
text: the gathering gloom.
text: PIP steps warily beneath, then starts to run once again.
scene_heading: EXT. GARGERY HOUSE, MARSHES - NIGHT
text: PIP’s home adjoins the forge. Made of wood, the house is
text: modest but comfortable enough, and a safe refuge now.
text: PIP barrels towards the door, and straight into -
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, GARGERY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: JOE GARGERY, the blacksmith - a rich Kentish accent.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There you are! Your sister’s been out a
dialog: dozen times looking for you, old chap.
text: And on cue, a ferocious cry comes from outside.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: PIP! PIIIIIIP!
text: With practiced efficiency, JOE takes a towel, wads it up,
text: uses it to pad the back of PIP’s trousers.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 4.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She’s on the rampage, Pip, and she’s got
dialog: Tickler with her. Best get behind the
dialog: door, old chap. I’1l do my best...
text: A closer look at JOE - fair, curly hair, pale eyes, he’s a
text: large, powerfully-built man, devoid of aggression,
text: incapable of malice. Good-natured; child-like almost.
text: And then MRS JOE is in the room. Ferocious, black-hair,
text: red-faced with fury.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Where have you been, you little monkey!
dialog: Wearing me out with fret and worry! I
dialog: said where have you been!
text: She charges at PIP, wielding her cane, ‘Tickler’. JOE does
text: his best to shield PIP behind his large leg, but MRS JOE
text: simply beats him too.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: The churchyard! As it was Christmas -
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: The churchyard! If it weren’t for me
dialog: you’d’ve been to the churchyard years
dialog: ago, and stayed there! Who brought you up
dialog: by hand?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You did!
speaker_heading: MRS JOE!
dialog: And why did I do it, I should like to
dialog: know!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Gargery - fetch the tar water!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No need for tar water
dialog: (she turns on JOE)
dialog: It is Christmas, my love.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: (a moment then -)
dialog: Bad enough having to be a blacksmith’s
dialog: wife, without having to mother you too.
dialog: Ha! Churchyard!
dialog: (sawing at a loaf of bread)
dialog: You’1l drive me to the churchyard between
dialog: you one of these days, and a precious
dialog: pair you’d be without me! But you’d like
dialog: that I suppose, the both of you...
speaker_heading: 6A
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 5.
text: And as her monologue continues, PIP slides out from his
text: hiding place and exchanges looks with his ally JOE.
dialog: A mute conversation; ‘you alright, old chap?’, ‘thank you,
text: Joe’. JOE ruffles his hair; an understanding. But MRS JOE
text: is watching.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE.
dialog: Table! Now!
text: They take their places at the table. PIP eyes the bread.
text: The sound of a cannon in the distance distracts JOE, and
text: PIP snatches the bread, stows it beneath the table.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hear that?
dialog: (another distant explosion)
text: There’s a conwict escaped off the Hulks.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: What might he have done, this convict?
text: And MRS JOE is on him again.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Murder most likely. That’s why they’re
dialog: put in the Hulks, because they murder-
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Murder?
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: - murder and rob and ask too many
dialog: questions!
dialog: (points the knife)
dialog: Where’s that bread gone?
text: It’s in his hand, beneath the table -
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I ate it.
text: A moment. MRS JOE glares but PIP holds his nerve and she
text: turns. JOE regards PIP questioningly. PIP shrugs, and
text: squeezes the bread into his pocket.
scene_heading: INT. PIP’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 6
text: Hungry, terrified, PIP hides beneath the covers, thinking
text: on murder. Every object in the small, meek attic room
text: seems menacing, every creak seems to speak ‘murder’.PIP
text: pulls the covers higher, squeezes his eyes shut.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHES, KENT - DAWN 6A
text: The sun rising on the new day.
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 6.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING, GARGERY HOUSE - DAWN 7
text: Every floorboard creaks as PIP tip-toes past JOE and MRS
text: JOE's bedroom. A glimpse through the door - his sister
text: snoring.
scene_heading: INT. LARDER, GARGERY HOUSE - DAWN 8
text: PIP lifts the lid from a stoneware pot and removes a
text: magnificent meat-pie.
text: Brandy is poured from bottle to flask, the flask corked,
text: the bottle now half-full. PIP thinks a moment, tops the
text: bottle up with a filthy viscous liquid - tar water. He
text: shakes the bottle in the hope of hiding the deception.
text: PIP turns and jumps; a dead hare hangs from the ceiling,
text: its glassy eyes glaring accusingly at the young thief.
speaker_heading: OMITTED 9
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY, MARSHES - DAY 10
text: Christmas Day is damp and misty as PIP hurries guiltily
text: towards the old fort that is their rendezvous. A seated
text: figure is visible through the mist -
text: THE CONVICT is slumped, cold and miserable, on a stone,
text: inspecting the wounds caused by his manacles. PIP
text: approaches, gathers his nerves, and touches the man on his
dialog: shoulder.
text: The figure turns -
text: But it’s a different CONVICT; gaunt, sinister, with cruel,
text: brooding eyes and a livid bruise on his face.
text: He swipes at PIP with his chained hands, and PIP turns and
text: flees, the hunched figure hobbling after him, growling.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY, MARSHES - DAY 11
text: Breathless, PIP stumbles on, relieved to see that the
text: cannibalistic young man has gone, for the moment at least.
dialog: But suddenly -
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Well, did you bring it boy?
text: MAGWITCH scoops PIP up into the air.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: (handing over the bag)
dialog: Yes, sir. Here, sir.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 7.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: And what’s in the bottle?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Brandy.
text: Back on the ground, PIP watches MAGWITCH drain the bottle
text: of brandy, then set about the pie, scooping great handfuls
text: into his mouth, glaring about him like a starving dog
text: protecting his food.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: You brought no-one with you?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No, sir!
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: And asked no-one to follow?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I would not do that, sir.
text: MAGWITCH’s eyes burn into PIP. Finally -
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: I believe you. A cold-hearted hound you’d
dialog: be, at your time of life, to hunt down a
text: wretch as near to death and dunghill as
dialog: me.
text: PIP, despite himself, is encouraged by the approval.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I’m glad you enjoy the pie.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Thankee, my boy, I do.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: There’1l be none left for him!
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: For ‘him’? Who’s ‘him’?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: The young man you spoke of. Who wants to
dialog: eat my liver.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Oh, him?
dialog: (Laughs-)
dialog: He won’t want no pie.
speaker_heading: PIP
text: He looked as if he did.
dialog: 12
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 8.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Looked? What d’you mean, looked?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I saw him.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Just now.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: PIP
text: Down by the river.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Dressed like me? Bruised face? Here?
dialog: Badly bruised?
speaker_heading: (PIP nods)
dialog: Give me the file, boy!
text: Immediately MAGWITCH is sawing wildly at his chains,
text: oblivious to the raw red wounds about his ankles,
text: muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH (CONT’D) PIP
dialog: Hunt him down like a Goodbye, then sir. A merry
dialog: bloodhound I will. Let him Christmas to you!
dialog: go free? Let him make a Goodbye...
dialog: tool of me again and again?
dialog: That villain? No, I’1l take
text: him to the bottom of the
dialog: river if I have to drag him
dialog: there myself...
text: And getting no response, PIP shrinks away into the mist.
text: A Christmas carol, sung with great volume and little tune -
scene_heading: INT. PARLOUR, GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 12
text: A squeeze-box wheezes away. The carol is performed by MR
text: PUMBLECHOOK and the GARGERY’s other Christmas guests; MR
text: and MRS WOPSLE and MR and MRS HUBBLE. These clerks and
dialog: tradesmen are what pass as gentle-folk in the narrow
text: confines of the village, and MRS JOE is appropriately
text: puffed-up.
text: PIP does his best to slip in un-noticed, but MRS JOE sees
text: him, and discreetly draws her finger across her neck.
speaker_heading: 12A
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 9.
scene_heading: INT. PARLOUR, GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 12A
text: Later. The Christmas dinner is laid. PUMBLECHOOK dominates
text: the festivities, a large man with dull eyes and a mouth
text: like a fish.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: For the great feast that we are about to
dialog: receive - thanks to you ma‘am - may the
dialog: good lord make us truly thankful.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Amen.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Did you hear that? Be grateful!
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: - especially, my boy, to those as what
dialog: brought you up by hand.
speaker_heading: MRS HUBBLE
dialog: Why is it that the young are never
dialog: grateful?
text: A moment’s contemplation of this devastating gambit.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: Naturally wicious!
text: Mumbles of ‘true, true’! PIP is in hell, but JOE is there.
text: JUMP CUT - Meal underway, PIP picking at fat and gristle.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: More gravy, old chap?
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Oh, I nearly forgot! Ladies and
dialog: gentleman, do leave a little room for the
dialog: savoury pork pie so kindly provided for
dialog: by dear Mr Pumblechook.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: No more than you deserve, ma’am.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: I’ll get it now. Shall I get it now? I’11l
dialog: get it now.
text: Murmurs of approval. She heads off to the larder to search
text: for the treasured pie, now long gone. PIP shrinks further
text: in his seat.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You look awful white, old chap. Have some
dialog: gravy —

dialog: 14
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 10.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK MRS JOE (0.S.)
dialog: I often say, a slice of It’s here somewhere!
dialog: savoury pork pie will lie
dialog: on top of anything you care
dialog: to mention and do no harm.
speaker_heading: MRS HUBBLE
dialog: Wise words, as always.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: Especially with a little brandy....
speaker_heading: MRS JOE returns —
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: At least it was here. It’s gone!
text: And now PUMBLECHOOK explodes into coughing and retching.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: TAR WATER! In the brandy!
text: It’s all too much. He bolts to the door, dodging MRS JOE -
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Come here, you little monkey!
dialog: And straight into the arms of -
text: A SERGEANT. A crowd of SOLDIERS stand behind him, rifles
text: at the ready. In the SERGEANT’s hand, MAGWITCH’s manacles -—
scene_heading: OMITTED AND INCORPORATED INTO 12 13
scene_heading: INT. FORGE, GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 14
text: JOE’s hammer bangs down onto glowing iron. Sparks fly. The
text: party guests and the SOLDIERS are clustered round the
text: forge as the chain of the manacles is repaired
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
text: A nasty pair. Two of the most vicious
dialog: characters you’d care to meet. Anybody
dialog: here seen anything of any such game?
dialog: (with a great hiss, the
text: mManacles are plunged into
dialog: the water)
dialog: Thank you, sir. A fine job.
dialog: (examines JOE’s handiwork,
dialog: tests their strength.)
dialog: We found them filed clean through. No

speaker_heading: OMITTED 15
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHES, KENT - DUSK 16
text: As night creeps in, so does the fog. The SOLDIERS advance
text: in loose formation, a long line almost lost to each other
text: in the mist. PIP and JOE pass beneath the old gibbet, PIP
text: regarding it with dread. A whisper -—
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I hope we don’t find ‘em, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I hope so too, old chap.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHES, KENT - DUSK 16A

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Murder! Help! Help me! Murder!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (0.S.)
dialog: Over here! They’re over here. Get some
text: light.
text: Torches are lit ablaze now, their sulphurous flames
text: glowing in the fog as the soldiers, JOE and PIP head to -
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER, MARSHES - DUSK 17
text: A ferocious fight is taking place, with MAGWITCH looming
text: huge and victorious over his slighter opponent.
text: The second CONVICT’s face is a mess of mud and blood, with
text: a vicious gash down one side of his face, the fight so
text: brutal that the SOLDIERS can only stand and watch, too
text: frightened to intervene, spectators in a flame-lit arena.
text: The SERGEANT pushes through -—
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 12.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Well what are you waiting for? Move!
text: The SOLDIERS pull them apart, the two CONVICTS swearing
text: and clawing at each other throughout.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: I took him! Take note, I took him and
dialog: gave him up to you!
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Handcuffs!
text: The CONVICTS are manacled. PIP hides behind JOE’s leg.
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: He tried to murder me!
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Try, and not do it? I'd have killed him
dialog: if I wanted, but instead I dragged him
dialog: here. I took him! Let him go free? Let
dialog: him profit from me, again and again?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Enough of this! Light the torches!
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: He tried to murder me! I should have been
dialog: a dead man, if you hadn’t got here.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: He lies! He’s a liar born and he’ll die a
text: liar. Look at his face, his grovelling
dialog: eyes. Look me in the eyes, villain. LOOK
dialog: AT ME!
text: MAGWITCH makes another murderous lunge at his enemy, but
text: is pulled back and down by four of the SOLDIERS.
text: And it’s only then, forced to the floor like a wild
text: animal, that MAGWITCH meets PIP’s eye, sees the fear and
text: alarm on the young boy’s face. For a moment, MAGWITCH
text: snarls, moves towards the boy -
text: But PIP puts his hand to his own chest, and shakes his
dialog: head. ‘It wasn’t me’ —
text: A moment, then all the fight goes out of MAGWITCH.
text: Something almost like shame comes to his face. And he

scene_heading: EXT. HUT, MARSHES - NIGHT 19
text: The prison ships; menacing hulks, lifeless, ghost ships
text: almost, lit by sulphurous torch-light.
text: Two rowing boats await to take the convicts back to this

text: MAGWITCH is about to be led away too, but he turns a
text: moment and, without looking at PIP, speaks to the
scene_heading: SERGEANT.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: I wish to say something. A man can’t
dialog: starve. I took - stole - some wittles up
dialog: at the village. A file too, and I'll tell
dialog: you from where. The blacksmith’s.
dialog: (Surprise from JOE, nothing
speaker_heading: from PIP)
text: Brandy and a pie.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Have you missed such an article as a pie,

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: My wife did.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: So you're the blacksmith, are you?
text: MAGWITCH steps towards JOE and PIP, causing the soldiers

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Then I’m sorry to say I’ve eat your pie.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: God knows you’re welcome to it. We don’t

text: The ghost of a smile, as he places the large manacled hand

text: Then MAGWITCH is hauled away.
text: Seated in the bow of the boat, manacled, hunched and

text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY, MARSHES - DAY 20

dialog: WHAT! WHAT! WHAT DID YOU SAY!

scene_heading: EXT. SATIS HOUSE - DAY 24
text: PIP sits in PUMBLECHOOK’s cart, scrubbed and trussed up in
text: his stiffest clothes, his suit too short.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: Eight times twelve?
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 17.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Ninety-six.
text: Through twisted, overgrown parkland PIP sees the grim,
text: dismal hulk of Satis House.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: Four times seventeen? Too slow! Sixty-
dialog: eight. Nine times thirteen -
text: PUMBLECHOOK keeps up his stream of questions as they step
text: down from the cart and approach the gates, chained shut.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: One hundred and seventeen -
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: - minus thirty-two? Are you listening,
dialog: boy? Boy?
text: The garden of this once fine house is overgrown, the
text: windows are either bricked up or barred, and from the
text: outside it seems barely credible that the place could be
dialog: inhabited. And yet...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What name?
text: A silhouette, calls from a window in a clear voice.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: Pumblechook!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Quite right.
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: Now, boy, remember your station and let
dialog: your conduct be a credit unto those which
dialog: brought you up by hand.
text: And now a strikingly pretty young girl approaches,
text: scarcely older than PIP but proud, self-assured, fearless -
scene_heading: - YOUNG ESTELLA.
text: She regards PIP with a judgemental eye, then produces a
text: large bunch of keys and opens the gate.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Do you wish to see Miss Havisham?
speaker_heading: PUMBLECHOOK
dialog: If Miss Havisham wishes to see me!

speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: She don’t.

scene_heading: PUMBLECHOOK. To PIP -)
dialog: Come along.
text: And with a glance back at the indignant, excluded
text: PUMBLECHOOK, PIP follows her into the house.
scene_heading: INT. SATIS HOUSE - DAY 25
text: The gloomy house is lit by a great many candles. ESTELLA
text: takes one up and leads the way. Portraits and draped
text: furniture can be glimpsed as they make their way up a fine
text: staircase towards a door. They stop outside.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Are you frightened?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Go in then.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: After you, miss.
text: ESTELLA smiles scornfully and walks away. PIP takes a
text: breath and pushes the door open...
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SATIS HOUSE - DAY 26
text: The room is lit with candles, with no glimpse of daylight.
text: It is the bedroom, and MISS ELEANOR HAVISHAM sits in front
text: of the mirror of her dressing table.
dialog: She is quite the strangest lady he - or we - have ever
text: seen. The wedding dress, the gloves, the veil are all
text: decayed to a yellow-grey. The bride too has taken on this
text: ashen, sickly taint.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Come nearer. Let me look at you.
text: PIP approaches gingerly, taking in more of the room; the
text: stilled pendulum, the clock stopped at twenty to nine, the
text: half-packed suitcase, the once-fine clothes now dusty and
text: decayed.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Look at me!
dialog: (He does so)
dialog: You are not afraid of a woman who has
dialog: never seen the sun since you were born?
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 19.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No, ma’am.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Then come closer.
dialog: (her hand on her chest)
dialog: Do you know what I touch here?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Your heart.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Broken!
text: The word is spoken with a weird pride.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: I sometimes have sick fancies and I have
dialog: a sick fancy that I want to see some
dialog: play. Play. Play!
dialog: (PIP stands, frozen)
dialog: Are you sullen and obstinate?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No, ma’‘am! I am very sorry for you and
dialog: sorry that I can’t play. If you complain
dialog: of me I will get into trouble with my
dialog: sister, so I would play if I could, but
dialog: it’s so new here....
text: She regards him. A moment. Very quiet.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: So new to him, so old to me, so
dialog: melancholy. Call Estella! Estella!
text: ESTELLA is already approaching, lit by candlelight. She
text: walks past him and straight to MISS HAVISHAM. With a
text: strange mechanical movement, a ritual almost, ESTELLA
text: places her head on her lap.
text: MISS HAVISHAM picks a broach from the dressing table and
text: places it against ESTELLA’s dress, in her hair, watching
text: how the jewels compliment her skin.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Your own one day, my dear, and you will
dialog: use it well.
text: (she fixes the broach to
text: ESTELLA, as if arming her)
dialog: Now. Let me see you play cards with him.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
text: But he’s a common labouring boy.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 20.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Well?
dialog: (whispered, for ESTELLA
dialog: only)
dialog: You can break his heart.
text: They both look to PIP.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: What do you play, boy?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: So. Beggar him.
scene_heading: 27 INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SATIS HOUSE - DAY 27
text: The card game. MISS HAVISHAM looks on.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: The jack of diamonds.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: ‘Jack’! He calls the knaves ‘jacks’, this
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: (MISS HAVISHAM smiles)
dialog: And what coarse hands he has, and what
text: thick boots. He’s nothing but a stupid,
text: clumsy labouring boy.
text: Humiliated, fighting back tears, PIP looks to MISS
speaker_heading: HAVISHAM.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: You say nothing of her. What do you think
dialog: of her?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I don’t like to say.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
text: Whisper in my ear.
text: And PIP approaches, until his face is close to MISS
text: HAVISHAM - the yellow skin, the milky eyes.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I think she is very proud.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Anything else.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I think she is very pretty.

speaker_heading: 28A
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 21.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I think she is very insulting. I think I
dialog: should like to go home.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: What? And never see her again?
text: And PIP looks to ESTELLA. Beautiful. A whisper.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I think I’d like to see her again.
text: MISS HAVISHAM smiles - she has won.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Then you shall. But when, when shall I
dialog: have you here again?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Today is Wednes...
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: No Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays here,
dialog: no days of the week, no weeks of the
dialog: year. Come again after six days. Estella,
dialog: take him down. Feed him.
scene_heading: EXT. SATIS HOUSE - DUSK 28
text: PIP waits in the yard of the derelict brewery as ESTELLA
text: approaches. She carries a tray of bread, a mug of beer
text: which she places on the floor in front of the boy.
text: It's as if he were a dog in disgrace. The gesture is so
text: hurtful and humiliating that tears start in Pip’s eye.
text: YOUNG ESTELLA sees this. With an effort PIP struggles to
text: retain his dignity. ESTELLA merely smiles and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. GARGERY HOUSE - NIGHT 28A
text: PIP’s slammed into the wall, MRS JOE hissing into his ear.
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Did you disgrace yourself?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No -
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: And did she pay you?
dialog: 29
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 22.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No -
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Or say she’d do something for us, a
dialog: reward?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: She wants me to return -
speaker_heading: MRS JOE
dialog: Then you will return, d’you hear me,
dialog: you’1l return and play nicely until she
dialog: sees us right. D’you understand?
text: And she lets the shaken PIP go. JOE looks on, powerless.
scene_heading: INT. FORGE, GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 29
text: A shower of sparks. PIP watches from his usual spot,
text: taking in JOE’s thick boots, his coarse, dirty hands, the
text: grime on his face as he hammers to the dirge-like song
dialog: ‘Old Clem’.
text: PIP holds up his own hands, examines them; the dirt under
text: the scruffy nails. Suddenly, JOE breaks off singing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Something wrong, old chap?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I wish you hadn’t taught me to call the
dialog: knaves jacks.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What’s that, Pip?
text: PIP pauses for a moment. Then, in a rush -
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: And I wish my boots weren’t so thick and
dialog: my hands weren't so coarse and I wish I
dialog: wasn’t common!
text: He tries to run but JOE stops him, scoops him up -
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Now, now old chap. That’s enough now,
dialog: what's all this talk? ‘Common’? Who says
dialog: you’s common? Tell me -
speaker_heading: PIP
text: The girl, at Miss Havisham’s.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 22a.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But you aren’t common in the least, old
dialog: boy! To my mind you are most uncommon.
dialog: Uncommon small and an uncommon scholar...
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I am ignorant and backward, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And what of that letter you wrote, with
dialog: the fine ‘J’ and the ‘0’, the most
dialog: uncommon ‘O’ I ever saw...
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I know nothing! You think much of me,

speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Good gracious, what is going! Enough!
dialog: Enough I say!
text: BIDDY is barely eleven, scruffy, more plain than pretty,

dialog: It is Satis House.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Is that...Greek?
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Greek or Latin or Hebrew or all three,
dialog: for ‘enough’.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Enough House. That’s a curious name.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA

speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: This is the boy, is it? Well I have a

text: He’s to wait in the ballroom.
scene_heading: 36 INT. BALLROOM, SATIS HOUSE - DAY 36
text: The door is closed on PIP. A fire has been lit in the
text: great, grand ballroom, but the smoke hangs in the air like
text: Marsh mist. Rising out of it is the great, long banquet
text: table, covered with dust and mould. In the centre of the
text: room stands the clock, hands stopped at twenty to nine.
text: Both repelled and fascinated by the sight, PIP moves
text: towards the table’s centre-piece, a cake, now overhung
text: with cobwebs and black with fungus.
text: PIP peers closely, then recoils in disgust as a fat black
text: beetle crawls from beneath the rotten icing. A voice -
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: What do you think it is?
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 27.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: A cake?
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: A bride cake. Mine! Take my hand, walk

dialog: Today is my birthday -
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Many happy ret-
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: I will not have it spoken of! On this day

dialog: this heap of decay-
dialog: (- the cake - )
dialog: - was brought here and we have worn away
text: together. Mice have gnawed at it and
text: sharper teeth than mice have gnawed at
dialog: me. When the ruin is complete, when they
dialog: lay me dead in my bride’s dress on the
dialog: bride’s table, the curse will be finished
text: on him.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: On who, Miss Havisham?

text: - The stables, empty and sinister.
text: - A once elegant greenhouse, twisted and shattered.
text: - Rows and rows of barrels, the source of the Havisham

scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 28.
text: - YOUNG ESTELLA, stood still, holding her face up to the
text: warmth of the sun, eyes closed. A private reverie. PIP
dialog: hides, watches -
text: - as now ESTELLA skips from barrel to barrel, singing
text: quietly to herself. Youthful, natural, exuberant, not at
dialog: all the stern and harsh girl we have seen before now. PIP
text: watches, sinking deeper into love, when -
speaker_heading: YOUNG GENTLEMAN
dialog: Who are you?
text: PIP turns. A PALE YOUNG GENTLEMAN, his own age, lanky and
dialog: puny.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GENTLEMAN
dialog: Who let you in? Who gave you leave to
dialog: prowl about?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Estella.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GENTLEMAN
dialog: Estella? That witch!
text: And now we see ESTELLA’s p.o.v, watching unseen.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Take that back!
speaker_heading: YOUNG GENTLEMAN
dialog: I will not!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You will take that back.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GENTLEMAN
dialog: Fight me then.
text: (and he starts to take off
dialog: his jacket)
dialog: Regular rules. Come to the ground!
text: And he starts to prance like some absurd prize-fighter. In
text: her hiding place, ESTELLA stifles her laughter.
text: PIP, too, isn’t quite sure what to do until a feeble jab
text: lands on his arm, and he responds with a neat punch to the
text: pale YOUNG GENTLEMAN’s nose. It’s as much fluke as skill,
text: but he’s surprised to see the boy sprawling on the floor.
text: The boy takes the blow in very good spirits, dabbing at
text: his nosebleed, springing to his feet.

speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: You are not ashamed of being a
dialog: blacksmith?
speaker_heading: PIP

speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM

scene_heading: INT. FORGE, GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 51
text: The noise, sweat and soot of the forge. Face and hands
text: black from the smoke, the ADULT PIP hammers at the red hot
text: iron. Nineteen now, he has grown into a fine, handsome
text: young man; dark-featured, strong, determined.
dialog: 
text: JOE works nearby, well into middle-age now, but still
text: retaining his child-like gaucheness. He and PIP eat a
text: makeshift lunch, tearing at bread with sooty hands.
text: There’s a figure in the doorway; ADULT BIDDY, now in her
text: early twenties, carrying a pile of books. More womanly, a
text: little neater, but with the same pleasant, open face.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Joe, may I?...
text: JOE nods assent.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHES, KENT - DAY 52

scene_heading: EXT. THE OLD BATTERY, MARSHES, KENT - DAY 53
text: Pip and Biddy read. But Biddy’s eyes are not on the page.

speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Don’t mind me.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I wish that I could love you and my work

dialog: but...
speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: You cannot.
speaker_heading: PIP

dialog: Might you be content with me?
speaker_heading: BIDDY

speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Do you think of her very often?
scene_heading: EXT. SATIS HOUSE - DAY 54

scene_heading: INT. FORGE, GARGERY HOUSE - NIGHT 55

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dead, sir. Bad heart. Passed away this
dialog: five years, sir, while on the rampage and
dialog: I miss her every -
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Condolences. My name is Jaggers and I am
dialog: a lawyer in London. I am pretty well
dialog: known. I have unusual business to
dialog: transact with you and I commence by
dialog: explaining that it is not of my
dialog: originating. If my advice had been asked,

dialog: and you see me here. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: (Nothing from PIP and JOE)
dialog: Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an
dialog: offer to relieve you of this young fellow
dialog: your apprentice. I am here to inform you
dialog: that he has great expectations!
speaker_heading: (PIP and JOE

text: He has come into a handsome fortune, and
dialog: it is the desire of the present possessor

text: PIP, his heart beating fast, turns to JOE.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 37.
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Now. Do you have any objections?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No...no, I don’t think so...
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: There are, of course, conditions. The
dialog: first is that you always retain the name
dialog: of Pip. You have no objection I daresay.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I...have no objection.
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: The second stipulation is that the name
dialog: of the liberal benefactor remains a
dialog: profound secret until the person chooses
dialog: to reveal it. You most positively
dialog: prohibited from making any enquiry on
dialog: this question. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Mr Gargery?
text: Throughout the above, JOE has gone into a sort of trance.
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Mr Gargery, this is for you.
dialog: (A purse - )
dialog: Twenty guineas. As compensation. For the
dialog: loss of his services.
text: He drops the money on the table. JOE stares at it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If you think money can make compensation

speaker_heading: JAGGERS

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Can I ask you, Biddy, to help Joe on a

speaker_heading: BIDDY

dialog: (PIP is taken aback)
dialog: Have you never considered that he may be

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Proud?
speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Yes, proud, too proud to let anyone take

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, GARGERY HOUSE - NIGHT 64

text: Clutching JAGGERS’ address in one hand, a carpet bag in

text: overwhelmed by the clamour and chaos.
scene_heading: EXT. JAGGERS’ OFFICES, SMITHFIELD - DAY 67
text: PIP staggers to the door of JAGGERS’s office, an

scene_heading: INT. JAGGERS’ OFFICES, SMITHFIELD - DAY 68
text: Two ghastly black plaster heads sit on a high mantelpiece.
text: A clerk stands on a chair, dusting them. Short, pock-

speaker_heading: WEMMICK
dialog: Mr Jaggers'1ll be with you shortly, Mr
text: Pip. He’s at the Bailey, getting evidence
dialog: together.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 43.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: (The heads-)
dialog: Whose likenesses are they?
speaker_heading: WEMMICK
dialog: ‘Likenesses’? This is their true selves!
dialog: Casts made in Newgate, fresh from the
text: gallows. Murderer, and a forger of wills.
dialog: Very crafty in particular, this one but
dialog: the evidence was too strong.
dialog: (To the death mask)
dialog: Not so crafty now are you, my friend?
text: (WEMMICK steps down off the
text: chair, shows PIP a ring on
dialog: his finger)
dialog: This was his too. Made a gift of it to
dialog: me, just before the end.
text: And with a shudder, PIP notices that WEMMICK wears a
text: number of similar rings; dead mens’ jewellery, two
text: handfuls of it.
speaker_heading: WEMMICK
dialog: Not worth much, but they’re portable, and
dialog: they’re property. That’s my guiding star,
dialog: Mr Pip; get hold of portable property.
dialog: (a bustle at the door)
dialog: That’s Mr Jaggers now.
text: And sure enough, JAGGERS bursts into the room, surrounded

speaker_heading: DRUMMLE

scene_heading: INT. MAYFAIR APARTMENT — DAY 93

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No, we can’t.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: The thing is to marry her, but you can’t
dialog: Marry, not while you’re looking about

speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: You talk of strength. If you want to see

speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: There’s power there. Very few men have

dialog: Joe, there’s really no need to be so

text: MISS HAVISHAM is in her usual place at the dressing table.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Come in, Pip! How do you do, Pip! You
dialog: kiss my hand as if I was a queen, eh?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You wished to see me?
dialog: 113
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 64.
text: But MISS HAVISHAM is staring over his shoulder, gesturing
text: with her eyes. PIP follows her gaze, and sees;
text: Out of the darkness steps ESTELLA, all grown-up now.
text: Startlingly beautiful and womanly.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS, SATIS HOUSE - DAY 113
text: The gardens are little changed since PIP and ESTELLA
dialog: played there as children.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: I am to be sent to London. I am to go on
dialog: show - myself and the jewels.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Do you wish to go on show?
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Why ask? We have no choice, you and I,
dialog: but to obey instructions.
text: They are at the old brewery; the site of YOUNG PIP and
text: HERBERT’s fight all those years ago. ESTELLA steps across
text: the barrels - an echo of the past. For a moment, some of
text: that old girlishness returns.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: I watched you, you know. That day,
dialog: fighting for my honour. I must have been
text: a strange little creature to hide and
dialog: watch, but I did. I enjoyed it very much.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You rewarded me very much.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You kissed me.
text: She regards him for a moment. Not unkindly;
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Poor Pip. You imagine yourself a young
text: knight from a child’s story, tearing away
text: the cobwebs and thorns, letting in the
dialog: sunshine. Marrying the princess. But you
dialog: must know, Pip -—
dialog: (a confidence)
dialog: - I have no heart.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I don’t believe it. How can there be
dialog: beauty without a heart?
dialog: 114
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 65.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Oh, I have a heart to be stabbed in or
dialog: shot in, and if it ceased to beat I
dialog: should cease to be.
text: (she takes his hand, places
dialog: it over her heart)
dialog: But I have no softness there, no
dialog: sympathy. Sentiment. Nonsense. I’ve been
dialog: made that way.
dialog: (PIP is about to speak)
dialog: I am serious, Pip. If we’re to be thrown
dialog: together you must believe me. For both
dialog: our sakes.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I’m sorry, I cannot. I will not.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: (A moment. )
dialog: Very well. It is said at any rate. Come,
dialog: Miss Havisham will be expecting you at
dialog: your old post.
text: And she walks towards the house, PIP following on, his
text: eyes fixed on her extraordinary beauty.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL, SATIS HOUSE - DAY 114
text: MISS HAVISHAM whispers in PIP’s ear.
dialog: A voice -
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown?
dialog: Do you admire her?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Then love her, love her, Pip. If she
dialog: favours you, love her, if she wounds you,
dialog: love her, if she tears your heart to
dialog: pieces - as it gets older, it will tear
dialog: deeper - love her, love her, love her...
text: (her arm is round his neck,
dialog: pulling him in -)
dialog: I adopted her to be loved, bred her,
dialog: educated her, developed her into what she
dialog: is that she might be loved. You know what
dialog: love is, Pip? Blind devotion, self-
dialog: humiliation, degradation, utter
dialog: submission, giving up your heart and soul
dialog: to the smiter as I did to that man...
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Miss Havisham!

scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 66.
text: The lawyer stands in the doorway, ESTELLA a little behind

speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: That is enough excitement for one day.
dialog: Pip, you are requested to escort Estella
dialog: to London tomorrow morning. I suggest an
dialog: early night. Miss Havisham, shall we take
dialog: a trip? Once round?
text: And JAGGERS begins to push MISS HAVISHAM on one of her
text: circuits of the wedding banquet. PIP and ESTELLA share one
dialog: last look.
scene_heading: EXT. GARGERY HOUSE - DUSK 115A

scene_heading: INT. FORGE, GARGERY HOUSE - DUSK 116A

text: watches for a moment. About to speak -
text: But what could he possibly say? Unseen, he slips away
text: without a word.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY LANE -— DAWN 117
text: Next morning, and their carriage hurtles towards London.
text: In her furred travelling dress, ESTELLA is more beautiful
text: than ever, and as PIP drinks her in, she leans out of the
text: window, feeling the sun and breeze on her face.
dialog: Exhilaration, an escape -
scene_heading: EXT. BRANDLEY HOUSE, RICHMOND GREEN - DAY 118
text: ESTELLA’s luggage is unloaded at the door of the fine
text: house of her chaperone, MRS BRANDLEY and her daughter MISS
scene_heading: BRANDLEY.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Mrs Brandley is to be paid a large sum of
dialog: money to introduce me to society. The
dialog: jewels and I. We are to be shown to
dialog: people and people are to be shown to us.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: May I come and see you?
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 67.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Of course. Miss Havisham expects it.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: And may I kiss you again?
text: She thinks a moment. Then steps back and, in the shadow of
text: the coach, offers up her cheek.
text: PIP kisses her, then searches her face for some response.
text: Impassive, emotionless. Nothing.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Goodbye, Pip.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT 119
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I love her, Herbert. I adore her.
text: PIP and HERBERT, a little drunk and sentimental.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: You've always adored her. You brought
dialog: your adoration and your luggage here
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: If I adored her then, I adore her twice
dialog: as much now.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: Lucky for you then, that you’re picked
text: out for her.
dialog: (PIP looks to him)
dialog: How can it be otherwise?
dialog: (A deep breath -)
dialog: May I say something, Handel? Something
dialog: disagreeable. Are you ready? One-two-
dialog: three...forget her! Detach yourself from
dialog: her. Think of her upbringing and of Miss
dialog: Havisham, know that she will never change
dialog: and only misery can come of loving her.
dialog: Forget Estella.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: You can’t try?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: It's impossible.

text: Hungover, PIP looks on as WEMMICK unlocks the cash-box
dialog: once more.
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: I see bills from vintners, bills from

dialog: go wrong, Mr Pip, but really you're
dialog: excelling yourself.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I’1l endeavour to show more restraint -
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Do as you will, it is no business of
dialog: mine. Wemmick, give Mr Pip the money he
dialog: requires. Now if you’ll excuse me...
text: And he heads off to his office. As he opens the door, PIP
text: glimpses a figure; BENTLEY DRUMMLE. JAGGERS shakes his

speaker_heading: THE FINCHES
dialog: Huzzah! Huzzah! For the Finches of the
dialog: Grove!
speaker_heading: STARTOP
dialog: And the ladies that they sigh for!
text: Rowdy jeers and leers. PIP, lost in drink, is barely
text: listening. DRUMMLE watches, stands coolly, eyes on PIP.
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
dialog: I would like to raise a glass to a lady
dialog: of my acquaintance, a lady of Richmond, a
dialog: peerless beauty, Miss Estella Havisham!
speaker_heading: THE FINCHES
dialog: Miss Estella Havisham!
text: PIP wakes up, struggles to his feet.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I know that lady -
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
dialog: Do you? Oh, Lord!
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: - and you know nothing of her.
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
dialog: On the contrary, I’ve had the pleasure of

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You lie!
text: Consternation from the fellow Finches.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
text: Steady now, Handel.
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE

scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE, BALL, RICHMOND - NIGHT
text: Spoiling for a fight, the Finches storm down the staircase

scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM, ASSEMBLY ROOMS, RICHMOND - NIGHT 123
text: A grand society ball is in full swing. The room is packed
dialog: with young London’s brightest and finest. But none is more
text: striking, more beautiful and startling than ESTELLA.
text: She stands amidst a pack of love-lorn suitors; handsome,
text: high-society men. The FINCHES storm in and, sensing
text: trouble, the crowd parts.
text: ESTELLA catches swaggering DRUMMLE’s eye, and offers up a
text: radiant smile. Then she sees PIP.
text: Their eyes lock, and for a fleeting moment, there’s a look
text: of startling sadness and regret in ESTELLA’s eyes -
text: Then it is gone, and once again she is beautiful, cold,
text: invulnerable. She takes DRUMMLE’s hand.
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
dialog: A waltz!
text: The music begins, and ESTELLA and DRUMMLE start to dance.
text: All this is observed by JAGGERS, dispassionately observing
dialog: the resolution of a plan.
text: PIP can take no more. Devastated, he flees. ESTELLA spots
text: this, stops dancing abruptly and goes to follow -
text: - but DRUMMLE’s meaty hand grasps her bare arm.
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
text: The dance is not yet over.
text: The other DANCERS see this confrontation.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Remove your hand, sir.
text: Their eyes lock - a challenge. ESTELLA is unflinching.

text: He turns. Bejewelled, silhouetted in the doorway in her

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: How can you do it, Estella?
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Give your affections to that man.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
text: All sorts of ugly creatures hover about a
dialog: lighted candle. Can the candle help it?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: No, but you can.
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Perhaps. If I cared.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: But you must care! To encourage a man as
text: despised, as addle-headed and unworthy
text: and boorish as Bentley Drummle, a man who
dialog: has nothing to recommend him except
dialog: money...
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Pip, don’t let it affect you so.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I can’t help it! To give that man the

speaker_heading: ESTELLA

speaker_heading: PIP

speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Oh, Pip. Why do you think?
text: A moment. The music from the ballroom can still be heard
text: and, without speaking, ESTELLA crosses to PIP and takes
text: his hand.
text: Nervously, PIP places his other hand on ESTELLA’s waist.
text: A breathless, intimate moment, their faces close as they
dialog: dance.
dialog: Then a voice -
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: Lovely evening, isn’t it? A storm later.
dialog: So they say. Estella - Mr Drummle

speaker_heading: PIP

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: This here ‘erbert - ?
speaker_heading: PIP
text: At his parents. Away till tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Sit. Sit and give us half a minute.
text: Nervously PIP sits opposite the stranger. He takes in the

text: over and takes PIP’s hands, and kisses them with startling
dialog: humility. And PIP remembers. The Convict.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Good God -
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: You acted noble, my boy. Noble, Pip, and
dialog: I have never forgot it.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: If you're grateful for me for what I did
dialog: as a boy, if you’ve come to thank me,
dialog: it’s not necessary. But you must
dialog: understand...
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: What must I understand?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: That I cannot renew our acquaintance. My
dialog: life has changed since then. I’m glad
dialog: that you’re well and that you’ve
dialog: repented. But really, you must go.
dialog: Please, go, now.

scene_heading: 130 INT. MAYFAIR APARTMENTS - NIGHT 130
text: MAGWITCH pours rum into glasses.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: How have you been living?
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You’ve done well?
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: I’ve done wonderful well. Seems you’ve
dialog: done well too.

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I have, thank you, and I'd like, if I
dialog: may, to give you this gift -
dialog: (His pocket book-)
dialog: A token. For old times. Before you go.
dialog: Here —
text: And he holds out a one pound note to the convict.
text: MAGWITCH regards the money for a second; not insulted,
text: just a little amused.
text: He folds the money lengthwise, gives it a twist, holds it
text: to the candle. As he watches it burn -
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Might a varmint make so bold as to ask
dialog: you how you have done well, since we were
dialog: on those marshes?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I have come into some property.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: And might a varmint ask whose property?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I cannot say her name. There are

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Conditions. Hm. Could I make a guess as

scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 75.
text: And a terrible truth starts to dawn for PIP. In a great

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: And a guardian, you will have had a
dialog: guardian, a lawyer maybe, with a name
dialog: beginning with a...J?
dialog: (PIP stumbles to the door)
dialog: A ‘J’ perhaps who might have sent me your
dialog: address when I landed in Portsmouth? A Mr
dialog: Jaggers p'raps?
text: (and MAGWITCH is upon him,
dialog: embracing him)
dialog: Yes dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman of
dialog: you! I swore that time as sure as I ever
dialog: earned a guinea, that guinea should go to
dialog: you. I lived rough so that you should
dialog: live smooth, I worked hard that you
dialog: should be above work. And when the blood
dialog: horses of them colonists kicked up dirt
dialog: in my face, and they called me a convict,
dialog: a common fellow, I said to myself ‘I’m
dialog: making a better gentleman than you will
dialog: ever be’
dialog: (tears in his eyes now-)
dialog: And Pip - you’re him! I made you! I’m
dialog: your father, Pip.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You are not my father!
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Your second father then, and you’re my
dialog: son, no, more to me than any son!
text: (His hands are on PIP’s face
text: now, drinking in the sight
dialog: of him)
dialog: Look at you, dear boy! Look at these
dialog: lodgings, fit for a lord, and this watch
dialog: and this ring and your linen and your
dialog: clothes. And your books too, hundreds of
dialog: them! Read ‘em all, have you? You shall
dialog: read’em to me, dear boy, and I shall be
dialog: so proud to think that I’m the maker of
dialog: such a man!
text: And MAGWITCH’s arms are once again around his ‘son’, a son
text: who feels nothing but fear and repulsion for this man.

dialog: time since I slept. You'll keep a watch,
dialog: my boy?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Because, look here, caution is necessary.

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH

dialog: ‘father’.
text: On the bedside table a jack-knife lies, huge and sinister,
text: its blade exposed, ready for use. On the mantelpiece,
text: tightly-bound rolls of cash, high denomination notes, more
dialog: money than PIP has ever imagined. PIP holds one in his
dialog: hand.
text: Sunlight is on the pillow; MAGWITCH stirs. PIP returns the
text: money to the pile, crosses to the curtain, and is about to
dialog: pull it shut -
text: Outside, in the park, a silhouetted figure in the dawn
text: light. Tall, thin, sinister, he stares implacably at the

dialog: And don’t commit yourself, don’t tell me

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Is what I have been told true?
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: ‘Told’ implies verbal communication, you
dialog: can’t have verbal communication with a
dialog: man in New South Wales.
dialog: (WEMMICK loiters)
text: Wemmick, the door.
text: WEMMICK pulls the door closed, and takes a seat.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I was led to believe -
speaker_heading: JAGGERS
dialog: - nothing, Pip. You believed what you
dialog: chose to believe. I am not responsible
dialog: for that. Now, have an uncle staying with
dialog: you at present, is that right?
speaker_heading: (PIP nods)
dialog: Perhaps you might buy him some new
dialog: clothes and advise him to reside in your
dialog: rooms as much as possible. Perhaps your
dialog: uncle might cut his hair. In the meantime-
dialog: ( - a piece of paper -)
dialog: - in writing to the gentleman in New
dialog: South Wales, you might give him this. The
dialog: balance of our accounts. My services are
dialog: at an end. Good day, Mr Pip.
text: But PIP doesn’t move. With measured fury -
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: All that time, in Satis House I was just

dialog: Estella was never meant for me at all.

speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Open this gate, Drummle, or I swear...
speaker_heading: DRUMMLE
dialog: Why, it’s the ‘smithie’s boy! Don’t lose

dialog: you’ve lost quite enough already...

speaker_heading: PIP
speaker_heading: ENOUGH!

dialog: is something of the knight-of-old about PIP this time.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: What I have to say to Estella I will say
dialog: before you. But Miss Havisham; when you
dialog: first took me from my home, I came as a
dialog: kind of servant, to gratify a whim and be
dialog: paid for it.
scene_heading: GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 10/12) 79.
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: Ay, Pip -
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: And when I fell into my mistake, of

speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
dialog: - I let you go on.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Was that...kind?
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM
speaker_heading: KIND!
dialog: (with real rage)
dialog: Who am I, for God’s sake, to be kind? It
dialog: amused me, do you hear? To punish my
dialog: relations. You were adequately paid I
dialog: believe. What else do you want, Pip?
text: And now PIP gathers himself, and turns to ESTELLA.

speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: It seems these are sentiments, emotions,

speaker_heading: PIP

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You can’t let Miss Havisham...
speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: It is my own act. Miss Havisham has urged

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Out of my thoughts? You are part of my

speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: I am what you made me!
dialog: (eyes blazing)
dialog: You are my mother, and yet I’ve never
dialog: seen your face by daylight. Since I was a

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Estella - come with me now.

speaker_heading: WEMMICK

scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM, SATIS HOUSE - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK) 173
text: MISS HAVISHAM, some sixteen years younger than in the

text: fire throws strange shadows onto the wall.
text: Alone in this blacked-out room, with the strange veiled
text: figure all in white, the infant ESTELLA is terrified.
text: She glances towards the banquet, already mouldering and
text: corrupted after six years of decay.
text: INFANT ESTELLA looks to JAGGERS for aid, but he is already

text: And now the woman in white is holding out her hand. A

dialog: walks away)
dialog: Oh Pip, are you very unhappy? Do you hate
dialog: me very much? I know that you must hate
dialog: me, but if you can ever bear to forgive
dialog: me, Pip...
text: She follows him. But the long train of MISS HAVISHAM’s
text: wedding dress is uncoiling behind her, knocking a table.
text: A candle falls, igniting the desiccated material. It
text: burns, the flames catching with startling speed, burning
text: through the dress like a fuse.
text: And now MISS HAVISHAM becomes aware of the flames behind
text: her, writhing as they catch the dried silk and organza and
text: lace, the flames burning around her as she screams and
text: grabs the table-cloth. The rotting wedding-cake, the glass
text: and crockery, the rats and beetles and spiders, fall to
dialog: the floor.
text: Helplessly, PIP swats at the flames, burning his hands,
text: then grabs the curtains, tears them down, the dawn light
text: pouring in, rats and spiders fleeing the light. He wraps
text: the fabric round MISS HAVISHAM, holding her tight until
text: the flames are extinguished.
text: The wedding-cake lies shattered on the floor.
text: And now JAGGERS bursts into the smoke-filled room. Ashes
text: float in the air like confetti, and PIP sits and cradles
text: MISS HAVISHAM as she lies, frozen in shock, her breath
text: coming in short bursts.

text: PIP approaches to hear better. Her incantation;
speaker_heading: MISS HAVISHAM

scene_heading: EXT. ROWING BOAT, THAMES - DAY 185
text: As MAGWITCH sits in the prow, PIP and HERBERT row with all

text: Pulling hard at the oars, PIP glances down at his burnt

text: He holds on to the oars, and rows on.
scene_heading: EXT. ROWING BOAT, THAMES - DUSK 186
text: The journey continues, past Gravesend now, the spring day
text: fresh but bright. PIP glances to his side;
text: The prison hulks are there, menacing and dark. PIP glances

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You seem despondent, Abel.
speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Not a bit of it. To sit here and have my

dialog: (He breaks off.)
dialog: I had a little child once. I didn’t tell

dialog: Died while I was in prison. ‘Appens often

dialog: what a dear pretty thing she were. And
dialog: when I saw you on those marshes, well,

dialog: that’s why I took to you so strong. You

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: You speak as if we were parting. In an

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: Well perhaps we will and perhaps we
dialog: won't.
text: He places his hand over the side of the boat, and lets his

speaker_heading: MAGWITCH
dialog: We can no more see to the bottom of the
dialog: next few hours than we can see to the

speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: Listen! Can you hear?...
scene_heading: EXT. ROWING BOAT, THAMES - NIGHT 188
text: HERBERT and PIP pull as hard as they can to the centre of
text: the river. Sure enough, the steamer is approaching,
text: paddles churning the water, the means of their escape.
text: But before it, a dreadful sight.
text: The Thames River Police, twelve strong uniformed men,
text: giving their boat a formidable pace.
text: PIP shoots a look to MAGWITCH, who seems resigned.
text: Nevertheless, PIP and HERBERT continue to row into the
dialog: path of the steamer -
text: - which now sounds its horn in warning.
text: The Police Boat is making fast progress too. An officer
text: stands at the helm;
speaker_heading: RIVER POLICE
dialog: You have a returned convict there! His
dialog: name is Abel Magwitch. I apprehend the
dialog: man, and call upon him to surrender!
text: Against all hope, PIP and HERBERT continue to row. PIP
text: glances back at the advancing boat, and the steamer behind
text: it, its horn sounding once more.
text: In the Police Boat, a black-clad figure cowers. COMPEYSON,
text: the dark, scarred face clearly visible.
text: MAGWITCH sees him too. PIP sees a momentary glimpse of the
text: jack-knife, clenched in MAGWITCH’s hand, the brutality of
text: old returning to his face.
text: And now the police boat is beside them, POLICEMEN clinging
text: on to the side in preparation for the arrest.
text: But too late. With a terrible cry, MAGWITCH hurls himself
text: onto a terrified COMPEYSON, knocking him backwards into
dialog: the water -
text: Horns blare -
text: And now the steamboat is suddenly upon them, great paddles
text: chewing through PIP’s boat like matchwood. PIP and HERBERT
text: hurl themselves into the water, turning just in time to

text: MAGWITCH and COMPEYSON are dragged beneath the steamer’s

scene_heading: INT. POLICE GALLEY, THAMES - NIGHT 189
text: The steamer has sailed on. The water is calmer now, and

dialog: Paper. Money. Five, ten pound notes, hundreds of pounds-
text: worth, sodden and useless.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Over there!
text: And a black shape bobs on the surface; MAGWITCH.
text: He is hauled into the boat. Blood seeps from a gash in his

text: An impassioned whisper -
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I will not leave you, do you hear me?
dialog: Whatever happens from now on, I'll be by

text: In sturdy, sensible boots, PIP strides across the marshes
text: of his youth towards his old home.
text: It's a beautiful June day, and he carries everything he
text: owns in a back-pack.
text: The gibbet hangs over the road. PIP hesitates, but only
text: momentarily. Then he marches beneath it, fearless now.
text: In the distance, smoke rises from the forge.
text: PIP breaks into a run...
scene_heading: EXT/INT. GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 208

text: PIP watches for a moment, smiling affectionately, the

dialog: Biddy? I came to see you as quickly as I
dialog: could. I wanted to tell you, Biddy -
text: She turns, puts her hand to her mouth, startled, the
text: flowers still clasped in her other hand; a bouquet.
dialog: And PIP realises -
speaker_heading: BIDDY
dialog: Oh, Pip - it’s my wedding day!
text: For one tiny moment, there’s a flicker of disappointment

text: But then JOE is there, beaming in his Sunday best, and PIP
text: rushes in, embracing them both and laughing, laughing...
scene_heading: EXT. THE OLD BATTERY, MARSHES, KENT - DUSK 208A
text: After the ceremony, the newly weds and their only guest
text: head for their old spot. JOE gives BIDDY a piggy-back, PIP

text: throws him her bouquet...

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's only money, Pip.
speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: Nevertheless, I will work and work and I

dialog: it takes me...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Enough now.
text: BIDDY smiles, takes JOE’s hand, looks to PIP.
text: And the three friends sit there, watching as the sun goes
dialog: down.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I have a message. From a lady...
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: A lady, how intriguing!
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: It’s from a lady, Handel!
text: And PIP enters the room. Older, darker, more mature, he
text: smiles and takes the note from CHARLES, opens it, reads
dialog: it.
text: And sits down in silence.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: What is it, Handel? Handel?
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY 213
text: PIP strides through the wintery park, full of

speaker_heading: PIP

speaker_heading: PIP
dialog: I’m sorry for anything that brings you

speaker_heading: ESTELLA
dialog: Then rest assured I feel none. My husband
