speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: I want to finish the study.
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: Which is exactly what I knew you'd

dialog: that experience is like. To have
dialog: your kids ripped away from you.
dialog: Ashley without any explanation...and
dialog: then Ronnie just not wanting anything

scene_heading: THE REAL DR. TYLER
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: CLATUNDE

speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: Keep talking to me-- keep talking--

speaker_heading: ABBEY

speaker_heading: CAMPOS

speaker_heading: OLATUNDE
dialog: Are you OK? Do you need a break?
scene_heading: THE REAL DR. TYLER
dialog: No, I'm fine.
text: Dr. Tyler takes a couple of breaths, steadying herself.
speaker_heading: OLATUNDE
dialog: Why would...another entity not from
dialog: this world do these things? Help us
dialog: understand the reasoning behind it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE REAL DR. TYLER
dialog: God I don't know--how can we know?
dialog: If humans can mystify other humans...
dialog: on a daily basis...then-~-I--I think

scene_heading: THE REAL DR. TYLER
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: She...I had to recover from that

dialog: bring me into the station so he...he
dialog: came to me.

dialog: about Will.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: IN A NOME HOSPITAL ROOM.
text: Abbey sits in bed...her back against the headboard...her
text: hair stringy, moist, unkempt. She's lost too much
text: weight...bone is pressing against her skin...an empty shell
text: of a once strong, healthy woman.
text: Her body is very still, unmoving.
text: August sits in a chair next to her, a MANILA FOLDER in hand.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: I hate to ask you these questions--
dialog: now, while you're in this condition

dialog: things in life that can't wait.
text: Abbey nods weakly, quietly.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Abbey. What happened to your
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: (quietly, weakly)
dialog: I told you...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: What you told me and what actually
dialog: happened are two different things.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: No--they're the same.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: OK...you want to play this game?
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: It's not a game-~
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: How did Will die?
text: She hesitates, pulls back-~stunned by the question.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: C'mon....Answer it.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: He was murdered.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No Abbey. What you're telling me
dialog: and what happened are two different
dialog: things. Now one more time: How did
dialog: Will die?
text: Her eyes are darting around...she's breathing harder...her
text: skin is losing it's color...panic is welling in her throat.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: Why are you asking me this?
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Campos! Get in here!
text: A deputy opens the door and Campos walks in, circles to the
text: other side of the bed and kneels next to Abbey.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: Tr's OK...1t's OK...
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: No it's not OK. We're getting to
dialog: the bottom of everything now. Again:
dialog: How did your husband die?
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: I teld you, an intruder entered our
dialog: house and killed him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107
text: August and Campos exchange looks.
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: He's going to show you something
dialog: that will upset you. But it has to
dialog: be done, understand?
text: She doesn't understand. With what strength she has left,
text: she looks at Campos hard.
text: August opens his file...and holds up
speaker_heading: a PHOTO
dialog: for her to see...
text: She gasps--half SCREAMS, doesn't have the strength to scream
text: again--her face is a perfect mask of revulsion, of
dialog: tears...anguish.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: -why...?
text: THE PHOTC is of WILL TYLER--with a BLOODY HOLE in the side
text: of his head the size of a GRAPEFRUIT.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: This is the head of a man--
text: He holds up a SECOND PHOTO, this one of a 9mm PISTOL.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: --who used this gun, to blow his own
dialog: brains out.
text: Abbey can't stop sobbing--her eyes are closed, her head turned
text: away--whimpering. Campos is caressing her face, almost
text: protecting it from the photos.
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: I'm sorry...
text: August shakes the photos for emphasis.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: This is how you do it--and he did it
dialog: right. Suicide Abbey. That's how
dialog: your husband died.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
speaker_heading: AUGUST
text: He took a pistol and shot himself in
dialog: the head--there was no knife, no
dialog: der--just him and his own gun
dialog: edge of your bed.
dialog: int
dialog: 
dialog: at
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: --he's not that man--he wouldn't do
dialog: that to us, to his family--
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: --I've seen it before, I'll see it
dialog: again--
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: (to Campos)
dialog: Tell him...tell him he's wrong. I
dialog: would have known he was gonna--I'm a
dialog: psychiatrist---Christ----I would
dialog: have known--!
text: Campos holds her close, trying to comfort her.
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: You can't blame yourself for what
dialog: was going on in his head. Who knows
dialog: what he learned, what he didn't
dialog: share...what finally broke him--
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: No...no...
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: Sometimes the closest signs, the
dialog: ones closest to us, are the hardest
dialog: to read.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: (to Abbey)
dialog: Now you know the reality.
text: August puts the photos down...and leans in.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: And for the last time. Tell me what
dialog: happened to Ashley.
text: She can't answer.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: You have to tell him...for Ashley.
text: Tears wetting her cheeks, she pulls away from Campos and
text: looks at him...softly.
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: You know what happened. You
dialog: experienced it. Except we came
dialog: back...she didn't.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Campos! eyes lock on hers...and then they give in, looking
text: down to the bed. He can't refute her words...not after what
text: he's seen. Not after what they've been through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABBEY
dialog: (to August)
dialog: I swear to you--I swear it. She was
dialog: taken, by-by something. ..something
dialog: not from here....... I swear it....
text: August looks between the two of them, his face like a bull
text: ready to charge--but unsure which bulls eye to hit first.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: (then quietly)
dialog: It's difficult to go back.
text: He arranges the pictures and closes the files just so.
speaker_heading: CAMPOS
dialog: Go back?
text: August takes his time, doesn't rush it.
speaker_heading: AUGUST
dialog: Back over the line, from fiction to
dialog: reality. You can't just stop being
dialog: insane whenever you want to. It's
dialog: @ the kind of thing that stays with
dialog: you forever.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE INTERVIEW ROOM.
text: Abbey is quiet...lost in the memory.
speaker_heading: OLATUNDE
dialog: So Will committed suicide?

speaker_heading: OLATUNDE
