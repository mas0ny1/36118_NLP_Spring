scene_heading: INT. QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/PAUL’S ROOM - DAY 1
dialog: 
text: We are in a simple, small but comfortable hotel room with
text: bare white walls and worn out but well-kept hardwood floors.
text: There’s a small bed with someone seemingly asleep in it; a
text: desk and a chair in the corner. Around the window, we see a
text: faint frame of early morning light, but the curtains are
text: drawn closed, keeping the room dark and tranquil.
text: After a few seconds, we notice a quiet but steady sound
dialog: “drip... drip... drip..." breaking the absolute silence.
text: On the bed, PAUL GAGNE has his eyes open, awake in the
text: darkness. A light-haired Frenchman in his mid 30’s, he
text: listens to the steady beat of water falling one drop after
text: the next into a lonesome metal can.
text: He can hear a piano start to play in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS/SINTRA - DAY 2
dialog: It’s morning of a Fall day in Sintra, the ancient Portuguese
dialog: city on the hills, not far from Lisbon. For centuries, this
dialog: was the summer retreat for the local aristocracy. The ornate
text: towers of various castles, each in its own architectural
text: style, are seen above the more typical Colonial-era buildings
text: that make up the heart of the town. There’s green all around
text: from its famous lush gardens. The effect is romantic - almost
dialog: fairy tale.
text: The streets are still quiet in town. It’s early in the
text: morning. The tour buses have not yet arrived. The lucky
text: tourists who managed to get a room in town are still asleep.
text: Well, not all of them. JAMES “JIMMY” MANUS, a robust
text: Irishman, early 60's, tall and gentle, strolls amongst a few
text: LOCALS. Looking down, hands in his pockets, he is deep in
text: thought. It’s a beautiful day in Sintra, but Jimmy is unaware
dialog: of his magnificent surroundings.
scene_heading: EXT. FONTE DOS NOIVADOS/SINTRA - DAY 3
dialog: 
text: As Jimmy turns the corner, something makes him slow down.
text: It’s nothing more than an old fountain adorned with beautiful
text: tile work. He stops to listen to the sound of the working
text: fountain and, as if hit by a wave of nostalgia, he slowly
text: approaches the water stream. And as Jimmy touches the water,
text: his eyes fill up with tears.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (0.S.)
dialog: We call that Fonte dos Noivados -
dialog: The Engagement Fountain.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOK/SINTRA - DAY 4
text: Standing on top of a sloped street, an elegant older man with
text: silver hair, adjusts his BINOCULARS, trying to get the scene
text: down below, of Jimmy at the fountain, into focus.
text: The friendly looking Frenchman in his early 60's is MICHEL
text: GAGNE. Next to him is TIAGO MIRANTE, a striking, young
dialog: Portuguese guide.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (0.S.)
dialog: The tile work is from the late 18th
dialog: Century, from the reign of Dona
dialog: Maria I. At that time, unmarried
dialog: girls would come from all over the
dialog: region to drink from this ancient
dialog: fountain. They’d do this pilgrimage
dialog: because there was a belief that the
dialog: waters would help them find a good
dialog: husband.
text: Michel lets his binoculars fall to his chest, and hang from
dialog: their straps.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: And did it work?
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: They say so.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: How magnificent. If only it was so
dialog: easy.
text: Tiago smiles benignly, then starts down the street, watched
dialog: by Michel.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Magnifique.
scene_heading: EXT. QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/SWIMMING POOL - DAY 5
dialog: 
text: Blue water. The surface of transparent blue water trembles,
text: projecting abstract forms.
text: A woman’s hand touches the water, a reflection of her face,
text: still abstract, fills the screen. She seems to be looking at
text: herself... or at the bottom of the pool.
dialog: 3.
text: FRANCOISE “FRANKIE” CREMONT, kneeling by the pool, dips one
text: hand into the water, then the other one, making sure both
text: wrists are wet and cool. As if part of a ritual, she then
text: splashes water on the back of her neck. Once, twice.
text: Frankie gets up and, meditative, keeping her eyes down at the
text: water, takes a deep breath. She’s a striking woman, with a
text: very short haircut, messy like a boy’s, accentuating her
dialog: strong features.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MAYA, 15, light-skinned black, in shorts and a tank top, is
text: lying on a lounge chair by the pool reading Wuthering
text: Heights. She looks up from her book, inquisitive, recognizing
dialog: something, or someone she knows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frankie drops the bathrobe. She’s topless, wearing only the
text: bottom part of a bikini. Another deep breath, and she dives
text: into the swimming pool.
text: Maya puts her book down, and watches as Frankie swims under
text: water, and comes to the surface close to her.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (British accent)
dialog: There’s people in the hotel, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I don’t see anyone.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: They can take pictures.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: That's okay. I’m very photogenic.
text: Maya observes as Frankie swims away, her semi-naked body
text: moving gracefully under the water.
scene_heading: INT. PORTUGUESE BAKERY - DAY 6
text: A traditional Portuguese bakery with glass shelves filled
dialog: with the freshest, most delicious pastries. It’s all so fresh
text: you can almost smell it. Behind the counter is LUCIANA,
text: serving Jimmy, placing pastries in a takeaway box. Jimmy is
text: sipping an expresso.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So that’s four queijadas. And now,
dialog: let's see... six pastéis, please.
speaker_heading: LUCIANA
dialog: You look tired today. Did you not
dialog: get enough sleep?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Well thank you very much.
text: Another SALESWOMAN, standing next to Luciana, laughs at what
dialog: she’s just heard.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: Luciana!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So nice to hear first thing in the
dialog: morning!
text: The Saleswoman laughs some more. Luciana blushes.
speaker_heading: LUCIANA
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t... anyway, tired is
dialog: sexy!
text: Luciana hands him his box of pastries.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'll pretend I believe you.
speaker_heading: LUCIANA
dialog: (in Portuguese)
text: His eyes are puffy. He's been
dialog: crying.
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Have a nice day, Mr. Jimmy. Say
dialog: hello to the Madame.
text: Luciano goes to help other customers.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I have terrible allergies. If you
dialog: want to know.
speaker_heading: LUCIANA
dialog: My husband too. It’s awful this
dialog: time of the year.
text: Jimmy takes another sip from his espresso, trying to enjoy
dialog: the Portuguese morning.
scene_heading: INT. QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/IAN & SYLVIA’S SUITE - DAY 7
dialog: 
text: IAN ANDOH, 46, an Englishman, black, solidly built, sits on
text: the bed, wearing shorts, holding a running shoe. He tries to
text: put the shoe on, but it’s too tight. He picks it up again,
text: and as he loosens up the shoe laces, working meticulously
text: from the top part down, a recurring thought manifests itself.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: The whole thing is so unfair. I
dialog: can’t get over it. They’re one of
dialog: the happiest, most perfectly
dialog: romantic pairs I have ever known.
text: Ian’s wife SYLVIA ANDOH, late 30's, stands across the hotel
text: suite, dressed in pants and a bra, picking up a shirt from an
text: open suitcase. They must have been a happy couple at some
text: point. Now, approaching middle age, something sets them
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: There’s no perfection there. They
dialog: have their grievances.
text: Ian puts on the running shoe.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Have you seen my yellow cashmere
dialog: sweater?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: To think that one is suddenly taken
dialog: away from the other by this...
dialog: thing, this horrible thing, makes
dialog: me lose faith in love itself.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: So romantic, all of a sudden!
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Don’t be cynical. We’re seeing your
dialog: father go from romantic bliss to
text: tears and despair.
text: Ian stands up and grabs a T-shirt, but before he puts it on,
text: he looks at himself in the mirror, and grabs his own love
dialog: handles.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I have to stop with the bread.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I’ve gained weight.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Don’t start. Please.
text: Ian puts the T-shirt on. Sylvia closes down the suitcase,
text: frustrated that she can’t find what she was looking for.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: What day is it today? Thursday?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Wednesday.
text: She goes in the drawer, grabs the first shirt she sees and
text: puts it on.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: It’s impossible to pretend we are
dialog: enjoying this trip. It’s a brutal
dialog: idea she had. For us all to come
dialog: here at a time like this.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You sure it wasn’t your father’s
dialog: idea?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: What do you think?
text: Sylvia goes out the door, leaving Ian alone with his weight
dialog: and his shoes.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTUGUESE BAKERY - DAY
text: Jimmy is walking out with his box of pastries when he runs
dialog: into Michel and Tiago.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: You beat us this morning!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: “I'd woken early, and I took a long
dialog: time getting ready to exist.”
text: Michel isn’t sure he understands.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fernando Pessoa. I just can’t help
dialog: it. My mind swims with him whenever
dialog: I’m here.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Jimmy, you are the only actor I
dialog: know who reads anything but their
dialog: reviews.
text: Jimmy laughs, and then offers his box of pastries.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Queijadas anyone? Or a pastel?
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: How is she this morning?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She's good, thanks. Fine.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m here in this magical town with
dialog: the people I love most. I have no
dialog: right to complain, do I?
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: I believe everyone always has a
dialog: right to complain, don’t you,
dialog: Tiago?
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: Certainly.
text: The three men smile at each other awkwardly.
scene_heading: INT. QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/FRANKIE & JIMMY’S SUITE - DAY 9
text: Frankie, already dressed, her hair still wet, goes to the
text: dresser and picks up a cardigan sweater.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Will this one do?
text: As Frankie hands Sylvia the sweater, Sylvia notices a
text: bracelet Frankie has on her wrist, and grabs her hand to take
dialog: a better look.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Wait a minute...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Isn't it gorgeous?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Is it real?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Pink diamonds, Colombian emeralds.
dialog: It’s Bulgari, vintage.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: How come I’ve never seen this one
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It was given to me by a man I knew
dialog: between Michel and your father.
dialog: There were quite a few, you know. I
dialog: was younger than you are now. And
dialog: very beautiful. I never wear it.
dialog: Not because of your father - he
dialog: doesn’t care. But it’s a bit
dialog: flashy, no?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: It’s Bulgari.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I'm always afraid it’ll get stolen
dialog: or something, but now I’m like
dialog: ‘what the hell’.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Can I try?
text: Frankie places the bracelet onto Sylvia’s wrist. There's a
text: knock on the door, but the girls are too excited to hear
text: anything else but themselves. Sylvia admires the stones
dialog: against the light.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: He must’ve really loved you, this
dialog: man.
text: The door opens and Paul comes in. He’s straight out of bed,
text: hasn’t even washed his face yet.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Love? I don’t know. He liked me,
dialog: and he was rich. I try never to
dialog: confuse money with love. He said
dialog: the colors were perfect for me.
dialog: Whatever that means.
dialog: 9.
text: Paul gives his mother a double kiss on her cheeks and goes to
text: sit on the bed, without a word.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My room has a terrible leak.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Well, good morning.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can’t sleep.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Try another room.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I asked. Nothing available.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Is the water dripping on you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, it’s in the corner. But still,
dialog: it’s all night, “drip... drip...
dialog: drip...” It’s impossible.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You're too sensitive.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You want to switch rooms?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You want to sleep with my husband?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Question is: do you want to sleep
dialog: with your husband?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: None of your business!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You started this.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Children. I haven’t even had coffee
dialog: yet.
text: A beat. Paul keeps staring at Sylvia, defiant, but this is a
dialog: sensitive matter Sylvia would rather not discuss. All very
dialog: clear to Frankie.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I’m going to get some sun. You
dialog: should try it sometime, Paul. Would
dialog: be good for your skin.
text: Sylvia walks towards the door...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Vivi!
text: Sylvia turns around, takes the bracelet off.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I forgot. Sorry.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don’t forget sun screen; especially
text: there, on the side.
text: Sylvia gives him an annoyed look.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sun can be so unforgiving to your
text: wrinkles.
text: Frankie puts the bracelet back on, as Sylvia exits.
text: Frankie is now alone with her son Paul. She goes to the
text: bathroom mirror and starts putting some makeup on. Paul
text: follows her.
text: The conversation that follows, as will all between French
text: mother and son, is in FRENCH.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Je me sens hyper malhereux.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Bah oui bien sir.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Merci pour 1’ironie!
dialog: Frankie doesn’t need much.
dialog: eyeliner, lipstick.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm so terribly unhappy.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're being ironic!
text: Moisturizing cream, and a little
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Paul, mon chéri, je suis
dialog: mieux placée que n’importe
dialog: qui pour savoir qu’elles ne
dialog: sont pas toutes roses, ces
dialog: vacances. Mais tu es jeune,
dialog: tu as la santé, tu pars vivre
dialog: @ New York dans le West
dialog: Village, et on profite d’une
dialog: des villes le plus
dialog: romantiques au monde sous un
dialog: soleil magnifique. Qu’est-ce
dialog: qu’il te faut de plus?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Je crois que je suis toujours
dialog: amoureux d’Anne-Shophie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh non pitié. Pas Possible.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Pourquoi?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Tu restes avec ces filles
dialog: deux ans. Tu n’es pas sir de
dialog: les aimer, donc elles te
dialog: quittent. Une fois qu’elles
dialog: sont parties, bingo, tu
dialog: découvres qu’en fait tu es
dialog: amoureux d’elles! Béatrice,
dialog: Julie, Anne-Sophie, et qui
dialog: encore?!... A chaque fois
dialog: c'est la méme histoire! Tu
dialog: tournes en rond, et quand ce
dialog: n'est pas ga... enfim bref.
dialog: En tous cas, il faut que tu
dialog: arrétes. Ca fait quoi,
dialog: quasiment deux ans qu’Anne-
dialog: Sophie et toi avez rompu? Tu
dialog: ne peux plus 6tre amoureux
dialog: d’elle, ce n’est pas
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Pour quelqu’un qui prétend
dialog: croire a l’amour éternel...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Eternel? Je n’irais peut-étre
dialog: pas jusque 1a.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh honey, I, more than
dialog: anyone, am aware that this
dialog: trip is not a happy event.
dialog: But, Paul, you're young and
dialog: healthy, you're moving to the
dialog: West Village in New York
dialog: City, and it is a sunny day
dialog: in one of the most romantic
dialog: cities in the world. What
dialog: else do you want?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I think I'm still in love
dialog: with Anne-Sophie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh no, please! That can not
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You stay with these girls for
dialog: two years. You're not sure
dialog: you love them, so they break
dialog: up with you. Then, after they
dialog: leave, you find out you're
dialog: actually in love! Beatrice,
dialog: Julie, Anne-Sophie! Always
dialog: the same! You're going in
dialog: circles, and if you don't -
dialog: anyway, that has to stop. You
dialog: and Anne-Sophie split up,
dialog: what - almost two years now?
dialog: You simply cannot still be in
dialog: love with her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I thought you were the one
dialog: who believed that love can
dialog: last forever.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Forever? I don't know about
dialog: that.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: En tout cas Jimmy et toi avez
dialog: l‘air plus amoureux
dialog: aujourd'hui que du temps de
dialog: votre rencontre.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Mais Paul, elle t’a quitté.
dialog: C’est absurde. Quand tu
dialog: rencontreras la femme de ta
dialog: vie, tu l’oublieras, Anne-
dialog: Sophie. Tu vas voir.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ah oui, tu parle comme tu la
dialog: connais déja, la femme de ma
dialog: vie?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You and Jimmy seem to be more
dialog: in love now then when you two
dialog: first met.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: But Paul, she left you. It's
dialog: absurd. Once you meet the
dialog: right woman, you'll forget
dialog: about Anne-Sophie. You'll
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You talk as if you knew who
dialog: the right one might be.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE FRANKIE
dialog: Eh bah oui, peut-étre. I do.
speaker_heading: PAUL PAUL
dialog: Bravo. Splendid.
scene_heading: EXT. PALACIO NATIONAL/SINTRA - DAY 10
text: ILENE BIANCHI, a great looking woman, early 50’s with
text: youthful charm, and dark, winsome eyes, pulls a small carry-
text: on bag up a street behind the historic Palace of Sintra.
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: My problem is the story. If I could
dialog: just get that right, you know? I
dialog: think I could really make something
dialog: good. Something great, even.
text: Ilene looks around as she walks, her curious and peaceful
text: eyes enchanted by the views of Sintra.
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: But I just can’t get my head around
dialog: a conventional three-act structure,
dialog: and they want that.
text: She's followed by GARY TOMLINSON, a shaggy, sandy-haired
text: American, mid 50’s, also pulling a carry-on bag.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Anyone who might finance it at
dialog: least. The first act - man, that’s
dialog: something, you know? And then the
dialog: second - isn’t that enough? A third
dialog: just seems gratuitous.
dialog: 11
dialog: 13.
text: Gary is completely uninterested in the view, but Ilene knows
text: him well, and is able to shut him out in her head. She lets
text: him talk as they keep walking up the street.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'm interested in all of it. Story
dialog: is just one part. I see geography
dialog: as destiny, you know what I mean?
dialog: I’m interested in what constitutes
dialog: intimacy, identity, community; how
dialog: we communicate... with ourselves,
dialog: with our surroundings, and how
dialog: these human constructs can be
text: rendered in image and performance.
text: As they turn a corner, the colorful Palacio da Pena, on top
text: of the hill, comes into view.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Do you think it’s crazy to think
dialog: about shooting on 35? It would be
dialog: so amazing. Ilene?
text: The view of the multi-colored fantasy castle is a wonder, and
text: Ilene pauses to take it in.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Ilene? Are you even listening to
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Wow. They were right. Looks like
text: something out of a fairy tale.
text: She looks out at the busy, beautiful town in front of her.
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STAND/SINTRA - DAY 11
text: A small group of YOUNG GIRLS in Catholic school uniform walk
text: down the street. They pass Paul, who smiles, and tries his
dialog: well-rehearsed Portuguese:
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bom dia.
text: But the girls are not interested. They don’t respond, but
text: that doesn’t faze Paul. He breathes the air of Sintra, looks
text: around at his magnificent surroundings, and it makes him feel
dialog: good.
text: Just up the street, there’s a little FLOWER STAND, displaying
text: local plants and flowers in unexpected, artful arrangements.
dialog: 14.
text: As Paul passes by, he notices the very pretty girl, BIANCA,
text: early 20's, with pale white skin, dark hair, and piercing
text: green eyes, behind the stand putting together a new
dialog: arrangement.
text: Paul slows down. He can’t believe his eyes, so he turns
text: around and, discreetly, looks back at her. There she is, like
text: a vision, putting together different plants, making artful
dialog: arrangements.
text: Paul decides to walk back.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Bom dia.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Bom dia.
text: Paul checks out the flowers, while discreetly checking out
text: the girl. He picks up an arrangement, and smells it deeply.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hmmm... The smell!
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Lavanda is the best.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Reminds me of someone.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Someone you love.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Someone I used to.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: She broke your heart?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She married somebody else.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Ah, I see.
text: She keeps working on her arrangement, while Paul chooses
dialog: another to smell.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Which one would you say is the most
dialog: sensual?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Depends on who you're buying it
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: A very beautiful girl. I think
dialog: she'd like what you like.
text: She smiles, and puts down her arrangement to go assist Paul.
text: She chooses a big bouquet, and hands it to him.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: What do you think of this one?
text: They are interrupted by the arrival of a young man, JOAO
text: MIGUEL, bringing an armful of fresh plants and flowers. He
text: senses something in the air, as Bianca goes behind the
text: counter, back to her arrangement. Paul, smelling the flowers,
text: is caught off guard.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (in scratchy Portuguese)
dialog: Quanto custa?
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Quinze. Feefteem.
text: Paul hands him a fifty Euro bill.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: No. Feefteem. One five.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry, that’s all I have.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Wait one minute. My girl goes for
dialog: change.
text: But she is back at work on her elaborate arrangement and
text: shrugs at his suggestion.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Bianca, please go get some change
dialog: for the Senor, ao restaurante.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Nao ves que estou ocupada?
dialog: Tenho que terminar isto até
dialog: ao meio dia. Vai 14 tu.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: O que 6 que se passa aqui?
dialog: Vai buscar o troco, que eu
dialog: cuido do cliente.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Estou a meio dum arranjo! Nao
dialog: vou a lado nenhum
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Estou a interromper alguma
dialog: coisa, 6?
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Don't you see that I'm busy?
dialog: I have to finish this by
dialog: noon. You can go get it.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: What I see, I don't like. Go
dialog: get change. I'll take care of
dialog: the customer.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: But I'm making a big bouquet.
dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Am I interrupting something
dialog: here? What's going on?
text: Paul watches in disbelief as the whole thing escalates to a
text: full blown argument.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Nao se passa nada!
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Eu conhego-te...
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Estas louco!
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: .+.eu vi os olhinhos que ele
dialog: te estava a deitar.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: O que 6 que estas pr’aia
dialog: dizer? Tens de comfiar mais
dialog: em mim, Joao Miguel. S6 estou
text: a vender flores.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Nothing is going on!
speaker_heading: JOAO MIGUEL
dialog: Oh, please...
speaker_heading: BIANCA

speaker_heading: MAYA

speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: MAYA

speaker_heading: ILENE (0.S.)
dialog: Jimmy!

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Yes. I’m lost.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Jimmy. It’s me, Ilene.

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I worked with Frankie in New York.
dialog: On Noah Baumbach’s movie.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ilene!
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I was her hairstylist.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Of course. I’m so sorry. What a

dialog: How wonderful!
text: He gives her a big hug.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Didn’t Frankie mention...?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Frankie talks about you all the

dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: That’s sweet. You know she’s the
dialog: only actress in all my years of
dialog: working in film that I’ve become
dialog: real friends with. But with the
dialog: distance, it can be hard to keep
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just the other day I was trying to
dialog: remember the name of that
dialog: restaurant you took us to last time
dialog: we were in New York. I wanted to
dialog: recommend it to a friend.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It was a classic American steak
dialog: house. Very good.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Keen’s! On 36th Street.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yes, that was it. Amazing.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: You liked that mutton chop, huh?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I loved that mutton chop. But was
dialog: that the last time we saw you? I
dialog: thought maybe in London, also?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: No, I haven’t been to London yet,
dialog: but I’m hoping to. It’s been a long

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And now, “lo, Cintra’s glorious

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I don’t know much about Byron, I’m
dialog: embarrassed to say, but it’s
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh, I wouldn’t know anything about
dialog: him except I had to memorize that
dialog: poem for my Leaving Certificate. He
dialog: seems to have been everywhere,
dialog: though. Every town in Europe seems
dialog: to claim him. And he had scandalous
dialog: affairs in each stop. In Greece,
dialog: they consider him a national hero.
dialog: As boys, we thought his stuff was
dialog: very sexy to read, believe it or
dialog: not. Really romantic.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Sounds like a full life...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Well, he did die very young.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Didn't they all? But wouldn’t you
dialog: rather live a life full of passion
dialog: and adventure, even if it’s short,
dialog: than go through an endless,
dialog: monotonous string of the day after
dialog: day after day?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. It’s easy to say
dialog: life is wonderful when you go from
dialog: one adventure to another, but Byron
dialog: suffered quite a lot. Anyway,
dialog: that’s not reality for most people.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Certainly not for me. I think that
dialog: to try and find beauty in everyday

speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: Star Wars??
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: It’s actually a good job.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m sure. I didn’t mean, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: No, don’t worry. Of course. But
dialog: they pay well. And for the most
dialog: part the people are nice. It’s a

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We signed a confidentiality

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ok.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know I am.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: So did you find it?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Nobody knows. I don’t understand

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Would you like a pastry?
speaker_heading: ILENE

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It’s too overwhelming.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're so...
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Pragmatic?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That’s one word for it.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Wouldn’t it be wonderful if she and

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: FRANKIE

text: Ilene sips tea, alone on the terrace of a small and
text: beautifully renovated house, a private Quinta. There’s a
text: swimming pool down below, and a view to the immense green
dialog: valley.
text: Gary comes out to join her; he’s holding something behind his
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I wasn’t expecting this. The photos
dialog: on the site don’t do it justice.
dialog: They should hire me to take new
dialog: pictures. This place is incredible.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: This is so nice, Gary. It must be
dialog: very expensive.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It's fine. George Lucas been berry
dialog: berry good to me.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: To both of us! But who knows what
dialog: the next job will be.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That's why I want to make this
dialog: movie. I can’t be a cameraman
dialog: forever. I need to change gears,
dialog: before it’s too late.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I hope so.
text: Gary pulls his hand from behind, holding a small gift box.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Here. I have something for you.
text: Ilene’s surprised. He gives her the box.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Oh, God.
text: He gives her a kiss. It’s a bit clumsy.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I hope you like it.
text: Ilene tries to smile. She wasn’t expecting this.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Open it.
text: She does. Inside the box, a silver ring, with a small detail
text: in gold. It’s a designer ring, very modern, young.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Gary, you shouldn't have done this.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Why? You said you liked it.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I know I did, but still.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I walked by the store before we
dialog: left Valencia, and it was still in
dialog: the window.
text: Ilene closes the box, with the ring inside.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I’ve been thinking?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: No. What were you thinking?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’ve been thinking I want us to
dialog: spend more time together.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yes. I had an idea of getting rid
dialog: of my apartment in the city and
text: just moving into the house in Water
dialog: Mill full time. Making a real home
dialog: out there.
text: Gary tries to look directly into Ilene’s eyes.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: You could come and stay for as long
dialog: as you wanted. And whenever one of
dialog: us is working in the city, we could
dialog: stay at your place.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: That’s a lot of plans, all of a
dialog: sudden.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We'd have a beautiful house on the
dialog: beach, and I’d help with the rent
dialog: on a nice apartment on the Upper
dialog: West Side. We’d have two homes. We
dialog: don’t need more than that. What do
dialog: you say?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Oh. I don’t know. For me Water Mill
dialog: is more like a weekend place. I
dialog: like it, but for the beach, and to
dialog: get away.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 17
dialog: 18
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: A lot of people live there full
dialog: time and still work in the city.
dialog: It’s really not very far. And
dialog: besides, with more time in Water
dialog: Mill, you could paint more, or
dialog: write, or do any of those things
dialog: you always say you'd like more time
dialog: for. Without my apartment, we'd
dialog: both save money. You wouldn’t need
dialog: to work so much.
text: Ilene looks out onto the vast view of the valley in front of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ilene, I'd like to be with you. For
dialog: us to be together.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Is this a proposal?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I didn’t think of it that way, but
dialog: I guess it is. What do you say?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I say let’s go out. We just got
dialog: here. The ring is beautiful, Gary.
dialog: Thank you. I love it. Thank you.
dialog: Now come on, get your coat, get
dialog: your camera. Let’s go. Let’s see
dialog: where we are before we plan the
dialog: future.
text: Ilene walks into the house. Gary stays with the view for
text: moment, then goes inside after her.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAMWAY - DAY 17
text: An old fashioned, open TRAM crosses a bucolic green corridor
text: of leafy trees and tall grass.
text: Later, it passes by a small town comprised almost exclusively
text: of old, small white houses.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TRAMWAY - DAY 18
text: The tram is in motion, and Maya is sitting inside, writing in
text: a small notebook. She finishes a sentence and looks out,
text: seeing the small town pass by.
dialog: 39.
text: Maya goes back to her notebook, trying to concentrate again,
text: when she’s interrupted by a couple of Portuguese boys, PEDRO
text: and BENTO, a bit older, around 16 years old, who are sitting
text: behind her. Pedro leans in.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: O que voce esta escrevendo?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (hard Portuguese accent)
dialog: Desculpa, eu nao falo...
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Yes, you do. You speak very well.
text: Maya is able to understand that he’s playing with her, and
dialog: makes a bigger effort.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Eu nao falo portugues.
dialog: They laugh.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: I see. That’s ok. What are you
dialog: writing?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Oh, it’s nothing.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Are you going to the beach?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I am.
text: She turns around, and looks at them. She sees that they carry
text: boogie boards with them.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I take it this is the right
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I’m from England, the East
dialog: Midlands, but my family moved to
dialog: London last year. You?
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: I’m from Porto, a few hours to the
dialog: North. Bento here is from Sintra.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: BENTO
dialog: I live in Sintra. Are you here on
dialog: vacation?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: BENTO
dialog: What is it then?
text: Maya avoids the question.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Hey, can I rent a boogie board on
dialog: the beach?
text: Pedro gets up and comes to sit next to Maya.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: No. But you can use mine.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: No, that’s okay.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Bento has one too. We can take
dialog: turns.
speaker_heading: BENTO
dialog: Have you ever been to Praia das
dialog: Magas?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Oh, you’re going to love it. I
dialog: can’t wait for you to see it. It’s
dialog: the most beautiful beach. Praia das
dialog: Magas. Beach of the Apples.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Are there a lot of apple trees
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: None. It’s called “Apple Beach”
dialog: because of the apple in the Bible,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: No.
dialog: 19
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: In Paradise. The temptation. The
dialog: original sin.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: The Adam and Eve apple?
speaker_heading: BENTO
dialog: Yes, that’s right.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: That’s insane.
dialog: They laugh.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: We are a very Catholic country, you

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA EUFEMIA - DAY 19
text: CARLINHOS, a 5 or 6 year old boy, comes from the woods near
text: the church, playing with a small shovel, picking up fallen
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (0.S.)
dialog: Many, many years ago, at a time
dialog: when the Barbarians dominated
dialog: Portugal, there lived in Sintra a
dialog: princess named Eufemia, who fell in
dialog: love with a nice country boy.
text: Carlinhos runs up the road, to an open area where the quaint
dialog: Church of Santa Eufemia is built.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Her father the King was a very
dialog: tough, conservative man, and
dialog: wouldn't allow the relationship
dialog: with a commoner, so they had to
dialog: stop seeing each other once and for
dialog: all.
text: Carlinhos looks at the simple church, white, with a couple of
text: small green windows, the image of a female saint on tiles to
text: the side, and a cross at the very top. It’s strikingly
dialog: beautiful in its simplicity.
speaker_heading: CARLINHOS’S MOTHER (0O.S.)
dialog: Carlinhos!! Volta!!
text: Carlinhos runs back towards his mother. We get closer to the
text: church, where Michel is standing outside, next to Tiago.
dialog: 42.
text: The back part of the church is all constructed in stone, very
text: old, with a garden and another small building in the same
dialog: style.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: One day, the princess ran into the
dialog: boy’s mother, who told her that the
dialog: boy had been struck with a very
text: painful, debilitating skin disease.
dialog: The princess -—
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Ah! Voila!
dialog: Michel waves.
text: Jimmy and Frankie are walking up a dirt road, towards the
dialog: church.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Bonjour!
text: JOANA and JOAO, two Sintra locals, carrying a picnic basket
text: and bottles of wine, walk arm in arm, a few steps ahead of
text: them. Joana looks back, discreetly towards Frankie, and
text: whispers something to her husband.
text: Michel greets Frankie, two kisses.
speaker_heading: MICHEL MICHEL
dialog: Viens, chérie. Tiago est en Come, cherie. Tiago is
dialog: train de nous raconter telling us the story of the
dialog: l'histoire de Sainte- Saint.
dialog: Euphémie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: What a beautiful church, so simple.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I told you!
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Bonjour, Tiago!
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: Bonjour, Senhora. I was telling
dialog: them that during the time of the
dialog: Barbarians--
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: It’s okay, Tiago.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (a Frankie)
dialog: La jolie princesse s’était
dialog: éprise d’un gargon du peuple
dialog: mais le Roi son pére lui
dialog: interdit de le revoir. Le
dialog: jeune homme tomba alors
dialog: gravement malade.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (to Tiago)
dialog: Just keep going.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: The disease spread
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (to Frankie)
dialog: The good princess fell in
dialog: love with a commoner and her
dialog: father forbid their affair.
dialog: The boy got sick.
dialog: all over - the
dialog: boy’s body, his whole skin, was
text: full of horrible, bloody sores. The
dialog: princess went to see the boy,
dialog: against her father’s orders, and
dialog: brought him here, where they used
dialog: to come to see the view. She washed
dialog: him in the waters from the fountain
dialog: and-
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: His skin went back to normal
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: No. Not immediately. He felt better
dialog: slowly. It took him days. Arms
dialog: first, then the legs, the face and
dialog: then--; the whole body. It was a
dialog: miracle.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: And people still come here to wash
dialog: themselves in this miraculous
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: They do, because the water is said
dialog: to cure people of all maladies.
text: Frankie knows what is going on in their minds.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Where’s the fountain?
text: Tiago points to a sign to the side.
text: Impatient, Frankie starts to walk the other way, down towards
dialog: the woods.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: 44,
dialog: Frankie! S'il te plait.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Frankie!
text: A thought disturbs Frankie; she stops midway and turns back
dialog: to respond to Jimmy and Michel.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: The two of you together...
dialog: I can’t take it.
dialog: worst combination!
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (to Michel)
dialog: Leave it.
dialog: it’s the
text: Michel puts his hands in prayer, imploring.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Frankie, please.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Arréte ton cirque, Michel.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Ce ne sont pas trois gouttes
dialog: d’eau qui vont te faire du

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Je ne crois pas a4 ces

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: D’accord, pardon. Mais s’il

dialog: arréte de prendre cet air
dialog: accablé. Je n’en peux plus de
dialog: cette téte d’enterrement.
dialog: Comme si celle de Jimmy ne me
dialog: suffisait pas. Regarde-le.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh, Michel. You're making a
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: It doesn't hurt, Frankie - to
dialog: splash a little water.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I don't believe in this shit.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Don't call it ‘shit’.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Okay, I'm sorry. But please
dialog: stop. And stop looking so
dialog: miserable. I can't put up
dialog: with the sad face. I have
dialog: enough of that with Jimmy
dialog: already. Look at him.
dialog: 20
dialog: 45.
text: They turn to look at Jimmy, who stands lost in his own
dialog: thoughts, not listening.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE FRANKIE
dialog: (a Michel) (to Michel)
dialog: Je suis 4 bout, 1a. I almost can't bear it.
speaker_heading: MICHEL MICHEL
dialog: Sois plus douce, Frankie. Be kind, Frankie. This is not
dialog: Tout ne tourne pas autour de all about you.
dialog: toi.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE FRANKIE
dialog: Ah bon? Isn't it?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I’m going to ask you both a favor:
dialog: at least pretend that you accept my
dialog: fate. For the sake of this trip,
dialog: for the family, for today, please.
text: Frankie turns around, and goes into the woods, leaving the
text: three men alone in the churchyard.
scene_heading: EXT. TAPADA DA ROMA - DAY 20
text: Frankie walks through the woods. The sunlight draws geometric
text: patterns on the ground, while playing a sometimes bright but
text: mostly dark game on Frankie’s face. What could be jarring has
text: a calming effect on her. She pauses to enjoy the sunlight on
text: her face for a moment, and then keeps going.
text: A BIG FAMILY OF LOCALS is having a picnic in an open area,
text: surrounded by a fertile garden, and connected to a modest
text: Quinta that sits on the edge of the woods. There is a picnic
text: table set up under a leafy grape arbor, and a fire burning in
text: a portable barbecue pit in the center. It’s a happy event,
text: with KIDS running around while ADULTS sit around the table
text: eating a big family meal. Among them, the couple from the
text: previous scene. Joana's face brightens up, and she sees
text: something and pokes ANTONIA, her aunt, next to her.
speaker_heading: JOANA JOANA
dialog: Nao te disse? I told you.
text: The woman recognizes Frankie immediately:
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Irma Aline. Sister Aline.
speaker_heading: JOANA
dialog: Frangoise Cremont.
dialog: 21
dialog: 46.
text: Frankie nods and smiles, acknowledging their presence, and
text: tries to keep going, but now the whole family is looking at
text: her. Antonia pours some wine in a glass.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Madame Cremont!
text: She offers the glass to Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: I'm a big fan.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: You must have good taste in movies.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: I know you from the TV.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh, sure. Let me guess-—
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Os Arquivos do Vaticano.
speaker_heading: JOANA
dialog: The Vatican Files.
text: Frankie raises her glass.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Os Arquivos do Vaticano forever!
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: It’s my mother’s birthday. She’d be
dialog: happy if you can make a toast with
dialog: us? She really identifies with your
dialog: character Sister Aline.
scene_heading: INT. SANTA EUFEMIA - DAY 21
text: Inside the simple church, Michel is sitting, his eyes closed
text: in prayer, in front of the small statue of a Saint.

dialog: 47.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA EUFEMIA - DAY 22
text: Tiago stands at the side of the church, checking his phone.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (0.S.)
dialog: You don’t really believe in all
dialog: this, do you?
text: Tiago smiles.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: I don’t know, Senhor. Whatever
dialog: helps can’t hurt you.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I guess that’s right.
text: Tiago pulls out a pack of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: You mind?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Not at all.
text: Tiago offers one from the pack to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, no, thank you.
text: Tiago lights up, and they stand together, quietly.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are you married, Tiago?
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: Yes, I am. I have a wife and a son.
dialog: They live in Braga, in the North.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I see. You’re separated then?
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: No, no, no. Just for five months a
dialog: year. I come down here for the
dialog: tourist season.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I imagine that can be difficult.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: To be honest, it is. It’s very
dialog: hard. My wife, she’s like my
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 23
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (CONT'D)
dialog: I love her, but she doesn’t even
dialog: like me sitting next to another
dialog: woman. You can imagine what it’s
dialog: like when I’m here in Sintra.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: That's why I look so tired today. I
dialog: went out to dinner with a friend
dialog: last night, another guide, and when
dialog: I called my wife later to say
dialog: “goodnight, I love you”, she
dialog: already knew where I’d been, what I
dialog: drank, and who else was at the
dialog: restaurant. It was incredible. We
dialog: stayed up for hours on the phone,
dialog: which is not good for my business.
dialog: I have to be alert, and the days
dialog: are not short, you know?
text: Tiago takes a long drag.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes I don’t even know why I
dialog: stay married.
text: Jimmy just looks at Tiago. He doesn’t know how to respond.
speaker_heading: TIAGO (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, Seflor. It’s not to
dialog: bother you. I am good. I am fine.
dialog: Shall we move on? I will go see
dialog: about your friend now, make sure we
dialog: didn’t lose him. This is not really
dialog: a place for tourists, and it’s
dialog: quite difficult to find the spot of
dialog: the “miraculous waters.”

speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Alone?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Why did you let her?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: She didn’t ask me.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I hope it’s safe.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA

speaker_heading: IAN

speaker_heading: SYLVIA

scene_heading: EXT. JARDIM DA VIGIA - DAY 26
text: Ilene walks fast, ahead of Gary, who struggles a little
text: trying to catch up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You're walking so fast. We’re not
dialog: in New York City, you know. You'd
dialog: think you’re trying to get away
dialog: from me.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I’m just a little thrown, that’s
dialog: all.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Ilene, please, slow down.
text: Gary stops, giving Ilene little option but to do so as well.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to me. I’ve spent the last
dialog: ten years of my life going wherever
dialog: work took me. I used to get so
dialog: excited about going to a new place -—
dialog: Iceland, Patagonia, Vancouver! -
dialog: but now I’m tired. Not tired, but I
text: have a strange feeling. Emptiness.
dialog: I’m home, the sun goes down, and...
dialog: I think I just feel lonely. Do you
dialog: ever feel that way?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: No. Not really. I like being by
dialog: myself. I always have, even when I
dialog: was a kid. I get home after two
dialog: months away, and I’m happy to be by
dialog: myself. I have my books, my
dialog: magazines, my kitchen, my bed, my
dialog: friends when I want them. I feel
dialog: content.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I guess I don’t. I’m not content. I
dialog: want change. I don’t want to just
dialog: continue like it’s all going to
dialog: last forever. I want to start
dialog: something new. With you. New for
dialog: both of us. We have to admit we are
dialog: in the middle, Ilene, or past the
dialog: middle. It’s not really the time to
dialog: coast, is it?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Gary, you just need to make your
dialog: own movie.
text: Ilene proceeds, starts to walk again.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No, that’s not what I need. Maybe I
dialog: will, maybe I won't.
text: They approach the end of this green, lush walkway, and
text: suddenly they’re in the middle of a road, where cars and loud
dialog: Tuk Tuk’s, ride by.
dialog: 27
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: But I’m ready to settle down,
dialog: Ilene. I love you. I love being
dialog: with you. You know I don’t care
dialog: about marriage, that’s not
dialog: important to me. But being with you
dialog: is. It is important to me. And
dialog: Water Mill could be the answer.
dialog: There’s a lot of space there. I
dialog: could turn the garage into a new
dialog: studio for me, and then you could
dialog: have the second bedroom inside all
dialog: for yourself. I would knock before
dialog: entering. I promise. What do you
dialog: say?
text: A MEGA TOURIST BUS invades the screen, and stops right ahead
text: of Gary and Ilene. It’s door open, with a mechanized, loud
dialog: oomph!
text: Ilene’s attention veers towards the CROWD of TOURISTS, who
text: descend upon the road, happy and excited.
text: A moment later, she finds herself in the middle of the crowd,
text: which seems to have multiplied itself.
text: Ilene lets herself be taken away by the movement of the
dialog: crowd.
text: Gary looks out, but soon he can’t see her anymore.

text: the middle of a conversation.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: .+.jJust as the sun rises every
dialog: morning, and the night comes at the
dialog: end of the day, I was certain
dialog: Frankie and I were going to be
dialog: together forever. So when one day
dialog: she told me she was leaving, I
dialog: wondered, how is it possible? When
dialog: we got married, I believed in those
dialog: vows. ‘Til death do us part, and
dialog: all of that.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You always were a good Catholic.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: You know, until today, I hadn't
text: been inside a church in a long
dialog: time. But yes, I was raised ina
dialog: very Catholic family.
text: They continue walking.
speaker_heading: MICHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Frankie and I were so young. And I
dialog: was scared. I didn’t know if
dialog: anything was going to work out. The
dialog: restaurant. Frankie. My
dialog: relationship to my own family. It’s
dialog: hard to remember now - we remember
dialog: mostly the fun, the exciting parts -
dialog: but it was scary to be young, no?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: You never met my father, did you?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: He was tough. He was in the
dialog: Resistance, you know, a real hero.
dialog: And a real Catholic. Marriage for
dialog: me was a life saver.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That’s not very sexy, is it?
dialog: A woman wants to feel desired, not
dialog: needed for survival.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Not just women. We do too. But at
dialog: that time, I didn’t know that. I
dialog: couldn't imagine my life without
dialog: Frankie. And yet, today I know that
dialog: her leaving was the best thing that
dialog: ever happened to me. I met Thierry.
dialog: I finally allowed myself to fall in
dialog: love with a man.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That must have felt good.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Times were different, you know. The
dialog: way I was brought up and
dialog: everything. It wasn’t easy for me,
dialog: but Thierry was very persistent.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I remember the day you called to
dialog: tell Frankie.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Frankie acted so shocked, I almost
dialog: gave her an Oscar.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That was not a performance. I was
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: But, please. She should’ve known.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She didn’t.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Amazing how people sometimes choose
dialog: not to see what’s right in front of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She told me she never knew, which
dialog: means that your performance must
dialog: have been very convincing. You
dialog: should have got the Oscar.
text: Michel laughs, then continues.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: She was very worried about Paul.
dialog: Thierry and I. How it would affect
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She’s still very worried about
dialog: Paul, but not because of you. She
dialog: can’t see him as anything but a
dialog: small child in need of constant
dialog: guidance and protection. Kids have
dialog: to be left to find their own path.
dialog: Certainly my daughter has. Sylvia
dialog: never looked at me for any
dialog: direction, even when she was a
dialog: little girl.
dialog: 58.
text: They pause. A quiet moment of reflection between them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I liked Thierry, by the way. I
dialog: really did. What happened?
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe the restaurant.
dialog: Late nights. Other men. Alcohol. We
dialog: gave it our best.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know that.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Please.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Michel.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Life takes turns, you know. Things
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don’t know what “after Frankie”
dialog: means. There’s no “after Frankie”
dialog: for me.
dialog: There’s some tension, and Tiago feels it might be better to
text: leave the two men alone.

speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: I’m going to talk to the guards,
dialog: and see if we can get inside.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: Let’s go, Jimmy.

speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Bonjour, Frankie, Frangoise. I’m
dialog: Gary. I’m here with Ilene. We
dialog: arrived this morning.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ah! You're the friend.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: She told you about me?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No, she didn’t. My husband did. I
dialog: guess you met him earlier.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Such a pleasure to meet you.
text: Frankie and Gary walk along the road, side by side, making
dialog: small talk.

speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm working with Ilene on Star
dialog: Wars. I’m the second unit DP.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: That must be a lot of work.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m tired, and thankful for this
dialog: break.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: First time in Sintra?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: First time in Portugal. We have
dialog: been shooting for almost a month
dialog: now, and when Ilene told me you
dialog: were here, I said ‘let’s go’. I'ma
dialog: big fan, you know.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I’m a fan of Ilene’s. She’s been a
dialog: good friend.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We met on another film we did
dialog: together. The Void. I was the
dialog: Principal DP on that. We’ve been
dialog: hanging out, you know.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I’m not sure what that means.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I love Ilene.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ah. That’s something.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Frankie, Ilene says. May I call you
dialog: Frankie?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: That’s what my friends call me.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You look even better in person, you
dialog: know. Do people tell you that?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: You're being kind.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No, it’s true. You know, I wanted
dialog: to talk with you about something,
dialog: if we can find the right time. I
dialog: have a film project that I want to
dialog: direct.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Your first time directing?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yes, well, no. But my first
dialog: feature. I’ve been thinking about
dialog: it for a long time. And I’ve shot
dialog: over 18 films for other people. I’m
dialog: ready to start, you know. And I
dialog: think you and I share a taste ina
dialog: certain kind of cinema. It’s about
dialog: an opera singer who loses her
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ha. That’s funny.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I think you’d be perfect for it.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I can’t sing.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: But that’s it! She loses her voice.
dialog: It’s almost like silent film
dialog: acting, and I can’t think of anyone
dialog: more expressive for the role. Like
dialog: Greta Garbo.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Or Fatty Arbuckle.
text: Gary laughs, uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Can I can send you the script?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: If you’d like. When are you
dialog: thinking of shooting this?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It’s not going to happen now. I
dialog: need a year, at least, to prepare.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: If we’re going to collaborate I
dialog: think it’s better to be up front
dialog: with you, it’s going to take time
dialog: to get it together. You know the
dialog: business. I’d say realistically it
dialog: will be a year, a year and a half,
dialog: before we start shooting.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I see.
text: Frankie takes a deep breath. They walk side by side in
text: silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You know, Frankie. I’m going to
dialog: take time off to work on this film.
dialog: I have a house in Water Mill,
dialog: that’s just under two hours from
dialog: New York, it’s a beautiful place.
dialog: I've invited Ilene to come live
dialog: with me. Don’t you think it would
dialog: be a good idea for her to settle
dialog: down a little bit? Not travel so
dialog: much. Not work so much on projects
dialog: she doesn’t really care about?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Does it matter what I think?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You know her well.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: But does it matter? If you’ve
dialog: invited her, then you should know.
dialog: Ilene is the kind of woman who'll
dialog: tell you straight to your face what
dialog: she thinks. No bullshit, Ilene. And
dialog: no bullshitters. She doesn’t have
dialog: time for people who aren’t very
dialog: real, very sincere, you know?
dialog: That's why I like her.
text: Gary doesn’t know quite how to respond.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now if you’1ll excuse me, I’m going
dialog: to go look for my son. I haven’t
dialog: seen him since the morning, and
dialog: this was meant to be a family
dialog: vacation.

dialog: silence.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAIA DAS MACAS/CLIFF - DAY 29
text: The cliffs at the end of the beach. Maya, wearing only a long
text: T-shirt over her wet beach clothes, hikes/climbs the tricky
text: part of a ledge. She places one foot on a rock, while one
text: hand tries to hold on to a higher mark on the ledge. She
text: makes sure the one foot is firm on the rock, while looking
text: for a safe step for the other foot. She climbs up for a
text: second, but not sure of her next step, strides back down.
text: That’s when a helping hand enters frame.
text: Pedro extends his arm and pulls Maya up. As she climbs, she
text: steps with the wrong foot, and falls into his arms, clumsy.
text: They smile, a bit disconcerted.
text: Maya and Pedro walk hand in hand on this rocky path high up,
text: at the end of the beach. They are away but not far from the
text: sand, surrounded by the ocean. They stop to look at the view;
text: the long golden sand beach, and on the other end, a rocky
text: cliff crowned with small, charming white houses, typical
dialog: Portuguese.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: Is that still Sintra?
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: That’s Colares, actually.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: It’s so pretty.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: I knew you would like it. If you
dialog: like, I can buy you a postcard.
text: Maya faces the view, breathing in the moment. Pedro comes
text: from behind, and puts his arms around her. She holds his
text: arms, welcoming the gesture.
speaker_heading: PEDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to come here with my parents
dialog: and my sister every summer. My
dialog: whole life, until I was thirteen.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: And then what happened.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: My parents got divorced. My
dialog: vacations were divided between time
dialog: with Mom, then time with Dad, and
dialog: there was no time left for this
dialog: Apple Beach anymore.
text: A SEAGULL flies overhead, and dives into the water. A wave
text: crashes in the ocean down below.
speaker_heading: PEDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: But then I met Bento in Lisboa last
dialog: year. We played football against
dialog: each other in a national
dialog: tournament. His school won, but we
dialog: became friends after, and he
dialog: invited me to visit him in Sintra.
text: Pedro turns Maya around. They’re face to face, and she gives
text: him a kiss. Pedro smiles, happily surprised, and soon after
text: they kiss again, this time a long, slow one, both discovering
dialog: the pleasure of each other’s mouths.
speaker_heading: PEDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a confession. The real story
dialog: of this Apple Beach has nothing to
dialog: do with Adam and Eve. I’m sorry.
dialog: Can I tell you?
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: It’s okay. If you'd like.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: They say that the Ribeira River,
dialog: over there, used to carry down
dialog: apples from the farms in Colares
dialog: all the way to the coast, and they
dialog: would end on the beach down here.
dialog: But the thing is, I’ve never seen
dialog: one single apple tree in Colares,
dialog: so I don’t believe this story.
dialog: There aren't any apple farms in
dialog: Colares.
text: For Maya, he talks too much. She kisses him again.
text: After another long moment, he pulls away, and looks at her
dialog: with near wonder.
speaker_heading: PEDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: When can I see you again?
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: (laughing)

speaker_heading: FRANKIE

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Take more.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It's not like that. I have to
dialog: talk to Dr. Bernhard. They're
dialog: very strong, you know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So what? At this point.
text: Paul talked without thinking, and his comment hits Frankie
text: the wrong way. Her eyes tear up, and she looks away, trying

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Excuse-moi Maman.
dialog: vraiment désolé.
dialog: Je suis

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't want this.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It's worth at least twenty

dialog: later. Just put it away
dialog: somewhere very safe. Then in

dialog: yours. No one will know the
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't want it.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Maybe your future wife will

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'd first need to find a

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: New York can be very

speaker_heading: PAUL

dialog: histoire de trust dont a
dialog: parlé Sylvia. L’argent, c’est
dialog: ton domaine. De quoi il
dialog: s'agit?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Pour ga il faudrait qu’on
dialog: prenne rendez-vous avec un
dialog: avocat, quelqu’un qui
dialog: maitrise vraiment le sujet.
dialog: Ca ne se régle pas comme ga
dialog: et on n’est pas obligés de
dialog: parler de droits de
dialog: succession maintenant. Si on
dialog: est en vacances c’est
dialog: justement pour oublier tout
dialog: ga.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: C’est pourtant vité réglé.
dialog: Tout ce que j’ai, c’est
dialog: l’‘appartement de Paris. Je
dialog: l’ai déja mis en vente, et
dialog: j’ai l’intention de léguer ce
dialog: que je vais en tirer au
dialog: Conservatoire.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ah bon? Tu leur en fais don?
dialog: Et Jimmy, il le sait déja?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Mais, oui. Bien sir. Toi, tu
dialog: n’as pas besoin de moi. Tu me
dialog: l‘'as déja parfaitement fait
dialog: comprendre. Jimmy s’est trés
dialog: bien débrouillé, il a mis ce
dialog: qu’il lui faut de cdté.
dialog: Sylvia peut compter sur Ian.
dialog: Je suis stire qu’il a gagné
dialog: encore plus d’argent que toi.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: There's something else we
dialog: need to talk about. This
dialog: incorporating idea of
dialog: Sylvia's. Money is your
dialog: business. What is she talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I think we should just set up
dialog: a meeting with a lawyer,
dialog: someone who really
dialog: understands the situation.
dialog: These things are complicated.
dialog: We don't need to talk
dialog: inheritance taxes while we're
dialog: here. It's a vacation from
dialog: all of that.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Not much to talk about. All I
dialog: have is the apartment in
dialog: Paris. I've already put it on
dialog: the market. I intend to
dialog: donate the proceeds to the
dialog: Conservatoire.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Really? You're giving it
dialog: away? Does Jimmy know?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yes. Of course. You don't
dialog: need me. You've made that
dialog: perfectly clear. And Jimmy's
dialog: saved plenty from his own
dialog: work. There's more than
dialog: enough there. And Ian will
dialog: take care of Sylvia. I'm sure
dialog: he's made even more than you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sirement. Je ne suis pas en
dialog: train de me plaindre, Maman.
dialog: Je n’ai aucune envie de vivre
dialog: a Paris. Si tu veux faire don
dialog: de l’appartement, vas-y.
dialog: Simplement... je suis
dialog: surpris. Il vaut tant que ga
dialog: de toute fagon?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: J’'en demande trois millions.
dialog: Tu connais le quartier.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: A mon avis tu te trompes.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ne me dis pas que je me
dialog: trompe. Tu n’as pas a me
dialog: rabaisser comme ga. Ca n’est
dialog: vraiment pas nécessaire. Et
dialog: ensuite le Conservatoire
dialog: s'est engagé a créer une
dialog: bourse Frangoise Cremont pour
dialog: les apprentis comédiens.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ah d’accord...
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Je sais que c’est vaniteux de
dialog: ma part. Mais c’est ga que je
dialog: veux, et je prends mes
dialog: dispostions en conséquence.
dialog: J'ai besoin que tu t’assures
dialog: qu’ils le feront bien. Tu
dialog: peux me promettre de t’en
dialog: occuper, Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Qu’ils feront bien quoi?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Qu’ils créeront bel et bien
dialog: cette bourse!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Non mais arréte, 1a! On
dialog: dirait que tu parles d’une
dialog: bande d’escrocs.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm sure. I'm not
dialog: complaining, Maman. I don't
dialog: want to live in Paris anyway.
dialog: It's fine for you to give the
dialog: apartment away. I'm just...
dialog: I'm surprised. Is the
dialog: apartment really worth that
dialog: much money anyway?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I'm asking three million. You
dialog: know the neighborhood.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I think you're mistaken.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Don't tell me I'm mistaken.
dialog: Don't put me down like that.
dialog: It's not necessary. It's not.
dialog: And the school has promised
dialog: they would set up a Frangoise
dialog: Cremont Scholarship for young
dialog: actors.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ah. I see.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It's vanity, I know. But I
dialog: want it, and I'm planning for
dialog: it now. I need you to make
dialog: sure they do it. Can you
dialog: promise me that, Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They do what?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Set up the scholarship!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, please. They're not
dialog: crooks.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Quant au reste, il n’y a pas
dialog: grand-chose. Je le donne au
dialog: fur et a mesure.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: The rest, there's not much.
dialog: I'm giving it away as I go.
text: Paul looks at the bracelet again. This time, the light hits
text: it’s precious stones, and it shines brighter: it seems to
dialog: hold more value than just a few seconds before.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Tu as vu Ilene?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: C’est qui Ilene?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Mon amie Ilene. Elle est
dialog: arrivée.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ilene. Celle dont tu parles
dialog: tous le temps.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oui. Mon amie chef-coiffeuse.
dialog: Elle a énormement de talent.
dialog: Et puis elle est maligne
dialog: comme tout, et elle me fait
dialog: rire. Je suis stire qu’elle te
dialog: plairait.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Elle habite & New York...
dialog: Frankie nods.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Et elle n’a pas de mec.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ah ga, je n’en sais rien.
dialog: Mais elle est trés jolie.
dialog: Elle est beaucoup plus jeune
dialog: que moi.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Et comme par hasard elle
dialog: débarque a Sintra en méme
dialog: temps que nous.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Have you seen Ilene yet?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who's Ilene.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: My friend Ilene. She's here.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ilene. The one you always
dialog: talk about.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yes. My hair stylist friend.
dialog: She's so talented. Smart, she
dialog: makes me laugh. I am sure
dialog: you'd really like her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She lives in New York.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And she's single.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Ah, that-- I don't know. But
dialog: she's very pretty. She's much
dialog: younger than me, you know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And she happens to be in
dialog: Sintra at the same time that
dialog: we are here.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Elle traville en Espagne.
dialog: C’est juste a cdté.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: C’était censé étre des
dialog: vancances en famille!
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Elle est sur le tournage du
dialog: nouveau Star Wars. C’est
dialog: énorme! Donc tu vois, quand
dialog: je te dis qu’elle est
dialog: douée...
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: She's working in Spain,
text: around the corner.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This was supposed to be a
dialog: family vacation!
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: She's on the new Star Wars
dialog: movie. It's a major job.
dialog: Shows you how good she is.
text: All of a sudden, the bracelet feels heavy on Paul’s hand.
text: He’s clearly very upset, and he tosses the bracelet up and
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: C’est marrant. La plupart des
dialog: méres trouvent que personne
dialog: n’est jamais assez bien pour
dialog: les fils.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Je ne sais pas de quelles
dialog: méres tu parles. Pas la
dialog: mienne en tout cas. Du moment
dialog: qu’il était un homme et pas
dialog: juif, elle était ravie. Ca
dialog: lui était méme égal qu’il
dialog: soit homo.
text: They pause, angry.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Paul, toute ta vie je t’ai
dialog: toujours donné tout ce que tu
dialog: as voulu, et pourtant tu n’es
dialog: jamais content de rien. Rien
dialog: ne te suffit jamais. Aucune
dialog: femme. Aucun homme. Aucune
dialog: mére. Aucun pére.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Funny. For most mothers,
dialog: there is never anyone good
dialog: enough for their sons.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I don't know what mothers you
dialog: are talking about. Not my
dialog: mother. As long as he was a
dialog: man and he wasn't a Jew, she
dialog: was perfectly happy. She
dialog: didn't even care if he was a
dialog: homosexual.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Paul, I've given you
dialog: everything you've ever wanted
dialog: your whole life, and yet you
dialog: are never satisfied with
dialog: anything. Nothing is enough
dialog: for you. No woman. No man. No
dialog: mother. No father.
text: In one quick gesture, Paul throws the bracelet away, far away
dialog: down the hill.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Paul?! Mais tu es malade??
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Paul?! Are you crazy??
dialog: 31
dialog: 73.
text: Paul turns around and walks away from his mom, furious.
text: Frankie takes off, goes running down the hill, dropping the
text: bouquet of flowers behind her.
scene_heading: EXT. RUA RIGUEIRINHO - DAY 31
text: Paul is still fuming, walking with firm, fast steps, when he
text: runs into Sylvia.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There you are.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Yes, I’m late. I’m meeting Ian for
dialog: lunch in town.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I just came from talking with
dialog: Frankie.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The level of manipulation is beyond
dialog: anything I can fully explain. And
dialog: by the way, she’s selling the Paris
dialog: apartment, so don’t get your hopes
dialog: up. She’s getting all her ducks in
dialog: a row, as the Americans say. You
dialog: knew she would leave nothing to
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: What do you mean she’s selling the
dialog: apartment?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It’s already on the market, and
dialog: she’s made up her mind. She's
dialog: leaving everything she’s got to the
dialog: Conservatoire, which is not much,
dialog: it turns out, besides the
dialog: apartment.
text: The news stops Sylvia cold in her tracks. She leans on the
text: ancient, moss covered rail wall that accompanies the road.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Seriously? That’s absurd.
dialog: 32
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She worked her whole life. She can
dialog: do whatever she wants with her
dialog: money. And what she wants is to be
dialog: remembered. She’s setting up the
dialog: Frangoise Cremont Scholarship Fund
dialog: for poor and needy actresses.
dialog: That’s what she wants. I’m sorry
dialog: her death won’t help you leave your
dialog: boring husband, but I quite like
dialog: the idea.
text: Sylvia picks up her pace, walking fast away from Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sylvia. Sylvia!
scene_heading: EXT. SEQUOIAS ROAD - DAY 32
text: Ilene walks by herself in the woods. This is a more
text: primitive, more chaotic part of the hills. The trees are
text: taller, their canopies denser, and the light struggles to
text: reach the ground. Ilene allows herself to get lost in the
text: colors, the shades and light of nature.
text: A sound brings Ilene’s attention back to the earth. She looks
text: to the side, behind a bush, and sees a woman on all fours,
text: sweeping fallen leaves around with her hands.
text: It’s Frankie, combing through the foliage, looking for
text: something. A shiny point a few feet away makes her frantic
text: for a second, until she realizes it’s nothing but an ordinary
text: rock. She looks up, and sees Ilene.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: What did you lose now, Frankie
dialog: darling?
text: Ilene extends her hand, but Frankie isn’t ready to get up
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: If you stumble upon a Bulgari
dialog: bracelet, it’s mine.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Emeralds, rubies and diamonds.
text: Ilene goes down on the ground and looks around her, and so
dialog: does Frankie. They can’t find anything.
dialog: 75.
text: They’re both on all fours, now face to face, and they start
dialog: laughing.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I’m not.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: My stupid son.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: It’s the only one I have. Help me
dialog: up here. I’ve looked everywhere
dialog: already.
text: Ilene gets up, and extends her hand. Frankie holds it, and as
text: she gets up, she falls into Ilene’s arms.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Oh Ilene. It’s so good to see you.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: It’s good to see you.
text: Frankie’s face looks more pale than normal. Her eyes lose
text: sight, her lips lose their color. She feels suddenly dizzy.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I’m okay.
text: Frankie tries to stay up, but her legs get weak.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me.
text: Ilene rushes to hold her friend, but as she does, Frankie
text: starts to fall down.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Frankie!
dialog: 33
dialog: 76.
text: Ilene still tries to hold her up, but once she notices it’s
text: serious, and Frankie is actually falling, she lets her to the
text: ground, carefully, holding her head so it doesn’t hit
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: ILENE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God. Frankie!
text: Frankie lies on the ground, as her eyes roll back, and the
text: muscles in her body jerk rhythmically for a second. Ilene
text: stands back, desperate, unsure of what to do.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY 33
text: Ian and Sylvia sit at a restaurant in the city of Sintra.
text: He’s served a salad by the WAITER, while Sylvia picks on
text: bread and butter at the table.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You're not going to eat?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I’m not very hungry.
text: Ian digs into his meal.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll have a glass of wine. Waiter!
text: The Waiter comes back, while Sylvia is looking at the menu.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the waiter)
text: A glass of Planalto, por favor.
text: The waiter takes the menu, and leaves.
text: Ian looks down at his plate, and sticks his fork into a big
text: chunk of lettuce.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Regardless of what I feel, and of
dialog: what I think you feel, we have a
dialog: home and an amazing daughter,
dialog: and... maybe it’s my personality, I
dialog: don’t know... I didn’t grow up like
dialog: you. All of you. I don’t have the
dialog: same expectations maybe. I’d like
dialog: to think that our life together,
dialog: our family, is the most important
dialog: thing.
dialog: 77.
text: Sylvia wasn’t expecting this. She takes a sip of Ian’s white
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Of course I can fantasize once ina
dialog: while what my life would be like if
dialog: I had made different choices.
dialog: That’s normal. It’s human. But
dialog: actually going through a divorce?
dialog: It hasn't crossed my mind.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Never?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Well, I can’t say the same.
text: They sit in a silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: So then you must know that there’s
dialog: only one ‘ground’ for divorce under
dialog: British law, which is that the
dialog: marriage has irretrievably broken
dialog: down. Five facts may constitute
dialog: this ground: adultery, unreasonable
dialog: behavior, two years separation, if
dialog: both parties consent; five years
dialog: separation, if only one party
dialog: consents, and two years desertion.
text: Ian pauses, and eats a small bite of his meal.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I've been faithful to you, Sylvia.
dialog: It would take a long, very
dialog: expensive legal battle to try and
dialog: prove unreasonable behavior on my
dialog: part, which I think would be your
dialog: only possible path.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I never thought about getting into
dialog: a battle with you.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: So I’m glad we’re having this
dialog: conversation, because I wouldn't
dialog: just let you go, Sylvia. You’d have
dialog: to take me to a court of law,
dialog: that’s what it would take.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: God, you did more research than I
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Of course I did. I called a lawyer.
dialog: What do you expect me to do? He
dialog: made some calculations for me.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Calculations!
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I like to be prepared. You must
dialog: have made calculations, yourself,
dialog: but this is what we came up with.
dialog: In the unlikely event that you are
dialog: granted a decree Absolute, since
dialog: you don’t have a salary, your
dialog: alimony would get you, according to
dialog: our calculations, a one bedroom in
dialog: Upper Edmonton, maybe a two bed/one
dialog: bath in Lower Edmonton.
text: The Waiter arrives with Sylvia's glass of white wine.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: That’s where Maya’s kick boxing
dialog: instructor lives.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Is she the Bolivian?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Then, maybe. That would make sense.
dialog: I hear Lower is very popular among
dialog: South American immigrants.
text: Sylvia takes a sip of her wine, and gets up.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: I’m going to go.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You don’t want to go with me to
dialog: pick up Maya?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: No. I want to go see the Regaleira.
dialog: 34
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You want to go see the Regaleira. I
dialog: see. What is the Regaleira, may I
dialog: ask?
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: It doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: No, that’s right. You’re right,
dialog: Sylvia. It doesn’t matter.

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Has this happened before?
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I have one of these every other day
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: But I thought you were fine.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: I was. After the treatment, I had
dialog: two years completely cancer free. I
dialog: went back to work, and it was
dialog: great. I made two films, back to
dialog: back, in England and in France.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: You told me you were exhausted.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Yes, but only because it was a long

text: Gary smiles politely, as the Old Man and the dog pass by.
text: And now, with the dog’s bark far away, there is a strong
text: silence surrounding Gary. He can hear the trees move, and the
text: wind, with piercing clarity. He is alone with himself in this
dialog: beautiful place, in Sintra.
scene_heading: EXT. QUINTA DA BOICA - DAY 37
text: Ilene comes out of the house, onto the terrace. She takes in
text: the view of the lush valley below, a moment on her own to
text: reflect on the tough news of the day.
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: Ilene!
text: It’s Gary, coming towards her, from the front gate of the
dialog: Quinta.
text: As he approaches her, Ilene walks towards him and,
text: unexpectedly, she falls into his arms.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh, baby.
text: Gary, surprised by her emotions, tightens his embrace.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, honey, sweet girl. Don’t worry.
dialog: It’s okay. It’s okay.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: It’s not...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Shhh...You don’t need to say
dialog: anything.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: When I came here... I wasn’t
dialog: expecting so much.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I know. Me either. This place is
dialog: really more to dream than to talk
dialog: about.
text: She looks at him with compassion.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know if it’s the mountain
dialog: air, or these beautiful
dialog: surroundings, I don’t know... but I
dialog: realized today that love is all
dialog: that matters. Not money. Not jobs,
dialog: or movies. Or even companionship. I
dialog: know it’s cliché, but for the first
dialog: time I understand it’s only love
dialog: that matters.
text: Ilene listens intently. This is turning out differently than
dialog: she expected.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to leave, Ilene.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: But we still have a couple days
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I know we do, but I’1l stay in
dialog: Lisbon for a night or two. It’s
dialog: supposed to be a great town.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Gary, I’m sorry-
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: There’s no need to apologize. My
dialog: feelings for you... if it’s not
dialog: reciprocal, it’s silly to pretend.
dialog: I’m too old for that. Besides, I
dialog: understand how much you value your
dialog: independence. Stay here and enjoy
dialog: your friends. That’s what you came
dialog: here for.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Gary, when you shoot your film,
dialog: I’1l come work on it.
dialog: 38
dialog: 39
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No, I don’t think that’s a good
dialog: idea anymore. I hope you
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Oh. Of course I do. I understand.
text: Gary turns to go.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I should go pack. I have a car
dialog: coming soon.
text: He goes into the house, leaving Ilene alone on the terrace.
scene_heading: INT. QUINTA DE SAO THIAGO/FRANKIE & JIMMY’S SUITE - DAY 38
dialog: 
text: In her hotel room, Frankie is sleeping. Her pale white skin
text: barely covering the veins below, she looks fragile,
text: vulnerable, and so different than she has throughout.
text: Jimmy sits in a chair by the bed, watching her closely,
text: listening to every movement, every breath.
text: After a long moment, he stands, and starts to take off his
text: clothes. He carefully hangs his pants on the back of a chair,
text: then his shirt on a hanger.
text: He goes to the bed, and gets in beside Frankie. Then he
text: turns, and puts his arms around her.
text: She feels his body close to hers, and turns towards him.
text: They start to make love, quietly, passionately.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAVESSA DE SANTA MARIA - DAY 39

speaker_heading: MICHEL (0.S.)
dialog: Ilene!
text: Michel approaches, followed by Tiago and Paul.
speaker_heading: MICHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think you have met my son,
dialog: Paul.
text: Introductions are made, they exchange handshakes.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: MICHEL (CONT'D)
dialog: We were going to go get some coffee
dialog: and patisserie. Do you want to come
dialog: with us?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: No, thank you. But I’m planning to
text: meet Frankie later. At the top.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: Peninha.
speaker_heading: MICHEL
dialog: (to Ilene)
dialog: Yes, good, then we’ll see you
dialog: there.
text: They come to a split in the road.
speaker_heading: TIAGO
dialog: It’s this way.
text: Tiago and Michel take the turn, but Paul hesitates behind.
speaker_heading: PAUL PAUL
dialog: Papa, je vous rejoins. Papa, I'll catch up with you.
speaker_heading: MICHEL MICHEL
dialog: Oui oui, bien sir. Prends ton Of course, of course. Take

dialog: your time.
text: They disappear, leaving Ilene and Paul alone. They begin to
dialog: walk together.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I hear you’re moving to New York.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And you live there, is that right?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Twenty three years. Do you know
dialog: where in the city you’re going to
dialog: be living?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I thought your mother told me you
dialog: had a found a place already.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My mother thinks she knows
dialog: everything. She has all these
dialog: plans, you know.
speaker_heading: ILENE
text: Of course. She’s in a hurry.
text: Paul seems a bit surprised at Ilene’s comment.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So you know.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Yes. I’m so sorry. If ever you need
dialog: anything-
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We'll be fine by ourselves, thank
dialog: you.
text: Ilene is taken aback.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: You know your mother invited me
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know she did. She wanted us to
dialog: meet. She’s afraid I’m going to end
dialog: up alone in New York City.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Maybe she just wanted to see me.
dialog: Frankie and I are good friends, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can I tell a story, about Frankie?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I’m not sure I want to hear it,
dialog: Paul. It’s not necessary.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: But I want you to hear it. It will
dialog: help you understand our family a
dialog: little better. You see, Jimmy's
dialog: always had a thing for Portugal.
dialog: We’re all thankful to him for that.
dialog: It’s a gift he gave us: Portugal.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is probably our fifth or sixth
dialog: time to come here together. And
dialog: Sintra particularly, you know they
dialog: came here on their honeymoon, don’t
dialog: you? That is their second
dialog: honeymoon. They had each had others
dialog: before. But when my mom first
dialog: started seeing him, he took us on a
dialog: trip to the Algarve. Have you been?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Praia da Falésia, beautiful beach
dialog: south of here, and twenty years
dialog: ago, before the Portugal
dialog: renaissance, or destruction,
dialog: depending on who’s talking, it was
text: almost deserted. Really gorgeous.
dialog: Mom, Jimmy, and Sylvia, his
dialog: daughter Sylvia. Have you met,
dialog: Sylvia?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: No, I haven’t.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She's lovely, a little damaged, but
dialog: lovely. We all went to the Algarve
dialog: together. Mom had moved to London,
dialog: but only for a short time, for a
dialog: film, but clearly she and Jimmy
dialog: were also testing the waters, for
dialog: the new family to be. A family
dialog: vacation was decided, and off we
dialog: went. I barely spoke any English at
dialog: the time. I was just your average
dialog: French schoolboy, so as you can
dialog: imagine I was very nervous.
text: Excited, but nervous. Particularly
dialog: because of Sylvia. I had met her a
dialog: couple of times, and, really, you
dialog: might not know it now, but she was
dialog: the most beautiful girl ever. She
dialog: was, she is - a few years older
dialog: than me. I was maybe fifteen, and
dialog: she was eighteen or nineteen. She
text: had a woman’s body already. A
dialog: beautiful body. When I saw her in a
dialog: bikini, oh my God... And I was such
dialog: a boy! Anyway, it was summer, and
dialog: hot, and she and I would spend the
dialog: whole day on the beach together.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I don’t need to go on. You
dialog: get the picture, right?
text: Ilene doesn’t answer. Paul continues.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: One night, Mom and Jimmy went out
dialog: to dinner, and we said, Sylvia and
dialog: I, we were going to stay home, and
dialog: watch TV. They were showing the
dialog: movie Grease on TV. You remember.
dialog: (sings Summer Lovin’)
dialog: Tell me more, tell me more, did you
dialog: get very far.
text: Ilene chuckles.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what got into me,
dialog: because I was actually a very shy
text: boy, pimples, and skinny, and very
dialog: uncomfortable, but I got up and I
text: started to imitate John Travolta.
dialog: I grabbed Sylvia so we could dance
dialog: together, and she screamed! Not
dialog: because she didn’t want to. No, she
dialog: was sun burned. And so, naturally,
dialog: I offered to put some lotion on her
text: shoulders. She took her shirt off.
text: A GIRL trotting on a HORSE comes their way, following a
text: BLONDE TRAINER, who holds the reins of her horse with white
dialog: gloves.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: When my mom and Jimmy came back, we
dialog: were having sex on the couch. Me
dialog: and my soon-to-be step sister.
text: The riders come fast, and Paul and Ilene have to make space
dialog: for them to pass by on the road.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: As you can imagine, that was the
dialog: end of this new family idea. I was
dialog: sent back to live with Michel in
dialog: Paris. And my mother moved to
dialog: London. To live with Jimmy and
dialog: Sylvia. And that was that.
dialog: Ilene takes it in.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: You see, in Portugal, I lost my
dialog: mother once already. It only seems
dialog: fitting that I’m here again now.
text: He stops, and looks at Ilene more closely.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: She's right about one thing: you
dialog: are very attractive, you know.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Is that a compliment?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe. My mother would like us to
dialog: get married.
text: Ilene is silent.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think you are the marrying
dialog: type?
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Not to you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn’t think so.
text: An uncomfortable moment between them.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: When are you moving?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don’t know now. Everything is a
dialog: bit up in the air, as you can
dialog: imagine, scheduling-wise.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: If it was soon, I would have been
dialog: happy to introduce you to a few
dialog: people in New York, but I don’t
dialog: think I’ll be there all that much
dialog: longer.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh no. Pity!
dialog: 40
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Yes. I got an offer to work on a
dialog: series, in London, in fact, for the
dialog: BBC. I need a break from New York -
dialog: I’ve been there too long.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I was so looking forward to telling
dialog: your mother, but now I can’t. I
dialog: just can’t.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes, I understand.
text: They stand for a moment, together. Nothing more to be said,
dialog: it seems.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to go now, and catch up
dialog: with my father.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Ok. I’m sure I will see you later.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes, I’m sure we will.
text: Paul walks off, back in the direction of Michel and Tiago. A
text: few feet away, he turns, and calls out to Ilene.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ilene.
text: She turns and stops.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you for listening.

dialog: ways.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAIA DAS MACAS/BEACH - DAY 40
text: It’s still bright on the beach, but the sunlight is more
text: gentle, casting long shadows as it approaches the horizon.
text: Some seagulls fly above the surf, only to dive in head on,
text: hunting for fish. On the sand, only a few groups of families
dialog: or friends, not as crowded as before.
dialog: 4l
dialog: 93.
text: Maya and Pedro come walking along the surf, side by side.
text: They don’t hold hands, but walk very close to each other, in
text: silence, watching the waves break. Each is very aware of the
text: other’s body next to them; as Maya’s arm swings, it gently
text: rubs Pedro's, and she prolongs the moment, feeling his skin
text: against hers, extending a finger so it can hold his finger
text: for a brief moment, playfully, romantic.
text: Pedro looks at Maya, as they continue their stroll on the
text: sand, too self conscious to hold hands, but full of desire.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAIA DAS MACAS/BEACH - DAY 4l
text: A GROUP OF EIGHT BOYS and TWO GIRLS sit in a circle on the
text: sand, with towels, backpacks, beer bottles and cigarettes
text: scattered all around. All attention is on Bento, Pedro’s
text: buddy from the tram, who reads from a notebook.
speaker_heading: BENTO
dialog: “What is love if not blazing
dialog: flames? I asked Grandpa, will he
dialog: ever get over losing Frankie. Will
dialog: he ever let go. “You’re asking the
dialog: wrong question”, he said. “It’s not
dialog: about getting over, or letting go.”
dialog: He put his arm around me, and I
dialog: wondered how this could possibly be
dialog: about anything else. “It’s about
dialog: honoring what happened,” he said.
dialog: “You met a person that awoke
dialog: something in you. A fire ignited.”
text: There’s laughter all around. Bento continues.
speaker_heading: BENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: “The work is to be grateful.
dialog: Grateful everyday that someone
dialog: crossed your path and left a mark
dialog: on you.” When Grandpa left, I
dialog: looked at my reflection on the
dialog: water, and wondered; who will be
dialog: the one to ignite this fire inside
dialog: of me?”
dialog: (comments )
dialog: Wow!!
text: More laughter, louder. Bento can’t see that, behind him, Maya
text: and Pedro are approaching. He continues to read:

dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: BENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: “And when it happens, I want to
dialog: hold him and kiss him, our bodies
dialog: melting into each other, our hearts
dialog: beating as one.”
text: Maya can still hear the last words. She recognizes her words,
text: and jumps in to grab the diary from Bento’s hands.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: What are you doing??
text: Caught by surprise, Bento tosses the book to another friend,
dialog: and this friend to another.
text: Maya runs around, trying to grab it from them.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: (in Portuguese)
dialog: Stop it! Guys!
text: When one of the BOYS plays with Maya, swinging the book
text: around her face like bait, and then tossing it away to
text: another friend, the unexpected happens: Maya pushes the boy
text: hard, and he falls to the sand.
text: Maya dives ready to fight some more. It’s a complete
text: surprise, and the boys try to hold her back. Some of them
dialog: laugh.
text: Pedro gets into the mix, and a fight amongst them ensues.
text: There’s a scream, and laughter, punches and sand throwing all
dialog: around.
text: The book falls on the sand, and Maya immediately grabs it.
text: She then grabs her backpack and walks away. Pedro pushes one
text: of the boys who continues to laugh, and they fight on the
text: sand. Through an arm lock from the boy, he sees Maya going
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: PEDRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Maya!

text: Her hands glide through the different keys with the ease of
dialog: someone who’s trained, but not a professional. She makes a

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Don’t be. It’s sad. It’s very sad,

speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: No, I’m going to go for a walk, if

scene_heading: EXT. SEQUOIAS ROAD - DAY 48
text: Leaving the woods behind, Frankie walks onto the road where,
dialog: earlier, she had her argument with Paul.
text: After she takes a few steps on the road, she sees something
dialog: that makes her pause.
text: In front of her, the beaten up bouquet of flowers is still on

dialog: How did you find Frankie?
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: ILENE

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: ILENE

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Did someone famous say that?
dialog: Jimmy laughs.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, just me.
speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: I guess it’s true. I have to be
dialog: true to myself. But now I admit I
dialog: regret it a little. It means I'll
dialog: have to start up again that phase
dialog: of drinks and meals, and dates with
dialog: men I hardly know. I’m starting to
dialog: think maybe I’m too old for it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Careful there. If you’re old, what
dialog: am I.
speaker_heading: ILENE

speaker_heading: ILENE
dialog: Maybe. I’ve always loved New York.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why not?

text: On top of the hill, Frankie moves slowly along a terrace
text: outside the abandoned sanctuary, a yellow building with
text: crumbling walls. The wind blows and a mist surrounds her, as
text: she walks along. But Frankie is paying no attention to
text: nature. Instead, she is observing the scene taking place
dialog: below.
text: FRANKIE’S POV: Frankie sees Jimmy and Ilene. They look good
dialog: together, and there’s a lightness in Jimmy we haven’t seen
dialog: before.
text: The wind blows a strong gust, and Frankie has to hold the
text: fragile wooden rail hard.
text: FRANKIE’S POV: Jimmy takes his jacket off, and puts it over
text: Ilene’s shoulders.
text: She is an unexpected witness to this gentle action, and the
dialog: future that it might herald.
scene_heading: EXT. PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 52
text: At another spot on the hill, Michel stands with his
text: binoculars to his eyes. He drops them, and we can see in his
text: face that he has seen everything.
scene_heading: EXT. PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 53
text: Paul is walking up the road, when he passes by the ruins of
text: an old house. He slows down when he sees a COUPLE making out
text: against the walls.
dialog: 54
dialog: 55
dialog: 102.
text: The hands of the WOMAN caress the back of the MAN’s head. She
text: is wearing a shiny bracelet.
text: Paul comes closer. He can’t believe his eyes, but there’s no
dialog: mistake: this is Frankie’s bracelet, on this woman’s wrist,
text: as she strokes her man’s head.
text: The couple is suddenly aware of Paul’s presence, and they
text: pull apart. They are the flower sellers, Bianca and her
dialog: boyfriend Joao Miguel, who were last seen fighting earlier
text: on. They see Paul, and decide to leave.
text: Paul keeps on his way, but turns around to catch a glimpse of
text: the couple walking hand in hand, going down the road. The
text: Vendor steals a kiss on the Bianca’s neck, while she laughs,
dialog: very much in love.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. PENINHA SANCTUARY/ABANDONED CHAPEL - DAY 54
dialog: 
text: We see a small chapel perched on top of the hillside.
text: Frankie is inside, an abandoned ruin made of stone walls and
text: wooden floors. Instead of doors and windows, just their gaps
dialog: between walls.
text: It’s dark, quiet and there’s nothing to see, like a death
text: chamber. Frankie touches the walls, feeling the rock, and
text: listening to her own footsteps. She sees a stream of water
text: running down the old wall. She extends her hand, and feels
text: the water on her skin.
text: Outside, a few clouds fly by against the still blue sky,
text: taken by strong winds.
text: Frankie hears a sound, and in the rear of the chapel, almost
text: in darkness, she sees Tiago, with his cell phone and a lit
dialog: cigarette.
text: He and Frankie look at each other for a moment, warily, and
text: then Frankie starts moving slowly, leaving the Sanctuary, and
text: heading towards the light outside.
scene_heading: EXT. PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 55
text: Frankie walks outside the chapel, and onto a rocky pasture.
text: The wind blasts and a cloud blows intermittently against the
text: sky. She tightens up her jacket, protecting herself against a
dialog: sudden chill.
text: She walks ahead, to the edge of the cliff in front of her,
text: and the long drop below.
dialog: 103.
text: Frankie looks out to the sea. Time stops for long moment.
text: And then she turns to see what’s behind her.
text: Coming to meet her from different directions are Jimmy and
text: Ilene, and Paul. Not far are Ian and Sylvia, with Maya behind
text: them. In the rear is Michel, with Tiago helping him navigate
dialog: the rocks and the climb.
text: And then, as if always, Jimmy is beside Frankie. He puts his
text: arm around her. She feels his presence, his body, his weight,
dialog: and then -- before the others have even fully arrived to see
text: the view -- Frankie is ready to go, ready to continue.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: On y va?
text: And without pause or hesitation, she leads Jimmy and the rest
text: back towards the town, back towards what’s ahead for her, for
dialog: all of them.
text: As she arrives at Michel, he puts up a fuss for a moment as
text: to missing the view. But Frankie insists, and he and Tiago
text: turn around and follow the rest, as the head down and away.
text: Clouds come and go.
text: And then, the sky clears up momentarily, and we marvel at the
text: spectacular view of the sun setting on the entire Sintra
dialog: coastline down below - the mountains, the towns, the tree
text: tops, the white beach, and the infinite ocean.
