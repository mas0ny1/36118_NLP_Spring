text: A LADY (Donna) in her early forties sits next to Bad in this
text: dimly-lit bar. Her skin is loose around her eyes and jaw, but
text: her face is thin. Her makeup is pretty thick and a little

text: Bad awakens to the steady pulse of the red light on the

text: Nowhere. The engine's seized up.
text: Bad gets out of the Suburban. The road is dirt. Bad looks for
text: the highway; it's nowhere to be seen.
text: The road is softening to THICK MUD. Bad walks back to the
text: Suburban. Donna's asleep again. He grabs the bottle of WHISKY
text: and a FLASHLIGHT. The rain intensifies. It's a frog-
dialog: strangler.
text: Bad nudges Donna.
speaker_heading: BAD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to walk for help. If

text: Donna doesn't budge. Bad starts out through the rain and mud.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW MEXICO COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENTS LATER 141
text: Bad can barely walk. He's drunk, his ankle is tender, and the
text: road is inches deep in MUD.
text: Twice he falls and pulls himself up, crawling and stumbling
text: to his feet. To either side are trees, and he can see nothing
text: but the few feet of road ahead of him. He struggles onward.
text: The third time he falls, he can't get his feet back under
text: him. He crawls to the side of the road. His hand slips
text: through the wet mud and the rest of his body follows down the
speaker_heading: DITCHBANK.
text: He lands in COLD water and rights himself. He's lost the
text: FLASHLIGHT, but still has the bottle.
text: Bad lays his head back on the ditchbank and takes a long

speaker_heading: GREENE.
text: Bad wears neatly pressed slacks, shiny Lucchese cowboy boots,
text: and a crisp white shirt held together by a turquoise Bolo

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Helluva song.
text: As Tommy begins another verse, Jack pulls an ENVELOPE from

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They're getting bigger by the day.

speaker_heading: BAD
dialog: I'll say.
