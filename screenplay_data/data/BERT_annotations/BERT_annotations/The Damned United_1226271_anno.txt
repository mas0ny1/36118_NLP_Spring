dialog: this is not just a business matter for
dialog: you both. It's more than that. It's
dialog: personal. Am I right?
speaker_heading: CLOUGH
dialog: Well, we're very different people, Don
dialog: and I. We have different styles. In
dialog: football and in life. I'm a warm man.
dialog: An idealist. I do believe in faeries,
dialog: and that is my outlook. Don is
text: different. There's a hardness to him.
text: A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware
dialog: of it. But he's a cold person.

dialog: And that lack of warmth. That coldness
dialog: was there. Permeated the club when I
dialog: arrived.
speaker_heading: REVIE
dialog: I totally refute that. The atmosphere
dialog: at Leeds was like a family. A happy
dialog: family. You ask any of my players. I
dialog: signed most of them personally. Knew
dialog: their backgrounds. Their parents.
dialog: Their streets. I was a father to them.
dialog: In that club every morning. Massaging
dialog: those boys. Did you do that for them?
speaker_heading: CLOUGH
dialog: They would never have let me.
speaker_heading: REVIE
dialog: Did you try? You didn't even try. I
dialog: soaped those boys down with my own
dialog: hands. You just went to Leeds with no
dialog: thought for the club, no thought for
dialog: the players. Just on some kind of mad
dialog: personal vendetta with me.
speaker_heading: CLOUGH
dialog: Well are you surprised? What else was
dialog: I going to do?? After what you did...
speaker_heading: REVIE
dialog: What did I do?

speaker_heading: REVIE
dialog: Never! Matter of principle! I always
dialog: shake the other manager's hand!
speaker_heading: CLOUGH
dialog: You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my
dialog: trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.
speaker_heading: REVIE
dialog: Then I probably didn't see you!!
speaker_heading: CLOUGH
dialog: No, you saw me Don. But considered me

dialog: We know you as the man who's constant

dialog: Who had one of the best jobs in the

dialog: greatest gift in British football
dialog: Leeds United, a team that in ten years
dialog: hasn't finished outside the top four,
