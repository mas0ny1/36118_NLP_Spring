scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
dialog: 
text: A fishing boat pushes over choppy water. FOUR GUN TOTING
text: MEN on Jet Skis wearing black wet suits and goggles
text: escort the boat. Flying above it is a HELICOPTER.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A SERBIAN MAN captains the wheel. SERB 2 scans the
text: horizon with binoculars. He checks the GPS system, then
text: his watch, then speaks into his throat mic. All italics
dialog: are Serbian w/ subtitles:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERB 2
text: Fifteen minutes to delivery.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The JET SKIER in the lead weighs in on a radio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The HELICOPTER PILOT weighs in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: All clear from above.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath
text: the surface.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam
text: from the boat and skis bubbles.
dialog: 
text: Calm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE-
text: BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels.
text: JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water.
dialog: 
text: The LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes
text: follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above.
text: From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive
text: disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES.
text: A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the
text: boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting
text: the cable and drawing himself closer.
dialog: 
text: Dangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the
text: hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water
text: and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A SURGE of ELECTRICAL FORCE blasts from the control
text: panel. SPARKS fly.
dialog: 
text: The two Serbian Men jolt backwards -- WHAM -- and hit the
text: wall. All the needles inside all the dials go LIMP. The
text: roar of the engines DIES and the boat STOPS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Shane slips inside the hull, through the new hole.

speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: What's happening?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a
text: SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are
text: simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second
text: later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET
text: SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a
text: second, way too fast for anyone to notice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The shaken Serbs climb to their feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERBIAN 2
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
text: They look around, and see the SEALS, on the jet skis: In
text: the masks they are indistinguishable from the GUN-TOTTING
text: MEN they switched paces with. All seems clear. Serb 1
text: pushes on the throttle... nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERBIAN 1
text: We've been hit. We're taking on water.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the boat lists -- and water pours in, under the
text: cabin door. They spring into action!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERBIAN 1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Grab the professor, quick!

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED
dialog: GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERBIAN 1
dialog: Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot!
dialog: 
text: The Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2
text: rushes below deck.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: PROFESSOR CHARLES PLUMMER, bound to a chair and gagged,
text: tries to YELP as the room begins to flood with water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS
dialog: 
text: Serb 2 runs down steps to the lowermost hold. He tries to
text: force the door open. When it finally opens, he is forced
text: back by a three foot wall of water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Professor Plummer panics, as the water rises up to his
text: mouth He struggles, but can't get free. Up to his nose,
text: over his head.... He's gone.
dialog: 
text: Then Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the
text: Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer
text: screams. Shane removes his mouth piece. Shane doesn't
text: seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States
dialog: Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But
dialog: you have to do exactly what I say, when I
dialog: say it. My way -- no highway option. Do
dialog: you copy?
text: (Plummer nods, terrified.)
dialog: Where's the briefcase?
dialog: 
text: The Professor gestures across the room, where a metal
text: BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his
text: own waist. As the water rises, to the roof.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLUMMER
dialog: How did you know where I...
dialog: 
text: Shane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving
dialog: him his oxygen.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of
text: our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAL
text: KEEP SHOOTING!
dialog: 
text: The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Give it a second, they're almost out of
dialog: ammo.
dialog: 
text: The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" They do, until
text: there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAL (CONT'D)
text: Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at
dialog: your 10 o'clock.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Just before the water envelopes him and Plummer...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: (into his mic)
dialog: I've got the Prof and the case. First
dialog: round's on me back at Virginia Beach.
dialog: 
text: Shane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the
text: Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Shane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat
text: falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable
text: CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the
text: belly of the helicopter above him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER
dialog: 
text: Shane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor.
text: Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: You know how to swim?
dialog: 
text: The Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out.
dialog: 
text: Shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls,

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper,
text: then disappear gracefully back into the water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks
text: beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor
text: takes out his mouth piece.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLUMMER
dialog: Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd
dialog: we... That was the most incredible...
dialog: 
text: Shane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors'
text: mouth, shutting him up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Better keep that on `til we get to the
text: rendezvous point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLUMMER
dialog: (through the mouth piece)
dialog: Why? Poison gas?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: (re: the oxygen)
dialog: No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN CLEARING - A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: A Pave Hawk SH-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly,
text: waits. Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line
text: and sets down atop the mountain by a stream.
dialog: 
text: Shane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the
text: waiting Hawk. Charles stops Shane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Lieutenant, thank you. (He pats his
dialog: briefcase) You saved more than just my
dialog: life today. Can I call my wife to let
dialog: her know I'm okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
text: Negative. Not imperative to the mission.
dialog: We have to keep moving. I have strict
dialog: orders to get you out of here safely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks
dialog: I'm dead. (then) Don't you have a family?
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: (this gets him:)
dialog: Make it quick.
dialog: 
text: Charles picks up his briefcase. He holds the lock up to
text: his mouth and whispers into it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.
dialog: 
text: The briefcase pops open. Shane looks at him, puzzled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: My kids. It's voice activated. Designed
dialog: it myself. I do security, that's my
dialog: specialty. (gestures back:) Those guys
dialog: back there tried to get this case open
dialog: for five days -- couldn't crack it. And
dialog: you should see what happens to you if
dialog: open it without the code. I have a
dialog: picture of my kids in here, you want to
dialog: see it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Negative.
dialog: 
text: Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks
text: in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a
text: family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone... nothing
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Battery's dead...
dialog: 
text: Shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone.
text: Charles dials, and talks...

speaker_heading: CHARLES (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: SHANE'S P.O.V.: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion. He
text: sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A
text: VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase.
text: There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites.
text: Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches out, grabs the

dialog: 
text: Shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. His arm and

dialog: 
text: Shane's Captain enters: BILL FAWCETT (35) -- friendly,
text: unassuming. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Shane
text: salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Captain, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: As you were Lieutenant.
dialog: 
text: Bill sits down beside the bed. He takes a long look at
text: Shane. He holds a REPORT in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: We've been through a lot together Shane.
dialog: You're the best man I ever trained. And a
dialog: good friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: ... I know sir. And I except full

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why the hell did you let him use the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
text: He had to call his family. A lapse in
dialog: judgement on my part that I regret sir.

dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bill shakes his head, disappointed. He pulls up a chair,
text: and sits opposite Shane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: ... Plummer was the best security expert
dialog: the department of defense ever had -- a
dialog: genius. He was working on a program that
text: scrambles launch codes. He called it
scene_heading: G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude
text: Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from
dialog: the GHOST satellite and a country can't
dialog: launch its own nukes. That's what the
dialog: Serbians kidnapped him for, but they
dialog: couldn't get S
text: inside the briefcase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: The case was empty sir, as I stated in my
dialog: report.
dialog: 
text: Bill considers this. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Not a surprise, really. Not like the
dialog: professor to hide things where someone
text: might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still
dialog: out there, (Bill smiles:) which is why
dialog: I'm going to give you another shot.
dialog: 
text: Shane sits up. He can't believe his good fortune.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Sir. Thank you. I... appreciate your
dialog: confidence.
dialog: 
text: Invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an IV,
text: and starts to rise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll need to put a team together. I'm
dialog: gonna need the mini sub, I need access to
text: an EP3 aries 2 spy plane...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (interrupting:)
dialog: Negative. It's not that kind of mission.
dialog: 
text: Shane listens, intrigued.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Two days ago, I got a call from the
dialog: professor's wife... Widow. She told me
text: someone had broken into her home.
text: Searched the place, top to bottom.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: BILL(CONT'D)
text: She's scared. The family's scared.
dialog: Whoever killed the professor must think
text: G.H.O.S.T. is in that house. Maybe it is,
dialog: maybe it isn't. Either way, I need
dialog: someone to stay at that house, and
dialog: protect them. And while you're there --
dialog: find out if the program is in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: That's it? Why would you want me for
dialog: that, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The professor's wife requested you.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: Honey, I'm alive. Listen: A lot can

dialog: 
text: Shane packs his duffel with military gear: GPS compass,

text: Shane double-checks the address. The sprinklers go off.
text: Shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of

dialog: 
text: WE hear TINY FEET approach -- then the door swings open,

dialog: 
text: Shane eyes Lulu. Lulu eyes Shane, then:

scene_heading: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - DAY

dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: KIIIDDS!!!
dialog: 
text: Shane startles, covers his ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your butts down here and say "hello!"
dialog: 
text: And then three pairs of feet come down the stairs. Lulu,
text: ZOE, 15, and TODD, 14 line up like the perfect family
text: portrait. Todd's hair hangs in his face. He wears a Sid
text: Vicious shirt and a long trench coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've already met Lulu. This is Peter,

dialog: 
dialog: All the kids except for Todd-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Hi.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Charles wasn't around too much. His work
dialog: took him all over the world. He'd be gone
dialog: six or seven months at a time. So I
dialog: think for the younger ones it's a little
dialog: confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're
dialog: dealing like your normal teenagers.
text: Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I
dialog: did everything I could...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Charles was in a dangerous business. I
dialog: knew it when I married him. No one's to
dialog: blame here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everyone thinks that Charles told me or
dialog: the kids where he hid it. And until
text: G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Nothing will happen to your family as
dialog: long as I'm here. I've dealt with much...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly from behind Shane's head a DUCK appears and
text: NIBBLES his ear. Shane spins in full fight stance. He
text: sees the Duck... and relaxes. Sort of.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's Gary. He was Charles'.
dialog: 
text: The duck QUACKS angrily. Confused, Shane returns to "at
dialog: ease," keeping one eye on the duck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Mrs. Plummer-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Call me Julie.
dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE

dialog: 
text: Shane, now wearing an EAR TRANSMITTER, crawls through the

dialog: 
text: Nighttime -- the family eats dinner. We slowly pull
text: out... through the kitchen window... and reveal Shane
text: with night vision goggles on scoping the property.
dialog: 
text: The phone RINGS inside. Through the window, Julie

speaker_heading: JULIE

text: A safety deposit box under Charles' name

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's wonderful. This could all be over!

text: He lowers Tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath,

speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: The things I do for my country.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LULU

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE

dialog: 
text: Lulu crosses her eyes at Shane, then at Tyler -- who

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: Tyler hates it when I do that...
dialog: 
text: Peter starts bawling, too. He runs away, crying. The

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Who was that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The garage door opens, dramatically unveiling Shane. He's

text: hide his contempt as he sees: Julie's WHITE MINIVAN. A
text: bumper sticker declares "World's Greatest Mom." Shane
text: puts Tyler in a CAR SEAT. Its interlocking buckle
text: connects FOUR WAYS. Shane fumbles with it for a while.
dialog: It just doesn't add up...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: We're gonna be late.

speaker_heading: SHANE

speaker_heading: MURNEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
dialog: So. You're the new baby-sitter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

dialog:

dialog: 
text: ON THE SCREEN: they each select a fighter. Lulu picks a

speaker_heading: SHANE

dialog: 
text: The second round starts, Brownies have gathered around to

text: taking it really seriously. He's really mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't fair. My joystick's broken.

speaker_heading: LULU

text: The Ninjas pull a retractable KENDO STAFFS. Wielding them
text: with great skill. It takes all of Shane's skill to fend
text: them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast.
text: Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded FOLDING
text: LADDER and clocks a Ninja with it. He goes down, but
text: Shane is SHOCKED from behind by the other NINJA. The
text: Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. Their Kendo
text: staffs hiss with a powerful ELECTRIC CURRENT. The Ninjas
text: knock Shane backwards down the stairs...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA
dialog: GHOST -- hand it over!
dialog: 
text: They leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs,
dialog: knocking him into...

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLAYROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: There are TOYS EVERYWHERE -- like a tornado hit a TOYS-R-
text: US. Shane fends the Ninjas off. He spots a BASEBALL BAT,
text: and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. They step back...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Okay -- who wants some?
dialog: 
text: Shane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a
text: whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. Shane and the Ninja
text: share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge. Shane
text: fends them off with his Whiffle bat. With his foot, he
text: picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both
text: to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with
text: both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow.
text: Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a
text: shelf and grabs it. He pulls the string, and swings the
text: plastic disk like a deadly bolo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARMER JOHN GAME
dialog: The rooster goes...
dialog: 
text: WHACK, he hits a Ninja in the head. He swings the Farmer
text: John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf
text: over. Shane crashes down, toys fly, several FURBIES hit
text: the floor. They echo the fight:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FURBIES
dialog: Ow! Ow!
dialog: 
text: Shane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no
text: shoes. He grabs a barrel of LEGOS, and flings them all
text: over the floor. The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos
text: and Jacks dig into their feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINJA/FURBIES
dialog: Ow! Ow ow! Crap!
dialog: 
text: The Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos,
text: Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes
text: DESITIN at a NINJA, blinding him.
dialog: 
text: Shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them, KICKING a
text: Ninja in the chest. The Ninja CRASHES through the window!
dialog: 
text: he other Ninja looks up, fearful. Suddenly he grabs a
text: bottle of BABY POWDER. He sprays it in Shane's face...
text: POOF! The room fills with a CLOUD OF WHITE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SHANE
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He squints, blinded. The cloud dissipates... and Shane
text: sees he's now alone. He runs to the broken window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE:
dialog: 
text: The Ninja's are long gone. Shane bangs the window sill,
text: disappointed to have lost them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER
dialog: 
text: Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door. He
text: quietly knocks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Kids. It's safe. You can open up.
dialog: 
text: A long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run
text: out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd
text: and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do...
text: Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: Please don't leave us Shane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
dialog: 
text: He hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Shhh... It's okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Who were they? What did they want...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: They're looking for a program, that your
dialog: father invented.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: So Mom's not paranoid? There really are
dialog: people out to get us.
dialog: 
text: He takes out the CD labeled GHOST.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: They're not after you. They want this.
dialog: But nothing's gonna happen to you, as
dialog: long as I'm here. And I'm not going
dialog: anywhere.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The kids shudder, relieved. They hug him tighter. He
text: looks Zoe, eye to eye. He dries her tears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I can't do this without your help,
dialog: okay? We need a little more cooperation
dialog: here. (the Kids nod) Tell you what --
dialog: let's start over. From now on, you listen
dialog: to me, and do what I say. (to Zoe and
dialog: Todd:) And I... I'll listen to you too.
dialog: Deal? Truce -- okay?
dialog: 
text: Zoe and Todd nod. Shane offers his hand to shake. They
text: shake -- then they hug him, too.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Shane and the Kids sit around Shane's computer. Shane
text: slips the Ghost CD in the disc drive, pushes play --

speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: C'mon c'mon c'mon...
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP - COMPUTER MONITOR
dialog: 
text: The SOUND comes on: it's MUSIC. "Unchained Melody." And
text: then, PICTURE: Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze at a pottery
text: wheel. Shane is furious -- a long pause. Then...
dialog: 
text: Zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night.
text: Then, the other kids join in. Soon, even Shane is
text: laughing too: the telephone RINGS -- they all jump,
text: startled. Zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play
dialog: it cool and not frighten her mother:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing
dialog: happened you should worry about. Nope.

speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's
dialog: fine. They were looking for GHOST, but
dialog: they didn't find it. You have any luck?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well, yes and no. We found something in
dialog: the box... But we're not sure what it is.
dialog: Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It
dialog: looks like some kind of "key". We just
dialog: don't know what its for.
dialog: 
text: She holds up the strange, metal two pronged KEY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The good news is I'll be home in two
dialog: days, as soon as the customs paperwork

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The TEACHER shows the children how to dye Easter eggs.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE on Lulu, making a mess of an egg. She smiles.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE on Shane, squashed at a little desk. He dips an
text: egg in some purple dye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Driver's Ed. An obstacle course with cones. Zoe
text: nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed TEACHER next to

text: she HITS the gas, then BRAKES, HITS the gas, then BRAKES.
dialog: 
text: Shane stands off to the side, shaking his head. Peter

scene_heading: INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: The TEACHER hangs a series of cute "Turkey Hand" drawings
dialog: above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make
text: the feathers). She hangs one of a HUGE HAND, and smiles
text: at Shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on. Shane
text: nods, "yeah, I know it's good." Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (OVER THE PA:)
dialog: Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice
text: Principal Murney in the gym.
dialog: 
text: Lulu's classmates all chant, in unison:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND GRADERS
dialog: Ooooooooh! (You're in trouble!)
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE GYM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Shane enters. Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. She
text: is holding a broken-off SIDE VIEW MIRROR. Murney stands,
text: Principal Claire next to him. They look concerned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's
dialog: Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY
dialog: That? Lady drivers, what do you expect.
dialog: No, it's not that -- it's the boy...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Red two? I mean Todd?
dialog: 
text: Claire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
dialog: Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to
dialog: return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and
dialog: I'm not sure what to do...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Has he been skipping class?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
dialog: Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth
dialog: period. But this...
dialog: 
text: Murney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops,
text: in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has
text: a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a "skinhead" look.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY
dialog: This is how he showed up to practice. And
dialog: that's not all. I was doing a little re-
dialog: con in his locker... and I found this:
dialog: 
text: Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it.
text: It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane
text: scowls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: If he'd had Hustler or something, boys
dialog: will be boys -- but this is just sick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: He's not a NAZI.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
dialog: It's certainly not normal.
dialog: (pulls Shane aside.)
dialog: See if you can talk to the boy. Find out
dialog: what's going on.
dialog: 
text: Shane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought.
text: Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out.
dialog: 
text: The WRESTLING TEAM is assembled, stretching. They snicker
text: and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes. Shane walks
text: the kids out, and Murney chases after him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY
dialog: hope you won't go light on him -- that
dialog: whole family's no good, if you ask me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: I'll talk to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY
dialog: You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a
dialog: hell of a fighter on the mats, huh?
text: (Shane ignores him, and keeps
dialog: walking.)
dialog: Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll
dialog: give these boys a treat.
dialog: 
text: He "fake-punches" one of his Boys -- who flinches like
text: Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. Murney laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Another time, maybe...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY
dialog: It's a date then. I'll show you a couple
dialog: moves. I promise I won't hurt you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Shane walks away. Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung
text: Fu SCREAM, and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the BACK,
text: Shane trips forwards to his knees. Murney tells his team:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: See that? You never know when your
dialog: adversary is going to strike!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Did you kick me in the back? Is there a
dialog: footprint on my jacket?
dialog: 
text: Shane dusts off his back, and leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURNEY
dialog: Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy!
dialog: 
text: Shane turns back. It looks like Shane might fight, but
text: instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. Murney shakes
text: his head, and snickers to his Team.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers
text: piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...
dialog: 
text: odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TODD'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Shane knocks on Todd's door. Nothing. He enters. The
text: window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm --
text: there's a REFRIGERATOR MAGNET stuck to it, keeping the
text: contact, so the alarm didn't go off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Smart kid.
dialog: 
text: Shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can
text: see Todd, running around the corner. Shane hops out the
text: window. He sees Zoe, peering out her window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets
text: within forty clicks of the perimeter,
dialog: signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your
dialog: homework, preheat the oven, and make sure
dialog: Lulu brushes her teeth!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on
text: the sill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: You want in or out?
dialog: 
text: The Duck leaps out. Shane screws the window shut. On the
text: corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a CITY BUS.
dialog: 
text: Shane picks a GIRL'S BICYCLE up off the front lawn. It's
text: pink, with a flowered basket. It's small for him, but he
text: hops on and pedals furiously after the bus.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few
text: HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT - LATER
dialog: 
text: The bus stops in a rundown neighborhood Todd hops off the
text: bus. Shane's arrives a moment later, dripping sweat. He
text: stashes the bike behind a mailbox...
dialog: 
text: Shane'S P.O.V.: At the entrance to the old warehouse,
text: Todd meets up with three other TEENAGE BOYS, they're
text: dressed in brown HITLER YOUTH UNIFORMS, they head inside.
dialog: 
text: Shane follows them, stealthily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Shane follows the Hitler Youth into a large room, set up
text: with folding chairs. He hides in a dark corner. Todd and
text: the Hitler Youth enter, and take seats. A CREEPY MAN in
text: a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them. Shane
text: watches as the MAN addresses the Hitler Youth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Alright. All my Nazis are finally here.
dialog: Okay, I want all of you at attention.
dialog: 
text: The Nazis stand at attention. Shane is horrified...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
text: And on stage left - (he yells) VON
dialog: TRAPPS! I need my Von Trapps!
dialog: 
text: hane watches... as a group of blonde ACTORS, all dressed
text: in lederhosen as the SINGING VON TRAPP family enter, and
text: join the "Nazis." There's also a few NUNS, a CAPTAIN VON
text: TRAPP, and a MARIA. The Creepy Man is, in fact, a good
text: natured, slightly foppish DIRECTOR.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Okeydokey. Starting from where we left
dialog: off Gimme Rolf and Liesl -- let's give
dialog: You are Sixteen a run up der flagpole...
dialog: 
text: Todd heads up to the stage, the Director arranges him and
text: the ACTRESS PLAYING LIESL (40ish) into position. An
text: ACCOMPANIST begins on piano, Todd sings, remarkably well:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You wait little girl, on an empty
dialog: stage/for fate to turn the light on/your
dialog: life little girl, is an empty page/that
dialog: men will want to write on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACTRESS/LIESL
dialog: To write on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You are sixteen, going on seventeen...
dialog: 
text: Shane bursts into laughter. His whole face lights up for
dialog: the first time ever...
dialog: 
text: Todd and Liesl dance. Todd is good, but nervous. He
text: attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the
text: stage, clutching his ankle. He gets up, and limps to the
text: seats. The Director walks onto the stage, upset. He
dialog: looks up, to heaven:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable
dialog: evil that I deserve to be saddled with
dialog: the world's worst production of Sound of
text: Music? (he shouts, at the cast:) We open
dialog: in a week. The set's not finished... The
text: cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every
dialog: kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig
dialog: himself out of the earth, so he could
text: have a heart attack again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I'm sorry... I'll get it right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: None of you will ever get it right! Which
dialog: is why, I quit.
dialog: 
text: He throws down his script. The Cast is stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
text: And with that, he exits stage right...
text: end scene.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And, on his own cue... he exits stage right, in a huff.
text: The entire cast looks to Todd, fuming.
dialog: 
text: Shane jumps up from his hiding place, startling
text: everybody. Everyone steps back. Todd is terrified.
dialog: 
text: Shane kneels down beside Todd. He closes his eyes, and
text: begins rubbing his hands together like Mr. Miyagi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIESL
dialog: You gonna fix him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: No. My hands are freezing.
dialog: 
text: Shane grabs Todd's ankle hard and unceremoniously CRACKS
text: it, and yanks him to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I'm not going to quit. I hate wresting...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: AT EASE. (Todd shuts up) Would you
dialog: listen, just once? Look, I don't know a
dialog: hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,
dialog: but... You're good. A lot to learn, but
dialog: with hard work, discipline -- you could
dialog: make a go of this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: ... but what about Murney?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: That guy's an idiot.
dialog: 
text: Todd smiles, relieved. They sit on the edge of the stage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: "Sound of Music" is a great show. My dad
dialog: took me to see it when I was a kid.
dialog: 
text: Shane smiles wistfully. Todd relaxes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You don't seem like the musical type.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.

speaker_heading: TODD

dialog: something?

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: You know what girls think is weird?
text: Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each
dialog: other to the floor? I've never understood
dialog: that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Doesn't matter now anyway... show's
dialog: off... it's over.
dialog: 
text: Shane looks at the Cast, they look pretty glum as they
text: pack up their costumes. Todd looks devastated -- only a

speaker_heading: LIESL
dialog: We don't have a director...

speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: No director? I have directed rescue

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: ... What's up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called

speaker_heading: SHANE

speaker_heading: ULU

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so

text: A bewildered beat -- then Julie pulls out a tube of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: The key is the kid's names. Watch.
dialog: 
text: Shane steps forward - ZAP! The floor tile SHOCKS HIM,

speaker_heading: S
speaker_heading: SHANE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Code or no code, go get it -- now.
dialog: 
text: ill cocks his gun. Sweat drips down Shane's face. He
text: mists the air to see the beams: He steps forward, over
text: one beam and ducking under another -- he miscalculates: a
text: BURST OF FLAME blazes from the ceiling like a giant blow
text: torch, Shane leaps back, landing on his hands and knees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Bill) You can't make him do this --
text: He doesn't have a chance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP - SHANE
dialog: 
text: Shane's thinks. He notices a GROOVE carved in the floor,
text: not quite centered to the room. He feels the Groove.
dialog: Something she said...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Haven't got a chance.
dialog: 
text: Shane feels the Groove in the floor. He thinks. He looks
text: up at the ceiling (bottom of the first floor).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (sings softly to himself)
dialog: ... When you're down and low, lower than
dialog: the floor. And you haven't got a chance.
dialog: Don't make a move `til you're in the

dialog: 
text: Calmness comes to Shane's face. He takes a deep breath,
speaker_heading: S
dialog: facing forwards:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just hop three times like a kangaroo --
dialog: 
text: He hops forwards three times, fearlessly. NOTHING
text: HAPPENS. No BOOBY TRAPS are set off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
text: Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.
dialog: 
text: He steps sideway, across two tiles. Again -- NOTHING
text: HAPPENS. It dawns on Julie what he's doing. Julie smiles,
text: relieved. Shane he steps forwards, then back:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
text: Three steps forward and one step back.
dialog: 
text: When he steps back -- A SPRING-LOADED SPIKE launches down
text: from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing.
text: Shane is rattled, his focus gone. Until Julie shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK!
dialog: 
text: Shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back -- just
text: in time: FLAMES SHOOT FROM BOTH WALLS right at him. If
text: he'd been standing, he'd be toast.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - SIMULTANEOUS
dialog: 
text: The Minivan blasts through another yellow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: Look out Zoe! Rollers!
dialog: 
text: There is a POLICE CAR cruising the street ahead of them.
text: Zoe blows past it. Inside is the Cute Cop. The Squad
text: Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan
text: -- it takes a while, they're FLYING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0.
dialog: 
text: Zoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her.
text: The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe.

speaker_heading: CUTE COP
dialog: I'd say you could lose your license --

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: People are trying to kill us. They have

dialog: follow me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUTE COP
dialog: Just pull over!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Fine. Don't follow me!
dialog: 
text: She swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The Minivan speeds by. The Squad Car is on its tail. It

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no
dialog: more. Then better jump quick, like there
dialog: ain't no floor.
dialog: 
text: Shane jumps up just AS THE FLOOR UNDER HIM DROPS AWAY,
text: revealing a pool of liquid. Shane has wedged himself in
text: the corner. A bead of his sweat falls into the liquid,
text: and sizzles in a cloud of smoke. It's acid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself, to calm down)
dialog: Almost done, almost done... "Just hold
dialog: your breath, and jump to the left."
dialog: 
text: He jumps, to the left of the HOLE. He lands in front of
text: THE SAFE. He's relieved -- then nozzles spray YELLOW GAS
text: at him. He holds his breath just in time. Still holding
dialog: his breath:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE (CONT'D)
dialog: And that's the Peter Panda Dance.
dialog: 
text: He flips the switch to DISARMED. The safe's red light
text: turns green. Immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns
text: retract! The gas gets sucked into grates. The whole
text: room goes SILENT. Whew.
dialog: 
text: Bill looks around. He nervously steps forward - he waves
text: his hand over the floor, and jumps back. Nothing happens.
dialog: 
text: Bill signals for Mrs. Chun to go first. She gestures
text: back: you go. It's a stand-off. Finally, Bill takes a
text: breath -- and walks across the room. The Booby Traps are
text: disarmed. Mrs. Chun follows, pulling Julie along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thank you, Shane. You were always my best
dialog: man. I knew you'd figure it out.
dialog: 
text: Shane scowls, disgusted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, if you're willing to join up,
dialog: I'd be happy to cut you in on the
dialog: proceeds. What do you say -- we make a
dialog: good team?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: I was devoted to you, sir. And you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'll take that as a "no."
dialog: 
text: Bill turns to the safe. He starts to reach for the
text: dial... then catches himself. Something's not right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I think you better open it.
dialog: 
text: Shane reaches for the safe, before he reaches the dial --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. That's just what you want isn't it?
dialog: 
text: Bill thinks, trying to read Shane's poker face. Shane
text: shrugs. Bill gestures to Mrs. Chun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You open it.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Chun doesn't budge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh come on. I walked the floor first.
dialog: 
text: Reluctantly - Mrs. Chun reaches out, and touches the
text: dial. Nothing happens. Relief. She turns it, and ZAPPPPP!
text: 1000 volts ELECTROCUTES her, her hair on end, shaking
dialog: from the voltage...
dialog: 
text: Bill is off guard, Shane kicks his gun away! The gun
text: skids into the acid and plunges, SIZZLING. Bill is
text: incensed, but Shane gazes coldly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: There will be no mercy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: None requested.
dialog: 
text: Full of himself, Bill LUNGES. And he's strong! He
text: shoves Shane back, then PUNCHES him in the gut.
dialog: 
text: Shane glares, then returns an onslaught of BLOWS.
text: Shane's fury is unleashed: A volley of attacks, hitting
text: Bill's arms, head, legs! He's crazed, unrelenting.
dialog: 
text: But suddenly Mrs. Chun LEAPS onto his back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. CHUN
speaker_heading: AAAAAA!
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She SCREAMS and grabs his throat. Shane struggles to
text: lose her. Suddenly, he drops and FLIPS her. She
text: catapults, stumbles backwards across the room, and stops
text: just inches from the acid! She teeters, tottering,
text: unable to gain her balance.
dialog: 
text: Shane shakes his head, then runs to grab her outstretched
text: hand. She smiles, saved. But he's unforgiving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: You're a... terrible neighbor.
dialog: 
text: Shane COLD-COCKS her, knocking her out. Suddenly --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Shane! Watch out!
dialog: 
text: Bill is charging him. Shane whirls, delivering a
text: ROUNDHOUSE KICK. OOF! Bill gets slammed in the chest.
dialog: 
text: Bill tumbles, the wind knocked out of him. He jumps to
text: his feet, delivering a series of hard punches, which
text: Shane deflects -- they tangle like pro's. It's clear the
text: both have the same training. They punch, spin, kick,
text: connecting only occasionally. Bill wheels around and
text: lands a kicks squarely in Shane's chest. Shane tumbles,
text: landing on his back in front of the safe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE - BILL
dialog: 
text: He steps over Shane. Leering mercilessly, he jabs the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Any last words?
