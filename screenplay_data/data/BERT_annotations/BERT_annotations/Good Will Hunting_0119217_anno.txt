scene_heading: INT. L STREET BAR &amp; GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING
text: The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is
text: ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across
text: several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last
text: nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Oh my God, I got the most fucked up
dialog: thing I been meanin' to tell you.
text: As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a
text: table near the back of the bar.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Oh Jesus. Here we go.
text: The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest
text: of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer.
text: Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a
text: softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22,
dialog: heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle
dialog: with.
text: Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other
text: guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror
text: stories with eager disgust.
text: All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a
dialog: rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are
dialog: its product.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: You guys know my cousin Mikey
dialog: Sullivan?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE

speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: What? Come on!
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: (trying not to laugh)
dialog: I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey,
dialog: the fuckin guy loves animals, and
dialog: this is the last person you'd want
dialog: this to happen to.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Okay. He's driving along and this
text: fuckin' cat jumps in front of his
dialog: car, and so he hits this cat--
text: Chuckie is really laughing now.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: --That isn't funny--
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"
text: And he looks in his rearview and
dialog: sees this cat -- I'm sorry--
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Fuckin' Chuckie!
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: So he sees this cat tryin to make it
dialog: across the street and it's not lookin'
dialog: so good.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's walkin' pretty slow at this
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You guys are fuckin' sick.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put
dialog: this thing out of its misery"--So he
dialog: gets a hammer--
scene_heading: WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
dialog: OH!
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
text: out of his tool box, and starts
dialog: chasin' the cat and starts whackin'
dialog: it with the hammer. You know, tryin'
dialog: to put the thing out of its misery.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: And all the time he's apologizin' to
dialog: the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG,
dialog: "I'm sorry." BANG!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Like it can understand.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: And this Samoan guy comes runnin'
dialog: out of his house and he's like "What
dialog: the fuck are you doing to my cat?!"
dialog: Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I
dialog: hit your cat with my truck, and I'm
dialog: just trying to put it out of it's
dialog: misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies.
dialog: So Mikey's like "Why don't you come
text: look at the front of the truck."
dialog: 'Cause the other guy's all fuckin
dialog: flipped out about--
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Watching his cat get brained.
text: Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Yeah, so he's like "Check the front
dialog: of my truck, I can prove I hit it
dialog: 'cause there's probably some blood
dialog: or something"--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: --or a tail--
speaker_heading: MORGAN
speaker_heading: WILL!
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
text: And so they go around to the front
text: of his truck... and there's another
text: cat on the grille.
scene_heading: WILL/MORGAN/BILLY

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE

dialog: their daily lives.
text: We see a panoramic view of South Boston.
text: Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a
text: small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack
text: of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping
text: through a book at about a page a second.
text: Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac
text: idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Please finish McKinley by next month.
dialog: Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real

text: Everyone groans.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I'm hoping that one of you might
dialog: prove it by the end of the semester.
dialog: The first person to do so will not
dialog: only be in my good graces, but go on
dialog: to fame and fortune by having their
dialog: accomplishment recorded and their
text: name printed in the auspicious "M.I.T.
dialog: Tech."
text: Prof. Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "M.I.T.

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: I don't know, we'll fuck up some
dialog: smart kids.
dialog: (stepping back in)
dialog: You'd prob'ly fit right in.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fuck you.

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: What do we got?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't know yet.

dialog: Margaret's class...

dialog: begins the
scene_heading: FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."
text: Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the
text: hapless Champa out cold.
text: As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL.

text: Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying
dialog: to avoid being overrun.
text: When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he
text: HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.
text: Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a
text: shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he
text: was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.
text: Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will
text: can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's
text: boys from the hood of a car.
dialog: Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a
text: fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.
text: The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown
text: wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone
text: throws a bottle.
text: In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's
text: friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will,

dialog: him.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

text: The look of rage returns to Will's eye.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Get the fuck off me!

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Is it my imagination, or has my class
dialog: grown considerably?
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my
dialog: spectators, but it appears there
dialog: will be no unmasking here today. I'm

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: However, my colleagues and I have

scene_heading: INT. BACK SECTION, BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have
text: made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE
text: YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.
text: Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair.
text: He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston
dialog: accent.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Hey, how's it goin'?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Yeah, cause I think I had a class
dialog: with you.
text: At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan
text: Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate
text: themselves within listening distance. A rather large student
text: in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie.
text: He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering
text: over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: What class?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Ah, history I think.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Yah, it's not a bad school...
text: At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: What class did you say that was?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: History.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: How'd you like that course?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Good, it was all right.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: History? Just "history?" It must
dialog: have been a survey course then.
text: Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy
text: exchange a look and move subtly closer.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Pretty broad. "History of the World?"
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Hey, come on pal we're in classes
dialog: all day. That's one thing about
dialog: Harvard never seizes to amaze me,
dialog: everybody's talkin' about school all
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Hey, I'm the last guy to want to
text: talk about school at the bar. But as
dialog: long as you're here I want to "seize"
dialog: the opportunity to ask you a question.
text: Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan
text: see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your
dialog: history class.
text: Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.
text: When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and
text: rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: To tell you the truth, I wasn't there
dialog: much. The class was rather elementary.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that
dialog: it was. I remember the class, it was
text: just between recess and lunch.
text: Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: All right, are we gonna have a
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: There's no problem. I was just hoping
dialog: you could give me some insight into
dialog: the evolution of the market economy
dialog: in the early colonies. My contention
dialog: is that prior to the Revolutionary
dialog: War the economic modalities especially
dialog: of the southern colonies could most
dialog: aptly be characterized as agrarian
dialog: precapitalist and...
text: Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and
text: is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Of course that's your contention.
dialog: You're a first year grad student.
dialog: You just finished some Marxian
dialog: historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly,
dialog: and so naturally that's what you
dialog: believe until next month when you
dialog: get to James Lemon and get convinced
dialog: that Virginia and Pennsylvania were
dialog: strongly entrepreneurial and
dialog: capitalist back in 1740. That'll
dialog: last until sometime in your second
dialog: year, then you'll be in here
dialog: regurgitating Gordon Wood about the
dialog: Pre-revolutionary utopia and the
dialog: capital-forming effects of military
dialog: mobilization.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Well, as a matter of fact, I won't,
dialog: because Wood drastically
dialog: underestimates the impact of--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: "Wood drastically underestimates the
dialog: impact of social distinctions
dialog: predicated upon wealth, especially
dialog: inherited wealth..." You got that
dialog: from "Work in Essex County," Page
dialog: 421, right? Do you have any thoughts
dialog: of your own on the subject or were
dialog: you just gonna plagiarize the whole
dialog: book for me?
text: Clark is stunned.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Look, don't try to pass yourself off
dialog: as some kind of an intellect at the
dialog: expense of my friend just to impress
dialog: these girls.
text: Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The sad thing is, in about 50 years
dialog: you might start doin' some thinkin'
dialog: on your own and by then you'll realize
dialog: there are only two certainties in
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Yeah? What're those?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: One, don't do that. Two -- you
dialog: dropped a hundred and fifty grand on
dialog: an education you coulda' picked up
dialog: for a dollar fifty in late charges
text: at the Public Library.
text: Will catches Skylar's eye.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: But I will have a degree, and you'll
dialog: be serving my kids fries at a drive
dialog: through on our way to a skiing trip.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Maybe. But at least I won't be a
dialog: prick.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And if you got a problem with that,
dialog: I guess we can step outside and deal
dialog: with it that way.
dialog: While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark]
text: decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If you change your mind, I'll be
text: over by the bar.
text: He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a
dialog: look.
text: Morgan turns to a nearby girl.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: My boy's wicked smart.
scene_heading: INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER
text: Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement
text: as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the
text: players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.
text: occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.
text: Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: You suck.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I've been sitting over there for
dialog: forty-five minutes waiting for you
dialog: to come talk to me. But I'm just
dialog: tired now and I have to go home and
dialog: I wasn't going to keep sitting there
dialog: waiting for you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm Will.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Skylar. And by the way. That guy
dialog: over there is a real dick and I just
dialog: wanted you to know he didn't come
dialog: with us.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I kind of got that impression.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get
dialog: up early and waste some more money
dialog: on my overpriced education.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Here's my number.
text: Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Maybe we could go out for coffee
dialog: sometime?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Great, or maybe we could go somewhere
dialog: and just eat a bunch of caramels.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: When you think about it, it's just
dialog: as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Okay, sounds good.
text: She turns.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Five minutes.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I was trying to be smooth.
dialog: (indicates clock)
dialog: But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna
dialog: come over there and talk to you.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: See, it's my life story. Five more
dialog: minutes and I would have got to hear
dialog: your best pick-up line.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Glad I came over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOW AND ARROW -- LATER
text: Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about
text: their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar
text: with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window
dialog: with some friends.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: There goes that fuckin' Barney right
dialog: now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip."
dialog: We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hold up.
text: Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window
text: and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass.
text: He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey!
text: Clark turns toward Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: DO YOU LIKE APPLES?
text: Clark doesn't get it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Yeah?
text: Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA
dialog: LIKE THEM APPLES?!!
text: Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY
text: Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores
text: lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58)
text: sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page.
text: Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in
text: the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Excuse me. Is this the buildings and
dialog: grounds office?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, can I help you?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I'm trying to find the name of a
dialog: student who works here.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No students work for me.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Could you just check, because the
dialog: young man who works in my building--
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Which one's your building?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Building two.
text: Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, if something was stolen, I
dialog: should know about it.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: No, no. Nothing like that. I just
dialog: need his name.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I can't give you his name unless you
dialog: have a complaint.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Please, I'm a professor here and
dialog: it's very important.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, he didn't show up for work
dialog: today...
text: Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Look, he got his job through his
dialog: P.O. so you can call him.
text: Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a
text: card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the
text: card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM."
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM -- DAY
text: Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is
text: fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will
text: and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There is a lengthy legal precedent,
dialog: Your Honor, going back to 1789,
dialog: whereby a defendant may claim self-
dialog: defense against an agent of the
dialog: government where the act is shown to
dialog: be a defense against tyranny, a
dialog: defense of liberty--
text: The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who
dialog: signed the complaint isn't in my
dialog: courtroom. Why is that?
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
text: He's in the hospital with a broken
dialog: knee, Your Honor. But I have
text: depositions from the other officers.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in
dialog: his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit
dialog: back in 1887, that "Every American
dialog: citizen is by birth, a sworn officer
dialog: of the state. Every man is a
dialog: policeman." As for the other officers,
dialog: even William Congrave said; "he that
dialog: first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft
dialog: he that has stolen the treasure."
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Your Honor--
text: Will cranks it up.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to Prosecutor)
dialog: I am afforded the right to speak in
dialog: my own defense by our constitution,
dialog: Sir. The same document which
dialog: guarantees my right to liberty.
dialog: "Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
dialog: is "the soul's right to breathe, and
dialog: when it cannot take a long breath
dialog: laws are girded too tight. Without
dialog: liberty, man is a syncope."
dialog: (beat, to Judge)
dialog: Ibid. Your Honor.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Man is a what?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though
dialog: he be wounded-- "Magna..."
text: The Judge interrupts.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: Son,

dialog: My turn.
text: The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: June, '93, assault, Sept. '93
dialog: assault... Grand theft auto February
dialog: '94.
text: A beat, the Judge takes particular notice.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: Where, apparently, you defended
dialog: yourself and had the case thrown out
dialog: by citing "free property rights of
dialog: horse and carriage" from 1798...
text: Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: March, '94 public drunkenness, public
text: nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem.
dialog: November '94, assault. Jan. '95
text: impersonating a police officer,
dialog: mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned--
text: The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: You're in my courtroom, now and I am
dialog: aware of your priors.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm also aware that you're an orphan.
dialog: You've been through several foster
dialog: homes. The state removed you from
dialog: three because of serious physical
dialog: abuse.
text: The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: Another Judge might care. You hit a
dialog: cop, you go in.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Motion to dismiss denied.
text: The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE
dialog: Keep workin' on your arguments, son.
dialog: A word of advice for trial; speak
dialog: English.
text: As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches
text: Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Excuse me, your Honor.
dialog: (offers hand)
dialog: Gerald Lambeau.
text: An awkward beat. Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: JUDGE MALONE

speaker_heading: WILL

scene_heading: INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY
speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: looking guy you met at the bar?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting
dialog: anyone who fits that description.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay, you got me. It's the ugly,
dialog: obnoxious, toothless loser who got
dialog: drunk and wouldn't leave you alone
dialog: all night.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this
dialog: week we could go to a cafe and have
text: some caramels.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes. Under two conditions.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What're those?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That you meet with me twice a weekÂ—
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: and you meet with a therapist.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If I agree to this, I walk right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'll do the work. I'm not going to
text: meet with a therapist.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds,
dialog: Will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've already spoken to one therapist,

scene_heading: INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

dialog: you need to be doing. You have a
dialog: gift.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I could work the pit maybe, but I
dialog: could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: You have a quality -- something you
dialog: were born with, that you have no
dialog: control over -- and you are, in a
dialog: sense, hiding that by becoming a
dialog: janitor. And I'm not saying that's
dialog: wrong. I'm friends with the janitor
dialog: that works in my building. He's
dialog: been to my house for dinner. As a
dialog: matter of fact I did some free
dialog: consultation for "Mike" -- that's
dialog: not his real name. That's in my book.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had
dialog: the same problems as "Chad" the
dialog: stockbroker.
speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: Yes. The pressures you feel, and
dialog: again, I am neither labeling nor
dialog: judging them, are keeping you from
dialog: fulfilling your potential -- you're
dialog: in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery --
dialog: the Shenanigan's, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're right. I know.
speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: Will, your not getting off that easy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, but, I mean you know... I do

speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST

speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: I might understand that.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you find it hard to hide the fact
dialog: that you're gay?
speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: C'mon, I read your book. I talked to
dialog: you. It's just something I know to

speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: (a little laugh)
dialog: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

dialog: children.
speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: book's a best seller.
speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: You're getting defensive, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Look, man. I don't care if you're
dialog: putting from the rough. There are
dialog: solid arguments that some of the
dialog: greatest people in history were gay;
dialog: Alexander the Great, Caesar,
dialog: Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon,
dialog: Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny
dialog: Terrio, not many straight men can
dialog: dance like that.
speaker_heading: PSYCHOLOGIST
dialog: Who is "Danny Terrio?"
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your
dialog: shot. Take some pride in it. You go
dialog: to church? So fuckin' what, God loves
dialog: you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well
dialog: known as you? By the time you put
dialog: your disguise on and skulk out of
dialog: the house Sunday nights you probably

dialog: Will the chalk.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Have you ever played checkers?
text: Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts
text: drawing lines through the diagram, energized.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You color-code it. Half-red, half-
dialog: black. If that's an integer--
text: Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Half-red, half-black--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: --that?--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: --Half-red, half-black--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: --That edge!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: An integer.
text: The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two
text: gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: It would appear we got that proof in
dialog: under the wire after all. It's not
dialog: how hard you look at things, young
dialog: man, it's the way you look at them.
dialog: If you take aim before you fire, you
dialog: will find the most difficult problems
dialog: become, quite literally, child's
dialog: play.
text: Will gets his coat.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Will, you've managed to offend four
dialog: of my colleagues so much that they
dialog: refused to come back. You're meeting
dialog: with the leading hypnotist in the
dialog: country next week and Tom and I plan
dialog: to sit in on the sessions, so I expect
dialog: you to behave appropriately.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the HYPNOTIST.
text: Lambeau's assistant, TOM (33) takes notes. The Hypnotist
text: makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Shall we start the, uh...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You
dialog: guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: Yes, Will. We'll get to that. But
dialog: first, why don't you go to sleep for
dialog: me.
text: He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and
text: his EYES CLOSE. The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: Would you mind standing on one leg?
text: Will gets up and stands on one leg. Lambeau is impressed.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The
text: mood is more serious now.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now
dialog: how old are you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Seven.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: And what do you see?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Somethin's in my room.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: It's like a small figure, hoverin'
text: over me. Gettin' closer.
text: Will flinches.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: You're in a safe place, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's touching me.
text: Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau]
text: with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: Where is it touching you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Down there.
dialog: (indicating genitals)
dialog: And I'm nervous.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: You don't have to be nervous, Will.
text: Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: 'Cause I'm not ready.
dialog: (calming)
dialog: But the figure tells me everything's
dialog: gonna be all right. 'Cause the
dialog: figure's a Libra too. And we start
dialog: dancin' and it's beautiful--
text: Will breaks into song at full volume.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!"
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Oh Jesus.
text: The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door.
text: Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Wait a minute, Barry.
speaker_heading: HYPNOTIST
dialog: I have better ways to spend my time.
text: He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Oh, for God's sake, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this
dialog: one on me. He left, I wanted to talk
dialog: to him for another twenty minutes. I
dialog: was havin' fun.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I told you to cooperate with these
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece
dialog: of work.
text: Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of
dialog: Lambeau.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (spooky voice)
dialog: Look into my eyes. I don't need
dialog: therapy.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Get out, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay... don't forget to get another
dialog: therapist for next week.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That's enough.
text: Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I called Mel Weintraub this morning,
dialog: to check for availability.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: What's the point?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: There is somebody...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: He was my roommate in college.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY
text: This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class.
text: Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall
dialog: could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here
dialog: today.
text: Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired
text: of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the
text: tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Establishing trust is the most
dialog: important component in making
dialog: breakthroughs with a patient. Why?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maureen?
text: MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Keep up the good work, Maureen.
dialog: Vinnie?
speaker_heading: VINNIE looks up.
speaker_heading: VINNIE
dialog: Because trust is an important thing.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't
dialog: your brother give you the notes?
dialog: Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you
dialog: then they won't feel safe enough to
dialog: be honest with you -- then there's
dialog: no point to them being in therapy.
dialog: It's like saying -- "Fine, come here
dialog: and don't tell me a thing but go
dialog: home feeling like you're doing
dialog: something about your problems -- and
dialog: give me my fifty bucks before you
dialog: leave will ya'!"
text: He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If you don't help them trust you --
dialog: then there's no way you'll ever get
dialog: them to sleep with you. And that
dialog: should be the goal of any good
dialog: therapist. Insecure women, you know...
dialog: nail 'em when they're vulnerable,
dialog: that's always been my motto.
text: The students look up, somewhat stunned.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: See, I got Vinnie's attention.
text: Laughter. Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices
text: LAMBEAU standing in the back of the room. There is an awkward
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Gerry.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Sean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (to class)
dialog: Well, it seems we're in the presence
dialog: of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau
dialog: is a Field's Medal winner.
dialog: Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
text: The students stare blankly.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize
dialog: for math.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But it's only given out every four
dialog: years.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Okay, that's all for today. Try and
dialog: get through Fernald by Monday.
text: The class starts to pack up and file out. Lambeau approaches
text: Sean who steps down from the lectern.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Good to see you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Good to see you.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Is there someplace we can talk?

dialog: shouldn't have told you that...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I bet your parents were happy to

speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I was happy to pay. I inherited the

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Stanford. I'm leaving in June after
dialog: I graduate.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So you just want to use me and go?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Well, I'm gonna experiment on you
dialog: for my anatomy class, then go.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: In that case, fine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Want to see my magic trick?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Sure.
text: Will, pulls out a bulging HANDFUL OF CARAMELS.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels
dialog: disappear.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Okay...
text: Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics. Then

speaker_heading: SKYLAR

dialog: that's about how there's always this
dialog: tension on a first date where both

text: Will smiles.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I really don't 'date' that much.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No I haven't...
speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (mock protest)
dialog: No I wasn't...
speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL

text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Oh, you will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No... I was hoping to get a kiss.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now?

speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: This kid's special, Sean. I've never
dialog: seen anything like him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Not much free time, Gerry.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Have you ever heard of a man named
dialog: Ramanujan?
text: Sean nods his head.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: He was alive over a hundred years
dialog: ago. He was Indian. Dots, not
dialog: feathers...
text: Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny
dialog: hut in India. No formal education,
dialog: no access to other works. But he
dialog: came across an old math book and
dialog: from this basic text he was able to
dialog: extrapolate theories that had baffled
dialog: mathematicians for years.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And he mailed it to Hardy--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That's right, Sean. He mailed it to
dialog: a professor at Cambridge who
dialog: immediately recognized the brilliance
dialog: in his work and brought Ramanujan to
dialog: England.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Where he contracted pneumonia and
dialog: died at a young age--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: They worked together for the remainder
dialog: of their lives, producing some of
dialog: the most exciting math theory ever
dialog: done. Ramanujan's genius was
dialog: unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like
dialog: that. But he's very defensive and I
dialog: need someone who can get through to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I need someone with your kind of
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: My kind of background?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: You're from the same neighborhood.
dialog: South Boston.
speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Not Rick? You didn't send him to
dialog: Rick?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Just meet with the boy once a week.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Can we do it at my office?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That would be fine.
text: The waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Any vulnerability he senses, he'll
dialog: exploit.
speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, let's let the healing begin.

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Would you excuse us?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Tom.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You too, Gerry.
text: Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.
text: After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will
text: alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He
text: seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence
text: as Sean watches Will.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire.
text: A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and
dialog: sits.
text: He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally-
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Where are you from in Southie?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Did you buy all these books retail,
dialog: or do you send away for like a "shrink
dialog: kit" that comes with all these volumes
dialog: included?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Have you read all these books, Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Probably not.
speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: How about the ones on that shelf?
text: Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, I read those.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What did you think?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not here for a fuckin' book
dialog: report. They're your books, why
dialog: don't you read 'em?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That must have taken you a long time.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, it did take me a long time.
text: Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident
text: manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair
text: and goes to the shelf.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (looking at book)
dialog: "A History of the United States,
dialog: Volume I." If you want to read a
dialog: real history book, read Howard Zinn's
dialog: "A People's History of the United
dialog: States." That book will knock you on
dialog: your ass.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: How about Noam Chomsky's
dialog: "Manufacturing Consent?"
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You people baffle me. You spend all
dialog: this money on beautiful, fancy books--
dialog: and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Whatever blows your hair back.
text: Will returns to his chair. Pause.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (indicating cigarette)
dialog: Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.
dialog: Stunt your growth.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're right. It really gets in the
dialog: way of my jazzercizing.
text: Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He
text: remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his
text: face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you lift?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Nautilus?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Free weights.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: 285.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh.
text: Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's
text: painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You paint this?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah. Do you paint?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Crayons?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: This is a real piece of shit.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Tell me what you really think.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Poor color composition, lousy use of
dialog: space. But that shit doesn't really
dialog: concern me.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What does?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The color here, see how dark it is?
dialog: It's interesting.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I think you're one step away from
dialog: cutting your ear off.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You ever heard the saying, "any port
dialog: in a storm?"
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sure, how 'bout "still waters run
dialog: deep"-
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: --Well, maybe that means you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maybe what mea--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Maybe you were in the middle of a
dialog: storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the
text: waves were crashing over the bow,
text: the Goddamned mast was about to snap,
dialog: and you were crying for the harbor.
dialog: So you did what you had to do, to
dialog: get out. Maybe you became a

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maybe you should be a patient and
dialog: sit down.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Maybe you married the wrong woman.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Watch your mouth.

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come with me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER
text: Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.
text: They look out over a small pond, in which a group of
text: schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So what's with this place? You have
dialog: a swan fetish? Is this something
dialog: you'd like to talk about?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I was thinking about what you said
dialog: to me the other day, about my
dialog: painting. I stayed up half the night
dialog: thinking about it and then something
dialog: occurred to me and I fell into a
dialog: deep peaceful sleep and haven't
dialog: thought about you since. You know
dialog: what occurred to me?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You're just a boy. You don't have
dialog: the faintest idea what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why thank you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You've never been out of Boston.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So if I asked you about art you could
dialog: give me the skinny on every art book
dialog: ever written... Michelangelo? You
dialog: know a lot about him I bet. Life's
dialog: work, criticisms, political
dialog: aspirations. But you couldn't tell
dialog: me what it smells like in the Sistine
dialog: Chapel. You've never stood there and
text: looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
dialog: And if I asked you about women I'm
dialog: sure you could give me a syllabus of
dialog: your personal favorites, and maybe
dialog: you've been laid a few times too.
dialog: But you couldn't tell me how it feels
dialog: to wake up next to a woman and be
dialog: truly happy. If I asked you about
dialog: war you could refer me to a bevy of
dialog: fictional and non-fictional material,
dialog: but you've never been in one. You've
dialog: never held your best friend's head
dialog: in your lap and watched him draw his
dialog: last breath, looking to you for help.
dialog: And if I asked you about love I'd
dialog: get a sonnet, but you've never looked
text: at a woman and been truly vulnerable.
dialog: Known that someone could kill you
dialog: with a look. That someone could rescue
dialog: you from grief. That God had put an
dialog: angel on Earth just for you. And
dialog: you wouldn't know how it felt to be
dialog: her angel. To have the love be there
dialog: for her forever. Through anything,
dialog: through cancer. You wouldn't know
text: about sleeping sitting up in a
dialog: hospital room for two months holding
text: her hand and not leaving because the
dialog: doctors could see in your eyes that
dialog: the term "visiting hours" didn't
dialog: apply to you. And you wouldn't know
dialog: about real loss, because that only
dialog: occurs when you lose something you
dialog: love more than yourself, and you've
dialog: never dared to love anything that
dialog: much. I look at you and I don't see
dialog: an intelligent confident man, I don't
dialog: see a peer, and I don't see my equal.
dialog: I see a boy. Nobody could possibly
dialog: understand you, right Will? Yet you
dialog: presume to know so much about me
dialog: because of a painting you saw. You
dialog: must know everything about me. You're
dialog: an orphan, right?
text: Will nods quietly.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Do you think I would presume to know
dialog: the first thing about who you are
dialog: because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I
dialog: don't buy the argument that you don't
dialog: want to be here, because I think you
dialog: like all the attention you're getting.
dialog: Personally, I don't care. There's
dialog: nothing you can tell me that I can't
dialog: read somewhere else. Unless we talk
dialog: about your life. But you won't do
dialog: that. Maybe you're afraid of what
dialog: you might say.

speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: the seconds until the session was
dialog: over. It was pretty impressive,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: To show me he doesn't have to talk
dialog: to me if he doesn't want to.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: KRYSTYN
dialog: Hi, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You know, I was on this plane once.
dialog: And I'm sittin' there and the captain
dialog: comes on and is like "we'll be
dialog: cruising at 35,000 feet," and does
text: his thing, then he puts the mike
text: down but forgets to turn it off.
dialog: Then he says "man, all I want right
text: now is a blow-job and a cup of
dialog: coffee." So the stewardess goes
text: runnin' up towards the cock-pit to
dialog: tell him the mike's still on, and

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Haven't called her.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know what I'm doing. She's different

dialog: a really good time. She's smart,
dialog: beautiful, fun...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So Christ, call her up.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why? So I can realize she's not so
dialog: smart. That she's boring. You don't
dialog: get it. Right now she's perfect, I

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And right now you're perfect too.
dialog: Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
text: Will says nothing.
speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: through your entire life without
dialog: ever having to really know anybody.
text: Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: My wife used to turn the alarm clock
dialog: off in her sleep. I was late for
dialog: work all the time because in the
dialog: middle of the night she'd roll over
dialog: and turn the damn thing off.
dialog: Eventually I got a second clock and
dialog: put it under my side of the bed, but
dialog: it got to where she was gettin' to
dialog: that one too. She was afraid of the
text: dark, so the closet light was on all
dialog: night. Thing kept me up half the
dialog: night. Eventually I'd fall asleep,
dialog: out of sheer exhaustion and not wake
dialog: up when I was supposed to cause she'd

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: My wife's been dead two years, Will.
dialog: And when I think about her, those
dialog: are the things I think about most.
dialog: Little idiosyncrasies that only I
dialog: knew about. Those made her my wife.
dialog: And she had the goods on me too.
dialog: Little things I do out of habit.
dialog: People call these things imperfections
dialog: Will. It's just who we are. And we
dialog: get to choose who we're going to let
dialog: into out weird little worlds. You're
dialog: not perfect. And let me save you the
dialog: suspense, this girl you met isn't
dialog: either. The question is, whether or
dialog: not you're perfect for each other.
dialog: You can know everything in the world,
dialog: but the only way you're findin' that
dialog: one out is by giving it a shot. You
dialog: sure won't get the answer from an
dialog: old fucker like me. And even if I
dialog: did know, I wouldn't tell you.
text: Will smiles. A beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why not? You told me every other

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: wife?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What? Do I wonder if I'd be better
dialog: off if I never met my wife?
text: Will starts to clarify his question.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No, that's okay. It's an important
dialog: question. 'Cause you'll have your
dialog: bad times, which wake you up to the
dialog: good stuff you weren't paying
dialog: attention to. And you can fail, as
dialog: long as you're trying hard. But
dialog: there's nothing worse than regret.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't regret meetin' your wife?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why? Because of the pain I feel now?
dialog: I have regrets Will, but I don't

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: When did you know she was the one?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: October 21, 1975. Game six of the
dialog: World Series. Biggest game in Red
dialog: Sox history, Me and my friends slept
dialog: out on the sidewalk all night to get
dialog: tickets. We were sitting in a bar
dialog: waiting for the game to start and in
dialog: walks this girl. What a game that
text: was. Tie game in the bottom of the
dialog: tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk,
text: hit a long fly ball down the left
dialog: field line. Thirty-five thousand
text: fans on their feet, screamin' at the
dialog: ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin'
text: up the baseline, wavin' at the ball
text: like a madman. It hits the foul pole,
text: home run. Thirty-five thousand people
dialog: went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I was havin' a drink with my future
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to

dialog: never met?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't

dialog: eighteen, you slept out for tickets,
dialog: games gonna start in twenty minutes,

dialog: They let you get away with that?
speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: They could see that I meant it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're kiddin' me.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I
dialog: had gone to see that game I'd be in
dialog: here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a
dialog: bar twenty years ago. And how I always
dialog: regretted not goin' over there and
dialog: talkin' to her. I don't regret the
dialog: eighteen years we were married. I
dialog: don't regret givin' up counseling
dialog: for six years when she got sick. I

speaker_heading: PEKEC

speaker_heading: PEKEC
dialog: --But--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Look, I wrote it down.
text: They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The

dialog: cop goes "Stay here" And he goes
dialog: runnin' down the highway to deal
dialog: with the other crash. So, my Uncle
text: Marty's standin' on the side of the
dialog: road for a little while, and he's so
dialog: fuckin' lit, that he forgets what
dialog: he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck
text: it." He gets in his car and drives
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
text: So in the morning, there's a knock
dialog: on the door it's the Statie. So my
dialog: Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?"
dialog: And the Statie's like "I pulled you
dialog: over and you took off." And my
dialog: Uncle's like "I never seen you before
dialog: in my life, I been home all night
dialog: with my kids." And Statie's like
dialog: "Let me get in your garage!" So he's
dialog: like "All right, fine." He takes
text: around the garage and opens the door --
dialog: and the Statie's cruiser is in my
dialog: Uncle's garage.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: No way! You're kiddin'!
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: No, he was so hammered that he drove
text: the police cruiser home. Fuckin'
dialog: lights and everything!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Did your Uncle get arrested?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed
dialog: he didn't do anything. The fuckin'
dialog: guy had been drivin' around in my
dialog: Uncle's car all night lookin' for
dialog: the house.
text: Everyone is laughing. Skylar speaks above the din.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: There was this Irish guy, walking
text: down the beach one day.
text: She has everyone's attention. Will is nervous.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
text: And he comes across a bottle, and
text: this Genie pops out. The genie turns
dialog: to the Irishman and says -- "You've
dialog: released me from my prison, so I'll
dialog: grant you three wishes." The Irish
text: guy thinks for a minute and says
dialog: "What I really want is a pint of
dialog: Guiness that never empties." And --
text: POOF! A bottle appears. He slams it
dialog: down, and -- lo and behold -- it
text: fills back up again.
text: C/U of Will. Hoping the joke pans out.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Well, the Irish guy can't believe
text: it. He drinks it again, and again --
text: BOOM! It fills back up. So, while
text: the Irish guy is marveling at his
dialog: good fortune, The Genie is getting
dialog: impatient, because it's hot and he
dialog: wants to get on with his freedom. He
dialog: says "Let's go, you have two more
text: wishes." The Irish guy slams his
text: drink again, it fills back up, he's
text: still amazed. The Genie can't take
dialog: it anymore. He says "Buddy, I'm
dialog: boiling out here. What are your other
dialog: two wishes?"
dialog: (beat)
text: The Irish guy looks at his drink,
text: looks at the Genie and says... "I
dialog: guess I'll have two more of these."
text: The gang erupts with laughter.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE

speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thanks, Chuck.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Don't get too slap-happy, you're
dialog: takin' me home first.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE

text: More laughter.
speaker_heading: RECRUITER #1
dialog: In that case the boy could run

dialog: You say he doesn't have a diploma,

speaker_heading: RECRUITER #1
dialog: I don't need to see a driver's

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Seems like it's going well.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Well, have you talked to him at all
dialog: about his future?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We haven't really gotten into it.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Maybe you should. My phone's been
text: ringing off the hook with job offers.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Jobs doing what?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
text: Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks.
dialog: The kind of place where a mind like
text: Will's is given free reign.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That's great, Gerry, that there's
dialog: interest -- But I'm not sure he's
dialog: ready for that.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Sean, I really don't think you

speaker_heading: SEAN

text: Timmy comes over with the sandwiches.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Thanks, Timmy.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us?
dialog: We're trying to settle a bet.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Uh-oh.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Yeah, cured polio.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: You've heard of Albert Einstein?
text: Timmy smiles. Gives him a look.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard
dialog: of him?
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Okay thank you, Timmy.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: So who won the bet?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I did.
text: A beat. Timmy leaves.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: This isn't about me. I'm nothing
dialog: compared to this young man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of
dialog: Professors who were renowned for
dialog: their study of the universe. But it
dialog: was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk,
dialog: doing physics in his spare time, who
dialog: changed the world, Sean. Can you
dialog: imagine if Einstein had given that
dialog: up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies
dialog: in Vienna every night? All of us
dialog: would have lost something. And I'm
dialog: quite sure Timmy never would have
dialog: heard of him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He
dialog: just hasn't got the direction. We
dialog: can give that to him.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He married his cousin.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Einstein. Had two marriages, both
dialog: trainwrecks. The guy never saw his
dialog: kids, one of whom, I think, ended up
dialog: in an asylum- possible Unabomber
dialog: addition--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: You see, Sean? That's exactly not
dialog: the point. No one remembers that.
dialog: They--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Well, you're the only one.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: This boy can make contributions to
dialog: the world. We can help him do that.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Just... take it easy, Gerry.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Look, I don't know what else I can
dialog: say. I'm not sitting at home every
dialog: night, twisting my mustache and
text: hatching a plan to ruin the boy's
dialog: life. But it's important to start
dialog: early. I was doing advanced
dialog: mathematics at eighteen and it still
dialog: took me twenty-three years to do
dialog: something worthy of a Field's medal.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maybe he doesn't care about that.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Sean, this is important. And it's
dialog: above personal rivalry--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Now wait a minute, Gerry--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: No, no you hear me out, Sean. This
dialog: young man is a true prodigy--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Personal rivalry? I'm not getting
dialog: back at you.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Look, you took one road and I took
dialog: another. That's fine.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think
dialog: it's fine with you. Give him time to
dialog: figure out what he wants.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It
dialog: worked wonders for you.
text: A beat. Lambeau gets up.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Sean, I came here today out of
dialog: courtesy. I wanted to keep you in

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Since this is obviously not my first

text: Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating
text: "cash." The executives are baffled.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Look, we can do this the easy way or
dialog: the hard way.
text: The executives are completely blank.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: At the current time I am looking at
dialog: a number of different fields from
dialog: which to disseminate which offer is
dialog: most pursuant aid to my benefit.

dialog: What do you want? What do I want?
dialog: What does anybody want? Leniency.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: I'm not sure--
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: --These circumstances are mitigated.
dialog: Right now. They're mitigated.

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Okay...
text: Chuckie points to the third executive.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: He knows what I'm talking about.
text: The third executive is baffled.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: A retainer. Nobody in this town works
dialog: without a retainer. You think you
dialog: can find someone who does, you have
dialog: my blessin'. But I think we all know
dialog: that person isn't going to represent
dialog: you as well as I can.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Will, our offer starts you at eighty-
dialog: four thousand a year, plus benefits.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Retainer...
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: You want us to give you cash right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Allegedly, what I am saying is your
dialog: situation will be concurrently
dialog: improved if I had two hundred sheets
dialog: in my pocket right now.
text: The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: I don't think I... Larry?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: I have about seventy-three...
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Will you take a check?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Come now... what do you think I am,
dialog: a juvenile? You don't got any money
dialog: on you right now. You think I'm gonna
dialog: take a check?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: It's fine, John, I can cover the
dialog: rest.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: That's right, you know.
dialog: (turns to #1)
dialog: He knows.
text: Chuckie stands up and takes the money.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: (to exec #1)
dialog: You're suspect. I don't know what
dialog: your reputation is, but after the
dialog: shit you tried to pull today, you

speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Clearly.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're rich. What do you have to

speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: SKYLAR

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you play the piano?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Come one Will. I just want to know.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm trying to explain it to you. So

dialog: the keys, you see music, you see
dialog: Mozart.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well all right, Beethoven. He looked
text: at a piano and saw music. The fuckin'
dialog: guy was deaf when he composed the
dialog: Ode to Joy. They had to turn him
text: around to take a bow because he
dialog: couldn't hear the crowd going crazy
text: behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all
text: of that music in his head.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: So, do you play the piano?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Not a lick. I look at a piano and I
text: see black and white keys, three pedals
text: and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart,
dialog: they looked at it and it just made
text: sense to them. They saw a piano and
dialog: they could play. I couldn't paint
dialog: you a picture, I probably can't hit
dialog: the ball out of Fenway Park and I
dialog: can't play the piano--
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: But you can do my O-chem lab in under
dialog: an hour, you can--
speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: I couldn't go 'cause I had a date.
dialog: So I sent my chief negotiator.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Will, on your own time, you can do
dialog: what you like. When I set up a
dialog: meeting, with my associates, and you
dialog: don't show up it reflects poorly on
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Then don't set up any more meetings.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I'll cancel every meeting right now.
dialog: I'll give you a job myself. I just
dialog: wanted you to see what was out there.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Maybe I don't want to spend my life
dialog: sittin' around and explaining shit
dialog: to people.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: The least you can do is show me a
dialog: little appreciation.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (indicates proof)
dialog: You know how fuckin' easy this is to
dialog: me? This is a joke!
dialog: (crumples proof)
dialog: And I'm sorry you can't do this. I
dialog: really am. 'Cause if you could I
dialog: wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble
dialog: around and fuck it up.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Sure, then you'd have more time to
dialog: sit around and get drunk. Think of
dialog: how many fights you could have been
dialog: in by now.
text: Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIRE.
text: Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees and
text: puts it out. He looks up at Will.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: You're right, Will. I can't do that
dialog: proof and you can. And when it comes
dialog: to this there are only twenty people
dialog: in the world that can tell the
dialog: difference between you and me. But
dialog: I'm one of them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: So am I.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I
dialog: wish I never met you. Because then I
dialog: could sleep at night. I wouldn't
dialog: have to walk around with the knowledge
dialog: that someone like you was out there.
dialog: And I wouldn't have to watch you
dialog: throw it all away.
text: Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the
text: wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Will and Skylar lie in bed. Skylar watches Will sleep. She
text: gets up and goes to the fridge. Returning to the bed:
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Will? Are you awake?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Come with me to California.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I want you to come with me.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I know. I just do.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, but how do you know?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I don't know. I just feel it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And you're sure about that?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Yeah, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: 'Cause that's a serious thing you're
dialog: sayin'. I mean, we might be in
dialog: California next week and you could
dialog: find out somethin' about me that you
dialog: don't like. And you might feel like
dialog: "hey this is a big mistake."
dialog: (getting upset)
dialog: But you can't take it back, 'cause
dialog: you know it's real serious and you
dialog: can't take somethin' like that back.
dialog: Now I'm in California, 'cause you
dialog: asked me to come. But you don't really
dialog: want me there. And I'm stuck in
dialog: California with someone who really
dialog: doesn't want me there and just wishes
text: they had a take-back.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: "Take-back?" What is that? I don't
dialog: want a take-back. I want you to come
dialog: to California with me.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I can't go out to California.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: One, because I have a job here and
dialog: two because I live here--
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, Will if you're not in love
dialog: with me, you can say that.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Then what are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you mean "What am I afraid
dialog: of?"
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Why won't you come with me? What are
dialog: you so scared of?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What am I scared of?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Well, what aren't you scared of?
dialog: You live in your safe little world
dialog: where nobody challenges you and you're
dialog: scared shitless to do anything else--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't tell me about my world. You're
dialog: the one that's afraid. You just want
dialog: to have your little fling with the
text: guy from the other side of town and
dialog: marry--
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Is that what you think--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: some prick from Stanford that your
dialog: parents will approve of. Then you'll
dialog: sit around with the rest of the upper
dialog: crust kids and talk about how you
dialog: went slummin' too.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I inherited that money when I was
dialog: thirteen, when my father died.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: At least you have a mother.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Fuck you! You think I want this?
dialog: That money's a burden to me. Every
dialog: day I wake up and I wish I could
dialog: give that back. I'd give everything
dialog: I have back to spend one more day
dialog: with my father. But that's life. And
dialog: I deal with it. So don't put that
dialog: shit on me. You're the one that's
dialog: afraid.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What the fuck am I afraid of?!
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: You're afraid of me. You're afraid
dialog: that I won't love you back. And guess
dialog: what? I'm afraid too. But at least
dialog: I have the balls to it give it a
dialog: shot. At least I'm honest with you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not honest?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: What about your twelve brothers?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, is that what this is about? You
dialog: want to hear that I don't really
dialog: have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin'
dialog: orphan? Is that what you want to
dialog: hear?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, you don't want to hear that.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Yes, I do, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't want to hear that I got
dialog: cigarettes put out on me when I was
dialog: a little kid. That this isn't surgery.
text: Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't want to hear that. Don't
dialog: tell me you want to hear that shit!!
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Yes I do. Did you ever think that
dialog: maybe I could help you? That maybe
dialog: that's the point, that we're a team?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What, you want to come in here and
dialog: save me? Is that what you want to
dialog: do? Do I have a sign that says "save
dialog: me" on my back?
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I don't want to "save" you. I just
dialog: want to be with you. I love you. I
dialog: love you!
text: Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin'
dialog: bullshit me!
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: (standing up to him)
dialog: You know what I want to hear? I
dialog: want to hear that you don't love me.
dialog: If you tell me that, then I'll leave
dialog: you alone. I won't ask any questions
dialog: and I won't be in your life.
text: A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't love you.
text: He walks out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- NIGHT
text: Will leaves pulling on his clothes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY
text: Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and
text: ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and
text: looking sharp in twin navy blue suits.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So why do you think I should work
dialog: for the National Security Agency?
speaker_heading: DYTRESS
dialog: Well, you'd be working on the cutting
dialog: edge. You'd be exposed to the kind
dialog: of technology you couldn't see
dialog: anywhere else because we've classified
dialog: it. Super string theory, Chaos Math,
dialog: Advanced algorithms--
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Codebreaking.
speaker_heading: DYTRESS
dialog: That's one aspect of what we do.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on, that's what you do. You
dialog: handle more than eighty percent of
dialog: the intelligence workload. You're
dialog: seven times the size of the C.I.A.
speaker_heading: DYTRESS
dialog: That's exactly right, Will. So the
dialog: question as I see it isn't "why should
dialog: you work for N.S.A." it's "why
dialog: shouldn't you?"
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why shouldn't I work for the National
dialog: Security Agency? That's a tough one.
text: Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHUCKIE'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy
text: cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both
text: boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear
text: the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE
text: emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in
dialog: my mom's room again I'm gonna give
dialog: you a fuckin' beatin'!
text: After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: What's up guys?
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Why don't you beat off at your house?
speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: So I won't just be a construction
dialog: worker.
scene_heading: INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I never cared about that.
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: I love you, Will.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No take-backs.
text: Will says nothing.
speaker_heading: SKYLAR
dialog: Will?

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- SAME

text: BASEBALL CARD. Will has to smile. Lambeau looks up.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: What are you smiling at?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
text: Will can see that Lambeau wants more.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Pudge Fisk. You follow baseball?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOGAN AIRPORT TERMINAL -- SAME

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- SAME
text: Will, holding the card, reflects for a beat and puts it down.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean
dialog: told me. It's a long story.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You all set?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: I've got the first part. The rest I
dialog: can do at home.
text: Will gets up.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me
dialog: just about every hour. They're very
dialog: excited about how the meeting went.
text: Lambeau is excited. Will clearly is not.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Will sits across from Sean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So you might be working for Uncle
dialog: Sam.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Gerry says the meeting went well.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What did you think?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What did I think?
text: A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody
text: puts a code on my desk, something
dialog: nobody else can break. So I take a
dialog: shot at it and maybe I break it. And
dialog: I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I
dialog: did my job well. But maybe that
dialog: code was the location of some rebel
dialog: army in North Africa or the Middle
dialog: East. Once they have that location,
text: they bomb the village where the rebels
dialog: were hiding and fifteen hundred people
dialog: I never had a problem with get killed.
dialog: (rapid fire) Now the politicians are
dialog: sayin' "send in the Marines to secure
dialog: the area" 'cause they don't give a
dialog: shit. It won't be their kid over
dialog: there, gettin' shot. Just like it
dialog: wasn't them when their number got
dialog: called, 'cause they were pullin' a
dialog: tour in the National Guard. It'll be
text: some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel
dialog: in the ass. And he comes home to
dialog: find that the plant he used to work
dialog: at got exported to the country he
dialog: just got back from. And the guy who
dialog: put the shrapnel in his ass got his
dialog: old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen
dialog: cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
dialog: Meanwhile my buddy from Southie
dialog: realizes the only reason he was over
dialog: there was so we could install a
dialog: government that would sell us oil at
dialog: a good price. And of course the oil
dialog: companies used the skirmish to scare
dialog: up oil prices so they could turn a
text: quick buck. A cute, little ancillary
dialog: benefit for them but it ain't helping
dialog: my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And
dialog: naturally they're takin' their sweet
dialog: time bringin' the oil back and maybe
dialog: even took the liberty of hiring an
dialog: alcoholic skipper who likes to drink
dialog: seven and sevens and play slalom
dialog: with the icebergs and it ain't too
text: long 'til he hits one, spills the
dialog: oil, and kills all the sea-life in
dialog: the North Atlantic. So my buddy's
dialog: out of work and he can't afford to
dialog: drive so he's got to walk to the job
dialog: interviews which sucks 'cause the
text: shrapnel in his ass is givin' him
text: chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile
dialog: he's starvin' 'cause every time he
text: tries to get a bite to eat the only
dialog: blue-plate special they're servin'
dialog: is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker
dialog: State.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So what'd I think? I'm holdin' out
dialog: for somethin' better. I figure I'll
dialog: eliminate the middle man. Why not
dialog: just shoot my buddy, take his job
dialog: and give it to his sworn enemy, hike
dialog: up gas prices, bomb a village, club
text: a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and
dialog: join the National Guard? Christ, I
dialog: could be elected President.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Do you think you're alone?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Do you have a soul-mate?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Define that.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Someone who challenges you in every
dialog: way. Who takes you places, opens
dialog: things up for you. A soul-mate.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah.
text: Sean waits.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost,
dialog: O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: They're all dead.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not to me, they're not.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But you can't give back to them,
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not without a heater and some serious
dialog: smelling salts, no...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll
dialog: never have that kind of relationship
dialog: in a world where you're afraid to
dialog: take the first step because all you're
dialog: seeing are the negative things that
text: might happen ten miles down the road.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, what? You're going to take the
dialog: professor's side on this?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Don't give me your line of shit.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I didn't want the job.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It's not about that job. I'm not
dialog: saying you should work for the
dialog: government. But, you could do anything
dialog: you want. And there are people who
dialog: work their whole lives layin' brick
dialog: so their kids have a chance at the
dialog: kind of opportunity you have. What
dialog: do you want to do?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I didn't ask for this.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.
dialog: That's a cop-out.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Why is it a cop-out? I don't see
dialog: anythin' wrong with layin' brick,
dialog: that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.
dialog: Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's
dialog: gonna get to work the next day 'cause
dialog: of me. There's honor in that.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You're right, Will. Any man who takes
dialog: a forty minute train ride so those
dialog: college kids can come in in the
dialog: morning and their floors will be
dialog: clean and their trash cans will be
dialog: empty is an honorable man.
text: A beat. Will says nothing.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And when they get drunk and puke in
dialog: the sink, they don't have to see it
dialog: the next morning because of you.
dialog: That's real work, Will. And there is
dialog: honor in that. Which I'm sure is
dialog: why you took the job.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I just want to know why you decided
text: to sneak around at night, writing on
text: chalkboards and lying about it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 'Cause there's no honor in that.
text: Will is silent.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Something you want to say?
text: Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why don't you come back when you
dialog: have an answer for me.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If you won't answer my questions,
dialog: you're wasting my time.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
text: Will loses it, slams the door shut.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Sean has finally gotten to Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who the fuck are you to lecture me
dialog: about life? You fuckin' burnout!
dialog: Where's your "soul-mate?!"
text: Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Dead! She dies and you just cash in
dialog: your chips. That's a fuckin' cop-
dialog: out!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I been there. I played my hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's right. And you fuckin' lost!
dialog: And some people would have the sack
dialog: to lose a big hand like that and
dialog: still come back and ante up again!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Look at me. What do you want to do?
text: A beat. Will looks up.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You and your bullshit. You got an
dialog: answer for everybody. But I asked
dialog: you a straight question and you can't
dialog: give me a straight answer. Because
dialog: you don't know.

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE

speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: It's a way outta here.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do I want a way outta here for?

dialog: neighbor. I want to take out kids to
dialog: little league together up Foley Field.
speaker_heading: CHUCKIE
dialog: Look, you're my best friend, so don't
dialog: take this the wrong way, but in 20
dialog: years, if you're livin' next door to

speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: have a few laughs. But you know what
dialog: the best part of my day is? The ten
text: seconds before I knock on the door
dialog: 'cause I let myself think I might
dialog: get there, and you'd be gone. I'd
dialog: knock on the door and you wouldn't
dialog: be there. You just left.

dialog: that.

scene_heading: INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: This is a disaster! I brought you in
dialog: here to help me with this boy, not
dialog: to run him out--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Now wait a minute--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: --And confuse him--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: --Gerry--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: And here I am for the second week in
dialog: a row with my professional reputation
dialog: at stake--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hold on!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Ready to falsify documents because
dialog: you've given him license to walk
dialog: away from this.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I know what I'm doing and I know why
dialog: I'm here!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Look Sean, I don't care if you have
dialog: a rapport with the boy -- I don't
dialog: care if you have a few laughs --
dialog: even at my expense! But don't you
dialog: dare undermine what I'm trying to do
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: "Undermine?"
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: He has a gift and with that gift
dialog: comes responsibility. And you don't
dialog: understand that he's at a fragile
dialog: point--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He is at a fragile point. He's got
dialog: problems--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: What problems does he have, Sean,
text: that he is better off as a janitor
dialog: or in jail or hanging around with--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: He can handle the work, he can handle
dialog: the pressure and he's obviously
dialog: handled you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor?
dialog: Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because
dialog: the first thing that happened to him
dialog: was that he was abandoned by the
dialog: people who were supposed to love him
dialog: the most!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Oh, come on, Sean--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And why does he hang out with his
dialog: friends? Because any one of those
dialog: kids would come in here and take a
dialog: bat to your head if he asked them
dialog: to. It's called loyalty!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Oh, that's nice--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And who do you think he's handling?
text: He pushes people away before they
dialog: have a chance to leave him. And for
dialog: 20 years he's been alone because of
dialog: that. And if you try to push him
dialog: into this, it's going to be the same
dialog: thing all over again. And I'm not
dialog: going to let that happen to him!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Now don't do that. Don't you do that!
dialog: Don't infect him with the idea that
dialog: it's okay to quit. That it's okay to
dialog: be a failure, because it's not okay!
dialog: If you're angry at me for being
dialog: successful, for being what you could
dialog: have been--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: --I'm not angry at you--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Yes you are, Sean. You resent me.
dialog: And I'm not going to apologize for
dialog: any success that I've had.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: --I don't have any anger at you--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Yes you do. You're angry at me for
dialog: doing what you could have done. Ask
dialog: yourself if you want Will to feel
dialog: that way for the rest of his life,
dialog: to feel like a failure.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That's it. That's why I don't come
dialog: to the goddamn reunions! Because I
dialog: can't stand the look in your eye
dialog: when you see me! You think I'm a
dialog: failure! I know who I am. I'm proud
dialog: of who I am. And all of you, you
dialog: think I'm some kind of pity case!
dialog: You with your sycophant students
dialog: following you around. And your Goddamn
dialog: Medal!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: Is that what this is about, Sean?
dialog: The Field's Medal? Do you want me to
dialog: go home and get it for you? Then
dialog: will you let the boy--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don't want your trophy and I don't
dialog: give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew
dialog: you when!! You and Jack and Tom
dialog: Sanders. I knew you when you were
text: homesick and pimply-faced and didn't
dialog: know what side of the bed to piss
dialog: on!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: That's right! You were smarter than
dialog: us then and you're smarter than us
dialog: now! So don't blame me for how your
dialog: life turned out. It's not my fault.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don't blame you! It's not about
dialog: that! It's about the boy! 'Cause
dialog: he's a good kid! And I won't see
dialog: this happen to him- won't see you
dialog: make him feel like a failure too!
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: He won't be a failure!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If you push him into something, if
dialog: you ride him--
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am
dialog: today because I was pushed. And
dialog: because I learned to push myself!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: He's not you!
text: A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns
text: to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I can come back.
speaker_heading: LAMBEAU
dialog: No, that's fine, Will. I was just
dialog: leaving.
text: There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well, I'm here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, is that my problem? I'm afraid
dialog: of being abandoned? That was easy.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Look, a lot of that stuff goes back
dialog: a long way. And it's between me and
dialog: him and it has nothing to do with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you want to talk about it?
text: Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh, this is your file. I have to
dialog: send it back to the Judge with my
dialog: evaluation.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're not going to fail me are you?
text: Sean smiles.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So what's it say?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You want to read it?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you had any experience with
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Twenty years of counseling you see a

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, have you had any experience with

speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: the worst of the beatings were between
dialog: me and my brother. We would practice

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Cause fuck him, that's why.
text: A long quiet moment.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Is that why me and Skylar broke up?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I didn't know you had. Do you want
