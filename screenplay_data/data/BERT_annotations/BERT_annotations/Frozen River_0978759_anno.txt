scene_heading: 1 EXT. INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - DAY 1
text: A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."
text: A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
dialog: Lawrence River.
text: Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
text: officials inspect and question impatient drivers.
text: Beyond them a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
dialog: MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
dialog: you".
scene_heading: 2 EXT. BELOW THE BRIDGE - DAY 2
text: The river stretches for miles in either direction,
text: frozen, and still with trees on either side.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD, MASSENA NEW YORK - DAY 3
text: RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red
text: ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger
text: seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open,
text: smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in
text: the cold morning air.
text: Her bare feet rest on the cold ground.
text: Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her
text: on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small
text: SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE.
text: Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski
text: lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a
text: SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride.
text: Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land.
text: After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR.,
text: leans out the trailer door.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: We're out of Capt'n Crunch.
text: His breath is visible in the cold.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just give him toast.
dialog: 2.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: We got no butter, we got no jelly.
text: Ray is out of ideas. He expects her to move, but she
text: stays still. He looks around the yard.
speaker_heading: T.J. (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Listening for the trucks.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Are they really coming?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Where's dad?
text: She is silent.
speaker_heading: T.J. (CONT'D)
dialog: (says it slow)
dialog: Where's dad?
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know how he found it, T.J.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Found what?
text: Ray takes a drag off her cigarette. T.J. walks over to
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: T.J. (CONT'D)
dialog: The money?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: I locked it in my glove compartment.
text: T.J. looks in at the OPEN AND EMPTY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: That was stupid.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were
text: coming before the bank opened.
dialog: 3.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Did you tell him you had it?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!?
dialog: That's the stupidest place you could have
dialog: put it.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost
dialog: thirty two months. I thought it would be
dialog: okay!
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Did he leave anything?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: T.J. (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: You could look for him?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He could be anywhere.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: We should look for him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where?
dialog: T.J.
dialog: The Rez,
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: With more than four thousand dollars,
text: he's probably in Atlantic City by now.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: So let's go, let's find him before he
dialog: blows it all.
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I can't.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I just can't do it anymore.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: But he'll lose it all.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: T.J., we can't make him stop.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: He stole our money. Call the Troopers.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's not stealing if you take it from
dialog: your family. Anyway, he made some of it,
dialog: too.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: So you're just gonna sit there?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: In the distance the RUMBLE OF TRUCKS. Ray hears it. It
text: gets louder.
dialog: T.J.
text: Another Christmas in the tin crapper.
text: T.J. goes into the shed and slams the door.
text: Ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer.
scene_heading: 4 INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY 4
text: She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized
text: RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV.
text: An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her
text: eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced
text: smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture.
text: Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off
text: her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into
text: a pair or jeans and a t-shirt.
dialog: 5.
text: A sleepy-eyed, toe-headed boy, RICKY, 5, walks in,
text: shirtless in pajama bottoms, eyes shining.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Is it here?
text: Ray stops what she's doing when she sees him and kneels
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey, little sleepy head.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.
text: He drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the
dialog: corner.
text: The RUMBLE OUTSIDE GROWS LOUDER. Ricky BOLTS out of the
text: bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Wait a sec-
text: He bursts into the yard where:
scene_heading: 5 EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY 5
text: A PICK-UP TRUCK DRAPED WITH A "WIDE LOAD" banner leads
text: TWO SEMIS hauling halves of a DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME
text: wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind.
text: Ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly,
text: trying not to pee himself.
text: T.J. comes out of the shed.
text: The Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard.
text: GUY VERSAILLES, pot-bellied, in a green velour running
text: suit, squeezes out of his truck. On the door: "MASSENA
text: MODULAR AND MOBILE HOMES, NEW AND RECONDITIONED."
text: Ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and
text: tries to climb the side of it. The TRUCK DRIVER looks
text: down from his cab.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: (to Ricky)
dialog: Get down.
text: Ray peeks out the kitchen curtain.
dialog: 6.
text: After a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a
text: pasted-on smile.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're all ready for ya'.
text: She points to the new concrete foundation. He consults a
text: clipboard.
speaker_heading: VERSAILLES
dialog: We'll need the balloon payment to unload.
text: T.J. looks at Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We have it, it's just that they called
dialog: Troy from Titus last night. That's where
dialog: Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-
speaker_heading: VERSAILLES
dialog: Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It was some emergency with the lifts. So
text: he took off without thinking with the
dialog: money. Completely forgot you were coming.
dialog: So as soon as he gets back-
speaker_heading: VERSAILLES
dialog: When's he gonna be back?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: As soon as he can get here, I'll just run
dialog: it down to you.
text: T.J. could crawl out of his skin.
speaker_heading: VERSAILLES
dialog: (ironic smile)
dialog: This is the second time you've dragged me
dialog: out here. If you don't come up with it by
dialog: Christmas, you've lost your fifteen
dialog: hundred dollar deposit.
text: He walks toward his car. She follows him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at
dialog: ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna
dialog: make me a manager after Christmas so I
dialog: can handle the payments if you just leave
dialog: the house-
dialog: 7.
text: He gets in the car.
speaker_heading: VERSAILLES
dialog: Call me when you have the balloon
dialog: payment.
text: He makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's
text: rev their engines and grind into reverse.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'll call you...
text: Her voice is DROWNED OUT by REVVING engines.
text: Ricky rushes to her.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Wait, where are they going?
text: She takes his face in her hands.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen to me. We'll get them back.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: But why are they leaving?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise,
dialog: honey.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: That's our house!
text: He BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing
text: after the semis. Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out
text: of steam and stops, panting.
text: She catches up to him and tries to hug him. He pushes her
text: away. She gets down on her knees and takes his face in
text: her hands.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We're gonna get it back.
text: She picks him up and walks back to the trailer. Ricky
text: looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to T.J.)
dialog: You better hurry or you're going to miss
dialog: the bus. Let's get your clothes on,
dialog: Ricky.
dialog: 8.
text: T.J. just stares at her.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: I can get a job you know.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're 15, T.J.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: They won't ask any questions.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're finishing school.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Come on, you don't think we can live on
dialog: what you make at All for a Dollar do you?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're going to school.
text: She goes inside. T.J. follows.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: I bet I could make more than you do.
text: She ignores him.
scene_heading: 6 INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY 6
text: Ray helps Ricky into his clothes and puts his backpack on
text: his back.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Where's daddy?
text: Ray and T.J. look at each other.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He'll be back.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Aren't we even gonna look for him?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No! I'm going to work and you're going to
dialog: school.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: That's it?
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: The only thing that changed is that your
dialog: dad started gambling again. Everything
dialog: else is the same.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Where did he go?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He had to take a business trip.
text: T.J. rolls his eyes.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Aren't you even gonna look for him?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And miss a day of work? No. Not again.
dialog: We just have to live our lives. Now go
dialog: get your backpack.
text: T.J. stares, sullen.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on!
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: When is daddy coming home?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know, Ricky.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: I can't believe you're not even gonna
dialog: look for him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer)
dialog: T.J.
dialog: The reservation.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I told you, he could be in Atlantic City
dialog: by now.
text: She helps Ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: The glove compartment. That's so stupid.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're going to school.
dialog: 10.
text: He follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus
text: rolling up out front.
text: Suddenly, Ray remembers:
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, wait.
text: They turn around. She digs in her pockets.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. Lunch money.
text: They take it and keep running for the bus.
text: Ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. She
text: takes out her second to last one. She lights it and takes
text: out her mascara.
text: She tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears
dialog: keep getting in the way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 7 INT. ALL FOR A DOLLAR STORE - DAY 7
text: RAY stacks shelves with a knock-off version of plastic
text: "My Little Pony" in a messy aisle of boxes.
text: MATT, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Matt. Could I talk to you?
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to come on full-time.
text: Matt blinks with a blank expression then:
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I see you as a short timer.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: A short timer. Not here for long, not
dialog: really committed.
text: Ray follows him to the stock room.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: When I started you said it would be six
dialog: months before I could come on full-time.
dialog: And that was two years ago.
text: He opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's my opinion.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Well, I mean, you know, I do show up.
text: Pat's late everyday. She's late now.
dialog: She's always late.
text: He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else
text: to say. He walks out.
text: Ray resumes unpacking ponies.
text: A moment later PAT, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. As Pat
text: hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her
text: low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'?".
text: Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and
text: heads out the back door.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: See ya' tomorrow.
scene_heading: 8 INT./EXT HORIZON, ROUTE 37 - DAY 8
text: Ray drives down a two-lane highway. It is empty flat land
text: but for a few trailer homes and barns.
text: She passes a lonely sign: "BRIDGE TO CANADA."
text: Up ahead another sign: "AKWESASNE LAND OF THE MOHAWK."
text: From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses
text: with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with

dialog: the cold.
scene_heading: MOHAWK TEENAGER
dialog: Fill it up?
text: She rolls down the window, digging for change under the
text: seat of her car. She counts it out.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Just three...uh, no...two seventy one,
dialog: two, three, four.
scene_heading: MOHAWK TEENAGER
dialog: Two seventy four.
text: He nods and goes to the pump. She finds a wadded up five
dialog: dollar bill.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (yells out window)
dialog: Make that seven seventy four.
text: She spots a sign for "TRAILWAYS" bus in the window.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here
dialog: last night?
scene_heading: MOHAWK TEENAGER
dialog: Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked
dialog: until 9 PM. You can ask inside.
text: Ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for
text: a few older Mohawk women.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, that's okay.
scene_heading: MOHAWK TEENAGER
dialog: Did you want to support our Mosquito
dialog: Lacrosse League. It teaches basic

scene_heading: 11 EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE PARKING LOT - DAY 11
text: Ray pulls up alongside the Acclaim and recognizes it by
text: the "EASY DOES IT" bumper sticker.
text: She gets out and looks inside. There is a small plastic T-
text: Rex on the floor of the backseat.
text: She leans against the car for a moment.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you
dialog: thank you...
text: After a moment Ray looks up at the Bingo Palace and heads

text: Acclaim stops in front of a rusted out BUBBLE CAMPER.
text: Lila gets out. Ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's my car.
text: Lila SPINS around.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (points to the Acclaim)
dialog: What are you doing with my car?
text: Lila fingers the keys in her hand.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: That? I found it.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You stole it.
speaker_heading: LILA
text: The keys were in it.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: So you just took it...?

text: door and takes out her cell phone.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll just see what the troopers say
dialog: about that.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)
dialog: (From inside camper)
dialog: Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here.

text: car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (knocks with the gun)
dialog: You can cut the bullshit and give me my
dialog: keys now.
text: There is no reponse. Ray waits for a moment and then:
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)

text: Ray looks at her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This is New York State so quit the

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: This camper belongs to my brother in law.
dialog: He won't like this.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: Then you should quit stealing cars.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I thought it was abandoned, the guy
text: driving it got on a bus.
text: Ray stops.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Did you see where the bus was headed?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.

speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Why's that?

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: He's always looking for cars with button-
dialog: release trunks.
text: Ray thinks about it.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: He don't need papers or anything.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Does he use them to rob banks or
dialog: something?
text: Lila shrugs.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: All I know is he pays good for a car like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Where does he live?
speaker_heading: LILA
text: Through the woods. Not far.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's in it for you?
speaker_heading: LILA

scene_heading: EVERGREEN TREES.
speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: RAY
text: Tap the bottom of his feet.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That's what they did to get Ricky

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
dialog: Your left rear parking light is not

scene_heading: 98 INT. BOB'S MOTEL - SAME 98

text: She carefully opens it to a small office with a desk,

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We found him.

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't

speaker_heading: TROOPER NAPOLI
dialog: How did you happen to meet her?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby
dialog: sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I
dialog: get my gas.
speaker_heading: TROOPER NAPOLI
dialog: I just thought you should be aware of

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh my God.
text: He nods his head.
speaker_heading: TROOPER NAPOLI
dialog: If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter.

speaker_heading: TROOPER NAPOLI

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Put it down.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Put it down.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Are you gonna shoot me now, too?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Put that thing down!
text: He ignites the blow torch to spite her.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his

dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: That was an accident.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Some accident you shot him in the foot.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He spent the food money on scratch cards,

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
