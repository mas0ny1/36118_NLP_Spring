scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT - DURHAM, NC 1
text: Cold opens to two cops driving in a police car. Stark,
text: dramatic feel, like THE SHIELD. Opening credits roll over the
text: scene. The radio cackles alive.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (0.S.)
dialog: Attention all units, attack in
text: progress at 742 Evergreen Terrace.
text: Screaming woman heard from inside
dialog: the residence. Respond Code 3.
text: The cop driving picks up the CB unit and turns on the lights
text: and siren.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: 5430, show us responding, we'll be
text: at scene in under a minute.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: 5430, additional person reporting
dialog: stated they still hear screaming.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Roger. Keep the PR on the line. Do
dialog: they have a suspect description?
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
text: Negative. Reporting sound of glass
dialog: breaking.
text: The cops look at each other ominously, slam on the gas pedal.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 2
text: The car pulls to a stop and the cops jump out. Loud, guttural
text: female groaning and a crash from the apartment. They check
text: the windows, curtains are closed, so they kick in the door.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 3
text: Cops bust in, see a naked girl bent over a sofa arm being
text: fucked hard from behind by a naked guy. Her arms are tied
text: together behind her back, and he is holding them and spanking
text: her, like a jockey. A lamp is in pieces on the floor, clothes
text: are strewn around the apartment. They have their backs to the
text: door and her screams are so loud they don’t hear the cops.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: STOP! Get your hands up and move
dialog: away from the woman!
text: COP 1 tackles the guy, he screams in shock. COP 2 pulls the
text: girl away and wraps his coat over her naked body.
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: Are you ok, Miss?
text: She grunts and tries moving her hands but can’t because they
text: are tied up. COP 2 unties her, ANGLE ON COP 1, his knee in
text: the back of the guy, cuffing him.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I have money in my wallet, just
dialog: take it!!
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: This is the police, shut up and
dialog: stop resisting.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: WHAT!? Why are you hand-cuffing me?
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Shut up! Stop resisting!
text: The cop secures the cuffs and takes out his Tazer.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What is going on?!? Why are you
dialog: arresting me?!?
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Shut up. This is your last warning.
text: He points the tazer at Tucker, who looks up in shock.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: DON'T TAZE ME, BRO!!!
text: COP 2 comes over tentatively and taps on COP 1’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: Uh...hey Partner, you might want to
dialog: take a look at this.
text: COP 1 turns to see the girl, the policeman’s jacket barely
text: covering her, furiously signing at him and making the grunty
text: noises deaf people make when they try to talk.
speaker_heading: COP 2 (CONT'D)
dialog: She's deaf.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: She's what?
text: The deaf girl gets in COP 1’s face and signs, exaggeratedly,
text: while also speaking in an unmodulated voice of a deaf person.
speaker_heading: DEAF GIRL
dialog: I! AM! DEAF!
text: The expression on COP 1’s face goes from intense to confused.
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: We don't have a crime. She says the
dialog: sex was consensual.
speaker_heading: DEAF GIRL
dialog: He wasn’t raping me, he was fucking
dialog: me. You know, fucking!
text: She points her finger at her crotch, moving her hips back and
text: forth. The three of them stand there for a beat.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Now that we have that cleared up,
dialog: you two think you could leave?
speaker_heading: DEAF GIRL
dialog: I was about to cum!
text: Screen goes to black, and the masthead appears:
text: I HOPE THEY SERVE BEER IN HELL
text: Opening credits roll as...
scene_heading: EXT. LAW SCHOOL - DAY 4
text: TUCKER, 24, handsome and self-possessed, pulls his car into
text: the parking lot, and gives the Guy Head Nod to a familiar
text: passer-by as he strides coolly into the law school.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Ever fuck a deaf chick? Of course
dialog: you haven't.
scene_heading: INT. LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 5
text: In the common area of the law library, a mixed group is
text: sitting around bullshitting instead of studying.
speaker_heading: FRIEND #1
dialog: (a girl)
dialog: I still can’t believe you're
dialog: getting married, Jeff.
dialog: *
speaker_heading: FRIEND #2
dialog: I can’t believe she said yes.
text: The group laughs as we ANGLE on JEFF, 24, a thick-necked, ex-
dialog: high school athlete no one has ever accused of being a nerd.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Shit, man, I’m starting to regret
dialog: that she didn’t say no. This
dialog: wedding planning stuff is nuts. I
dialog: spent all night looking through
dialog: wedding magazines and books of
text: white flowers. Just white.
speaker_heading: FRIEND #2
dialog: Jesus. I hope I never have to get
dialog: married.
text: ANGLE ON Tucker entering the library.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: With your face, I think you’re
dialog: safe.
text: Tucker stands behind Jeff with a smile waiting for Jeff to
text: notice him while the friends at the table gawk at Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Raise your hand if you've ever
dialog: fucked a deaf girl.
text: A beat. Jeff whips around as Tucker smiles deviously and
text: slowly raises his hand. The group bursts into hysterics.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: Bullshit!
dialog: No way.
dialog: Deaf girls are hot.
dialog: Lies.
dialog: Can you hear me now?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You had sex with a deaf chick?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You're deaf too now?
text: Tucker starts mock-signing.
dialog: + eH
dialog: *
dialog: *
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: (in a mongoloid voice)
dialog: Yes, Jeff, I had sex with a deaf
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Didn’t you hook up with a mute girl
dialog: last semester? You’re 2/3 of the
text: way to a Helen Keller.
scene_heading: INT. LAW SCHOOL CLASSROOM - A LITTLE LATER 6
text: Jeff and Tucker are next to each other in an auditorium style
text: class. Everyone has laptops open in front of them.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I almost shit myself when those
dialog: cops busted in. I thought she set
dialog: me up or something.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna
dialog: do, whatcha gonna do when you’re
dialog: fucking a deaf girl and the cops
dialog: come for you?
text: The professor is perturbed with the talking in the back.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Mr. Max. What is your take on this
dialog: issue?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I’m sorry, what issue is that?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Are you not paying attention Mr.
dialog: Max?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I wasn't, I apologize, I was busy
dialog: talking about having sex with a
dialog: deaf girl.
text: The class laughs.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Charming...and oddly appropriate.
dialog: Do you or do you not feel that
dialog: Little People should be a protected
dialog: class?
dialog: *
dialog: + eH
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You mean midgets?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Yes, Mr. Max, if you must, midgets.
dialog: Do you think they should be
dialog: protected?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What are we protecting them from,
dialog: eagles and poachers and stuff? Like
dialog: an endangered species?
text: The class erupts again.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Poachers?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: It could happen. You know if Kanye
text: showed up to a club in a midget
dialog: stoll, they’d be extinct in a week.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Mr. Max if you didn’t do the
dialog: reading, then...
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: No, I don't think midgets should be
dialog: considered a protected class for
dialog: the purposes of employment
dialog: discrimination law. I think their
dialog: physical limitations put them
text: squarely within the business
dialog: necessity and reasonable
dialog: accommodation defenses of the
dialog: Americans with Disabilities Act.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Where do you draw the line then?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I’m not sure. I figure it’s like
dialog: riding a roller coaster. You must
dialog: be this high to get ADA protection.
text: Tucker puts his hand at chest level and the class laughs.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Very funny, Mr. Max. What if I told
dialog: you that I just finished a pro bono
dialog: case involving a gentleman's club
dialog: that terminated the employment of a
dialog: dancer with dwarfism because she--
text: Tucker lurches forward in his seat.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You represented a midget stripper?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: They prefer the term ‘Little
dialog: Person’.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Was she fired?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: No, they gave her her job back.
text: Tucker has that mischievous twinkle in his eye.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What club was it?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Mr. Max, if you’re genuinely
dialog: interested in the case, come to
dialog: office hours and I'll fill you in.
dialog: Until then let’s remember this is a
dialog: constitutional law class, not Adult
dialog: Friend Finder.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Touche! I will shut up now.
text: Aside to Jeff, as Professor drones on about the case.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: So, you ready for your bachelor
dialog: party tonight?
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: Locked and loaded.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I’m gonna go get Aaron, meet us at
text: the campus bar after class.
text: Tucker closes his laptop as we go to black.
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S APT. - MINUTES LATER 7
text: The apartment is dark and spartan. Aaron is slouched down in
text: the room’s only chair, in front of a meticulously organized
text: media center, playing a Grand Theft Auto-style game.
text: Aaron is 24, tall and lanky with angular features. He’s neat,
text: almost finicky about his appearance, but underneath, he’s a
text: maladjusted, beaten down Star Trek nerd. He’s got a headset
text: on that is connected to his controller.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m going down the alley to beat up
dialog: the hooker. Watch my six.
text: Aaron's phone rings. He puts his Bluetooth in his other ear.
text: In SPLIT SCREEN, Tucker barrels through city traffic. Aaron’s
text: his digital doppelganger; running down pedestrians on screen
text: as Tucker sends them running for cover in real life.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Yo, Aaron. It’s Tucker.
text: Aaron flips out and hits the video game controller furiously.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What the hell is going on!?
text: Aaron's car is getting shot up from behind.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I’m coming to get you, we’re going
dialog: drinking.
text: Aaron's character dies on the screen.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What the hell!? YOU SUCK!!
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Is this your idea of having my
dialog: back?!
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: This is a great idea! I need a
dialog: drink and you need some daylight.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What kind of wingman are you, you
dialog: selfish little shit-for-brains?!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: I should come over to your house,
dialog: cut off your stubby virgin hands
dialog: and beat you to death with them,
dialog: HotWheelz!
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S APT. — CONTINUOUS 9
text: Aaron rips off both headsets, hurls his controller, and
text: storms into the kitchen.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/INT. TUCKER’S CAR 10
text: Tucker pulls up to the curb in front of Aaron’ building.
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 11
text: Aaron is standing against the counter eating cereal.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Ahhhh, Captain Crunch. My old
dialog: friend.
dialog: (baby talk)
dialog: You wouldn't leave me hanging in an
dialog: alley full of hookers. I’m not
dialog: gonna catch you in the cupboard
dialog: sucking off Toucan Sam. Noooo, you
dialog: have integ-wuh-tee and disci-pwin.
scene_heading: EXT. AARON’S APARTMENT —- SIMULTANEOUS 12
text: A chair with “HERS” stenciled on the back and an over-flowing
text: box sit outside. “HERS” has been crossed out and “WHORES”
text: written in Sharpie underneath. “WHORE’S BELONGINGS” is
text: scrawled on the top of the box. Tucker opens the lid.
text: Something is written on the inside.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: (reading, but to himself)
dialog: Take whatever you want, her box is
text: apparently open to all.
text: Tucker sifts through the box: Han Solo and Princess Leia
text: figurines with their kung-fu grip hands melted together,
text: women’s clothes, pictures of a blissful Aaron and a striking,
text: but disinterested, brunette. The box is peppered with unused
text: tampons that have been snapped in half.
dialog: 13
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S APT. — CONTINUOUS 13
text: Tucker barges in without knocking and opens all the drapes;
text: flooding the dark, depressive sanctuary of pain with light.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Look at this place. It’s a shrine
text: to cuckoldry and rage.
text: Aaron plops down in his chair. The back has “HIS” stenciled
text: into it, matching the “HERS” outside.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What are you babbling about?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: We're going to the bar. I just told
dialog: you on the phone.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I don’t pay attention to what you
dialog: say. I just wait for you to stop
dialog: talking about yourself, get bored,
text: and hang up.
text: AARON stares blankly ahead at the television.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Did Sarah call yet?
text: Tucker goes into the kitchen to get himself a chair and grabs
text: two beers from the fridge.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No. She probably has trouble
text: talking with a dick in her mouth.
text: Tucker sets the chair down, grabs the remote, and stops on
text: the opening credits of Jem & the Holograms.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
text: This cartoon is disturbingly hot.
dialog: Can you imagine a threesome with
dialog: Jem and Jerrica?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I can imagine them both cheating on
dialog: me.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
text: Jerrica runs a foster home. She
dialog: wouldn’t cheat.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: She voluntarily surrounds herself
dialog: with shattered little lives so her
dialog: dysfunctional existence feels more
dialog: normal. You think she wouldn’t pull
text: her cartoon panties to the side for
text: the first guy who tells her she’s
dialog: pretty?
text: Aaron waits in vain for Tucker to respond.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course she would. They all
dialog: would. Even the foster kids, those
text: validation seeking little sluts.
text: Click. Tucker changes the channel, a DeBeers commercial.
text: Aaron lurches forward jabbing his finger at the television.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm onto your game DeBeers--
dialog: diamonds are almost worthless other
dialog: than the value attached to them by
dialog: the silly tramps you've brainwashed
dialog: into thinking “diamond equals
dialog: love.” Guess what sluts, your quest
dialog: for the perfect princess cut is
dialog: supporting terrorism and genocide.
dialog: Congratulations, your avarice has
dialog: managed to destroy an entire
dialog: continent!
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Sarah kept the ring?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I hope you die in a fire.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You act like you're the first
dialog: person in the world to get cheated
dialog: on. It happens to everyone, dude,
dialog: even me.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Oh, really? Does everyone catch
dialog: their fiancee sucking off a rapper?
dialog: 14
dialog: 15
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - TWO WEEKS AGO 14
text: Aaron lets himself in with keys attached to an old, tattered
text: Duke GI Joe keychain. He’s carrying a box of Earl Grey tea
text: and a bag of throat lozenges.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Hey honey, how are you doing?
text: Sarah is vigorously pumping her head in the crotch of
text: Grillionaire, an iced-out white rapper. He’s sloppily eating
text: a sandwich and using the remote when he spots Aaron.
speaker_heading: GRILLIONAIRE
text: WHAT IT DO BABY! GRILLIONAIRE IN DA
dialog: HOUSE! !
text: SARAH jerks up and turns panicked to see Aaron just as he
text: slams the front door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S LIVING ROOM - BACK TO CURRENT SCENE 15
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Hey, who knew blowjobs were good
dialog: for sore throats, right?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: The most rewarding part of our
dialog: friendship is your ability to find
dialog: personal amusement in the
dialog: destruction of my life.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: It’s not that bad, dude. You always
dialog: get stuck in these cycles. When you
dialog: get depressed like this, you need
dialog: to ask yourself What would Tucker
dialog: do?, and then go do that.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I already know what you would do,
dialog: and I have no desire to get HIV
text: from one of the cum dumpsters into
dialog: whom you shoot your emotional pain
dialog: every weekend.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You know HIV is basically curable
text: now. It doesn’t even show up in
dialog: Magic Johnson's blood anymore.
dialog: 16
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You're telling me that Magic
dialog: Johnson is black AND has AIDS...and
dialog: he has it better than me?
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS BAR - AN HOUR LATER 16
text: Campus Bar is part sports bar, part dingy hook-up dungeon.
text: Tucker is flirting aggressively with Leslie, a gorgeous co-ed
text: waitress. Aaron, disgusted, is staring off at the TV.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: I love kids. When I graduate I want
dialog: to work with children, and have a
dialog: bunch of my own. What about you?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Are you kidding, I love kids too. I
dialog: can’t wait to have more.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You have kids?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: No, I’m just playing.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: He does, they’re just all in the
text: compost heap behind Planned
dialog: Parenthood.
text: Leslie doesn’t know whether to be creeped out or disgusted.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: (boyishly charming)
dialog: If you do stem cell research, you
dialog: could work with them.
text: She tries not to laugh, but can’t help herself. Jeff breezes
text: in and sidles up. Tucker swats Leslie on the ass.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Run along baby, man talk. I have
dialog: your number, I’11l call you.
text: Leslie walks away, clearly smitten. Aaron shakes his head.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Who says romance is dead?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How can you be angry at women, yet
dialog: at the same time, be mad at the
dialog: things Tucker does?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m like a feminist; I can assert
text: multiple contradictory positions.
text: Tucker scoffs. The bartender was eavesdropping and breaks in.
speaker_heading: CAMPUS BARTENDER
dialog: (to Tucker)
dialog: Hey, listen bro, can you do me a
dialog: favor and not talk to my server
dialog: like that? It’s disrespectful.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: CAMPUS BARTENDER
dialog: I think you heard me.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Oh, I heard you, Hero. You don’t
dialog: want me flirting with your server.
dialog: I didn’t know she belonged to you.
dialog: I thought she was an individual
dialog: with free will?
speaker_heading: CAMPUS BARTENDER
dialog: It’s a figure of speech, bro.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Well, BRO, here’s another figure of
dialog: speech for you: Mind your own
dialog: fucking business. I’m sorry I’ve
dialog: accomplished more in 30 minutes
dialog: with Leslie than you have in two
dialog: years, but she looked pretty happy
dialog: talking to me. Or maybe she rubs
text: her crotch against all the
dialog: customers.
speaker_heading: CAMPUS BARTENDER
dialog: I think it might be time for you to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Or maybe it’s just time for you to
dialog: get me another drink.
text: Tucker waves his empty glass.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CAMPUS BARTENDER
dialog: I don’t think so.
text: Leslie passes by with a full drink tray. Tucker makes eye
text: contact and motions her over, pulling her into him with his
text: arm around her waist. He plucks a beer from her tray.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Hey sweetie, just put this on my
dialog: tab, okay.
text: Tucker disarms her with charm and she gives it up easily. The
text: bartender sees this transpire and seethes.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: (to Campus Bartender)
dialog: Sam, could you get me another beer
dialog: for table six?
text: The bartender lifts the bar door and postures up. Jeff slides
text: in behind Tucker, who turns away unconcerned.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (calmly but assertively)
dialog: I will have what he’s having. Thank
dialog: you.
text: Jeff locks eyes intimidatingly with the bartender who
text: considers his options and relents.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Listen, I know everything is set
dialog: for tonight, but I think we should
dialog: discuss a potential change in venue
dialog: for your bachelor party.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Oh, this should be good.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: The strip club we’re supposed to go
text: to sucks. It’s dirty and decrepit
dialog: and the girls that don’t have
dialog: stretch marks have personalities
dialog: like the worst parts of the Bible.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Personalities? We have to talk to
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Some of us actually enjoy the
dialog: company of women, Aaron.
dialog: a *
dialog: *
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yeah, I’m the misogynist here.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: It wouldn’t be so bad if Durham
dialog: hadn't passed that ridiculous ‘no
dialog: touch’ ordinance. All we can do is
text: sit at a table and look at them.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I thought you said they were
dialog: disgusting. Why would we want to
dialog: touch them?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What do you want to do Jeff, play
dialog: checkers? This is a fucking
scene_heading: BACHELOR PARTY.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well, what did you have in mind?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
text: A short two hour drive away is a
dialog: strip club called Baby Dolls. I’m
dialog: sorry. Let me back up. This isn’t
dialog: just some strip club. This is the
dialog: Super Bowl of carnal pleasure.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: We've been to strip clubs before.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Not like this one, dude. The first
dialog: time I got a lap dance there, the
dialog: stripper grabbed my hands and put
text: them on her tits. The second dance,
dialog: she turned around and basically dry
dialog: humped me the entire time. She was
dialog: gorgeous and wasn't even close to
dialog: being the best one there.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I used to think there was a bright
text: line between a gentleman's club and
dialog: a brothel. Now you're telling me
text: it's just gray.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You can full-on grab their breasts
dialog: and they don’t care?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: They encourage it.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I bet they had good childhoods.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: And the very best part: $5 cover,
dialog: $10 dances, $2 drinks. All. Night.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’d rather fellate a hot curling
dialog: iron than drive 150 miles because
dialog: Tucker breast fed until he was
dialog: eight.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I can’t leave. Tomorrow we have a
dialog: bunch of meetings and stuff to take
dialog: care of. Seating chart and whatnot.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Seating chart?!
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m sure Kristy can cut that
dialog: Gordian knot.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It’s not that simple.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Yes it is. It’s an LSAT logic game.
text: A table seats 8 people. Tucker must
text: sit next to a single woman with
text: large breasts. Aaron must not sit
text: next to anyone with a vagina. No
dialog: one else matters. Boom, done.
speaker_heading: JEFF
text: The wedding is next weekend, man.
dialog: I’m not just going to leave Kristy
dialog: hanging because of some stupid no-
dialog: touch policy. That’s your issue,
dialog: not mine.
dialog: 17
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: We'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
dialog: Look dude, if we stay in Durham, we
dialog: can’t have the experience we need
dialog: to make up for that abomination of
dialog: an engagement party you had with

text: Jeff's at a table between Kristy’s father, Mr. Jorgens and

speaker_heading: MR. JORGENS
dialog: I’m glad you’re having a good time,

speaker_heading: MR. JORGENS

dialog: Probably, sir.
text: ANGLE ON Mrs. Jorgens, Kristy’s mother, leading bible bingo.

speaker_heading: JEFF

dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Having a great time back here. This

text: drunk with strippers.
text: ANGLE ON Mrs. Jorgens.
speaker_heading: MRS. JORGENS
dialog: From the sole of your foot to the
dialog: top of your head there is no
text: soundness- only wounds and welts
dialog: and open sores. Hugh, honey, who
dialog: does that sound like?
text: ANGLE ON Jeff as Mr. Jorgens talks to his sons sitting next
dialog: to Jeff.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Tomorrow morning? Sure I can make
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MR. JORGENS
dialog: Of course that’s who Isaiah’s
text: talking about. The open sores are
dialog: from having their horns and tails
dialog: cut off so they can blend in with
dialog: the humans.
text: SPLIT SCREEN with Jeff and Tucker, Aaron and Kristy.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Hey Jeff, does Daddy know his

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m not in a position to answer

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Fuck it. I think I’m just going to

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Jeff, you know you’re my boy, but I
dialog: have to be honest. If you keep
dialog: acting like a bitch, someone's
dialog: gonna fuck that pussy in your face.
dialog: Jesus Christ dude, this is IT! This
dialog: is our last gasp together as single
dialog: men!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: And what about Aaron!?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Don’t drag me into this. There’s a
dialog: Next Generation marathon this
dialog: weekend. I am just fine lusting
text: after Deanna Troy and stewing in my
text: cocoon of loneliness and anger.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: He hasn’t been out of the house
dialog: since his girl tore out his heart
dialog: and stomped it with bling shoes!
dialog: Aaron needs this!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You do need this.
speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: TUCKER

dialog: So put your fucking game face on!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Let’s do this!
text: Jeff bolts from the car and bounds toward his apartment.
speaker_heading: AARON

text: Jeff kisses her and nuzzles his head against her neck.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Guess who just called. My mom.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What’s wrong, did another dinosaur

speaker_heading: KRISTY
text: She's coming into town early to

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: No she’s not. Quit being dramatic.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: If she has her way the reception
text: will be a potluck in a barn.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: She’s pious and conservative, Jeff,
dialog: not Pennsylvania Dutch!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: We'll probably have to churn our

speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: My parents are paying for the
dialog: wedding. My mom’s entitled to have
dialog: some input. What did you want me to
dialog: say to her? Don’t come?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That would be a start. I’1l be

speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Calm down, Groomzilla!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Don't Groomzilla me! Those squirrel

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Packing.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m going to Charlotte with Tucker
dialog: and Aaron for my bachelor party.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: I thought you were staying in town.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Change of plans. Tucker knows about
dialog: a great strip club down there.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Good for Tucker, I hope he has a
dialog: great time.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You know I can’t let him go off by
dialog: himself. That’s when the really bad
dialog: stuff happens. He needs me to have
text: his back.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Who’s got your back? Aaron?
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Tucker’s got my back.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Tucker says he’s got your back.
dialog: Except you’re always the one
dialog: bailing him out. I wish you took
dialog: care of me as well as you take care
dialog: of Tucker.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: That’s a bunch of crap! I always
dialog: look out for you. You’re my number
dialog: one priority.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Really? When have I taken
dialog: precedence? When have you chosen me
dialog: over Tucker? Give me an example.
dialog: Just one.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m marrying you aren’t I?
dialog: 24.
text: Kristy looks incredulously at Jeff. He tries to salvage some

speaker_heading: JEFF (CONT'D)
dialog: You just don’t want me going to a
text: strip club with Tucker.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Honey, you know I’m cool with you
dialog: going to a strip club. If we didn’t
dialog: have so much to do, I’d go with
dialog: you. But we have all the final
dialog: appointments this weekend. You need
dialog: to be there.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Why do I even need to go now? It’s
dialog: going to be two against one the
dialog: whole time anyway.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: That’s not true. Your input is
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I didn’t get a say when the Locust
dialog: Queen decided to swarm in early.
dialog: Why should this be any different?
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: So instead you’re going to pout and

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Should I go help?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: There is a zero percent chance that

scene_heading: 23 INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 23
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: COMPROMISE!? That's all I've been
dialog: doing! Your dad didn't want a
text: bachelor party with strippers and
dialog: booze, so I said fine, we'll do an
dialog: engagement party at the church. I
dialog: want a beach ceremony?
dialog: (imitating Mrs. Jorgens)
dialog: No sir, we're having it in church
text: under the watchful eye of the Lord.
dialog: (in his normal voice)
dialog: and I said okay. I want a bouncy
dialog: castle at the reception?
dialog: (imitating Mrs. Jorgens)
text: Bouncy castles are childish and
dialog: dangerous. Grow up.
dialog: (in his normal voice)
dialog: So I gave in because I didn't want
dialog: to argue. It's just a stupid bouncy
dialog: castle. The only thing I've been
dialog: able to keep so far is the open
dialog: bar, and now she's probably going
dialog: to take that too and you aren’t
dialog: going to do a thing to stop her!
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: No one said you had to give in on
dialog: that stuff. Be a man and take a
dialog: stand if it’s important to you!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You want me to be a man and take a
dialog: stand? Here it is: I’m going to
dialog: Charlotte with Tucker and I don’t
dialog: give a fuck what you or the Wicked
dialog: Witch of West Texas think about it!
text: Tucker walks in without knocking.
speaker_heading: TUCKER

text: Kristy tries to put on her “Everything is fine” face.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: So what's this I hear about you
dialog: taking Jeff for the weekend?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Well, Durham passed this stupid no-
dialog: touch rule. I figure since the
dialog: ladies can’t seem to keep their
dialog: hands off me, it’d be irresponsible
dialog: for me to go to clubs around here.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: How thoughtful of you.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You don’t mind do you? I’m not
dialog: stepping on any toes, am I?
text: Kristy gives him that “well...actually” look.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: It’s just we have all the final
dialog: wedding appointments tomorrow and--
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Oh no. Jeff didn’t say anything
dialog: about that. Why didn’t you tell me,
dialog: dude? That’s not cool. It’s your
dialog: wedding, man.
text: Jeff is wide-eyed at Tucker in frustration and anger.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll just go out in town. We can
dialog: do Charlotte after your honeymoon.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Kristy, that way you can come too.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Sure, that sounds like fun
dialog: actually.

speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: AARON (V.O.)
dialog: Is that egg? Why yes it is, and
dialog: bacon too. But wait--they didn't

text: The fry cook dunks an english muffin into a giant open tub of
text: maple syrup. He pulls the english muffin out and accidentally

speaker_heading: AARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)

dialog: Right?
text: She doesn’t say anything, which says everything.

speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the girl)

text: In the background the bartender sets up five pint glasses
text: half full with light beer in pyramid. He fills six shot

text: on the lips of the glasses. The bartender takes a huge swig
text: of Bacardi 151, puts a lighter up to his face, and blows a
text: massive fireball over the shot glasses. He hits one of the
text: shot glasses into the beer, starting a domino effect that

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ugh! None of us are sluts!
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: That’s funny, normally the

text: The bartender sets up the shots for everyone.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think a toast is in order for my
text: buddy Jeff, who is also getting
dialog: married, and to the bride to be and
dialog: all her beautiful friends. Even the
dialog: bitchy prude.
text: He raises his glass.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's to the people we've met, and
dialog: to the people we've fucked,
dialog: And to those amongst us who've had
dialog: no such luck.
dialog: Here's to beer in the glass, and
dialog: vodka in the cup,

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What's your porn name?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Scott Peterson.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No no, not your real name. Here

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I wasn’t allowed to have pets.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay let’s do it the other way
dialog: then: what’s your middle name?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Don't have one. Unless I missed it
dialog: between "Shut up" and “you’re

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well what street did you grow up
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I grew up in a cave.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh come on! Play along, it's fun.
text: Amy playfully nudges him.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: If you touch me again, I will gut

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember what we talked about in

dialog: ask yourself What Would Tucker Do?,
dialog: and then do that instead.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Fine...but we can’t both go after

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Who are you talking to? Because you

speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Let’s do shots.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Isn't she precious?
speaker_heading: MELISSA *
dialog: We'll do teams. *
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Fine. Bachelor and hottest guy--me--
dialog: versus bachelorette and your
dialog: hottest friend.
text: Tucker scans the bachelorette party and points to a girl with
text: big fake tits and a naughty come hither look, Christina. She
text: smiles and comes over.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Ugh. I think your friend is hotter
dialog: anyway.
dialog: 39.
text: She points to Aaron.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Yeah? Go talk to him for five
dialog: minutes. Now let’s get down to
dialog: business. Line'em up. And no girly
dialog: shit either. If it has sugar in it,
dialog: it's not a real shot.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Technically, all alcohol has sugar

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Wizard.

speaker_heading: OLDER LADY

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: We're just full of alcohol and
dialog: McGriddles. You could do that.
speaker_heading: OLDER LADY
dialog: Oh my! You are funny.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: That's what my friends tell me, but
dialog: they’1l say anything to get laid.
text: Older Lady chuckles and looks down in her lap. Aaron is
text: holding his beer down and the dog is drinking from it.
speaker_heading: OLDER LADY
dialog: What are you doing?! Oh my
dialog: goodness, Pookie, are you OK?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Your dog has a drinking problem,
dialog: you might want to get her into
dialog: doggie AA.
speaker_heading: OLDER LADY
dialog: Why did you give beer to Pookie?!
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Pookie drank my beer. There is a
dialog: difference.

text: ANGLE on the four shot contest participants; shots lined up
text: in front of them. Melissa and Christina pick up theirs and
dialog: toast.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Give me chastity and continence,

text: They laugh and cheer. Tucker and Jeff kinda look at each
text: other and raise their next shots.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: To alcohol, the cause of and
dialog: solution to, all of life's
dialog: problems. Homer Simpson.
text: They pound the shot. ANGLE on Aaron talking to Ashley.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Jeff, she doesn't think we went to
dialog: the same high school.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He doesn't even know what the
dialog: mascot is.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I think you're the one who doesn't
dialog: know. You're just trying to use
dialog: reverse psychology to steal the
dialog: answer from me. I will not fall
dialog: victim to your chicanery.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Psssssh, nuh-uh. You're totally
dialog: faking.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Here, we can settle this easy.
text: Tucker thrusts a shot under Jeff's nose and he does it.
speaker_heading: JEFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Aaron'1ll whisper his answer to me
dialog: in this ear and you whisper your
dialog: answer in the other. I’11 tell you
text: if he’s faking.
text: Ashley seems to think this makes sense, and whispers into
text: Jeff's ear. Aaron leans in and Jeff looks at him quizzically.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JEFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmmm. Unless the mascot is "I'm
dialog: going to knock this girl
text: unconscious and anally fist her," I
dialog: don't think he went to your school.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Oh, I’m the cockblocker!
text: ANGLE on Tucker talking to Christina.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: So what's up with the bitchy one,

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Yeah, it must suck to be that ugly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: She’s not ugly!
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Women are the worst at judging

dialog: her face? Bums wouldn’t fuck her.
text: ANGLE ON Ashley and Aaron. A Grillionaire song comes on. The
text: video plays on the TV screens behind the bar.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Oh boy, Grillionaire!
speaker_heading: GRILLIONAIRE
dialog: I don’t touch no bills under

speaker_heading: AARON

text: They all look at Jeff awkwardly.
speaker_heading: JEFF (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ugh, that is so misogynist.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: No it isn’t. If I said that women
text: belong chained to the stove with
dialog: just enough slack to reach the
dialog: bedroom, that would be misogynist.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What I said was sexist. And a
dialog: fucking joke. Not that your spoiled
dialog: pageant girl ass would know the
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Fine, you're sexist and misogynist.
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Tucker, you misogynist Neanderthal.
dialog: Why do you hate women so much?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: (nearly exasperated)
dialog: I don't hate women. I love women!
dialog: Why else would I put up with all

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You know what--
speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I’m sorry. You have to excuse my
dialog: friend, sometimes he doesn’t know

speaker_heading: LARA

speaker_heading: TUCKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: My midget princess.

speaker_heading: BRITE.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: Her blonde hair and sparkling blue
dialog: eyes reminded me of Gwenyth

text: Rainbow Brite waddles confidently across the room.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TUCKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: How could you not realize he’s

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: It’s Tucker. Do you want to talk to

speaker_heading: KRISTY

dialog: Nod isn’t a sincere apology.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What else am I supposed to say? I’m
dialog: not a mind reader.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: Do you understand the magnitude of
dialog: this situation? He lied to me for
dialog: you. He landed in jail because you
dialog: failed as a friend in every way
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I didn’t make him lie to you.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: He lied because he was your friend,

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: That’s stupid. Protect me from

speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: From his future wife thinking his

dialog: that because I always knew you were
dialog: selfish. Now I worry that you’re

dialog: force that I can’t trust to have
dialog: the best interests of the man I
dialog: love at heart.
text: Kristy’s exhortation freezes Tucker.
speaker_heading: KRISTY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s what you don’t seem to

dialog: know where Jeff’s are?
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Yeah, of course.
speaker_heading: KRISTY
dialog: So you just ignored them then?

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: KRISTY

scene_heading: FRIEND OF CHUBBY
dialog: So you're drinking alone? That's
dialog: one of the beginning stages of

dialog: I already hide liquor around the
text: house and drink alone in the dark.
scene_heading: CHUBBY INTERLOPER
dialog: That's sad.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: No way. Drinking is highly
dialog: underrated. Think about it: What
dialog: are the detriments to being drunk?
scene_heading: FRIEND OF CHUBBY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: It hurts relationships with family
dialog: and friends? I don't like my family
dialog: and my friends drink as much as me.
dialog: It causes long term health
dialog: problems? I drive way too fast to
dialog: worry about anything long term. It

dialog: attractive,
dialog: (pointing to Friend of

dialog: makes boring people interesting,
dialog: (pointing to Chubby
dialog: Interloper )
dialog: and makes hot girls like me. For my

dialog: friend. Or at least was, until last
dialog: week when I took advantage of his
dialog: kindness and loyalty. I forced him
text: into lying to Kristy, dragged him

dialog: the hell I want. And to be honest,
dialog: it's worked out pretty well for me
dialog: up to about 24 hours ago. When my

dialog: and my invitation to his wedding.
text: Aaron and Lara look at each other.
speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Still, I shrugged it off and went
dialog: out anyway. I won't bore you with
dialog: the particulars but the long and
dialog: short of it is, I got drunk and

dialog: sorry, I honestly didn't understand

dialog: over the past 24 hours, it's hit me
