scene_heading: DARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th, 1968
dialog: 
text: A darkness where even outlines are not discernible. There is
text: a dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is
text: PLAYING the BEACH BOYS: "When we could say good night and
dialog: still stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be
dialog: married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?"
dialog: 
text: Through it there has been the SOUND of BANGING, distinct and
text: rhythmic. It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS. There are also
text: WHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: ... what?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
text: That headboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
text: Nobody can hear it.
dialog: 
text: It BANGS a couple of more times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: I can. It makes me nervous.
dialog: 
text: It continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging
text: of the headboard. She follows the scream with a few yelps.
text: Silence. Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: (complimentary)
dialog: Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus
dialog: Christ... Jesus H. Christ.
dialog: 
text: The PHONE CONTINUES TO RING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: (a slightly different
dialog: tone)
dialog: You going to answer it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: (meaning no)
dialog: Uh-uh.
dialog: 
text: It CONTINUES TO RING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: (being for her very
dialog: mischievous)
dialog: Want me to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Let it ring.
dialog: 
text: And it does. It CONTINUES TO RING, killing all other
dialog: considerations.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't
dialog: give up.
dialog: 
text: After a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Hello...
dialog: (a little surprised)
dialog: Ah, hi.
dialog: 
text: The GIRL'S VOICE on the other end of the phone can be HEARD
text: only FITFULLY, when George holds the receiver loosely by his
text: ear. It is TINA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA'S VOICE
dialog: What took you so long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Wasn't sure it was you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

speaker_heading: TINA'S VOICE

dialog: Awww --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: I'll call you back.

speaker_heading: TINA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

text: He hangs up. Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and
dialog: coughed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: You're rude. I mean, you're very
dialog: rude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, I tried to get her off the
dialog: phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: You know what I'm talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: No, baby. Now look, that girl that

dialog: she'll do something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: I don't know, kill herself. She's
dialog: O.D.'d four times.
dialog: 
text: This calms Felicia. A pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Well, is she your girlfriend?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Then it's not your problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: It isn't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: No. You know too many sick ladies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: How do you expect to get anything
dialog: done if you allow yourself to get
dialog: sidetracked? Particularly in your
dialog: business... you deal with women
dialog: every day...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA'S VOICE
dialog: Don't worry, honey, I'll protect

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Okay.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
text: Whoever she is, she doesn't give

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Bare-assed, George swings out of bed, looking for something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: What're you looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My keys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I thought you said you weren't
dialog: going anywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this
dialog: friend of mine for a few minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You mean that girl, don't you?
dialog: 
text: George finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes,
text: a pair of crumpled levis, and a brightly-colored shirt. He
text: leaves his shorts and socks on the floor. He's obviously in a
dialog: hurry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What girl, she's not a girl, she's
dialog: just a friend of mine.
dialog: 
text: Felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You son of a bitch.
dialog: 
text: George sighs, shrugs, and heads toward the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, at least wait 'til I'm
dialog: dressed. I'm going.
dialog: 
text: She starts to get out of bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Christ -- do you have any
dialog: Kleenex?
dialog: 
text: George is a little desperate now. He runs to the bathroom,
text: tosses her the whole box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks a lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll be right back, it's just that
dialog: this girl is a different girl...
text: she has attacks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: These attacks... it's got something
dialog: to do with her... uh... pancreas.
dialog: 
text: George is trying to remember the rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: She's got a...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (suddenly interested)
dialog: Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (anxious to go now)
dialog: Yeah, I think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: That's very serious. Who's her
dialog: doctor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Gee, that's very serious...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic
dialog: ulcer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She did?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: It turned out to be cancer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: So what are you doing going over
dialog: there? You're not her doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've gotta give her some pills.
dialog: Percodan, she ran out.
dialog: 
text: Before Felicia can say anymore, George goes to the bathroom
text: and grabs the first pill jar he can find, moves to Felicia
text: and kisses her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: And listen, I'll be right back and
dialog: I want your ass in that bed when I
dialog: get back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (acquiescing)
dialog: You're very rude... if you don't
dialog: come back --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll be back in a while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I don't want to see you anymore.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, stop by the shop.
dialog: 
text: He takes off. Winds through alleys and heads up the hill to

scene_heading: EXT. AT JILL'S - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: JILL'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: Who do you think it is?

speaker_heading: JILL

dialog: Well, like what?

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

text: She's not answering.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No shit?
dialog: 
text: Jill laughs. George comes over to her.

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Now, George --

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Nobody's gonna get you but me!
dialog: 
text: He leaps after her and she screams, delighted. George chases

speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: How are you, baby?

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)

dialog: Europe.

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Honey, what happened?

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I just came from a meeting... I

dialog: with my life.

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I thought you said you were at the
dialog: epitome of your life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I am, I am. But I've had it with
dialog: chicks. They're like an
dialog: occupational hazard. Six guys

dialog: or settle down or something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What about me?

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: PETTIS

dialog: else: the big boys are going for
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: They are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETTIS
dialog: After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying
text: six percent. Six percent. FHA's at
dialog: eight and a half -- no, we won't be
dialog: going back to the old days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I guess not...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETTIS
dialog: It's got nothing to do with
dialog: inflation. Rates, for example, rise
dialog: independently of tight money if you
text: look at interest curves carefully.
dialog: Historically, that's always been
dialog: true, though most people don't
dialog: realize it.
dialog: 
text: An uncomfortable pause.

dialog: George and Mr. Pettis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (giving it all he's got)
dialog: I've got the customers... that's my
dialog: point. I'm the one they want. If I
dialog: had my own shop, they'd leave and
dialog: come to me. I have a lot of
dialog: customers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETTIS
dialog: Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you
dialog: make out a financial statement?
dialog: It'll save us both some time. Miss
dialog: Michaels here can show you... have
dialog: it notarized and we'll see where we
dialog: go from there. Miss Michaels, would
dialog: you get me a couple of forms?
dialog: 
text: Pettis rises, shakes George's hand and disappears. George is
text: left with MISS MICHAELS, who has been more or less within

speaker_heading: JILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Egypt?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRODUCER
dialog: Look, is there somewhere else you'd
dialog: rather go? Maybe we can change our
dialog: location.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, it's not that...

speaker_heading: PRODUCER

speaker_heading: JILL

dialog: This town...
dialog: 
text: At the shop on Brighton Way in Beverly Hills. A FEW BARS OF
text: SIMON AND GARFUNKEL'S "SOUNDS OF SILENCE" covers George
text: pulling up on his bike.
dialog: 
text: The street is empty of traffic except there are scores and
text: scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some
text: meter maids. George starts toward the shop. A pair of women
text: in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop.
text: They look like Medusas. They hurtle down the sidewalk as if
text: they're running from something.
text: Then they find their respective cars and begin pouring
text: pennies into the meters. CLINK, BUZZ, CLINK, BUZZ.
dialog: 
text: George looks glum. He's walking along the street. A GIRL
text: stops him. She's driving by in a 3.4 Jag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Hi, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, baby, what's happening?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Great, great. I hope you make it.

text: Somebody HONKS in back of her.

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Call me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't have your number, stop by
dialog: the shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (waving goodbye)
dialog: Okay!
dialog: 
text: George looks after her, smiling. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: God damn it.
dialog: 
text: He goes into the shop.
dialog: 
text: A large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop. It covers most
text: of the wall it leans against.
dialog: 
text: An attractive young woman in her early thirties, everything
text: matching, a real French garden, leans forward INTO SHOT and
text: looks at herself in the mirror. She studies her image
text: carefully. She moves closer to it. She seems uncertain at
text: first. Then as she looks her conviction grows:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Great... great... great... great...
dialog: great!
dialog: 
text: She turns back to DENNIS LOLLY, her hairdresser. She takes
text: his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Great, Dennis.
dialog: 
text: With her other hand she touches her hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think there's enough height?
dialog: I mean do you think there's enough
dialog: height?
dialog: 
text: Now she and Dennis look into the mirror at her together.
text: Dennis toys with the calico scarf around his neck. Felicia,
text: in far corner, waits defiantly. George spots her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA (CONT'D)
dialog: George, do you think there's enough
dialog: height?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (on way to Felicia)
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
text: Dennis doesn't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Man, I didn't say a word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Well, what do you think? Is there
dialog: enough height?
dialog: 
text: Both Dennis and Tina turn back to the mirror for further
text: deliberation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You're late, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (taking her to his
dialog: cubicle)
dialog: I gotta talk to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I don't want to talk about it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But you don't know what happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I don't care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: George, do you think there's too
dialog: much height?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (seating her)
dialog: It's great. You don't know what
dialog: happened, this girl she almost got--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (a little hysterical)
dialog: I don't care about that girl, I
dialog: don't care if she's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Calm down, baby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (calming down)
dialog: I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm
dialog: simply saying you have no respect

dialog: mummers...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Nummers.

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: 
text: Mary has gone over to the shampoo stand above which are

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What kind of treatment?

speaker_heading: FELICIA

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (working on Felicia)
dialog: No, man.

speaker_heading: RICCI
dialog: -- Right after I sprayed her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICCI
dialog: (losing control)
dialog: She touched it! Then she played in
dialog: it and got it all into something
dialog: else. Now I don't know what it is!
dialog: 
text: He's waiting for George for sympathy. Jill steps away
dialog: gathering patience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICCI (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't even stand to talk to her
text: on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (sympathetic)
text: She's heavy.
dialog: (to Felicia)
dialog: See, Norman expects me to get in
dialog: here, take care of all the
dialog: customers and then do his show out
dialog: in Norwalk. I gotta have my own
text: shop, just out of self defense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I can see that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're looking great, baby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: What're you doing later?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (half kidding)
dialog: Whatever you say.

speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: We have this political thing
dialog: tonight. Could you comb me out at
dialog: the house?
dialog: 
text: George is torn.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know. I'm beginning to feel
dialog: guilty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: What about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: All I ever do is play. I should be

speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Why don't you see Lester?

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (not sure what she's

speaker_heading: FELICIA

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: When can I talk to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: About what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: FELICIA

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know. Just a minute...
dialog: 
text: George moves over to Jill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Your advice!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: They didn't offer you the job yet.

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Right now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: When?

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: FELICIA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She's fine. You really think I'd be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: And I certainly wouldn't tell

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: there. Call Jurgenson's, call
dialog: Chasen's... I don't care how much
dialog: it costs... how much?... then spend
dialog: it. Just make sure it's there.
dialog: You've got all the money in the

dialog: Just make sure it's there on the
dialog: table tonight.
dialog: (he hangs up)
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: (to George, to no one)
dialog: You've got to do everything
dialog: yourself. You know?
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Lester gives George a steely look. It covers his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Felicia says you're a very good

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: She says you're a fabulous
dialog: hairdresser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I didn't say it, she did. How'd you
dialog: happen to get in that line of work?
dialog: 
text: George sort of knows what Lester's driving at.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, well, I went to beauty
dialog: school... you know you go to beauty
dialog: school... and you get your
dialog: operator's license... and you
dialog: graduate... and you're a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I see.
dialog:

speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's an unusual trade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes it is.
dialog: 
text: An awkward pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: But the important thing is you're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: In a way. But...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: But what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm better than the guy I work for.
dialog: 
text: This seems to interest Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, George, I invest for a lot of
dialog: people. I make a lot of money for
dialog: them. More than they could do for

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: After a while that hurts... doesn't

speaker_heading: LESTER

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: But personal services are not the

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: They're not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (suddenly direct, almost
dialog: enthusiastic)
dialog: No, they're a pain in the ass,

dialog: anything. It's a cash business and

dialog: or they'll steal you blind, am I
dialog: right or am I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're right.

dialog: Mr. Karpf...
dialog: 
text: Jackie is right behind her. She bounces in, not seeing
dialog: George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm sorry but I need an extra
dialog: garage key.
dialog: 
text: In Lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she
text: did with Jill. She's startled when she sees George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What for? What do you need the key
dialog: for?
dialog: 
text: Jackie continues to stare at George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The man from Sloan's is coming. I
dialog: called you about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: How did you lose that key? Oh,
dialog: George, this is uh Miss -- this is
dialog: Jackie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (a little suspiciously)
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (almost immediately on the
dialog: defensive)
dialog: Well, yes, George is a wonderful
dialog: hairdresser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: 
text: Awkward pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So how's Norman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Great. Who's been doing your hair?
dialog: 
text: Jackie glances at Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I go to the blue'n gold barber shop
text: in Westwood. The guy in the third
dialog: chair's dynamite... nobody much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
text: George is going to open a shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (really interested)
dialog: No kidding? Your own shop?
dialog: 
text: George starts to say yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: George, could you -- excuse us for
dialog: a minute?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: He leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and
text: Lester alone. Lester shuts the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I called to tell you I was sending
text: one over but the line was busy,
dialog: you're always on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I am?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Who were you talking to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Who do you think I was talking to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: My secretary saw you with that boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Steve?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Whatever his name is, that actor.
dialog: 
text: Jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very
dialog: emotional.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.
dialog: (a touch bitter)
dialog: Steve couldn't get arrested as an
dialog: actor. He couldn't get arrested as
text: a boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Then you were talking to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I ran into him at the 76 station on
dialog: little Santa Monica, what was I
dialog: supposed to do, hide in the ladies
dialog: room? Yes, I was talking to him.
dialog: 
text: Lester's a little chagrined now but not much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (an outburst)
dialog: I'm always on the phone because you
dialog: never let me see anybody, I can't
dialog: even bring my girlfriends over to
dialog: the house because they might run
dialog: into you. You're driving me up the
dialog: wall, Lester. You're even jealous
dialog: of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have
dialog: somebody I can talk to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I'm not jealous of the dogs.
dialog: 
text: Jackie looks at him in disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (very positive)
dialog: Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous
dialog: of anybody, I just can't afford to
dialog: get caught... off base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So I can't talk to some broken down
dialog: actor, what do you think, I'm going
dialog: to tell him I'm screwing Lester
dialog: Karpf!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Of course not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's not very logical, Lester.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - GEORGE AND SECRETARY

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
text: He thinks the room is soundproofed.
dialog: Don't tell him it's not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He'll have that awful construction
dialog: crew back again, and they can never
dialog: do anything right.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LESTER'S OFFICE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (trying to think of why)
dialog: It's very logical, it's the most
dialog: logical thing in the world. You
dialog: wouldn't feel this confined if we
dialog: could go out with people and have
dialog: dinner, and a little conversation
dialog: and so forth...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Really? How about starting with
dialog: tonight?
dialog: 
text: By her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this
text: for months. Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to
text: him genuinely upsets her. She's near tears and she's not the
text: kind of girl who cries easily. Lester's sensitive to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Sweetheart, I know it's rough but
dialog: at this point -- my business
dialog: involves handling money for some
dialog: very touchy people, politics and so
dialog: on... Felicia's at a very difficult
dialog: period in her life... any divorce
dialog: and settlement and so forth, my
dialog: finances would have to be looked
dialog: into.
dialog: 
text: Jackie knows what he's talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You and your touchy investors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Look... you do well for people,
dialog: they don't ask you to stop. Nobody
dialog: wants you to stop making money,
dialog: doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all
dialog: want their share.
dialog: 
text: Jackie comes over to Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're lying about one thing,
dialog: Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're still jealous.
dialog: 
text: She's said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can
text: be with him. Lester smiles. He's almost benign.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: God, you're a doll.
dialog: 
text: He takes her in his arms and she responds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (he means it)
dialog: We'll work something out about
dialog: tonight, I promise...

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Angie, give Miss Shawn a garage key

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Yes, Mr. Karpf.
dialog: 
text: Angie opens her desk and goes through some files, pulls out a
text: key, puts it in an envelope and hands it to Jackie -- she's
dialog: lightning quick about it, super efficient.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, let's go down together.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh yeah.
dialog: 
text: Jackie moves back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (normal tone now)
dialog: Well, George, you may not think ten
dialog: or fifteen grand means much to me,
dialog: but I invest for myself and a lot
dialog: of particular people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh yeah? I mean I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: So I'm going to want a little more
dialog: of your thinking on the subject.
dialog: 
text: The elevator doors open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: When?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: When?
dialog: 
text: The doors close on the three of them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR
dialog: 
text: going down. George is looking at Lester, waiting for an
dialog: answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (looks up slowly)
dialog: How about tonight?
dialog: 
text: Jackie looks to Lester. Lester winks at Jackie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yeah, little election party I'm
text: giving at the Bistro.
dialog: It's a pain in the ass but -- I
dialog: have to do it. We'll have a little
dialog: time to talk there.
dialog: 
text: The elevator stops on the third floor. A man in a suit and a
text: middle-aged woman with a cane get in. They're strangers to
text: each other. The elevator proceeds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
text: (quiet, almost solemn in
dialog: their presence)
dialog: -- maybe you could, on your way,
dialog: you know, pick up Jackie here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: They've reached the basement and are standing as Bill the

dialog: Rolls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: It's good you want to do something,
dialog: George.
dialog: 
text: George doesn't answer this time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish my son knew what he wanted
dialog: to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: -- Anything, I don't care what it
dialog: is, just so it's something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know what you mean.
dialog: 
text: Lester's car is backed up. The door opened for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: Maybe he ought to go to beauty

dialog: doll, okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
text: Lester slips Bill a few dollars and takes off, leaving Jackie

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- Yeah... your car down here?
dialog: 
text: Jackie nods. They walk toward it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- Listen, I'm supposed to take
dialog: Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's
dialog: really going to be pissed if I
dialog: don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I
dialog: tell her how important it is to me,
dialog: I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know. Probably not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Jill's really great, isn't she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Great... so how's everything with
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: They've reached Jackie's 230SL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Great, more or less.
dialog: 
text: She starts to get in.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How long you had this?

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, about six weeks now... Lester --
dialog: well, he's very sweet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He's a very private person,
dialog: actually.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know
dialog: that we went together, does he?
dialog: 
text: Jackie has started to get in the car several times. This
text: stops her again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- Well no. It never came up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I thought you said things were

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Well they are. But we have

dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We don't think marriage is
dialog: important.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: But you have problems?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- Yeah, honey...
dialog: 
scene_heading: JILL AND JACKIE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don't know. One minute he's up in
dialog: the air and makes love to me five
dialog: times a day and tells me
dialog: everything's going to be great and
text: he's getting his own shop and then
text: suddenly he disappears and he won't
dialog: even talk to me. It's driving me
dialog: crazy.
dialog: 
text: Jackie pulls away from the signal a little jerkily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Five times a day?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (sighs, then)
dialog: -- I guess it's all got to do with
dialog: this shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Really, Jill, aren't you
dialog: exaggerating just a little? Five
dialog: times a day?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Well, you know what I mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: After four years? No I don't... and
dialog: I don't know too many girls who do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I'm exaggerating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How much?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
scene_heading: JACKIE AND JILL
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (taking a little breath)
dialog: Well... it's not so much the number
dialog: of times he does it, it's... he
text: does it for a long time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He does?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Well yes -- you know that about
dialog: George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's been so long I don't how long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Quite a while... an hour, an hour
dialog: and a half -- sometimes forty-five
dialog: minutes -- that's quite a while,
dialog: isn't It?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I would say so, yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Honey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: ... Mmm-hmmm.

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- He came up behind me and I was
dialog: wiping a dish and he just... lifted

scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE ON HIS MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSIC, THE BYRDS, "TURN, TURN, TURN."
dialog: 
text: He pulls up to a rustic house. He gets his little case off
text: the bike and then hesitates. He walks to the door and rings
dialog: the bell.
dialog: 
text: Jackie answers the door. She seems distracted and, at the
text: same time, a little wary. Much the same, in fact, as George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Hi. C'mon in.
dialog: 
text: Jackie's wearing a robe. They walk into the living room, the
text: dogs yelping.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut up, it's all right.
dialog: (to George, automatically)
dialog: Do you want a drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, I do.
dialog: 
text: She starts to mix herself a drink. She changes her mind,
text: pours herself a shot of whiskey and hurls it back. She does
text: it again. When she turns back to George he's looking at her
text: noncommittally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where do you want to do this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Probably the bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Can't you do it out here?
dialog: 
text: George looks around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, it depends. If you just
dialog: wanted a combout. I guess I could.
dialog: 
text: Jackie turns to him, honestly uncertain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, what do you think?
dialog: 
text: George himself is tentative.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know. Why don't you sit
dialog: down.
dialog: 
text: Jackie looks around a little at a loss and finally sits down
text: on the glass-topped coffee table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (meaning her position)
dialog: Is this all right?
dialog: 
text: George moves in. He draws the drapes back so light comes in
text: from the backyard and the swimming pool can be seen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: He takes her hair in his hands. The contact makes them both
text: nervous. She looks away. George continues to run his hands
text: through her hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (a little nervous)
dialog: Well, what do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd cut it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You would?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, I think so...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (almost irritable)
dialog: You don't seem very sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, I'm sure.
dialog: 
text: There is a moment where Jackie is trying to decide whether
dialog: she'll let George actually cut her hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (then)
dialog: Okay... but I want you to know one
dialog: thing.
dialog: (almost a threat)
dialog: I've got to look great tonight, I
dialog: mean I have to look great, okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FELICIA'S BEDROOM AND DRESSING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Felicia is throwing on a bandana and wraparound sunglasses.
text: She seems in a hurry.
dialog: 
text: She leaves the bathroom, moves quickly through the house to
text: the kitchen. She passes Lorna's bedroom. LORNA is changing
text: from her school clothes into a tennis dress. She watches her
dialog: mother flash by.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Felicia stops. She is holding a dangling pearl earring in her
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Mona, Mona!
dialog: 
text: MONA comes out from the laundry room. Felicia has called a
text: little too loud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: (indicates earring)
dialog: Have you seen the other one of
dialog: these by any chance? I want to wear
dialog: them tonight.
dialog: (before Mona can answer)
dialog: Oh... when George gets here, tell
dialog: him to wait. I have to pick up a
dialog: dress and I may have to have it
dialog: fitted, but be sure...
dialog: 
text: Lorna ambles into the kitchen, expressionless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: ... to tell him to wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Yes, ma'am. But I have to go to the
dialog: market...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Just be sure he doesn't leave.
dialog: 
text: Felicia flashes out the door and into the carport, visible
text: through the kitchen. She takes off. Lorna slowly slips a
text: white swetlet onto her slender wrist.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM AND BATH - DAY
dialog: 
text: which includes a sauna. Jackie's got on a terry-cloth robe.
text: George has been wetting her hair in the basin. Her terry
text: cloth robe is bulky and obviously in the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Jill's coming with us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She's incredible...
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: She loves you, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah... I mean great.
dialog: 
text: George begins to cut. Jackie winces a little. George notices
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Getting my hair cut is always a
text: little nerve-wracking.
dialog: 
text: The cutting goes on. The bathroom is very close. George has
text: begun to perspire a little as has Jackie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I don't get it done often.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Whew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's hot in here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on
dialog: and it makes the whole bathroom
dialog: hot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah... wow.
dialog: 
text: George stops and takes off his shirt. He's wearing a purple T
text: shirt underneath. He goes back to cutting. Jackie's getting
text: more and more edgy, partly because of George's proximity and
text: partly because of her concern over what he's doing. George on
text: the other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job
text: at hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Not too much, don't cut too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Jackie, would you argue with your
dialog: doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The shrink? Many times.
dialog: 
text: George stops and looks at her. Both are perspiring freely
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bernstein... seemed to think I
dialog: hated men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Do you? You still see him?
dialog: 
text: Jackie tries to look at her hair in the mirror. George gently
text: pulls her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (with some feeling)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
text: Jackie doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ... he tried to... uh... make it
dialog: with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you?
dialog: 
text: Jackie looks up slowly. George is still cutting, not looking
text: directly at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It was after you, baby. After you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (breathes deeply)
dialog: Boy, that sauna is really... can't
dialog: you turn it down or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No... Lester likes it on all the
dialog: time in case he wants to use it.

scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM & BATH - DAY
dialog:

dialog: very close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Anyway, he offered me a silver
dialog: cloud. At least he should give me a
dialog: Ferrari and pay off my house and
dialog: give me a nine carat ring or
dialog: something...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Did Lester know about him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: There was nothing to know.
dialog: Anyway... if I can't have love I
dialog: have to at least have money. I have
dialog: to have some pride I can do
dialog: something.
dialog: 
text: George has started to dry her hair. He stops. He picks up the
text: scissors. Her hair is askew still so it's difficult to see
dialog: what George has done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
text: (staring at the scissors,
dialog: a warning)
dialog: George...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I just have to do one little thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: If you screw me up for tonight,

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did I what?

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, I don't tell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (teasing)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, did you or didn't you?
dialog: 
text: George shuts the blower off. He picks up his comb for the
text: final comb out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now, baby... if I told you about
dialog: her... then you couldn't count on
dialog: me not telling anymore... could
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You did, didn't you?
dialog: 
text: They're very close and Jackie's moving closer. She's
text: intrigued, amused and at ease. George is trying to keep some
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Baby...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You did, I know you did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: One of my few virtues is
dialog: discretion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You just can't stand to miss one of
dialog: them, can you?
dialog: 
text: She's moving closer and closer, being deliberately
text: provocative -- to seduce the information out of him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lester pulls into it. He stops, reaches in the glove
text: compartment and pulls out one of the little airline bottles
text: of vodka. He pours it into a glass, drinks it. He notices
text: George's bike in the driveway. Next to him on the seat is a
text: prettily wrapped package.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM AND BATH - JACKIE AND GEORGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: George sprays her. He turns her around in the chair to face
text: the mirror so she can see herself for the first time. She

text: and modishly and beautifully cut to her face.
dialog: 
text: Jackie's lips part.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softly)

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (staring at her)
dialog: Yeah, baby...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're a genius.

dialog: it back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (grabbing it, thrilled)
dialog: You're a genius, do you know that,
dialog: you're a genius?
dialog: 
text: She turns and throws her arms around George, kissing him.
text: It's too much for George. He kisses her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying to resist)
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: 
text: George is obsessed. He wraps his arms around her and she
text: responds, passionately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: 
text: They are grappling, pushing and pulling with each other.
text: George kicks away the stool by the mirror and tries to bend
text: Jackie to the rug-covered bathroom floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (genuine)
dialog: No! Don't! Please!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (forcing her down)
dialog: I don't want to... I swear...
dialog: 
text: She throws her arms around him, kissing him and shoving him
text: away. George is tearing at his trousers. They are on the
text: floor now , rolling around, bouncing gently off the ceramic
text: molding from the sunken tub.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It'll ruin everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know... you don't know, I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't, don't, don't...
dialog: 
text: They hit the sauna room door as they're rolling around and
text: the door opens. Steam comes pouring over them, momentarily

dialog: tug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (moans)
dialog: Oh, no...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's Lester.
dialog: 
text: She's frozen with fear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER'S VOICE

dialog: Hey, doll... Jackie... honey...
dialog: where are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Get up, get up, get up.
dialog: 
text: George is already trying to pull on his trousers. Jackie is
text: up and clutching her robe, unable to move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh God, oh God, oh God... do
dialog: something, please God, do
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sit down.

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: Sit down!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WITH LESTER
dialog: 
text: He's moved into the bedroom, carrying the package obviously a
text: gift for Jackie. He's been a little puzzled. His puzzlement
text: is rapidly turning to suspicion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Jackie?... Jackie?
dialog: 
text: Lester opens the door. He's hit with a blast of steam and the
text: sight of George stripped to the waist, ostensibly working
text: over Jackie who is loosely wrapped with a towel. George has a
text: comb in one hand and now turns on the dryer, blowing it with
text: a somewhat exaggerated gesture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Shut the door, shut the door!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: He shuts the door. Then he thinks better of it. He opens the
text: door again and takes a step into the bathroom.
dialog: 
text: George waves the comb at Lester a little impatiently. It's
text: wet and sprinkles Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, either come in or stay out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Shut the door, Lester. What do you
dialog: think this is, a picnic?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (confused now)
dialog: Sorry, honey, I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's okay, that's okay, just shut
text: the door.
dialog: 
text: Lester shuts the door, feeling a little chagrined, and
text: relieved. He sits on the bed and puts the present beside him.
text: In a moment George emerges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... she's very upset...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What about, tonight?

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: FELICIA

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: See, nothin' to it.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. SAMMY'S FOYER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMMY
dialog: Sure I know Jill.
dialog: 
text: Lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPE

text: the open foyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
dialog: 
text: where Jill and George were earlier. Lester's ordered a drink.
text: The huge black in the Afro offers him a toke. Lester stares

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (a little lamely,
dialog: indicating drink)
dialog: ... I'm...
dialog: 
text: He takes his drink and half toasts the black. He stops and
text: his eyes PAN the room. Lester is virtually the only person on
text: his feet. Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep
text: sofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely
text: moving. In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke
text: from the joints.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LESTER
dialog: 
text: Lester shakes his head as if to clear it. He takes a drink
text: and almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe
text: lights go on.
dialog: 
text: Lester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do
text: with his drink. He manages to stagger out of the strobe light
text: effect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RED DOG
dialog: Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's

text: Pope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the
text: direction of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had
dialog: taken earlier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: 
text: peers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt
text: beards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and
text: continues up it until he finds himself in a den.
dialog: 
text: Several people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and
text: watching television. They seem a shade better dressed than
text: those in the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and
text: partially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of
text: it. He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a
dialog: pipe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEN

speaker_heading: MAN WITH PIPE
dialog: (taking a good look at
dialog: Lester, then)
dialog: No, that's Sally.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MAN WITH PIPE
text: (pointing with his pipe

text: Lester looks at Sally. She looks at Lester, nods. Turns back
text: to screen to watch herself. Lester turns from Sally to see a

dialog: 
text: OUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
dialog: 
text: They're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: POPE

speaker_heading: POPE
dialog: Two weeks from tomorrow.

dialog: Why didn't you tell me before?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPE
dialog: -- just before I ask you out? I
dialog: can't do that. Let's get out of
dialog: here before good old Les catches up
dialog: with us again.
dialog: 
text: There's a flash of light from the poolhouse window. Jill
text: turns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind.
text: ANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
dialog: 
text: George has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. He's
text: looking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. It opens
text: again and he closes it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- do you want ice?
dialog: 
text: Interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- no.
dialog: 
text: George pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie.
text: Neither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each
text: other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis
text: court lights which someone has turned on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: -- we're kidding ourselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (staring right back)
dialog: -- we are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- last night I dreamt I was fifty
dialog: years old and Mary told me I was
text: supposed to meet Jill at the shop.
dialog: It seared me shitless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I can't imagine being with Jill
dialog: when she's fifty years old. I can't
dialog: imagine not being with you.
dialog: 
text: George moves to her. Jackie is waiting for him. They kiss. It
text: is long and lingering and deliberate. George breaks away and
text: goes to the poolhouse door. There's no lock, only an eye
text: latch on the screen door. He latches it, tests it. It gives
text: slightly. Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to
text: Jackie who stands waiting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- but what about her? I don't want
dialog: to hurt Jill.
dialog: 
text: George takes the coke out of her hand. She lets him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: 
text: walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe
text: lights are going again in the living room.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted
text: lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. The
text: vision disturbs him greatly.
dialog: 
text: He carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get
text: near her. She seems to move. He moves after her through the
text: lights down the length of the room, going as quickly as
text: prudence allows. Finally when they reach the end of the
text: living room she's disappeared. Then he looks out and sees her
text: poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged
text: path that leads down to the pool.
dialog: 
text: He lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass
dialog: door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
dialog: 
text: have made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in
text: sight. Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPE
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: We can't really leave that poor man
dialog: here alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPE
dialog: -- he'll never know the difference.
dialog: 
text: Jill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: -- still -- at least we should tell
dialog: him we're going. C'mon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POPE
dialog: (going along with it,
dialog: protesting)
dialog: I'm telling you he won't know the
dialog: difference.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BY THE POOL - LESTER
dialog: 
text: now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care
text: that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step
dialog: is a possible disaster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWIN
dialog: (from Jacuzzi)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Lester looks down, sees one of the Twins. Her arm is
text: outstretched, her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the
text: shrubbery spotlights. She's holding a joint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: -- it's getting soggy.
dialog: 
text: Lester takes it.
dialog: 
text: THE GUY WITH HER
dialog: -- just put it on the bench over
dialog: there and come on in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: -- in there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GUY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it
text: over to the bench. He puts the joint down.
dialog: 
text: Stares at it. He looks up and there's the other Twin standing
text: beside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel
text: loosely flung over her shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWIN
dialog: (meaning joint)
dialog: Could I have that?
dialog: 
text: Lester silently hands it to her. Stares at the pool and the
text: other Twin isn't there. He looks back and the one who had
text: taken the joint is gone. He looks back to the pool and the
text: other Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy
text: in the pool.
dialog: 
text: Lester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost
text: falling down as he does.
dialog: 
text: Carrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Say --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GUY
dialog: -- what is it now, man?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Do you know where I can find a
dialog: towel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GUY
dialog: -- the poolhouse.
dialog: 
text: Holding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over
text: his boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse. He
text: tries the door. The latch creaks. He pulls at it again and
text: the latch pops open. He starts to open the door, then hears
text: the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense
text: love making. The girl is quite carried away.
dialog: 
text: Lester hesitates. He listens as her sighs, interspersed with
text: fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. He thinks
text: better of it. He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly
text: closes the screen door.
dialog: 
text: He starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side.
text: He can't resist. He moves to it. He can't see anything. He
text: moves closer. The dim, dark but classical outline of a man
text: mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity
text: can be SEEN. Lester watches. The SOUNDS are not as loud from
text: this angle, but gradually they can be HEARD as the woman's
text: cries grow louder. Lester is glued to the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL'S VOICE
dialog: -- there you are. Les. Les -- Les --
dialog: Les, we're leaving.
dialog: 
text: The ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants, not
text: taking his face away from the window. Jill and Johnny Pope
text: stand beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Shhh --
dialog: (with genuine awe)
dialog: -- now that's what I call fucking.
dialog: 
text: Pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window.
dialog: 
text: As he does, a light begins to flood the room. It is the
text: refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic
text: impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end
text: table to another end table and to the refrigerator.
dialog: 
text: It opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of
dialog: George and Jackie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: 
text: who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of
text: the image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and
text: determined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks
text: past Jill without looking at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: -- what --
dialog: 
text: She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (watching)
dialog: Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Oh no.
dialog: 
text: She turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it
text: through the window, shattering the glass everywhere.

speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: You son of a bitch! You bastard!

scene_heading: WITH GEORGE AND JACKIE

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Honey? Where've you been? We've

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 
text: An ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the
text: wall, and Jill can be SEEN now storming off with Pope.
dialog: 
text: George, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far
text: window, pulls it open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
dialog: 
text: He's got the pants on backwards. He turns back to Jackie who

text: into a purse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- Jesus --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- well you better go after her.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- shit...
dialog: (he grabs his shirt)
dialog: ... wait here, honey --
dialog: 
text: He runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi

speaker_heading: TWIN ONE

dialog: Who was that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWIN TWO
text: Far out.
dialog: 
text: George, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling Jill.
text: He can't find her. He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy
text: covered wall. He can't reach the top. He moves along the
text: wall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. It's locked. He peers
text: through the gate calling frantically:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEROGE
dialog: Jill, honey?
dialog: 
text: Inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare
text: teeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously. George
text: chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the
dialog: house.
dialog: 
text: He trips and falls.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM

scene_heading: AT THE POOLHOUSE
dialog: 
text: George heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (swaying in)
dialog: Jill... Jill... Jill.
dialog: 
text: He looks in bedroom, then moves back to the phone and dials.
text: It rings three times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OPERATOR'S VOICE
dialog: Jackie Shawn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- yeah, this is --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OPERATOR'S VOICE
dialog: -- yes, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I guess you haven't heard from her
dialog: yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OPERATOR'S VOICE
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay... thanks...
dialog: 
text: He hangs up. Stares around the room. Jill's apartment is, as
text: usual, good-little-girl tidy. (A contrast with Jackie's
dialog: particularly kitchen.)
dialog: 
text: George walks over to the window and look's at the city. He
text: walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAY SCREEN
dialog: 
text: There is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING.
dialog: 
text: George opens his eyes. Above him is the carport and Jill's
text: yellow Mustang has just pulled in. George rises. He walks
text: into the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the
text: kitchen, carrying the paper. The kitchen clock reads 4:44.
dialog: 
text: George glances at it. Then back at Jill. She looks at him,
text: frightened but not moving. Her hair is stringy and she's got
text: no makeup on. There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm
text: and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of
text: which George will note in the course of the scene.
dialog: 
text: George looks her up and down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don't want to fight, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't want to fight either.
dialog: Look... uh -- I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: (moving to her, taking her
dialog: arm)
dialog: I do, Jill.
dialog: 
text: At this point he notes the arm bruise. Jill stares back at
text: him unflinching. George smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: How come you took your own car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (getting a cigarette)
dialog: I didn't want him meeting me here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well that's something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You didn't plan on fucking him
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 
text: Jill doesn't answer.
dialog: 
text: She walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to
text: take off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe
text: over it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You did fuck him, didn't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I'm very tired, George.
dialog: 
text: Jill goes into the living room. George grabs her arm again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Didn't you, baby?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Let go of me.
dialog: 
text: George doesn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll
dialog: call the police.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, Christ.
dialog: 
text: He lets go of her. The PHONE RINGS. Jill answers it. Her tone
text: alters appreciably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Oh, hi... listen, can I call you
dialog: back?... Yes... no, everything's
dialog: fine, really... bye.
dialog: 
text: She hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That was him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You told him I was here and he
dialog: wanted to know if I was beating you
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: Jill smiles thinly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, did you get a job out of it
dialog: at least?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I'd like you to leave now.
dialog: 
text: George doesn't move. Jill goes over and fishes into a tote
text: bag by the wall. She returns with Felicia's missing earring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: -- and take this with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where did this come from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Who knows, I'm sure you don't --
dialog: but if it'll help any, I found it
dialog: in your bed.
dialog: 
text: George nods. Jill's anger is growing and her hurt is
text: beginning to surface now. Tears start welling in her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (unsteadily)
dialog: So who else was there besides
dialog: Jackie? Huh?... huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Obviously there were others,
dialog: weren't there?
dialog: 
text: George stares at Jill. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Obviously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: How many?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you wanna know for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I just want to know, that's all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What difference does it make?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I just want to know while we were
dialog: seeing each other... I just don't
dialog: want girls looking at me and
dialog: knowing and me not knowing...
dialog: 
text: Jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable. George
text: moves to her and tries to put his arms around her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Baby, please don't... I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (breaking away)
dialog: I don't want to be a fool!... I
dialog: want to look them in the eye and
dialog: say, I know!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (she's backing up, he's
dialog: trying to touch her)
dialog: Baby, don't do this --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (fighting for control)
dialog: -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- please, baby --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: -- no, it'll help me, really --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I'll know you've lied to me... all
dialog: along. I'll know you're incapable
dialog: of... love... that'll help me...
dialog: not now, but eventually.
dialog: 
dialog: It's been rising in him the last few exchanges. Now all
text: George's restraints seem to leave him. He stops trying to
text: touch her and stands his ground, exploding:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You dumb cunt, everybody fucks
dialog: everybody, grow up, for Christ's
dialog: sakes. You're an antique, you know
dialog: that? Look around you -- all of
dialog: 'em, all these chicks they're all
dialog: fucking, they're getting their hair
dialog: done so they can go and fuck,
dialog: that's what it's all about. Come
dialog: into the shop tomorrow and I'll
dialog: show you -- I fucked her, and her,
dialog: and her, and her, and her -- I
dialog: fucked 'em all!... That's what I
dialog: do, I fuck. That's why I went to
dialog: beauty school, to fuck. I can't
dialog: help that, they're there and I do
dialog: their hair and sometimes I fuck
dialog: 'em. I stick it in and I pull it
dialog: out and that's a fuck, it's not a
dialog: crime.
dialog: 
text: George leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not
text: even bothering to look at Jill. Jill has been pulled together
text: a little more by the speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: ... well I'm glad you told me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (his eyes closed)
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 
text: His tone has indicated disbelief and disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I am... I mean, you know, that's...
dialog: 
dialog: She can't finish It.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What? What? What? What? What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: ... honest. At least you're honest
dialog: with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Does it make you happy?
dialog: 
text: Jill doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I wish you'd go now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's all you've got to say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: -- yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- tell me something -- did you
dialog: talk about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: George...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Please!... that's not like you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, I know. Did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: George, now cut this out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Stop it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes, yes, I did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: George, if you keep this up I'm
text: going to scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: George...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I said you were a loser!
dialog: 
text: She starts to cry again. George smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, I'm not a loser, baby, I just
dialog: sort of break even.
dialog: 
text: George turns and walks up the stairs and out the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: George shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the
dialog: living room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: George finds himself facing Lester and two other MEN who look
text: like hoods. Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other
text: night. Before him is a bottle of J & B, a paper bucket filled
text: with melting ice. The other men rise when George walks into
dialog: the room.
dialog: 
text: Lester, glass in hand, stares silently at George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (to the other two)
dialog: Wait outside, would you?
dialog: 
text: The two Men walk toward George and pass him on either side,
text: coming very close. Both of them are much bigger than George.
text: They stare through George as they pass him.
dialog: 
text: George continues to stand there. Lester, drinking, continues
text: to stare. Lester glances idly around the living room. Then
text: back to George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: You live like a pig.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (Lester doesn't answer)
dialog: How long have you been here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (looking it)
dialog: All night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well... who are those guys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What do they look like?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, Lester... are you unhappy
dialog: with me about something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Godammit, George...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now wait a minute...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Sit down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I said sit down!
dialog: 
text: One of the men opens the door and peers through the screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Everything all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I'll call you, it's okay.
dialog: 
text: George site down. Lester has risen to his feet, a little
text: unsteadily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, George, I want to hear it from
dialog: you. Either you admit it, man to
dialog: man, to my face or I'll have him
dialog: pound it out of you, and he does a
dialog: hell of a job, believe me.
dialog: 
text: George nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I believe you...
dialog: 
text: Lester waits, standing over George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I wanna hear about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh Jesus Christ.
dialog: 
text: Lester slaps him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I wanna hear about it, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, have 'em put me away, or
dialog: whatever you're gonna do, okay?...
dialog: I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired
dialog: to tell the truth... I'm too tired
dialog: for anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I wanna hear about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What can I say!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I wanna know your thinking, I wanna
dialog: know how someone like you thinks.
dialog: Did you think you could get away
dialog: with it, did you think you could
dialog: put something over on me? Does a
dialog: guy like you get his kicks sneaking
text: around behind people's backs and
dialog: taking advantage of them? Maybe
dialog: that's your idea of being anti
dialog: Establishment!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not anti-Establishment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: That's got nothing to do with it...
dialog: You're so beyond my comprehension I
dialog: can't even discuss it with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Then don't... just have 'em beat me
dialog: up or whatever you're gonna do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: No, not yet, not yet. You worry
dialog: about it for a while, I've been
dialog: worrying all night, now you can
dialog: worry.
dialog: 
text: A pause. Lester freshens his drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Was it me, did you have something
dialog: against me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What, do you think I planned it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Did they have something against me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Didn't they tell you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I wanna hear it from you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (agonized)
dialog: ... how am I gonna tell you what
dialog: they have against you?
dialog: I mean Jesus fucking Christ,
dialog: they're women, aren't they? Have
dialog: you ever listened to women talk,
dialog: man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til
text: it's fucking coming out of my ears.
dialog: I'm on my feet all day, every
dialog: fucking day, listening to women
dialog: talk and you know what they talk
dialog: about, don't you? Being fucked up
dialog: by some guy. That's all that's on
dialog: their minds. I'm sure you've done
dialog: something they could get pissed off
dialog: about, what's that got to do with
dialog: it? All women are pissed off, man,
dialog: all of 'em. They fucking hate us!
dialog: Don't you know that?
dialog: 
text: Lester has listened to this with some alteration of his
dialog: intensity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: ... yes, I follow your thinking on
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We're always trying to fuck them...
dialog: they know it and they like it and
dialog: they don't like it... that's just
dialog: how it is... look, it's got nothing
dialog: to do with you, man. It just
dialog: happened. Felicia's got nothing to
dialog: do but shop and get her hair done
dialog: and she knows she's getting
dialog: older... her daughter hates her,
dialog: what's she going to do, go to PTA
dialog: meetings?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Do you think Lorna hates her? I
dialog: don't think she hates her. I mean
dialog: she may resent her a little...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Why, why do you think that is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I
dialog: know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Well, I don't know.
dialog: 
text: A pause. Lester goes to pour himself another drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to George)
dialog: Want a drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Have a drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay, thanks.
dialog: 
text: Lester gets up and goes to the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You don't have a clean glass in the
dialog: house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (talking to himself)
dialog: I'll have to wash one out.
dialog: 
text: He turns on the faucet in the kitchen. He brings the glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, what a way to live. I never
dialog: lived like this, not even when I
dialog: was your age, not even when I never
dialog: had a dime.
dialog: 
text: George takes the drink. Lester just shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hell of a way to treat a business
dialog: partner, that's all I can say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, you were never going to give
dialog: me the money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: I was gonna give you the money.
dialog: Probably I was. Shit, I don't know,
dialog: I don't know anything anymore.
dialog: 
text: Lester sits and stares into his drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I tell you, you never know... you
dialog: just never know... one minute
dialog: you're here and the next... I mean
dialog: a man at my age, how long have I
dialog: got -- ten years? Five years? I
dialog: wish I knew... what I was living
dialog: for.
dialog: 
text: George looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: ... You can lose it all; you can
dialog: lose it all no matter who you
dialog: are... I don't know, what's the
dialog: point of having it all. Look at me.
dialog: I don't have a goddam thing... the
dialog: market's terrible right now, went
dialog: down ten points last week, goddam
dialog: Lyndon Johnson!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh yeah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yeah,, it goes up a little and then
dialog: it goes down, maybe Nixon will do
dialog: something. What's the difference,
dialog: they're all a bunch of jerks. I
dialog: wouldn't let 'em run my business, I
dialog: can tell you that much. Not if I
dialog: had any choice in the matter.
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: I don't know what to do with you. I
dialog: don't know, I don't know what's
dialog: right or wrong anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't either, Lester, I swear to
dialog: you I don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: What about Jackie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What about her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I mean, how did that happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Lester, it just happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: She's nothing but a whore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Just a whore, I go over there, have
dialog: a few drinks and get my gun off.
dialog: I'm through with her, she's nothing
dialog: but a whore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, man, no. You can say
dialog: everybody's a whore. She's okay. I
dialog: mean Jackie'll fuck around but not
dialog: that much. Somewhere she really
dialog: likes you, Lester, and it's not
dialog: just the bread. She's okay.
dialog: 
text: Lester sits and thinks about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You really think so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I'm finished with her.
dialog: 
text: Lester goes to the door. He turns as if he'd just thought of
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, by the way, I think you oughta
dialog: know -- Lorna thinks she's got the
text: clap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yeah, the clap. That's what she
dialog: thinks. But who knows -- I don't
dialog: know.
dialog: 
text: George nods. Lester shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know anything anymore.
dialog: 
text: He opens the door and goes out. The two hoods are standing
text: there. They look to Lester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to hoods)
dialog: Go easy on him, he's a nice boy.
dialog: 
text: George looks shocked. Lester laughs, gives George a playful
dialog: punch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Just having a little fun, George...
dialog: (to hoods)
dialog: Go on home.
dialog: (to George)
dialog: I'll call you later about the shop.
dialog: I'm beat. God, I'm beat.
dialog: 
text: With that, Lester's off.

scene_heading: EXT. SHOP - GEORGE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. SHOP - NORMAN AND DEVRA
dialog: 
text: Norman is by the front desk.

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You're late, George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you?
dialog: And if you don't reach her, keep
dialog: trying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVRA
dialog: (on desk)
text: Mrs. Shumann and Mrs. Young are
dialog: waiting. Mrs. Young is kind of
dialog: p.o.'d.
dialog: 
text: George nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where's Mary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVRA
text: She hasn't showed up yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (grumbling something under
dialog: his breath, then:)
dialog: Norman!
dialog: (to Devra)
dialog: Devra, I asked you to call Jackie.
dialog: Call her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEVRA
dialog: (perturbed)
dialog: All right.

text: Norman from upstairs shouts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Somebody's going to have to wash
dialog: Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (he's had about enough)
dialog: Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo
dialog: girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You are today.
dialog: 
text: George starts to say something but he's tired. He goes to his
text: corner, slams his jacket down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. SHUMANN
dialog: Temper, temper, George.
dialog: 
text: George fiddles around with the shampoos and rinses, knocks
text: over one where the top was not on, and the shampoo spills all
text: over the table top and starts to drip on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, Jesus, that fucking goddam Mary-
dialog: 
text: He starts to look for a rag and sees that Mary, wearing a
text: cloth coat is coming into the shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mary! Get over here!
dialog: 
text: Mary moves very slowly, George waits, hands on hips. It
text: should almost be a little faggy, his petulance as if,
text: inevitably some of the shop must rub off on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mary, where were you yesterday?
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: Mary doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You ran out on me and you left it
dialog: like a goddamn pig pen.
dialog: 
text: Mary's swaying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk?
dialog: Look, I've had a rough night, one
dialog: of the roughest I've ever had, now
dialog: I'm not in the mood for any sulking
dialog: bullshit, what's wrong? Are you
dialog: sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My son Otis. He was killed in
dialog: Vietnam. They done phoned me at the
dialog: shop yesterday.
dialog: 
text: It's suddenly very quiet. The SOUND of the SHAMPOO DRIPPING
text: on the floor can be HEARD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE AND MARY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, Mary.
dialog: 
text: Mary starts to cry and like a little child buries her head on
text: George's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: -- you shouldn't talk to me like
dialog: that no matter what, George... you
dialog: know better...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- oh -- sweetheart...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: -- you shouldn't do me like that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (hugging her)
dialog: -- please, please forgive me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: -- you know better...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: -- why did you come in today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: -- left my bag, didn't have no
dialog: money...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- how did you get here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: -- took a bus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - GEORGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: on his cycle drives up Bowmont into Jackie's driveway. Her
text: car is there.
dialog: 
text: George jumps off his bike, fairly races to the door. It's
text: open and he barges in. He's met by Jackie's Yorkies who bark
text: furiously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE'S VOICE
dialog: -- just a minute, you're early --
dialog: 
text: Jackie comes walking out. She's carrying a large cooking
text: spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit, a
text: pantsuit. She's wearing more makeup than usual. She stops
text: when she sees George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- good afternoon --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- you've got to leave.
dialog: 
text: George is not prepared for this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've got to leave?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: -- yes, honey, you've got to get
dialog: out of here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: Lester's on his way.
dialog: 
text: George stares at her then walks past her into the living
text: room. Bags are packed, a coat thrown over them. The wire
text: kennel carrying cages for the Yorkies are beside the bags.
dialog: 
text: George looks into the kitchen where Jackie's been cooking
text: some pasta.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Please, we'll have to talk later --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look about last night --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (exasperated but not
dialog: unkind)
dialog: Forget about last night, it's okay,
dialog: we'll talk when I get back --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's not okay, I mean we've got to
dialog: talk now. Where are you going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Look -- either you leave or I leave
dialog: because I don't want the two of us
dialog: here when Lester arrives. I just
dialog: don't --
dialog: 
text: The level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty
text: decibels. There's the SOUND of a CAR outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: My God that's him --
dialog: 
text: George looks out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: -- It's Malone's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's it, then I'm leaving.
dialog: 
text: With that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes
text: out the door. George starts after her. The DRY CLEANER comes
text: to the door, stopping George.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLEANER
dialog: Cleaners.
dialog: 
text: George has to fumble with Jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs
text: contained. He does, tosses the cleaning down and races
text: outside to his bike.
dialog: 
text: ON THE STREET
dialog: 
text: he sees Jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill,
text: winding around the curves. George guns his bike and takes off
dialog: after her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AROUND WINDING CURVES - GEORGE
dialog: 
text: almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn. Jackie's on
text: the curve above him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AT THE NEXT CURVE - GEORGE
dialog: 
text: catches up with her, pulls even to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pull over, pull over!
dialog: 
text: He threatens to run her into the curb. She stops the car
text: sharply and jumps out.
dialog: 
text: AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVE
dialog: 
text: They've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view
dialog: lot' not built on.
dialog: 
text: Yellow October weeds cover it and there's a huge television
text: antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon
dialog: wind.
dialog: 
text: Jackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk. She grabs
text: one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down
text: below her.
dialog: 
text: Her house can be seen from this angle, the Malone's truck
text: just pulling away.
dialog: 
text: George comes up to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (looking below her)
dialog: You're going to kill me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (turning to him,
dialog: imploring)
dialog: Well then what are you trying to do-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I want to marry you. I want to take
dialog: care of you and I want your
dialog: children, and I want you to be my
dialog: girl. That's all I want. That's all
dialog: I want out of my life, and it's a
dialog: lot.
dialog: 
text: She stares at him in disbelief. She actually clutches her
dialog: stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I don't know if I'll ever
dialog: make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but
dialog: I'll take care of you, I'll make
dialog: you happy, I swear to God I will.
dialog: 
text: Jackie doesn't answer. She slowly sinks to the ground. George
text: sinks beside her. Her eyes are wet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for
dialog: God's sake, answer me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: If you knew how many times I wanted
dialog: to hear you say that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So I'm saying it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's too late...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What's too late about it? Look,
dialog: we're not dead, are we? That's the
text: only thing that's too late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: Lester's left Felicia. He's taking
dialog: me to Acapulco on the five o'clock
dialog: flight. He's asked me to marry him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So what? You don't love him, do
dialog: you? Answer me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know... Jackie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: George now is very near tears himself. What he says now he
text: has to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he
dialog: holds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't trust... anyone... but
dialog: you...
dialog: 
text: George lets his head fall on her shoulder. She's kneeling,
text: supported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly
text: on her shoulder. She has her arm around him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh my baby...
dialog: 
text: As she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's
text: silver Rolls pulls up. Lester gets out of the car, goes to
text: the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: God, there's Lester...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't go, Jackie...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I can't just let him stand by the
dialog: door...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't leave me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I've got to... I've got to tell him
dialog: where I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I don't know -- I've got to.
dialog: 
text: She gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes
text: back down the hill. George sits under the television aerial
text: and watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing
text: INTO VIEW.
dialog: 
text: Finally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth.
text: She hurries to him. He taxes her by the shoulders. They talk
text: for a moment. The discussion looks like Jackie is giving
text: Lester directions. She glances uneasily up toward George.
dialog: 
text: George is watching them.
dialog: 
text: He sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his
text: arm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. They're going
text: through the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
