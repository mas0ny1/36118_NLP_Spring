dialog: I can't see anything... Are you there?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you there!?
text: Giggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a
text: cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame.
speaker_heading: LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door?
text: She scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating...
speaker_heading: RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try.
text: RAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching...
text: CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto...
scene_heading: 2 EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 2
text: A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING
text: BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes
text: skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a
text: MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof.
text: Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a
text: cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It
text: FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: It's ammonia, not alcohol.
speaker_heading: BOY (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: (Drunk) You're so smart. I love you!
text: He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba
text: gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into...
text: TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in...
text: A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance,
text: silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs
dialog: to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want
dialog: to think about what life holds in store.
text: Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of
text: the time. Yelling over to Luba...
speaker_heading: TWB 2.
speaker_heading: RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me.
speaker_heading: LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman
dialog: wants us there at 9 in the morning.
text: Raya looks at Luba. Torn.
speaker_heading: LUBA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just a few months working in a
dialog: hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like
dialog: your mother? Marry one of these assholes?
dialog: There's nothing here!.. He said it was
dialog: both of us or no go!
text: Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates;
dialog: she needs this so badly.
speaker_heading: LUBA (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck your mom!
text: But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past
text: Luba who watches her disappear.
scene_heading: 3 INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT 3
text: Raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights
text: come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn
text: between anger and relief.
speaker_heading: RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but--
speaker_heading: HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
text: It's three in the morning.
text: Halyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the
text: lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom.
text: SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's
dialog: measly aspirations...
scene_heading: 4 EXT. KYIV - MORNING 4
text: The silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv.
scene_heading: 5 INT. APARTMENT - KYIV - MORNING 5
text: Raya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a
text: cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod.
speaker_heading: ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: Big smile!
speaker_heading: TWB 3.
text: Luba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up.
speaker_heading: LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: (practicing) I am Natalya Verbova. I am
dialog: going to Budapest to buy carpets for re-
dialog: selling. I am staying two days...
text: Raya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia,
text: nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera.
speaker_heading: LUBA (CONT'D)
dialog: No-one's gonna believe we really did it!
text: Luba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement.
text: CAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up
text: with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE.
text: Then the title of the film fades in...
text: "THE WHISTLEBLOWER"
text: A FLASHLIGHT cuts across...
scene_heading: 6 EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT 6
text: POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to
speaker_heading: THE FRONT PORCH
text: He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38.
text: Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell
text: of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE
text: standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: It just got a bit heated, you know how it
dialog: gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Kathy nods, humoring. A police radio BUZZES.
speaker_heading: OFFICER LEEDS
dialog: Ready to go?
text: Kathy eyes the wife, tries to see past them into the house.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You sure everything is alright, Ma'am?
text: The wife is still. Kathy eyes her, gently. Then, calm...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Really. It was nothing.
speaker_heading: TWB 4.
text: The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him,
text: noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to
text: a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You all have any children?
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Nope.
text: The wife looks down. The man stirs, agitated.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND (CONT'D)
dialog: So if that's all Officer...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I'd like to take a quick walk through the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: You can't do that without a warrant.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes I can, Sir, please step aside.
text: The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up
text: the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: You're not coming in my house!
text: He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he...
text: GRABS Kathy. HURLS her into a wall. CRACK. Kathy yells in
scene_heading: EXTREME PAIN.
scene_heading: O.S. POLICE SIRENS BLARE
scene_heading: 7 INT. HOSPITAL HALL - NIGHT 7
text: Three POLICE OFFICERS linger. They peek through a door at...
scene_heading: 8 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME 8
text: Kathy. She sits up on a gurney. The DOCTOR examines her
text: shoulder. It's BRUISED PURPLE.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Painful there?
text: Kathy winces.
speaker_heading: TWB 5.
text: CAPTAIN HAWK, 50s, African American, walks in, noticing her
text: exposed shoulders, and turns, uncomfortable. Kathy covers.
speaker_heading: HAWK
dialog: I'm her Captain.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Her collar bone is broken. And I'm going
text: to have to set her arm in a cast.
speaker_heading: HAWK
dialog: Lookin' for a route to the desk?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yeah, I'm gonna break every bone in my
dialog: body until I'm captain.
text: Hawk laughs.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm fine. I'm sure you have a hotter date
dialog: than this tonight.
speaker_heading: HAWK
dialog: I wish.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Just when my self esteem was gettin' so
dialog: healthy.
speaker_heading: HAWK
text: We found a boy locked in the basement.
dialog: Badly beaten. We charged the husband with
dialog: domestic assault. You made the right
dialog: call. But you should've waited for
dialog: backup. (sighing)... I wish I didn't have
dialog: to say this--
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You're giving Deke the gold shield.
speaker_heading: HAWK
dialog: I have to Kathy. He has seniority.
text: Kathy shakes her head, deeply disappointed.
speaker_heading: HAWK (CONT'D)
dialog: You deserve the promotion. You should be
dialog: a detective and if we had more openings--
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That gold shield was the first one in
dialog: four years... Sir... I'm going to have to
dialog: resign, and take that position overseas.
speaker_heading: TWB 6.
speaker_heading: HAWK
dialog: I think that's a mistake. I want you on
dialog: my team.
text: Kathy sighs, touched. But...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on
dialog: the streets much longer. Not if I don't
dialog: know there's something on the other end.
text: She looks up at Hawk, but he's staring past her at...
text: The door. Kathy turns, seeing... A young, scared GIRL, 15.
dialog: This is ERIN. Kathy's daughter. She's heard everything. Hawk
text: eyes Erin, sympathetic.
speaker_heading: HAWK
dialog: Just think about it, will you?
text: He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes
text: Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say.
scene_heading: 9 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER 9
text: Erin stares out the window. Kathy watches her, concerned.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I wish you could stay here.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Me too.
text: Erin turns. Serious. Weighing...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I mean it's fine living at dad's, but...
dialog: Now I really won't see you for a while.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I'm doing this for us. If I have a better
dialog: job, I can give you guys more.
text: Erin nods, tearing again.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: When do you have to decide?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Come here.
text: Erin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug,
text: wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face.
dialog: TWB 7.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Are you sure it's not dangerous?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Of course. It's been four years. Things
dialog: are getting back to normal over there.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: A BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS
text: everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN. Cyrillic letters:
scene_heading: SARAJEVO - 3 KM.
text: Sprayed across it in red: TURN AROUND!
scene_heading: 10 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 10
text: A SILHOUETTE breaks the horizon and SPEEDS towards us,
text: throwing up gravel: a dented white BUS, emblazoned with large
text: black letters: "UN". A UNITED STATES flag on it.
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA 1999
scene_heading: 11 INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 11
text: Kathy sits in a bus full of BLUE BERETS. She looks out the
text: window, her eyes drinking it all in...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You come here today as a beacon of hope,
dialog: as representatives of humanity's highest
dialog: aspirations.
text: In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A
text: SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH.
text: Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen,
text: 20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace'
text: sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY.
text: In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one
text: flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR.
text: The bus cranks around the corner, entering...
scene_heading: 12 EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 12
text: The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war
text: reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue
text: is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged
text: from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to
text: the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin.
dialog: TWB 8.
text: IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window...
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are
text: at eye level. People just running to the
dialog: store.
text: All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome
text: by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
text: MOVE ALONG rapt faces... YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED MEN, heads
dialog: held high, ready for anything. We're in...
scene_heading: 13 INT. MEETING HALL - LATER 13
text: BILL HYNES paces before the assembled NEW RECRUITS. He's in
text: his 50s, distinguished and seemingly in charge...
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES
dialog: You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace
dialog: International to represent the US as
dialog: monitors for the United Nations, which
dialog: means you are the only national
dialog: contingent coming from a private
dialog: military. So you people chose to come
dialog: here. And for the next few weeks, we will
dialog: teach you how to protect the rule of law
dialog: in a war zone, how to rebuild a civil
dialog: society brick by brick...
text: MOVING OVER more RECRUITS... On their laps, "DYNCORP"
text: ORIENTATION FOLDERS. MEN, listening, determined...
scene_heading: 14 EXT. OUTLYING SUBURB - DAY 14
text: Kathy and RECRUITS receive TRAINING from a PAKISTANI MONITOR,
text: shadowing him as he hands food-packs to a LINE of REFUGEES.
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES (O.S.)
dialog: ...to ensure the dignity, equality, and
dialog: inalienable human rights of every single
dialog: person in this devastated place.
text: The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of
text: the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He
text: hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what
text: to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather
text: away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I?
text: ASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans.
speaker_heading: TWB 9.
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES (CONT'D)
dialog: The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended
dialog: this war, dictating that an International
dialog: Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth
dialog: the transition from war to peace.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SARAJEVO - DAY 15
text: KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a
text: mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER.
text: CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field.
text: A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader,
text: TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out...
text: A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A
text: SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES (O.S.)
dialog: But you will learn that peace is harder
dialog: won than war..
text: Kathy watches the boy run back up the road. The recruits head
dialog: down STEEP STEPS into...
scene_heading: 16 INT. ARTILLERY DEPOSIT - MOMENTS LATER 16
text: Light sneaks through cracks, catching on the oil black
text: barrels of THOUSANDS of GUNS. Todd hands out BINDERS.
speaker_heading: TODD MYERS
dialog: We are still in the process of disarming
dialog: the Muslim, Croat, and Serb militias. You
dialog: will be cataloguing these arms for
dialog: decommissioning records.
text: Kathy eyes the unending stash of GUNS.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. SARAJEVO SUBURBS - DUSK 17
text: Kathy drives past a MILITARY BASE, an ITALIAN FLAG flying...
text: A few hundred yards up the street, a BAR...
speaker_heading: BELLA LUNA BAR
text: Driving past a another BAR. GERMAN FLAG... A SIGN: BERLIN
text: NIGHTS... Kathy passes by, amused.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. AMERICAN DORMS - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - EVENING 18
text: Kathy and Carmen are led by a MONITOR through a sparsely
text: furnished UNIT. A poster of `Born in the USA' on the wall.
speaker_heading: TWB 10.
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES (O.S.)
dialog: You will learn that every morning's
dialog: hope...
text: Carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress.
scene_heading: 19 INT. LOCAL GROCERY STORE - DAY 19
text: Kathy inspects items on the shelves. Nothing familiar.
scene_heading: MOVING POV FROM BUS - EARLIER
text: A cluster of WOMEN in BLACK BURKAS. They sway like reeds in
text: the wind, grief overcoming them as they watch:
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES (O.S.)
dialog: ...is haunted by yesterday's nightmare...
text: UN BLUE HELMETS supervise the dig of a mass grave. Bodies are
text: revealed. A child's shoe is uncovered. A BURLY PEACEKEEPER
text: turns, sickened.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. TITO BARRACKS - AFTERNOON 20
text: The bus arrives. The base is surrounded by barbed wire and
text: overlook sights, manned by ARMED MILITARY.
text: MEETING HALL: Hynes looks out at the new batch. Proud.
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES
dialog: But today is a new day. As Head of the
dialog: United Nations Mission here I trust that
dialog: we stake our highest values, even our
dialog: lives, on the belief that we can rebuild,
dialog: we must renew, we will witness the
dialog: rebirth of this country.
text: The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER
text: THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back:
text: Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde
text: hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the
text: room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.
scene_heading: 21 INT. KITCHEN - IPTF DORM - EVENING 21
text: Kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread. Carmen
text: across from her. Kathy takes a bite and grimaces.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I thought this was peanut butter but--
speaker_heading: TWB 11.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: It's ass paste? I know. I bought it too.
dialog: Let's get out of here. I need a drink.
scene_heading: 22 EXT. STREET - SARAJEVO - NIGHT 22
text: ROCK MUSIC ECHOES from several bars. Carmen heads toward one,
text: when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN IPTF
dialog: That's a military Bar. You want the party
dialog: in there...
scene_heading: He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki
text: lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit.
text: Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR
text: and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo.
text: There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN
text: WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Hon, they're all yours.
text: They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the
text: officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then
text: zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is
text: surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their
text: shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a
dialog: Jaegermeister.
text: Jan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she
text: spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: What about you? You don't have an order?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No. I'm the polite one.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I like polite.
text: Carmen turns his head toward her.
dialog: TWB 12.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get
text: toasted.
text: Kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans
text: into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye,
text: but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN
text: SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous.
text: And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...
speaker_heading: ITALIAN SOLDIER
dialog: I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.
text: Kathy looks him over.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.
text: The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh.
speaker_heading: TODD MYERS (O.S.)
dialog: We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale...
dialog: Kathy, right?
text: Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF
text: AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly.
speaker_heading: TODD MYERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look the basic lay of the land is we have
dialog: to work with the other nationals, but we
dialog: don't mix with them at night.
text: JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking...
speaker_heading: JIM HIGGINS
dialog: Lucky those wops don't carry guns or
dialog: we'd've had ourselves a situation.
dialog: Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping
dialog: we'd get to squeeze some off.
speaker_heading: TODD MYERS
dialog: At who? Better odds you'll step on a land
dialog: mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do
dialog: for you then?
speaker_heading: JIM HIGGINS
dialog: (embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who
dialog: buried it.
text: Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy.
speaker_heading: TWB 13.
speaker_heading: TODD MYERS
dialog: You ever had to take someone down?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Just once.
text: The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good.
scene_heading: 23 INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT 23
text: Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to
text: leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still
text: with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS.
text: Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's
text: watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: You should probably get her home.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You probably shouldn't have let her drink
dialog: that much.
text: Kathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys.
dialog: Nothing was going to happen to her.
text: Kathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her.
speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I was hoping you'd come back.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Well I did. And now we're both leaving.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING 24
text: Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley.
scene_heading: 25 INT. DORM - KITCHEN - MORNING 25
text: Kathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing
text: relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: What the hell happened last night?
text: Kathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They
text: both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock.
speaker_heading: TWB 14.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Let's move. We're gonna be late.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY 26
dialog: Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo
text: suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings.
text: Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And
text: stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions
text: Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Do you have any idea where we are?
text: Kathy shakes her head. No idea.
scene_heading: 27 INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER 27
text: A run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple
text: of small offices off the open center.
text: Kathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for
dialog: them... Jan Van Der Velde.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Late night ladies?
text: They eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder.
speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm your duty officer. You check the duty
dialog: roster. Every day. You're each assigned
dialog: to monitor and instruct a group of
dialog: Bosnian local police. We work in six week
dialog: shifts. You instruct in the mornings,
text: then go into the field with them in the
dialog: afternoon. One of you needs to go now.
text: He eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs.
speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
dialog: They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out
text: the gate, then left, left, park, right...
text: Kathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys.
speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
text: My van. There's a map in front.
text: She drops the keys, grabs them, and rushes out.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. 5TH CANTON - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - MORNING 28
text: A SCHOOL sprayed with GRAFFITI and BULLETS.
speaker_heading: TWB 15.
scene_heading: 29 INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING 29
text: An abandoned CLASSROOM. Shabby corkboards with yellowing PSA
text: posters, ragged kids' drawings, and tired sticky tape.
text: Kathy skims through the training binders. The DOOR OPENS and
text: a GROUP OF LOCAL POLICE file in. They whisper, exchanging
text: lascivious glances. Kathy straightens her uniform.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Feel free to sit wherever you like.
text: Kathy waits for them to take their seats. They don't. A
text: BOSNIAN WOMAN, pretty, rushes in. Spotting Kathy...
speaker_heading: BOSNIAN WOMAN
dialog: Sorry I am late. I'm your interpreter.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Great, well... I just asked them to sit.
text: The interpreter shakes her head benignly. They take their
text: seats. The interpreter looks at Kathy.
speaker_heading: BOSNIAN WOMAN
dialog: They like to be difficult. They
dialog: understand if you're clear. Mostly they
dialog: have trouble speaking English. But let's
dialog: see if you can get them to talk at all.
text: Kathy looks out, suddenly daunted. She presses on, opening
text: her binder as authoritatively as she can.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime
dialog: scene investigation today. If we could--
text: An older officer, DANIK, stands, defiant.
speaker_heading: DANIK (BROKEN ENGLISH)
dialog: Where do we sign to say we came?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Actually, you sign the attendance at the
dialog: end of the session. It's a UN mandate--
speaker_heading: DANIK
dialog: Or we sign now?
text: Full of malice. Kathy puts the sheet away, then...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: We sign later.
speaker_heading: TWB 16.
text: The cop scoffs, and sits.
scene_heading: 30 INT. CLASSROOM - LATER 30
text: Kathy stands in front of a BLACKBOARD with DRAWINGS on a
text: CRIME SCENE. She crosses off TWO AREAS on the board.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: ...Keeping the crime scene clean is
dialog: number one.
text: A weak smile. Nothing from the crowd. She trundles on.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D) INTERPRETER
dialog: Remember you could be Pamyatayte scho vu bu mholy
dialog: stepping on the very evidence stavatu na scho nam pokazaye
dialog: that could incriminate. You yaka bula nespodivanka. Treba

dialog: bag. We call that 'chain of
dialog: evidence.'
text: Kathy looks out. The cops are barely paying attention. ONE
text: stubs out a cigarette. Another closes the binder, defiantly.

dialog: We sign sheet now?
text: Kathy leans back, disappointed. She hands him the sheet. They
text: all sign, apathetic.
speaker_heading: DANIK (CONT'D)
dialog: You will tell UN we were cooperating?
text: Kathy tries to retain a poker face but their indifference
text: stings. And just as they're about to leave...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: We have to go to the hospital together.
text: The cops eye her, agitated.
scene_heading: 31 EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 31
text: Kathy's SUV pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars.
text: IPTF OFFICER CLARKSON stands outside. He eyes his watch.
text: Kathy rushes to him, but he's already a foot in the door.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: We got here as quick as we could.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON (BRITISH ACCENT)
dialog: Just try to get them here on time.
speaker_heading: TWB 17.
scene_heading: 32 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 32
text: Clarkson leads Kathy and the BOSNIAN POLICE through the hall.
dialog: Gurney's and IVs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't
text: want to be examined here. Some windows are still covered with
text: wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. The
text: floors still hold the stains of old blood.
text: Clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Seems we have two stabbings, one
text: shooting, and a man with a broken leg and
text: a bad hangover who can't remember what
dialog: happened... Average night back in
dialog: Brighton.
text: The cops stare at him, lost. As they file into a SMALL ROOM
text: filled with tightly drawn curtains. They all squeeze into the
text: center together. Kathy is pressed against the large cop.
text: Clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing...
text: ZLATA SEHIK, 40, Muslim. Her face is covered with wounds. She
text: avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. She
text: pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as...
speaker_heading: CLARKSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (reading chart) "facial contusions from
dialog: repeated beatings with fist",
dialog: "lacerations on the eye caused by the
dialog: edge of an iron"...
text: He pauses. Looking at Zlata, he moves her sheet up to expose
text: her leg. Zlata's eyes tear. Clarkson reads...
speaker_heading: CLARKSON (CONT'D)
dialog: "The right hand was the first entry point
dialog: of a large kitchen knife"... "The second
text: entry point in the upper left thigh"...
text: It went through her hand and into her
dialog: leg... Who's going to take this report?
text: Kathy looks out at the Bosnian cops, but they stare at the
text: ground. One cop peeks into the next cubicle. Kathy looks at
text: Clarkson for a cue. He holds out the clipboard.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyone?
text: No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns
text: to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She
text: goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant.
dialog: TWB 18.
speaker_heading: VIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH)
dialog: I will take it.
text: The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy,
text: hungry for support. But Danik scoffs.
speaker_heading: DANIK (BOSNIAK)
dialog: (At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna.
text: Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy
text: looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: VIKO
dialog: She is Muslim. He said she deserved it.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Alright, that's it. Everyone out.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a
dialog: complaint?
text: The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf.
text: Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye.
text: Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at
text: Zlata, who lies helpless.
scene_heading: 33 INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER 33
text: Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him.
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: She has to file a complaint. A woman gets
text: stabbed in the face and there are no
dialog: repercussions?
text: Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Quit it! You hear me?
text: Kathy reddens. The local cops look over.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON (CONT'D)
dialog: We are not investigators. We are
dialog: monitors. You don't know a Serb from a
dialog: Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic
dialog: hatreds that started a war. This isn't
dialog: just policing, it's diplomacy.
speaker_heading: TWB 19.
text: Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't run the show, we make sure the
text: show runs smoothly.
scene_heading: 34 INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING 34
text: Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She
text: flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out
text: of her room, dolled up for the evening.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Come out. You can't solve this tonight.
dialog: I'm not taking no for an answer.
scene_heading: 35 EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT 35
text: Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches
text: the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR
text: walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a
text: short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking.
scene_heading: 36 EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING 36

scene_heading: 37 INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING 37
text: Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy.
scene_heading: 38 INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER 38
text: Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top.
speaker_heading: VIKO
dialog: Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital
dialog: eight time because of her husband. Every
dialog: time she try to file a complaint, my
dialog: bosses send her back. They always laugh
dialog: at the woman... They laughed at my
dialog: mother. They do not make prosecutions of
dialog: domestic violence. I want to get enough
dialog: evidence to do this.
text: Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily...
speaker_heading: VIKO (CONT'D)
dialog: This is why you are here, no?
text: Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes
text: the files, flipping through them. Thinking...
dialog: TWB 20.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you
dialog: go back to the hospital... You can pull
dialog: the records for every one of her visits.
scene_heading: 39 INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY 39
text: A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files.
scene_heading: 40 EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 40
text: Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through
text: Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Okay, now get the same thing from all the
dialog: doctors who treated her. They will have
text: to testify on Zlata's behalf.
scene_heading: 41 INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING 41
text: Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows
text: Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: This is good. Let's cross reference each
dialog: injury with other cases where felony
dialog: assaults were ruled. Can you get
dialog: something like that?
text: Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar
dialog: is illegal then the same standard can be
dialog: applied to a domestic assault.
scene_heading: 42 INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY 42
text: Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules.
speaker_heading: KATHY (O.S.)
dialog: If an attorney presents this properly,
dialog: referencing international standards, you
dialog: might be able to get a conviction.
text: Viko and Zlata wait... then breathe relief. They won. Viko
text: turns TO THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM: Kathy smiles, at last
dialog: feeling they can really accomplish something.
scene_heading: 43 INT. JAN'S OFFICE - ILIDZA STATION - DAY 43

speaker_heading: TWB 21.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sorry, you wanted to see me?

speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Madeleine Rees wants to see you. Head of
dialog: the Office of the United Nations High
dialog: Commissioner for Human Rights.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I'm sure it's fine. You followed
dialog: protocol, right?
text: Kathy rushes out, worried. Jan smiles, in on a secret.
scene_heading: 44 INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - SARAJEVO - MORNING 44

text: cover the walls. Pictures of Madeleine Rees with Kofi Annan,
text: Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela... Kathy is intimidated.
text: MADELEINE REES, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair,
text: British. She sashays in with a DOBERMAN on a leash.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE REES
dialog: Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap.
text: Kathy eyes the malevolent hound.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Ms. Rees, I--
speaker_heading: MADELEINE REES
dialog: Madeleine. You've been stirring things
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've
dialog: overstepped protocol--
speaker_heading: MADELEINE REES
dialog: You have done in two months, what we've
dialog: been trying to do for years.
text: Madeleine sits. Kathy straightens.
speaker_heading: TWB 22.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
dialog: All due respect to Viko Mezovic, but you
dialog: just facilitated the first conviction for
dialog: domestic abuse in Bosnian history. I'm
dialog: bloody impressed. So is the Dutch Duty
dialog: Officer who recommended you.
text: Kathy takes it in. Madeleine looks out the window at TWO

speaker_heading: MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
dialog: The IPTF has a Gender Affairs Office at
dialog: Mission Headquarters. Dervla Hughes, the
dialog: current head, is leaving and I think
dialog: you're the right person to take over.
text: Kathy is taken aback.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
dialog: You'd be overseeing 12 regional offices.
dialog: Any gender reports come through you. This
dialog: involves anything from equality training
dialog: to domestic and child abuse cases,
dialog: fallout from war crimes against women,
dialog: prostitution. Women in Bosnia are treated
dialog: like second class citizens. You could
dialog: have a real impact on their lives. What
dialog: do you think? Are you interested?
dialog: This is everything Kathy came to do...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Absolutely.
scene_heading: 45 INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - NIGHT 45

speaker_heading: KATHY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I know hon, it's very exciting. If this

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TWB 23.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: No I didn't. I'll look right now.
text: Kathy goes over to a computer, clicking open an EMAIL. ON THE

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CARMEN

speaker_heading: KATHY
text: Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (smiling) I know. I don't even know if

speaker_heading: CARMEN

scene_heading: 49 EXT. UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS (UNMHQ) - SARAJEVO - MORNING 49

dialog: TWB 24.
scene_heading: 50 INT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - MORNING 50

speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: I'm glad to have an American in the mix.
dialog: You'll be reporting to me.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to
dialog: Madeleine Rees' Office.
speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: It's a joint office. She's Human Rights.
dialog: But you're Police Task Force. So you go
dialog: through me. But we all report to Bill
dialog: Hynes anyhow.
text: They walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum.
scene_heading: 51 INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - CONTINUOUS 51
text: Rick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes

speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: Yeah, your ah... predecessor's files...
dialog: We're waiting for Archives to get those
dialog: out of here. I'll put another call in.
text: Kathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks
text: of boxes, on papers and files strewn about.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's fine. Thanks for the tour.
speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck.
text: He leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality
text: of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's
text: raring to go. She eyes a name plate:
scene_heading: KATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS.
text: Kathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall.
text: THE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in
text: the flickering fluorescent light.

scene_heading: 52 EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT 52

speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I was wondering when you'd ask me out.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's not a date... No, seriously. It's
dialog: not. I know you had a lot to do with my
dialog: promotion, so I wanted to thank you.
text: He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A

scene_heading: 53 EXT. CAFE - OLD TOWN - LATER 53
text: Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a

speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Here's to not dating.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Listen to me. I'm not joking around.

text: The waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You are certain you have everything you

text: The waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: We're fine thank you.
text: The waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused.
speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You were saying I'm a nice guy--

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You must be in heaven over here.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: The war left behind a lot of widows.
speaker_heading: TWB 26.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You don't find that--
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys
dialog: don't. I don't know what else to say
dialog: about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a
dialog: nice guy but--
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I can't afford to mess this up.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: It's only dinner. How bad can it get?
speaker_heading: KATHY

scene_heading: 56 EXT. EIGHTH CANTON - AFTERNOON 56
text: Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the

text: up, their hands over their mouths, keening.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: This is the first time they've seen their
dialog: homes in years.
text: IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and

text: WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on
text: makeshift storm windows on her aparment.
text: Kathy watches, Barry by her side.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: They're all widows?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: That's why they were so frightened to

speaker_heading: TWB 27.
speaker_heading: BARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: They couldn't believe they'd be safe.
dialog: That what happened before wouldn't happen
dialog: again. Except now with nobody to protect
dialog: them.
text: Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their
text: past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands
text: numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her
text: face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Except us.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I always thought helping refugees get

speaker_heading: KATHY

scene_heading: 57 INT. IPTF FIELD OFFICE - AFTERNOON 57
text: The field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to...
text: A YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody

text: up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her
dialog: surroundings, and...
text: JUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR.
text: Kathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns

text: The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's okay, it's--
text: But the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks
text: around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an

text: then... SHE WAILS.
text: Losing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her,
text: trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs.
text: Hopelessness in her eyes. And then...
dialog: TWB 28.
text: She faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: (at field worker) Call a medic!
text: He rushes off. Kathy and Barry lay the girl down. She lies on
text: the ground, breathing slowly, looking close to death.
text: Kathy holds her hand.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: FIELD WORKER
dialog: I found her out in the woods. She was
dialog: speaking, I don't know, she's not local.
dialog: I think she's one of the girls from the
dialog: bars.
text: Looking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her
text: face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is...
dialog: Raya. A long way from home. But then...
text: THE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA,
text: 17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face
text: bruised. Kathy looks up...
scene_heading: HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER
text: She was further back in the woods.
text: Irka sees Raya. Sudden relief. Then realizing...
speaker_heading: IRKA (ENGLISH/RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: BARRY

speaker_heading: BARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll take them to the women's shelter at

speaker_heading: KATHY

scene_heading: 58 INT./ EXT. - UN SUV - DAY 58

scene_heading: 59 INT. UN SUV/EXT. FLORIDA BAR - DAY 59
text: Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees
text: THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a

text: Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards...
text: LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS.
text: A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They
text: blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost...
text: At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between

speaker_heading: TANJO (SERBIAN)

speaker_heading: LOCAL COP

speaker_heading: KATHY

text: He stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an

text: The Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls.
speaker_heading: WALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH)
dialog: Okay. I need a time and date.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: WALKIE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: That's impossible. We need advance notice
dialog: for field calls.
text: The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him,
text: but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward
text: them, protectively, then sees...
text: TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar.
text: TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them.
text: They seem surprised.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: Hey. Fred Murray.
text: He shakes her hand.
text: Tanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I
dialog: tried to get an interpreter but--
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much

speaker_heading: TWB 31.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had

dialog: Office, saying they escaped from this
dialog: place.
text: Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: Yeah. Local police have been watching the

dialog: happened pretty fast. I guess those girls
dialog: must've run for it.
text: Kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Well, the girls in our field office
dialog: seemed pretty scared. I should follow up
dialog: with these ones.
text: The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes,
text: getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: You can see where they're taking them,
dialog: but I can't intervene. You know the
dialog: drill.
text: He shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine
dialog: start. Turning to it...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Thanks. I'll look out for your report.
text: She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van
text: driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off.
text: Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.
scene_heading: 60 INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER 60
text: Kathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small

text: CUT WIRES hang over the stage.
speaker_heading: THE BAR AREA
text: Is filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men,

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: TWB 32.

text: Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER!
text: She turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of
text: electricity. Tiny sparks fly.
text: She turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A
text: handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And...
dialog: PASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls.
text: She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file.
text: Her eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled
text: door. And pushes. It opens onto...
text: STEPS: She shines her flashlight up the dark passage...
text: The BEAM of the flashlight finds a DOOR. A glint off metal...
text: At the door handle, a large PADLOCK, smashed open. Kathy
text: darts the beam over the other TWO DOORS... both equipped with
text: PADLOCKS. Smashed.
text: Kathy pushes through the first door into...
scene_heading: 61 INT. HIDDEN BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 61
text: Kathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room
text: into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor.
text: Her eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away.
text: And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each
text: name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20...
text: Some kind of RECORD.
text: Kathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS.
text: And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual
dialog: positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200...
text: The amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor.
text: Kathy looks around, sickened.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT 62
text: A run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside
dialog: the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you
dialog: might think it was abandoned.
speaker_heading: TWB 33.
scene_heading: 63 INT. HALLWAY - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - MOMENTS LATER 63
text: The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long-
text: forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy
text: linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that
text: Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s,
text: Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.
speaker_heading: MILENA (ACCENTED ENGLISH)
dialog: These girls are told they have been
dialog: bought and must repay the debt. They are
dialog: told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll
dialog: be let go when they earn back that money.
dialog: But they never are.
text: Kathy stares at her, taken aback.
speaker_heading: MILENA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sex trafficking is one of the worst
dialog: things to happen after this war.
text: Milena hands over a medical report.
speaker_heading: MILENA (CONT'D)
text: Raya has a severe internal infection. The
dialog: doctor found (reading) "intentionally
dialog: placed foreign objects causing a
dialog: disruption of the vaginal wall".
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Foreign objects?
speaker_heading: MILENA
dialog: Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel
text: deficient paying for sex, so they find
dialog: other ways to feel powerful.
text: Milena pushes through a door. To a DARK HALLWAY...
text: Hanging bulbs flicker intermittently. They walk. Avoiding
text: dripping leaks in the roof.
speaker_heading: MILENA (CONT'D)
dialog: We gave her Penicillin, but the doctor is
dialog: worried there could be something more
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: When will he know?
text: They pass an EATING AREA. TEEN GIRLS sit, pick at food, chain-
text: smoke and flip through magazines. They are clean, but weak.
speaker_heading: TWB 34.
speaker_heading: MILENA
dialog: Unfortunately that's all we can do for
dialog: her. We're just a volunteer organization.
text: Kathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But if there are so many victims.
speaker_heading: MILENA
dialog: We lost our funding because of those.
text: ...She points at a basket of CONDOMS near the coffee.
speaker_heading: MILENA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the U.S. Department of State. They
dialog: have their rules. I'll do anything to
dialog: give these girls some protection. But the
dialog: Department of State thinks "Condoms
dialog: encourage prostitution." NGOs caught
dialog: giving them out, no longer receive US
dialog: funding.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But these girls aren't prostitutes.
text: Milena shrugs.
speaker_heading: MILENA
dialog: They don't realize the cycle they start. If
dialog: there are no condoms in the bars...
text: They pass a ROOM DIVIDER. Seeing... MORE GIRLS. IN THEIR
text: TEENS. All broken. And desperate.
speaker_heading: MILENA (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the guys want to find ways of avoiding
dialog: STDs. AIDS. Their solution? Pay more for
dialog: virgins...
text: Kathy sees A GIRL sit in a corner. She couldn't be more than
text: TEN YEARS OLD. She sits alone.
speaker_heading: MILENA (CONT'D)
dialog: So the traffickers bring more in. Younger
dialog: and younger. Now it's a global industry.
dialog: Simple economics. If there is demand, you
dialog: supply.
text: Milena opens a DOOR, revealing... INSIDE THE ROOM: A
text: VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN
text: ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed...
speaker_heading: TWB 35.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Where can they get help?
speaker_heading: MILENA
dialog: Try the Global Displacement Agency. They
dialog: have good medical care, lots of funding.
dialog: They might take them. Whether they'll
dialog: keep them or not... I don't know.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Where are the other girls from the

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Your job is so exciting. The only thing I

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No. That's definitely it. There were six

text: Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait...
text: Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles.
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: We meet again!
text: Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Is it okay for me to be here?
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: Sure, sure. You're fine here on the
dialog: gravel. What's going on?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I just wanted to follow up with you on
dialog: the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't
dialog: show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to
dialog: locate them.
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a
dialog: mess. Turned out it was a local police
dialog: mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or
dialog: something. Thought they had a
dialog: prostitution bust, but the bar is legit
dialog: and those girls were just waitresses.
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: Waitresses aren't kept under lock and
dialog: key.
text: ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field.
speaker_heading: TWB 37.
speaker_heading: FRED MURRAY
dialog: Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to

speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: Well, it's yet to be determined if

speaker_heading: TWB 38.
speaker_heading: KATHY

scene_heading: 76 INT. FLORIDA BAR - CONTINUOUS 76
text: Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps
text: along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A
text: scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but
text: her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS
text: Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers.
text: Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off-
text: duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I know. If you let me finish, I got a
dialog: call. Some friends needed a lift home
dialog: because they got drunk. But hey lady, you
text: better wake up! EVERYWHERE is a brothel.
text: The coffee shop down the street. The post
dialog: office. My corner store. That's how it is
dialog: here. I'm not interested, and I try and
dialog: stay in clean places. And if you don't
dialog: believe me, then fuck you.

speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No... I'm not okay. These girls... What

speaker_heading: ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)

speaker_heading: HALYNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Does he still hit you?
text: Zenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt.
text: She wants so badly to say... but she can't.
speaker_heading: HALYNA (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I hate to ask. But she's my
dialog: daughter... and your niece. Please--
speaker_heading: ZENIA

speaker_heading: KATHY

dialog: I think IPTF were paid off to turn a

speaker_heading: RICK JONES

speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This means we can get you out of Bosnia.
dialog: Isn't that what you want?
text: Raya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never
dialog: thought this moment would come...
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll stay here for two weeks, to
dialog: continue medical treatment as well as
dialog: psychological counselling. We'll give you
dialog: a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to
dialog: get started when you return.
text: Suddenly Irka's face drops.
speaker_heading: IRKA (RUSSIAN)
dialog: But... What do I do then? My parents were
dialog: killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who
dialog: sold me here... Can't I go somewhere
dialog: else?
text: Laura fumbles.
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: We can only send you home, but what you

text: But now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn.
speaker_heading: RAYA (RUSSIAN)
dialog: What about the others, the girls in the
dialog: bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she
dialog: couldn't... I don't know where she is...
dialog: I can't go without her. Please...
text: Laura pauses, taken aback.
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you

scene_heading: 90 INT. GDA - AFTERNOON 90

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a

speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: Irka can stay. But I can't keep Raya
dialog: here. She is refusing to cooperate in the
dialog: repatriation program.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then
dialog: we can take it from there.
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: We only house fourteen girls. It's a

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Two weeks. If she's going to testify,

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: There is another option... I want to help

text: Kathy takes out the photo of Fred Murray and lays it on the

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: None of this is your fault. I want to go
dialog: after the people who hurt you. But I need
dialog: to know exactly what happens. As a

text: Raya stares, still not convinced.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: I...
text: The translator starts. Raya stops her. Frustrated. Turning to
dialog: Kathy...
speaker_heading: RAYA (BROKEN ENGLISH) (CONT'D)
dialog: UN will protect me? They don't protect me
dialog: when they drink in bar and fuck me and my

text: Kathy is humbled. She looks at Raya, open, raw...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I have a daughter, just your age... I
dialog: wouldn't stop until I found her.
text: The two women stare at each other. A silent connection. Raya
text: looks down, almost... ashamed. Struggling to get this out...
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: I only left because... there was nothing,
dialog: no jobs, no... chances. I was good in
dialog: school. But with no money... My mother...
text: She is on her own. She works so hard. But
dialog: nothing changes. I thought I could help
dialog: her. He said we would work in a hotel.
dialog: With good wages...
text: Tears gathering in her eyes... It's terrifying to remember...
speaker_heading: RAYA (CONT'D)
dialog: But... When we got there... Other girls
dialog: were there. Like us. From Ukraine,

speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: TWB 46.
speaker_heading: RAYA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody could hear us... They... rape
dialog: us... One girl go crazy, screaming... He

text: Raya is stopped by a rush of tears. Kathy reaches for her
dialog: hand. Looking at this girl, so young...
text: Raya looks Kathy squarely in the face. She slides the photo
text: of Murray toward her.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Do you know this man?
text: Raya nods.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: He is not the only one. They come every
dialog: month. Tanjo give them money, so they
dialog: don't raid the bar. That day you come...
dialog: Tanjo did not want to pay. They want to
dialog: punish him. Take his money. His girls. I
dialog: ran...
text: Raya sobs, knowing she has betrayed the system. Betting her

speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: How're things?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar.
dialog: It's worse than I thought. There was a
dialog: protection racket. IPTF... Americans,
dialog: Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make
dialog: sure the place wasn't busted. That raid
dialog: was a punishment bust, because the owner
dialog: stopped paying. But he must've settled it
dialog: because the girls are right back where
text: they started. Locked up in the hills.
text: Rick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: I talked to thirty five girls at the
dialog: Shelter. All this testimony can't be
dialog: ignored. Our guys are patronizing the
text: bars in large numbers. Rick, serious
dialog: abuses are taking place. It's all in my
dialog: reports.
text: Kathy lays her stack of files on the desk.
speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: Okay, let's back up a second here--
speaker_heading: TWB 49.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I've got two girls ready to testify about
dialog: IPTF taking pay-offs--
speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: Testify where?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: In court.
speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All
dialog: International Personnel have immunity.
text: Kathy is stopped.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know. But there must be some channel,
dialog: some exception--
speaker_heading: RICK JONES
dialog: Look, you've done really good work here.
dialog: These are serious allegations. Let me
dialog: look into how to handle it. I'll get back

scene_heading: 96 INT. KITCHEN - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96
text: Jan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: It's different for us. We're all military
dialog: or police. Every contingent except for
dialog: the U.S... if someone does something
dialog: wrong, they have to answer to a military
dialog: tribunal at home. With the Americans...
dialog: your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: So the Americans aren't legally
dialog: accountable for anything?
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: To be honest, I think our superiors would
dialog: keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen
dialog: a military tribunal.
speaker_heading: TWB 50.
text: Jan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the
text: vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied.
speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know my mission stay is up in a few
dialog: weeks... You could come home with me.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: To do what?
text: She turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: I was just... This place, y'know, it gets

dialog: to you a year from now.
text: She puts down her glass of wine, irritated.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You don't need to worry about me.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Someone does.
text: She looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: So Fred Murray could just walk up to a
dialog: man and shoot him in daylight and he'd
dialog: never see the inside of a courtroom?
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: In Bosnia, yes... but... I mean,

speaker_heading: TWB 51.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I wanted these girls to testify in a

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: The immunity problem.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Okay, but if the girls testify in a
dialog: Bosnian court against their trafficker...
dialog: Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else
text: goes on in the brothels.
text: Madeleine nods. The dog comes bounding back.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: It could work. If you make certain that
dialog: in their testimony they mention every
dialog: sordid detail of IPTF involvement--
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That is their testimony. Then it would be
dialog: on record. Somebody would have to pay

speaker_heading: VIKO

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?
text: Raya nods, trusting in Kathy. Who turns, angry, back to...
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: I was going to call you. There was a
dialog: problem. During our repatriation
dialog: procedures, we realized Irka had no
dialog: passport.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: So we get her one. Where is she?
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: You don't get it. She was trafficked from
dialog: Belgrade. Her parents were killed in
dialog: Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No
text: embassy will recognize her. She is a girl
dialog: without a country.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: She is a witness for a UN investigation!
text: GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity.
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: We handed her over to the police a few

dialog: already done every favour I could for
dialog: you. This is not on me.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You had no right to do that!
speaker_heading: LAURA LEVIN
dialog: I had every right. We have a system that

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: If you know anything, this is on you.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: I think the cops leave them somewhere

scene_heading: 120 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 120

text: Five girls. Huddled in the back.
speaker_heading: TANJO (RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: So you want to testify?

speaker_heading: TANJO (CONT'D)

dialog: Emotion taking over...
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: These girls are dragged into this country
dialog: like cattle and then the system that's

speaker_heading: JANET WELLS

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking.
dialog: Internationals got her in this situation.
dialog: We owe her the chance to get out.

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: We want to repatriate Irka to the United

speaker_heading: JANET WELLS
dialog: We're going to find her a home.

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I also think the American embassy should
dialog: be aware of some of the problems we're

text: Madeleine interjects...
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Your help with Irka's case can really
dialog: raise awareness in the Mission around the

speaker_heading: BOY (SERBIAN)

speaker_heading: IVAN (SERBIAN)
dialog: Not today.
text: The boy looks down, disappointed.
speaker_heading: IVAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: What is it?
text: Ivan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away.
scene_heading: 141 EXT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - BOSNIAN COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING 141
text: The brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the
text: back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE.
speaker_heading: TANJO (SERBIAN)
dialog: You couldn't buy him a new one? You have
dialog: money now.
speaker_heading: IVAN (SERBIAN)
dialog: I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I

speaker_heading: BASEMENT
text: TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door.
dialog: Ushering Ivan INSIDE where...
speaker_heading: TWB 65.
text: GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look
text: up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell.
text: We realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo
text: waves his fingers, methodically...
speaker_heading: TANJO (RUSSIAN)
dialog: C'mon, let's go.
text: The girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but
text: submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door.
speaker_heading: TANJO (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to show you what happens when YOU
dialog: DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!!
text: They jump back. His scream echoes. They move
text: THROUGH THE HALL
text: To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the
text: door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo
text: pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a
speaker_heading: BARREN ROOM
text: And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE
text: ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And
dialog: we see that...
text: Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT
text: CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
dialog: But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain.
text: Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A
text: flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and
text: drops... A PIPE onto the ground.
text: The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now
dialog: the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.

speaker_heading: MADELEINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ordinarily she would be repatriated to

text: an orphan, she finds herself without a
dialog: home. I'm pleased to announce that we
dialog: have found a foster family in the United
dialog: States. I want to thank Janet Wells for
dialog: her assistance in making this happen. I
dialog: believe this can stand as a signal that
dialog: the International community in Bosnia and
text: beyond is finally ready to recognize the
dialog: growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a
dialog: human rights abuse as abhorrent as the
dialog: war crimes that drew the International

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: MADELEINE

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: CARMEN

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You've seen what they're doing.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: I know. I know. I just, the stuff people

speaker_heading: MONITOR
dialog: Looking for you in Human Resources.
text: Carmen eyes Kathy, concerned. Kathy follows the monitor
text: toward the exit. MONITORS and CIVILIANS buzz about, talking.
text: But all around Kathy, the air is silent. Some IPTF OFFICERS
text: eye her, coolly. Is she paranoid?
scene_heading: 149 INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY 149

speaker_heading: BLAKELY

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: BLAKELY
dialog: Would you say you're under extreme

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: BLAKELY

speaker_heading: TWB 69.
speaker_heading: BLAKELY (CONT'D)
dialog: We'd like to suggest taking some time

text: Kathy eyes him coolly. He slides over a booklet.
speaker_heading: BLAKELY (CONT'D)
dialog: See here? You can consolidate your leave.
dialog: We'll contact our head offices in the
dialog: U.K. and ensure none of your pay would be
dialog: deducted... Just... Take a little
dialog: vacation. Go home. See your kids.
dialog: We're simply suggesting this out of
dialog: concern for you.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Are you suggesting I take time off. Or

speaker_heading: BLAKELY

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are these people? (stopping on a

text: She looks up at Jan. He shrugs, sympathetic, wanting to help.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course I want to see my kids, of

text: being sent home like some hysterical
dialog: woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)

text: Jan shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: It's not what. It's who. You know them.

speaker_heading: TWB 71.
text: MARA, 19, hands Raya and Luba a piece of paper with CRUDE

speaker_heading: MARA (RUSSIAN)
dialog: You work in two hours.

speaker_heading: JULIA (RUSSIAN)
dialog: You sleep on whichever mattresses are

speaker_heading: TANYA (RUSSIAN)

text: Raya grabs her head. Feeling faint. She looks for a place to

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Don't let him see you like this.
text: Luba walks over to the other side of the room. Finds a spot
text: and sits. Raya watches her, hurt. Julia pushes a mattress
text: aside. Underneath is a... COUNTING SYSTEM scratched into the
text: floor. Each girls' name scratched with numbers beside it.
speaker_heading: JULIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm the closest. Then I can go home.

speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
dialog: Rayisa...Raya Kochan.

speaker_heading: LUBA (RUSSIAN)
dialog: It's all bullshit--
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: No! He sent a girl back three months ago.
dialog: I was here! (to Luba) What is your name?

text: She grabs... ANOTHER: Unreliable Witness. And another...

text: A photo falls out of one of them: RAYA. Kathy stares at it.
text: Her eyes wander over the room, and fall on her predecessor's

speaker_heading: RICK (CONT'D)

text: careful... Kathryn Bolkovac is heading up
dialog: this investigation. If you have any
text: questions refer them to her.
text: ALL EYES ON KATHY. They disperse, passing her, camaraderie

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You've given every officer time to create
dialog: an alibi.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I'm not going to subject my men to this

text: Kathy can't believe what he's saying.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: They are SLAVES. By any American or

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: JAN

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: JAN

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: PETER WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Dyncorp's contract with the State

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I don't want a scandal. I just want--

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England--
speaker_heading: PETER WARD
dialog: Exactly. Nothing leads back to the State

speaker_heading: VIKO

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: TWB 88.
speaker_heading: BORDER COP

speaker_heading: VIKO

speaker_heading: BORDER COP
dialog: Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance.

speaker_heading: BORDER COP (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BORDER COP (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: BILL HYNES
dialog: Our resources are tight. I have to
dialog: prioritize--
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (holding the border logs) This is real
dialog: evidence. And that's just a drop in the

text: Bill shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES
dialog: If I could give you a piece of advice it
dialog: would be to think of the future.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: These girls--
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES
dialog: Are Collateral Damage. Whores of War.

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You know as well as I do, those girls
dialog: aren't a product of the war.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: TWB 90.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: They're a product of the peace. For the

text: Kathy is repulsed. Bill takes a seat.
speaker_heading: BILL HYNES
dialog: This is your first mission. You're eager.
dialog: But we work in a very grey area and that
dialog: can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to
dialog: take the gloves off but they don't want
dialog: us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking
dialog: Catch-22. So what do we do? We
dialog: prioritize. We do our best and we always
dialog: look at the bigger picture. You're a
dialog: mother. Fine. I see what you're doing
dialog: with these girls. Maybe that's why you're
dialog: thinking with your heart not your head.
dialog: But you have a chance at a career in the
dialog: international sector. Ride this out. Get
dialog: a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia,
dialog: Afghanistan... I don't give a shit. And
dialog: then, when you're running the show, you
dialog: can implement whatever changes you see
dialog: fit. But right now be smart and shut this
dialog: bullshit down!

speaker_heading: VIKO
dialog: We have a warrant to search this

dialog: custody for human trafficking.
text: The girls look at one another. Is this for real? The BARMAN

speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Kathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear...
text: Danik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You do not have to be afraid of Ivan

speaker_heading: TWB 92.

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Viko) Get those blankets out of the

dialog: punishment, all the pain...
text: Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced...
text: And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When...
text: Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears.
text: He stares at Raya. Petrifying her.
text: Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her

speaker_heading: TWB 93.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: You just have to tell me you want to go.

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: You can leave with me this second. All of

speaker_heading: KATHY
