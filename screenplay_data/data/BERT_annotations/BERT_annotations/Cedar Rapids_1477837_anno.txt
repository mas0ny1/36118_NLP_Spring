dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A SHODDILY PRODUCED TV COMMERCIAL
dialog: 
text: The ad depicts videotaped scenes from Wisconsin's north
text: country-- a farmer and a cow, a woman waterskiing, a guy
text: mowing his lawn. A flat, nasally V.O. accompanies the images.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE (V.O.)
dialog: The Brown River Valley: It's where
dialog: we work. It's where we play. It's
dialog: where we live. But even here in
dialog: paradise, accidents can happen.
dialog: 
text: The ad wipes to an inappropriately gruesome photo of an
text: obviously fatal car wreck. The NARRATOR is chroma-keyed over
text: the image. He is ROGER LEMKE, 40, blandly charismatic, with a
text: blonde moustache that evokes a low-rent Tom Selleck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D)
dialog: At Northlands Insurance, our goal is
dialog: to provide high quality insurance
dialog: services and related products to
dialog: businesses and individuals in
dialog: Wisconsin's Northlands. I'm Roger
dialog: Lemke. Not only do I care about you,
dialog: we also endeavor to give you the
dialog: coverage you need at the best prices
dialog: around. It's that reason Northlands
dialog: has been awarded the prestigious Two
dialog: Diamond Award from the American
dialog: Society of Mutual Insurers three
dialog: years running. Because at Northlands
dialog: Insurance, we insure your dreams.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The ad has been playing on a 13-inch TV in a small, wood-
text: paneled office. A handful of EMPLOYEES and FAMILY MEMBERS
text: applaud wildly. The proud owner of Northlands, BILL KROGSTAD,
text: 60, embraces the man of the hour, Roger Lemke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: Ho-lee Christmas, knocked her outta
dialog: the park, Roger! Out of the G-D
dialog: park, you sonofagun!

speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE
dialog: Hell, I'm just a pretty face, Bill.
dialog: That copy was all you. Do got one
dialog: little gripe though, boss-- if
dialog: you'd waited until after Cedar
dialog: Rapids we could've said winner of
dialog: the Two Diamonds four years
dialog: running!
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILL KROGSTAD ROGER LEMKE
dialog: Aroo-aroo! Two Diamonds! Two Diamonds!
dialog: 
text: The men roughhouse playfully. Roger's comely wife, GWEN, 30,
text: holding their milk-fed TWIN TODDLERS, gives Roger a kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GWEN LEMKE
dialog: So proud of you, Roggie. God, you
dialog: rock. Doesn't your dad rock, boys?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE
dialog: (an Elvis impersonation)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much!
dialog: 
text: More laughter and backslapping. After a bit, an as yet unseen
text: MAN hesitantly approaches. He gently touches Roger's arm, not
text: wanting to interrupt the revelry. Roger turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tim! Timmy Lippe! Didn't even know
dialog: you were here. You see it, bud?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (earnest, deeply admiring)
dialog: Oh, heck yeah. You were awesome.
dialog: 
dialog: Despite appearances to the contrary, this is our hero: TIM
text: LIPPE (pronounced Lippy), 34, wholesome and positive, though
text: undercurrents of desperation lurk just behind his kind eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Just super... super awesome. Man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE
dialog: Y'know what Tim, I want people to
dialog: see the insurance game for what it
dialog: really is-- it's a noble field. I
dialog: believe that. Like I say, we're not
dialog: just insuring vehicles and homes
dialog: and that. Hell no. We're insuring
dialog: people's dreams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Oh. Yeah. I say that, too...
dialog: sometimes.

speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE
dialog: Well shit, you do, don't you? By
dialog: god, I stole your line! Knew I'd
dialog: heard that somewhere!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Oh, no biggie...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER LEMKE
dialog: Bummer they cut your little deal
dialog: outta the ad, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ach. Y'know. Got left on the ol'...
dialog: 
text: A FEMALE CO-WORKER interrupts, accosts Roger and ignores Tim.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEMALE CO-WORKER
dialog: Roger! Look out Brad Pitt!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: The ol' cutting room floor, right?
dialog: (upon being ignored)
dialog: Brad Pitt. Ha. That's...
dialog: (then, with forced nonchalance)
dialog: Whoa. Cake. Cool.
dialog: 
text: Tim goes to the cake table. He smiles at the cake, impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: So awesome.
dialog: 
text: The icing on the cake, a frosted visage of Roger Lemke,
text: smiles back.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TIM'S CAR - DAY (LATE WINTER)
dialog: 
text: A beige Buick Skylark splashes through a puddle of snow melt
text: in the glum, isolated hamlet of Brown Valley, WI (pop: 337).
dialog: 
text: Tim bops his head and sings along as a Parliament song plays
text: on a Good Times, Great Oldies radio station. A dour OLD LADY
text: shoveling her driveway stares as he passes by.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TIM'S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Skylark pulls into the driveway of a tidy umber-colored
text: rambler with a nature scene painted on the garage door.
dialog: 4.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Flowered wallpaper. Vinyl flooring. A spoon collection. The
text: room looks like someone's grandmother designed it. Tim enters.
dialog: 
text: He opens the fridge, grabs an A &amp; W Root Beer. He opens a
text: cupboard, removes a box of Hostess Cupcakes. He sits at the
text: Formica kitchen table, meticulously eats the cupcake, sips the
text: soda pop and stares out the window at a bird feeder.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S BEDROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Tim's bedroom looks like that of a fastidious teenager. Twin
text: bed. Orderly desk. Milwaukee Brewers poster (circa 1987).
dialog: 
text: Tim removes his penny loafers, pleated khakis and Northlands
text: Insurance polo shirt. He puts on a different pair of pleated
text: khakis, a maroon turtleneck and some Top-siders.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S SECOND BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Tim enters another bedroom. This one has a four-poster bed--
text: clearly a parents room, clearly unused. He opens the closet.
dialog: 
text: A label reads GIFT CLOSET!!! Each shelf is neatly organized:
text: Toys, knickknacks, occasion-specific greeting cards. He
text: selects a Get Well card and a Beanie Baby duck, Quackers.
dialog: 
text: A doorbell RINGS. Tim hurriedly signs the card. He licks the
text: envelope as he hustles to the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Tim opens the door to MILLIE VANDERHEI, 54, a thick,
text: depressive woman dressed like a 7th grade science teacher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: There she is! How you feeling?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Oh, it's no big whoop.
dialog: 
text: Tim pulls the card and Beanie Baby duck from behind his back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ta-da.
dialog: (re. the stuffed duck)
dialog: Quack, quack. D'you already have
dialog: this guy? Wasn't sure.
dialog: 5.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Gayle Syrst√§d gave me a Quackers
dialog: for Secret Santa last year. I can
dialog: probably trade with Nan, though.
dialog: 
text: Millie sits on Tim's paisley sofa. She opens the card. On the
text: front: a Rottweiler in a nurse's outfit. Inside: "Get Well or
dialog: You Deal with Me!" Then in Tim's writing, "Love, Tim."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (chuckles at the card)
dialog: Cute. Brandy would never sit still
dialog: long enough for me to dress her up
dialog: like that. Tell you that right now.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: You didn't have to do this whole
dialog: rigmarole, Tim. I told you it's
text: just a little diarrhea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I know. But for you to miss a day
dialog: of school, Millie... I can't
dialog: remember you ever calling in sick
dialog: when I had you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Well I wasn't going through
dialog: menopause when you were in middle
dialog: school now was I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Negative. Not to my knowledge. Not
dialog: to my knowledge.
dialog: 
text: She nods somberly. They sit there silently for a bit. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: So. Does your tummy feel good
dialog: enough to...?
dialog: 
text: They exchange a look...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER
dialog: 
text: Millie rides Tim. Tim palms her breasts. He still has on the
text: maroon turtleneck. And one brown sock. Their bodies make a
text: sound like two soft, thick hands apathetically applauding:
text: Clap-pfft, clop-pfft, clap-ffft.
dialog: 
text: The twin bed squeaks disapprovingly.
dialog: 6.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I can try and... hold it, Mil. Can
dialog: you...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Bring it home. Bring it home.
dialog: 
text: She waggles her hips with a bit more gusto. He grimaces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm bringing it. Bringing it!
dialog: Bringing it! D'aaaarrgho'awesome...
dialog: 
text: Tim exhales. Millie exhales. That worked out well.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S REC ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Millie and Tim watch American Idol. A WOMAN sings Queen's
text: YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. Tim harmonizes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ooh, you make me live! You're my
dialog: best friend!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: C'mon Tim, I can't hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Sorry. But you are, babygirl.
speaker_heading: (SINGS)
dialog: You're my best friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Tss. Goofball.
dialog: 
text: The song ends. They sit quietly for a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Y'know Galen and Dar Krause just
dialog: did a cruise to the Bahamas? Pretty
dialog: reasonable they said, price-wise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (mediocre Jamaican accent)
dialog: Ya mon, Bahama-mama.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: It's a little different I suppose--
dialog: a cruise. But...
dialog: 
text: A beat, then Millie removes a cruise brochure from her purse.
dialog: 7.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I'm not gonna shilly-shally
dialog: around here, Tim. I found a river
dialog: cruise through Germany-- Viking
dialog: Line, real grade-A. It's what I
dialog: want. For the honeymoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY RATTLED)
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait...
dialog: Where's this coming from? We agreed
dialog: on Wisconsin Dells for the
dialog: honeymoon. It's what we agreed on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You've been to the Dells two dozen
dialog: times...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the
dialog: Dells every year...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Because they have children. Water
dialog: parks are for children...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky
dialog: and Stage Show? It's not just a
dialog: water park...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Timothy, settle. You've never even
dialog: left the state of Wisconsin. Barely
dialog: left Brown Valley...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What's so great about...? You're
dialog: not... You're missing the... We
dialog: agreed on the Dells.
dialog: 
text: He avoids eye contact. Millie takes Tim's chin in her hands,
text: forcing him to look at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: God rest her. Your mom was my best
dialog: friend. But it's going on 20 years
dialog: now. You gotta grow up. You gotta
dialog: let go. You gotta live a life here.
dialog: See?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm living a perfectly fine life. I
dialog: don't know why you'd want to...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 8.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: rock the waters or whatever.
dialog: Ridiculous.
dialog: 
text: Tim looks away again, pouting. Millie gives him a motherly
text: hug. Over her shoulder, Tim watches a TEENAGER belting out
text: QUE SERA, SERA on American Idol. Then, almost inaudibly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: We agreed on the Dells.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: 
text: IN BLACK, a phone RINGS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TIM'S BEDROOM - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tim sleeps alone in his twin bed. The phone rings again. Tim
text: wakes with a start. He flips on the lamp, picks up the phone:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hello... Oh, hey Bill...
dialog: 
text: A look of profound anguish appears on Tim's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No...
dialog: 
text: The sound of a church organ playing ON EAGLES WINGS fades in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ST. ANSGAR'S LUTHERAN CHURCH - DAY
dialog: 
text: In back of a packed church, Millie whispers with WADE BRODT,
text: 60, a bald, bullet-shaped man. The conversation is discreet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Guy had it all. Everything you'd
dialog: ever want. Y'know he flew a Cessna?
dialog: In his spare time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I always say people like that-- who
dialog: live fast? They die hard. Look at
dialog: River Phoenix.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Everything you'd ever want.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I just don't know. To do those
dialog: things to yourself. Just perverted.
speaker_heading: (SIGH)
dialog: Who ever heard of such a thing?
dialog: 9.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ROGER LEMKE'S CASKET
dialog: 
text: Roger Lemke looks peaceful in death, although it's hard to
text: miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt. Tim is at
text: the front of a long line of uneasy MOURNERS. Tim holds back
text: tears as he gently touches the marks on Lemke's neck.
dialog: 
text: Tim steps aside to greet the widow Gwen Lemke in a receiving
text: line. The grief has left her gaunt. She appears medicated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is--
dialog: was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He
dialog: just... he had it all. If there's...
dialog: 
text: He is interrupted by Bill Krogstad's sobs. Tim reaches out to
text: put a comforting hand on Gwen's shoulder, but somehow ends up
text: touching her breast instead. A moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm...
dialog: 
text: Tim nods sadly as he removes his hand. He walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The drab office is brightened with week-old funeral flowers
text: and flaccid mylar sympathy balloons.
dialog: 
text: Tim sits across from a young couple, KURT &amp; PAM GAMBSKY, 20s,
text: in a small, glassed-in conference room. The couple is tense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: You just don't get it, Kurt...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Aw Christ, Pammy...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hang on guys, how's this sound--
dialog: you can both be right.
dialog: (pause for effect)
dialog: I know you're probably thinking,
dialog: "Oh, an umbrella policy's only for
dialog: rich people." You know what I say
dialog: to that? Bull roar.
dialog: 
text: The Gambskys smile, comforted. Tim is good at his job.
dialog: 10.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Pam, Kurt-- I've known you guys
dialog: since you were little kids. So
dialog: let's don't think of me as an
dialog: "insurance salesman." Think of me
dialog: as your friend who just wants to
dialog: help you protect your dreams...
dialog: 
text: Tim glances up and sees Bill Krogstad staring longingly at
text: Northlands' three TWO DIAMOND Award plaques. A beat, then
text: Krogstad SLAMS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WOOD PANELED WALL! The
text: couple reels around upon hearing the sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm... Excuse me a sec...
dialog: 
text: Tim exits the conference room and approaches Krogstad, whose
text: hand is now bleeding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: D'you-- can I get you a napkin or
dialog: something, Bill? For that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: Know how Roger used to get down
dialog: there to Cedar Rapids? To the ASMI
dialog: Convention? Any idea?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Um. I'm with Kurt and Pam Gambsky...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
text: Flew himself. In a Cessna. Pilot.
dialog: (a mournful beat)
dialog: It was all worked out. I was going
dialog: to ease into retirement in July
dialog: while Roger transitioned into his
dialog: ownership role.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Wait, Roger was going to buy
dialog: Northlands?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: All worked out. Shit, Dione already
dialog: put the down payment on a time
dialog: share. Branson, Black Hills.
text: Florida. Units all over the place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Holy cow.
dialog: 11.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: Yeah, whole deal. Now? Now I got my
text: back up against Christ-knows-what.
dialog: No Lemke, no buyer, the wife's
dialog: spending like we won the goddamn
dialog: Powerball. And what's worse,
dialog: because of the way, y'know, the way
dialog: Roger passed...
dialog: 
text: Krogstad chokes up. His grief is very real. So is Tim's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: The... belt and the lederhosen...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: (a nod, a sigh)
dialog: Quote-unquote perverted, they're
dialog: saying. Like Northlands has some
dialog: kind of stain. Oh, I'm so goddamned
dialog: tired...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Is there...? Can I do anything to
dialog: help, or...?
dialog: 
text: Krogstad hands Tim a Manila folder (bloodying it in the
text: process). Tim gestures for his customers to hold tight. Tim
text: opens the folder, reading aloud from a cover page.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: "Innovations in Hog Farm Risk
dialog: Mitigation." Roger's Two Diamond
dialog: presentation for the ASMI
dialog: Convention. I helped prepare it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: We need those Two Diamonds more
dialog: than ever, Tim. If I'm going to
dialog: sell this company, we need people
dialog: to feel OK about the Northlands
dialog: brand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (not getting it)
dialog: Mm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: I'd go myself but my daughter
dialog: Kayla, the heavy one? She unearthed
dialog: some Polack to marry her. I'm
dialog: locked into that wedding over in
text: Gladstone. No flex. Locked in.
dialog: 12.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Whoa-whoa-wait. What are you saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: I'm not asking you to fill Roger
dialog: Lemke's shoes. Not gonna happen.
dialog: I'm asking you to deliver his
dialog: presentation-- to bring me home
dialog: those Two Diamonds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I can't go to ASMI. To Iowa. To
dialog: Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Why can't
dialog: Lila do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: C'mon Tim. Lila's about as
text: charismatic as a bag of hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Bill, I've never... I mean, I've
dialog: dabbled in hog farm risk
dialog: mitigation, but I'm no pro...
dialog: 
text: Tim is really starting to panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD
dialog: You were what, 16, when I gave you
dialog: that filing job? Right after your
dialog: mom passed? Raising yourself pretty
dialog: much, living all alone. And I'm
dialog: thinking, now here's a kid. Here's
dialog: a kid who's gonna go places.
text: (a hand on Tim's shoulder)
dialog: And then, somehow, you kind of just
dialog: didn't. Now, I guess it makes some
dialog: sense-- a child loses both parents
dialog: at an early age, becomes what you
dialog: might call stunted. But cripes
dialog: almighty, do you want to just sit
dialog: there in your folks old house, just
dialog: rot away in Brown Valley dating
dialog: that...
speaker_heading: (SUBTLY DISPARAGING)
dialog: ... woman the rest of your life?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Millie and I are getting married.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Point is, I'm not exactly dancing
dialog: in the streets here Tim, but it's a
dialog: perception thing. You go down there
dialog: to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie-
dialog: eyed and all that. You show them
dialog: that Northlands is a good outfit--
text: an upstanding Christian outfit...
dialog: 
text: Tim considers the gravity of this moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw cripes, say you'll do it.
dialog: 
text: Krogstad starts crying again. He hugs Tim, his bloody hand
text: staining Tim's canary yellow V-neck sweater. Tim looks up to
text: see the Gambskys in the conference room staring at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGE --
dialog: 
text: A melancholic yet uplifting song (Leonard Cohen's HALLELUJAH,
dialog: perhaps) plays as:
dialog: 
text: - Tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder. He looks at the
text: barren trees as he considers his fate.
dialog: 
dialog: - Tim Googles "Cedar Rapids." He looks at photos, crime
text: statistics, a Chamber of Commerce Youtube video. He closes
text: his eyes, exhales.
dialog: 
text: - Tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror. He
text: works late. He types. He Power Points. Krogstad critiques.
dialog: 
text: - Tim laminates maps of Cedar Rapids and area attractions.
dialog: 
text: - Tim pulls a dusty American Tourister suitcase from the
text: attic. It looks about 40 years old. He packs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TIM'S BUICK SKYLARK - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Tim looks pensive as he drives. He's wearing a new suit. It's
text: a little too big. A greeting card and a Beanie Baby Rooster
text: bounce along on the passenger's seat.
dialog: 
text: Tim pulls up to a SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE. A pick-up truck with the
text: words Brodt Heating &amp; Cooling is parked in the driveway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Tim pokes his head into a living room, surprised to see Wade,
text: the 60-ish bald guy from church, reclining on a Lazy Boy.
dialog: 14.
dialog: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Wade's boots are off. His socks are dirty. He's watching ESPN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh, hiya Tim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...?
dialog: 
text: Millie enters in a terry cloth robe. A Yorkshire Terrier
text: follows her. Millie acts nonchalant. So does the dog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Hi Tim.
dialog: (re. Wade's presence)
text: Wade's cable's down.

speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: Course this should be considered a

dialog: building. You can find your first
dialog: clue "under the sea." By which I

dialog: set, race!
dialog: 
text: As the teams take off for the pool, Dean enters. Tim pauses

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You're going down, a-hole.
dialog: 
text: Just then, Dean's partner, a MAN in an electric wheelchair,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Let's roll, Perry-- Perry-plegic.

speaker_heading: PERRY

speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Tim and Ronald shove past Mike Pyle, knocking him down. Tim

speaker_heading: TIM
speaker_heading: (READS MESSAGE)
dialog: "You've seen the future, now Czech

scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS --

dialog: 
text: - IN THE CAR: Joan reads through Tim's laminated booklet as

dialog: 
text: - IN A GYMNASIUM: Ronald awkwardly tries to make a basket,
text: becomes upset when he misses. Joan swishes a 3-pointer.
dialog: 
text: - AT A DAIRY FARM: The teams milk cows. Mike Pyle is
text: particularly proficient. Dean can't help himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Know what that cow's thinking,
dialog: Pyle? She's thinking, "quit pulling

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: That doesn't even... There's no
dialog: such thing as silo ice climbing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, it's actually a big thing in

dialog: it. I saw it on YouTube.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Of course you did. Well, you can do
dialog: it then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared

speaker_heading: JOAN

dialog: that...
dialog: 
text: Tim's nostrils flair. Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner
text: arrive. Tim looks to the top of the silo. It is dizzyingly
text: high. He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yeah. Let's do this thing.
dialog: 
text: Orin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music
text: (Whitesnake's HERE I GO AGAIN, perhaps).
dialog: 
text: QUICK CUTS: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their
text: climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons.
dialog: 
text: And they start climbing. Sort of. Tim jams his pick into the
text: ice. He tries to pull himself up, but can't. Mike fares
text: worse. He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on... How's it...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE PYLE
dialog: Little help here...
dialog: 
text: The Dudes shout instructions. Tim and Mike try again. To no

scene_heading: A LITTLE WHILE LATER --

dialog: All the contestants have shown up. But not a damn one of them

speaker_heading: RONALD

scene_heading: A LITTLE WHILE LATER --

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75

speaker_heading: (ANSWERS PHONE)
dialog: Hey, Millie.

speaker_heading: MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

speaker_heading: MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

text: swallowed a pencil eraser.
dialog: 
text: Something dawns on Tim-- who gives a shit. He glances at Joan

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
dialog: Lucky for us it came out naturally
dialog: or we'd have been looking at

speaker_heading: RONALD
dialog: Don't get me wrong, I have my

dialog: have to admit I'm a big enthusiast

scene_heading: A BIT LATER --
dialog: 
text: Tim has finished his sherry. The bartender pours a second

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Would you rather toss a bum's
dialog: salad, y'know, eat out his butthole
dialog: or... give your dad a B-J?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RONALD
dialog: Come on Ziegler, this is supposed
dialog: to be a clean game...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No, if you used some salad dressing

speaker_heading: KARAOKE DJ (O.S.)

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why wait for the church choir when

speaker_heading: TIM

dialog: 
text: Tim confers with the DJ. The DJ nods, cues up the song. Tim
text: gives Joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I, um, I've met some really, just
dialog: super neat people here. But this
dialog: song, I'd like to dedicate to the
dialog: first African-American person I've
dialog: ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at
dialog: the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander--
dialog: said hello and that. But... Anyway,
dialog: I just think you're one of the most
dialog: awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes!
dialog: 
text: Tim gives Ronald a thumbs-up. Ronald returns the gesture as
text: the opening bars of Clarence Carter's PATCHES kick in. [NOTE:
text: Patches is an EXTREMELY sentimental soul song about a poor
text: black kid named Patches.] The first verse is spoken word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: (reading off the screen)
dialog: I was born and raised down in
text: Alabama. On a farm way back up in
dialog: the woods. I was so ragged that
dialog: folks used to call me Patches. Papa
dialog: used to tease me about it. But deep
dialog: down inside he was hurt, 'cause
dialog: he'd done all he could.
dialog: 
dialog: Joan and Dean whoo-hoo!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: (breaks into song, very soulful)
dialog: My papa was a great old man. I can
text: see him with a shovel in his hands.
dialog: See education he never had; He did
dialog: wonders when the times got bad. The
dialog: little money from the crops he raised
dialog: barely paid the bills we made.
dialog: 
text: Joan and Dean rush to the dance floor. Ronald remains on his

dialog: 
text: Tim responds by giving Ronald a noogie. Everyone laughs.
dialog: 
text: - Joan, Dean and Ronald roam the Holidome halls. Tim jumps
text: out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at Dean.
text: Dean takes off running after Tim. Joan and Ronald follow.
dialog: 
text: - The song fades out as the four of them approach the Pool
text: Area. The sign on the pool door says, Hours 8 AM - 11 PM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: This is ridiculous, you guys. Told

speaker_heading: TIM
speaker_heading: (TO RONALD)

scene_heading: INT. HOLIDOME POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Whaddaya say, Lippe? Take a dippy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
speaker_heading: (GERMAN ACCENT)
dialog: Ich can nicht schwimmen. That's "I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: So we stay in the shallow end.
dialog: (starts removing clothes)
dialog: And neither did I.
dialog: 
text: Gulp. Now in her bra and thong, Joan jumps in. Dean bobs
text: around with the trash can on his head.
dialog: 
text: Tim slowly starts to undress. He carefully places his money
text: belt on a table. He gets down to his T-shirt and tightie-
text: whities. Far enough. He eases himself into the shallow end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yow. Chilly. Ha.
dialog: 
text: Joan back strokes over to Tim. He tries to look elsewhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: So.

speaker_heading: TIM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: You have tan. A tan. Tan line. You
dialog: have a.
dialog: 
text: Joan gets close to Tim. His arms remain at his side.

speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh jeez...
dialog: 
text: Tim gives in. They make out. In the deep end, Dean takes the
text: garbage can off his head and watches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hell yeah.
dialog: 
text: Joan pulls off Tim's T-shirt, flings it aside. They're really
text: going to town. OFF-SCREEN, we hear a sliding door open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE (Specifically, four floors up): From this POV, it
text: looks like Tim and Joan are having sex. Dean, meanwhile, has
text: moved closer and may or may not be masturbating as he watches
dialog: them. Reveal whose POV this is:
dialog: 
text: Orin has come out onto his balcony. He looks aghast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: What the heck's going on down
dialog: there?!
dialog: 
text: Tim looks up, makes fleeting eye contact with Orin. Shit! Tim
text: scrambles to get out of the pool. Joan is a half-step behind
text: him. Dean decides that now would be a good time to moon Orin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Suck my ass, Helgesson.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: I'm calling security!
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOAN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: They burst into Joan's room, laughing to the point of tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Holy crap! We're so dead!
dialog: 
text: Then Joan mauls Tim. She tackles him to her bed. He rolls on

speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to make love!

scene_heading: INT. JOAN'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Your body's just so... firm and
dialog: pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:

scene_heading: INT. JOAN'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
dialog:

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No baby, you guys are playing at
text: Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next
dialog: week...
speaker_heading: (LISTENS)
dialog: Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna

dialog: 
text: Tim wakes up. The morning light hurts his hung over eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Did you not look at the
dialog: schedule on the fridge? Did we not
dialog: have this conversation 10 minutes
dialog: before I left?
dialog: (listens, sighs)
dialog: No, no, no. The playoffs are in
dialog: Ralston. This is the last regular
text: season game. He actually has a
dialog: chance to play, Richie. Christ.
dialog: 
text: Tim staggers out of bed, smiles. Joan holds up a finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine, but watch your speed on 84th
dialog: by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's
dialog: gotten busted twice right there. By

speaker_heading: (LISTENS)
dialog: Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love
dialog: you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick

speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that...? Were you looking at my
dialog: Two Diamond presentation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Your cell phone kept ringing in
dialog: your little fanny pack thing, so I
dialog: shut it off. When I saw the discs,
dialog: I figured I'd take a look. It's a
dialog: solid presentation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yeah, I see that.
speaker_heading: (WISTFUL BEAT)
dialog: You know we were together right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What? Whaddaya...? You and... You
dialog: and Roger, you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: It's so stupid-- but everyone
dialog: basically treated us like the
dialog: Brangelina of ASMI for a while
dialog: there. It ended two years ago. He
dialog: was getting into some pretty weird
dialog: stuff... as we all know now.
dialog: 
text: Tim is livid. He ejects his disc from Joan's computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter.
dialog: You knew, didn't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: My foot I knew! No, I did not. And

dialog: You're not as good as Roger Lemke.
dialog: Here we go again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: As good? Tim, Roger was a small-
dialog: minded, egotistical jerk. You're an

dialog: 
text: This stops Tim in his tracks. Better than Roger Lemke. Wow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Why were you with him then?
dialog: 
text: This stops Joan in her tracks. Her inner pain percolates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why? I don't know. I don't know. I
dialog: guess I probably maybe don't like

speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yeah. Well, you're acting like a

dialog: 
text: He wraps up in a towel, grabs his money cummerbund and goes.
dialog: 
text: A moment. Joan looks at the rumpled bed sheets, starts making
text: the bed. As she does, she sees the Clairol Nice `N' Easy hair

speaker_heading: ORIN

speaker_heading: TIM

text: Tim hesitantly follows Orin to the desk. A laptop sits open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Four years ago, the brain trust at

dialog: line" for everything. Billing,
dialog: newsletter, the whole shebang. Now
dialog: I'm almost 70-years-old-- I's about
dialog: as likely to figure this deal out
dialog: as I was to learn Chinese. Well, as
dialog: you know Roger Lemke was a real

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You bet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: So Roger's up here looking over
dialog: this new system, and he gets one of
dialog: these lightbulb-going-off kinda
dialog: looks, the way he did. And he says,
dialog: "Orin, with that newsletter going
dialog: digital you're saving almost four
dialog: grand a year in printing costs
dialog: alone. Four grand. Pure profit."
dialog: You see where this is going, Tim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I can't say that I do...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: PayPal. That's where. What has ASMI
dialog: ever given Orin Helgesson? Huh? Not
dialog: dime one. Sure as shoot not an
dialog: opportunity to serve on the
dialog: National Board. Have I not been a
dialog: good President? Do I not deserve a

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I'm still not reading you here...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORIN
dialog: There aren't printing costs anymore,
dialog: see? The ASMI-teer's digital. E-
dialog: Commerce! Don't you get it, Tim? All
dialog: that money-- almost 39-hundred
dialog: dollars a year-- that goes into a
dialog: PayPal account now. My PayPal
dialog: account. But I've got no idea how to
dialog: use it.

speaker_heading: ORIN

dialog: prepared to do the same for you.
dialog: What do you say? You take home those
dialog: those Two Diamonds, Northlands'
dialog: value skyrockets, Bill Krogstad

dialog: wins...
dialog: 
text: We push in on Tim-- at the crossroads of all crossroads.
