speaker_heading: OPEN ON:
text: Dead grass. Burnt from four months of triple digit heat and
dialog: no rain.
text: We move past an endless sea of it.
text: Past PUMP JACKS drawing black gold from the dirt ...
text: Past a herd of cattle scratching breakfast from the blistered
text: earth -- two old bulls huddle in the shadow of a mesquite
text: tree, choosing shade over hunger.
text: We pass a graveyard of farm equipment and rusted propane
text: tanks, signaling the city limits of ARCHER CITY, TEXAS.
text: We look over the town -- it doesn’t take long.
text: Surrounding an old, stone courthouse are empty buildings with
text: broken windows. A cafe. A title company ...
text: And FIRST TEXAS BANK.
text: We stop in front.
text: We hear a car door open and shut.
text: ELSIE WALBERGER, 60, and heavy, curlers in her hair, waddles
text: past us to the entrance of the bank.
text: She unlocks the door. As she hefts it open --
text: CAMERA RUSHES TOWARD HER.
text: Elsie is pushed forward and falls to the floor of the bank
text: with a thud.
text: She moans, rolls to her side, and sees:
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- ARCHER CITY -- CONT.
text: TWO SILHOUETTES. MEN. Hard to say who for two reasons: the
text: morning sun through the glass door and the ski masks pulled
text: over their faces.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: What in the devil --
speaker_heading: ROBBER
dialog: (Offering her a hand) Stand up and
dialog: take us to the cash drawers.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: I will not.
text: The robber kneels below the glare and points a revolver at
text: her face.
speaker_heading: ROBBER 2
dialog: We ain’t askin’.
text: She scrambles to her feet and is escorted behind the counter.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: There’s no money in the drawers
dialog: yet. It’s in the safe and I ain’t
dialog: got the key.
speaker_heading: ROBBER
dialog: Prove it.
text: She opens the drawers. Sure enough, they’re empty.
speaker_heading: ROBBER (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Y'all are new at this I’m guessing.
speaker_heading: ROBBER 2
dialog: Where’s the money?
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: I told you, in the safe.
speaker_heading: ROBBER 2
dialog: Who’s got the key?
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Mister Clauson. He’1ll be here soon,
dialog: and I suggest you fellers don’t be.
dialog: All you're guilty of right now is
dialog: being stupid. Just leave and that’s
dialog: all it’ll be.
text: One of the robbers spins her to face him. Grabs her by the
text: throat. His cold eyes stare deep into hers.
speaker_heading: ROBBER 2
dialog: Call me stupid again.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Think you scare me? You stupid son
dialog: of a bitch.
dialog: Uh oh.
dialog: 3.
text: The thief’s partner steps up, puts a hand on the angry man’s
text: shoulder, easing him back, and steps between them.
speaker_heading: ROBBER
dialog: When does Mister Clauson get here?
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Eight-thirty every morning.
text: They look to the clock on the wall -- 8:29.
text: The other robber grabs her by the arm and drags her around to
text: the main foyer of the little bank. Points his pistol at her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: ROBBER 2
dialog: Sit.
text: She starts to move toward a small sofa.
speaker_heading: ROBBER 2 (CONT'D)
dialog: Where the hell are you going? Sit
text: on the floor.
text: She does. Right in the middle of the bank. She looks up at
text: them -- scared for the first time.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- DAY.
text: A ‘78 Buick in mint condition comes to a stop in front of the
text: bank. MR. CLAUSON, 50's, bit of a belly and barely any hair,
text: climbs out and looks up at the bank sign, digitally
text: displaying the time and temperature.
text: The time is 8:30am. The temperature is 98.
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Goodness, it’s gonna be a cooker.
text: He moves toward the entrance of the bank. Behind him we see
dialog: virtually no signs of life. It’s a miracle this bank is even
dialog: open.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- CONT.
text: Mr. Clauson steps through and sees:
text: Elsie sitting uncomfortably in the center of the lobby,
text: propping all her weight on one arm, like a broken chair.
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Elsie, you alright?
text: She shakes her head ‘no’ as a pistol is placed to Mr.
dialog: Clauson’s temple ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. 1988 CHEVY CAMARO -- DAY.
text: A burnt field, charred and smoking, whizzes by as the engine
text: whines. We see two men:
text: TOBY HANSON, late 30's, a kind face marked by years of sun
text: and disappointment, rides shotgun. It’s not the face of a
text: thief, it is the face of a farmer.
text: Behind the wheel is TANNER HANSON, 40, his brother’s opposite
text: in every way: mustache, shaggy hair, an air of danger that
text: attracts as many women as it repels.
text: He lights a smoke as Toby wipes sweat from his brow.
text: Tanner grins from ear to ear.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Just like the army. Doin’ more
dialog: before nine a.m. than most folks do
dialog: all goddam day.
text: Toby looks straight ahead. They ride in silence for a moment.
text: Then Tanner explodes --
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
text: WHOOOOOOOOOHOOCOOOHOOHOO! !!! !
text: He pounds the dash. Toby waits for the storm to pass. It
text: does. Silence again.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You need to go a little easier on
dialog: the tellers.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I go as easy on them as they go on
dialog: me.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Slow down.
text: He doesn’t.
text: In the distance, they see the throbbing lights of a SHERIFF'S
text: CRUISER headed toward them.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Slow down --
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I ain’t speeding.
text: The cruiser races toward them. Tanner drives without a care
text: in the world. Toby is frozen to his seat, eyes tracking the
text: car as it approaches.
text: The cruiser whips by. Toby looks in the side mirror, certain
text: the vehicle is going to turn around. It doesn’t.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: See, little brother? We ain’t got a
dialog: worry in the world.
text: Tanner takes a long pull from his cigarette, and looks out
text: over the black top.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Plannin’ this and doin’ it’s two
dialog: different things.
text: Tanner laughs. His demeanor is so relaxed, you'd think they
text: were taking a drive with no destination at all.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Shit, most people that do this
dialog: don’t think to plan at all. ... You
dialog: know, we're half way to Olney.
dialog: Might as well put ourselves a day
dialog: ahead.
text: Toby looks exhausted. But it’s true. Tanner looks at him and
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon. Early bird gets the worm.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Slow down.
text: He doesn’t.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY -- CONT.
text: The Camaro pulls away from us. We try to keep up, but it
text: disappears over a rise. We stare at broken yellow lines as
dialog: they race underneath us.
text: CAMERA RISES. We see the Camaro in the distance. It is the
text: only car on the road. In fact, it is the only sign of life in
text: any direction. Smoke rises from scorched fields in every
dialog: direction. From our vantage point, it seems the whole world
dialog: is on fire ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- OLNY BRANCH -- DAY.
dialog: This branch was built in the fifties and hasn’t had a remodel
text: since. There is one surveillance camera mounted above the
text: teller’s counter.
text: A MAN IN HIS 80'S is placing rolls of coins on the counter
text: before a chubby, young TELLER. There is a dolly loaded with
text: three cardboard boxes beside him. They are the only two
text: people in the bank.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I found three boxes in the barn.
dialog: Lord knows how long they been
dialog: sittin there. (The old man
dialog: chuckles) I been living on an
dialog: inmate’s diet and had all these
text: boxes just sitting under feed
dialog: sacks.
text: The teller smiles.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: How do you forget such a thing?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Old as I am, lucky I could find my
dialog: way here.
text: The teller examines a roll of pennies.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: This one says 1953.
text: She breaks open the roll.
speaker_heading: TELLER (CONT'D)
dialog: I wonder if any of these is
dialog: collector’s items. You could be
dialog: sitting on a fortune here.
text: We hear a JINGLE OF BELLS from the front door. In a flash, a
text: pistol is pointed at the old man and a blurred image leaps
text: over the counter.
text: TANNER, in ski mask, is now behind the teller, pistol to her
text: head. Toby appears beside the old man.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Open the drawer.
text: Her eyes go wide. She raises her hands to the sky.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Put yer hands down and open the
dialog: drawer.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Ones, fives, tens, and twenties. No
dialog: hundreds.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Don’t this figure. Good lord won't
dialog: even let me have it for a damn day.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (Looking over the boxes) We don’t
dialog: want your coins, old man.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: So you boys is robbing the bank?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Keep your hands on the counter.
text: The old man simply can’t wrap his head around what he’s
dialog: seeing.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: That's crazy ... Ya’ll ain’t even
dialog: Mexican.
text: She reaches for the ink pack.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No no no. Leave that where it is.
dialog: And none of them in bundles, just
dialog: the loose cash.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: You oughta be ashamed of yerself --
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Oh, I am. Make no mistake. But I’m
dialog: doing it anyway. Put your hands on
dialog: the counter where I can see em, old
dialog: man. Got a pistol on you?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Damn right I do.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (Looks hard at Toby)Keep up with
dialog: the circumstances, okay?
text: Toby shakes his head at the scolding
text: and frisks him, finds a
text: snub nose .38 and sets it on the counter, out of the old
dialog: man’s reach.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: You gonna steal my gun?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (Pointing his pistol)I got my own
dialog: gun --
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We ain’t stealing from you, we’re
text: stealing from the bank.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: It’s the same thing, son.
text: Tanner jumps the counter.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Like hell it is.
text: They turn and run. The old man grabs
text: shattering glass beside them as they
scene_heading: EXT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- OLNY, TEXAS
text: The brothers run around the building
text: and the waiting Camaro.
text: They tear off through the alley.
text: his pistol and fires,
text: exit the building.
dialog: -- CONT.
text: to the back of the bank
text: The old man struggles out the front door, pistol in hand,
text: looks down the street. Nothing. Looks the other way. Nothing
dialog: there either.
text: Just like the last town, it appears in every way to be
dialog: deserted.
scene_heading: INT. CAMARO -- RESIDENTIAL STREET -- OLNY, TEXAS -- DAY.
text: Masks removed, the brothers are drenched in sweat. They pass
text: house after house with dead lawns and no cars in the
dialog: driveway.
text: Some of the windows are broken, some boarded up. One thing is
dialog: certain, whoever lived in these little towns doesn’t live
dialog: here anymore.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Put the gun on the counter?? You
dialog: liked to get us killed!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I’m not stealing from some old man.
dialog: We stealing from one place. That’s
dialog: it.
text: But Tanner isn’t angry, he’s laughing.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You're turning out to be a poor
dialog: criminal.
text: Toby opens the trash bag, judging the take. This was a much
dialog: bigger haul.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: See what the early bird gets?
text: Through the windshield we see field after field of cotton,
text: drab and stunted from the heat. Olney is far behind us now.
text: A tinge of relief on Toby’s face -- this may actually work.
text: He leans his head back.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
text: (The gleam returns to Tanner’s
dialog: eyes) Wanna head over to the branch
dialog: in Jayton?
dialog: Relief gone.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: NO. (He looks at his brother) We
dialog: hit these banks first thing in the
text: morning. When they’re empty...
dialog: That’s the last time I care to be
dialog: shot at.
text: Toby runs his hand over his sweat-drenched face.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta be smart. We’re a ways from
dialog: being finished.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Hell, we could do this all week.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We’re gonna.
text: Tanner laughs.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Can’t nobody stop us ... We like
dialog: the Comanches, little brother.
dialog: Lords of the plains... Raiding
dialog: where we please, with the whole of
dialog: Texas huntin’ our shadow.
text: Field after empty field fly by Toby’s window. He stares out
text: over them.
text: Tanner lights a smoke, draws in a deep drag.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lords of the plains. That’s us ...
text: Toby looks in the direction of his greatest worry, who
text: exhales smoke and smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TEXAS RANGER’S OFFICE -- ABILENE, TEXAS -- DAY.
text: MARCUS HAMILTON, two weeks shy of 70, thick silver mustache,
text: sits at his desk. A large Texas flag tacked to the wall
text: behind him.
text: He looks over a LETTER from the DPS HEADQUARTERS in Austin.
text: The heading says it all: Mandatory Retirement Referendum.
text: The letter is worn at the edges -- Marcus has spent a fair
dialog: amount of time looking it over.
dialog: 11.
text: Marcus packs a can of Copenhagen with fifty year’s worth of
text: skill, and sticks a pinch inside his lip.
text: A younger Ranger, and by younger I mean 50, walks in. His
text: name is ALBERTO PARKER, and aside from his olive skin, he
text: looks almost identical to Marcus: thick mustache, beer belly,
text: gold star on a starched white shirt, bone colored Stetson
dialog: hat.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You hear about these bank
dialog: robberies?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Why you always dress like me?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: This is our uniform.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: We ain’t got no uniform. You can
dialog: wear any color shirt you choose.
dialog: You just keep choosing mine.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Texas Ranger regs say white, blue,
dialog: or tan dress shirt. Stands to
dialog: reason every so often we gonna end
text: up dressed the same.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, they say imitation is the
dialog: greatest form of flattery, Alberto.
dialog: Did you know that?
text: Alberto is half Comanche and half Latino, though his Texas
dialog: twang is as pronounced as any cowboy.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Wanna hear about these bank
dialog: robberies or just sit there and let
dialog: Alzheimer’s run its course?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Where at?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: First Texas in Archer City and
dialog: First Texas in Olney.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: FBI looking for an assist?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Ain’t theirs. First Texas ain’t got
dialog: branches outside the state. Not
dialog: interstate commerce.
text: A flicker of fire ignites in Marcus’s eyes.
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You may get to have some fun before
dialog: they send you to the rocking chair
dialog: yet.
text: Marcus’s chair squeaks as he leans back.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: +. I may have one hunt left in me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HANSON RANCH -- DAY.
text: The Camaro throws dust along the dirt road as it drives past
text: a rotting house, various outbuildings, and a collapsing barn.
text: A few skinny cattle try to eek out a meal from the dead
dialog: grass.
text: The Camaro drives past the barn, past a dried pond, and
dialog: stops.
text: Toby steps out of the Camaro. Climbs on a FRONT-END LOADER (a
text: bulldozer in layman’s terms). Tanner drives the Camaro into a
text: ten-foot deep ditch.
text: Beside the ditch are THIRTY PEACH TREES, their roots
text: protected by burlap sacks.
text: The bulldozer roars to life and begins pushing a large pile
text: of red dirt.
scene_heading: INT. BULLDOZER -- CONT.
text: We look down on the blade holding two tons of dirt. Watch as
text: it releases the load, pounding the roof of the Camaro.
text: We see Tanner carrying two duffels and the trash bags of
text: money toward the sheet metal barn.
text: Half-starved cattle watch with curiosity from the relative
text: shade of a mesquite tree.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. SHEET METAL BARN -- CONT.
text: Tanner pulls open the doors to the barn. Inside, we see THREE
text: VEHICLES. A Chevy Blazer, an old Ford Taurus, and a rusted
text: Ford pick up.
text: Tanner tosses the duffels on the hood of the Taurus. Walks
text: out of the barn carrying the bags of money.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH -- HANSON RANCH HOUSE -- A LITTLE LATER.
text: Tanner sits, guzzling a beer, an unopened Bud in his lap.
text: Toby walks up, Tanner tosses the beer to him.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I need you sober.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Who the hell gets drunk off beer?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You count it?
text: Tanner smiles.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Ain’t my money.
text: Toby begins stacking and counting the cash as he sips his
dialog: beer.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: We oughta go hit the branch in
dialog: Coleman before we change this
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We change the money first. Hit the
text: branch in Coleman in the morning.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: It don’t make no sense to drive to
dialog: Oklahoma, then drive all the way
text: back to Coleman, then all the way
dialog: back to Oklahoma when we could
dialog: change all the money tonight.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It don’t make sense to you.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That’s what I said.
dialog: 14.
text: But Toby offers no explanation.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddam that was fun ... Wasn’t it?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: No.
text: Tanner laughs out loud.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You lying bastard. I saw you. You
dialog: liked it ... looked like you were
text: sproutin’ a little wood fer that
dialog: teller in Olney too. That’s the
dialog: problem with these baggy jeans --
dialog: can’t hide a hard hog against yer
dialog: leg. Remind me to wear my wranglers
dialog: if we start robbin’ high schools.
text: Toby looks up.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: This ain’t supposed to be fun. And
dialog: we ain’t robbing anybody. We’re
dialog: robbing ‘em back.
text: Tanner drains his beer, cracks open another.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Call it what you want. It’s the
dialog: most fun I’ve had with clothes on.
dialog: I wouldn’t have missed this fer the
text: world and two hookers.
text: Toby looks at the stacks of money.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: Half way there.
text: Tanner holds out a beer. Toby looks into his smiling eyes.
text: Shakes his head and takes it anyway.
text: Tanner walks to the edge of the porch. Jumps off. Walks out
text: and turns back toward the house.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Boy this place looks like shit.
text: Tanner looks over the emaciated cattle in the field beside
dialog: him.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Ain't a decent steak between the
dialog: whole lot of those sorry sons of
dialog: bitches.
text: Toby watches his brother, senses the storm brewing. Knows
dialog: silence is the best weapon against it.
text: Tanner shakes his head at the crumbling house. For the first
text: time, he isn’t smiling. He jumps back on the porch and walks
dialog: inside.
text: Toby rubs his sunburned temples, sighs, then stands and
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. HANSON RANCH HOUSE -- CONT.
text: Toby comes through the front door. The furniture is at least
text: thirty years old. Boxes are stacked everywhere.
text: We see a SUIT laying across a chair at the dining room table.
text: On the table is a PAMPHLET from a funeral -- black and white
text: photo of an old woman on the front.
text: The color version of that photo hangs on the wall.
text: Beside the pamphlet is a FIRST TAXES BANK folder with
text: numerous loan papers sprawled around it.
text: Tanner steps out from the kitchen. Looks around.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You haven't done much cleaning.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Cleaned mama six times a day. That
dialog: was enough for me.
text: Tanner picks up the funeral pamphlet.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She died in the bedroom?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Tanner takes off down the hall. After a moment, Toby follows.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- CONT.
text: A HOSPICE BED, complete with rails, sits in the center of the
text: room, An IV stand by its side. The sheets and blankets are
text: crumpled and tossed back, as if someone just climbed out.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Better get this out of here before
dialog: your boys move in.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: It’s on the list.
text: Tanner sips his beer. Looks around the room. Stacks of
text: magazines. Countless prescription bottles on the dresser.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She was in this bed a while, huh?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Three months.
text: Tanner nods. Shuffles his feet. Guilt setting in.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I could've lent a hand if she'd
dialog: asked. Could’ve fed them skinny
dialog: cows at least.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Got nothing to feed ‘em.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Well, could’ve cleaned up this
dialog: house a bit.
text: Toby almost smiles.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Never thought of you as the go-to
dialog: guy for house cleaning.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No ... Just robbing banks.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Hey bud, your phone dials out, you
dialog: could have checked on us anytime.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She could’ve asked.
dialog: 17.
text: Tanner finishes his beer, crushes the can, and tosses it on
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck her. She never wanted nothing
dialog: to do with me anyway.
text: Tanner walks out of the room, brushing past Toby.
text: Toby looks at the beer can. He walks over, picks it up, and
text: puts it on the night stand.
scene_heading: EXT. RANCH HOUSE -- MOMENT LATER.
text: Toby steps onto the porch. Finds Tanner leaning against an
text: old corral fence.
text: Toby gives his brother some distance.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She leave a will?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Was I in it?
text: Silence. Tanner turns to his brother, who looks down at his
text: boots, then dead into Tanner’s eyes.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: No.
text: Tanner has to smile. Drinks from yet another beer. Toby steps
text: off the porch and walks up beside him.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: The will don’t matter. She left
dialog: everything to me, and by Friday, it
dialog: all goes to my boys ... She didn’t
dialog: mean nuthin’ by it. Mama’s been
dialog: gone for years. I just tended to
dialog: the body.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: She damn sure meant it. Mama was
dialog: like a dog that got kicked every
dialog: time it was fed.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: After a while she started to think
text: the beatin’ was part of the meal.
dialog: Hated me fer knowin’ the
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That’s not it.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It’s cuz you never understood that
dialog: fighting back just makes the
dialog: beating last longer.
text: Tanner laughs. So does Toby. A little.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Oh, I understood it.
text: Tanner leans into Toby, resting his hand on his brother's
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why I stopped fighting and
dialog: shot that son of a bitch.
text: They both lean on the fence, looking out over the parched
text: field filled with mesquites -- the only plant mean enough to
dialog: survive in this place.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -—- ARCHER CITY, TX -- DAY.
text: Marcus and PARKER pull up to as large a crowd as Archer City
text: can muster: a dozen people and another dozen Sheriff's
text: deputies stand under the awning of the bank, hiding from the
text: sun like bats.
text: They walk toward the ‘crowd’ as a truck pulling a horse
text: trailer slows. The window rolls down and we see a RANCHER,
text: 50, his face as weathered as it is unforgiving.
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: What’s gong on?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Somebody robbed the bank this
dialog: morning.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Ain’t seen no one unusual in town,
dialog: have you?
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: I don’t come to town except to buy
dialog: diesel and put my paycheck in that
dialog: sombitch right there ( points at
dialog: the bank), and you say someone
dialog: robbed it?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Looks that way.
text: The rancher shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: There was a time you could have
dialog: left that bank unlocked overnight
dialog: and no one steal a penny.
text: Marcus smiles.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I remember it. (Hands him a card)
dialog: You see anyone that looks a little
dialog: sideways, you give me a call.
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: Sideways don’t want to meet me.
text: Find itself on the wrong end of a
text: short rope.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, that would simplify things
dialog: for everyone but you.
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: Maybe. If you can find the tree.
text: The rancher pulls away. Marcus smiles.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: God, I love West Texas.
text: They walk to the bank as a DEPUTY approaches.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Weren’t much of a robbery. Got off
dialog: with just under seven thousand.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Took the drawer money. Twenty’s and
dialog: under. Only loose bills.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: So no ink pack.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Nope.
text: Marcus nods.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Smart.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That was smart, wasn’t it. Can we
dialog: get a look at the video?
text: The deputy’s eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Let me introduce you to the bank
dialog: manager.
text: Waves them over to a boiling Mr. Clauson.
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Why can’t we wait inside? It’s
dialog: gotta be --
text: He looks above them to the First Texas sign and thermometer.
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON (CONT’D)
dialog: My goodness gracious, it’s a
text: hundred and five and barely noon.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: It’s a crime scene, Mr. Clauson.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Can we get a look at the
dialog: surveillance video?
text: Mr. Clauson shrinks a little.
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Well, umm...
text: They all wait for him to continue. He doesn’t. Just looks at
text: them, sweating.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: No video.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: «+. No video?
text: Marcus looks up and points to the surveillance camera above
text: the front door.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Oh, we got cameras, but ...
text: They wait for him to finish the sentence. He doesn’t.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: VCR busted, is that it?
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: They been planning to switch us
text: over to a digital system that feeds
dialog: right into the computer, these new
dialog: cameras, they don’t hook to our
dialog: VCR's. Need some kind of USB port.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Mmhmm.
text: Turns to PARKER.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Call over to the Young County
dialog: Sheriff's, see if they just hit
text: teller drawers and stuck to small
dialog: bills, I’m sure they did, but --
dialog: and ask em if they thought to hook
dialog: their cameras to some sort of
text: recording device.
text: PARKER dials his cell. Marcus turns to Mr. Clauson.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: They armed?
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Yes sir. Pistols.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Faces was covered?
speaker_heading: MR. CLAUSON
dialog: Ski masks, long shirts, sweat
text: shirts and baggy pants, like them
dialog: thugs in Dallas.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: Tweakers maybe?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Little early in the morning for
dialog: tweakers --
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What the hell you talking about?
dialog: Tweakers don’t sleep at all. They
dialog: just ... Tweak. All day and all
dialog: night. And think of ways to tweak
text: some more -- like robbing banks.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: These boys ain’t tweakers. Tweakers
text: rob drug stores and parked cars,
dialog: not banks.
text: Marcus spots Elsie, sitting on the steps, sweating buckets.
text: He walks to her.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You the teller?
text: She looks up at him. Her face wearing the violation of the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: They pushed me to the ground. Gun
dialog: to my face. Made me sit on the
dialog: floor.
text: Her face curls at the thought.
speaker_heading: ELSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: On the damn floor.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I know their faces was covered but
dialog: could you tell their race?
text: She just looks at him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Black? White?
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Their skin or their souls?
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Let’s leave their souls out of it
dialog: for now.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: If it was two black men, they’d
dialog: have never made it IN the bank ...
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: So they appeared Caucasian is what
dialog: you're saying.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: (Nodding) From around here
dialog: somewhere is my guess. From their
dialog: voices.
text: PARKER walks up.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Young County says same deal.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: They got video?
text: PARKER shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Same deal all the way around.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Doesn’t Wal-Mart sell all sorts of
dialog: electronics? My word ... These boys
dialog: ain't done, I’1l tell you that
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: They're patient. Just hit the
dialog: drawers and don’t take the hundreds
dialog: cuz that’s the bank’s money -- you
dialog: can trace that. They’re trying to
dialog: raise a certain amount is my guess
dialog: and it’s gonna take a few banks to
dialog: get there at this rate. Besides ...
text: Marcus looks at Mr. Clauson, Elsie, and the little bank.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: This is just too damn easy.
dialog: 24.
text: Marcus looks back over the small crowd -- all simple, country
text: folk, milling about in a state of grave disbelief. It’s a
dialog: miracle people haven’t been robbing them non-stop for the
dialog: past century.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINER -- VERNON, TEXAS -- LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Toby and Tanner sit at a table scarfing chicken fried steak.
text: Through the window we see a WEST TEXAS STATE BANK branch.
text: They are no longer dressed in baggy, urban gangster wear, but
dialog: like the poor country boys they are.
text: Aside from a few old timers sipping coffee in a distant
text: booth, the diner is empty.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You're boys know how rich they’re
dialog: about to be?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: They don’t know anything.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You take ‘em to the funeral?
text: A beat as they chew their food.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Like I said. They don’t know
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You haven’t told ‘em their
dialog: grandmama died? (Toby just eats)
dialog: When’s the last time you saw ‘em?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: When we all went to the rodeo in
dialog: Stamford. Right after you got out.
text: Tanner stops chewing.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That was last year.
text: And that'll do it for Toby’s appetite. He sets his fork down.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I talk to ‘em on the phone. When
dialog: Debbie’s not around ... It’s like
dialog: time hooked a chain to ‘em, and
dialog: it’s just ... pulling them away.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Want a little advice?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Go see ‘em tomorrow. In case this
dialog: don’t work out, at least they’1l
dialog: have a chance to do something if we
dialog: get popped -- lord knows your
dialog: spider of an ex-wife won’t let this
dialog: go without a fight.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Got any idea how much I owe in
dialog: child support? Debbie sees me
dialog: walking up, she’ll have the sheriff
dialog: on the phone before I ring the
dialog: doorbell. When we’re done with
dialog: this, I’1l see ‘em every day.
text: Tanner laughs at his brother.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You got enough in your front pocket
dialog: to fix that problem.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We'd have to add one to the list.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: So add one.
text: Toby looks at his plate.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You talk like we ain’t gonna get
dialog: away with this.
text: Tanner leans into him.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I ain’t never met nobody who got
dialog: away with anything. Ever. Have you?
dialog: 26.
text: Tanner smiles. Wipes his mouth with his napkin and tosses it
text: on his plate.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: I gotta shit like an old goat. Grab
dialog: the check and meet me out front.
dialog: And Tanner’s off.
text: Toby swirls his almost empty tea, watching the few remaining
text: ice cubes travel around the bottom of the cup.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN (0.S.)
dialog: Boy, if that ain’t a hint, I don’t
dialog: know what is.
text: We look up at JENNY ANN, 29, a real looker when she was a
text: teenager. Now, too plump to be called pretty, but still cute
dialog: and proudly displaying the one benefit of gaining fifty
text: pounds. Her blouse can barely contain her breasts.
text: She takes his cup and fills it.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN (CONT’D)
dialog: You like your steak?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: (Looking over his plate) Got a ways
dialog: to go yet.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You'll be here all night waiting
dialog: for me to finish this.
text: She stands over him, smiling.
scene_heading: INT. WEST TEXAS STATE BANK -- CONT.
text: A young teller, this must be her summer job because she looks
text: sixteen, sits at her ‘window’ staring at a small black and
dialog: white TV.
speaker_heading: TANNER (0.S.)
dialog: Sure is quiet in here.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: Everyone’s at lunch, can I --
text: A ski mask stares back, pistol casually pointed at her.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Open that drawer and take out the
dialog: fives, tens, and twentys. Fan em
text: out in front of me like a deck of
dialog: cards.
text: She does as he says. Looks at him, almost hyperventilating.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your purse down there?
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: I don’t have any money.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Don’t want your money, darlin’.
text: He smiles a toothy grin through the mask.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want your driver’s license. Hand
text: it over.
text: She fumbles for her purse, retrieves it. Hands him the
dialog: license.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Depends. If you call the police --
text: Tanner looks over his shoulder to a glass office, a man
text: sitting behind the desk, facing away from us.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Or say anything to him, (He holds
dialog: up the license) I’m gonna drive to
dialog: your house and kill everyone I
dialog: find. Understand?
text: She frantically nods ‘yes’.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Good girl.
text: He smiles, his eyes lingering over her young body, watching
text: her breasts heave with every panicked breath.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re lucky I’m on a schedule.
text: He turns and walks out. The girl leans back on her stool,
text: gasping for air.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: INT. DINER -- CONT.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (He lies) Last job was for a
dialog: natural gas company.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: That sounds high dollar.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Nothing high dollar about drilling,
dialog: and ... No one’s drilling for gas
dialog: now anyway.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: Well, they’re sure drilling for
dialog: oil. Ain’t one drill the same as
dialog: the next?
text: He looks at her bright eyes and eager, almost flirty smile.
text: It makes him a little uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That's my take on it. Now I just
dialog: gotta convince someone else to
dialog: believe me.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: I believe you.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: .- Somebody hiring.
text: She tosses her considerable weight to one hip.
dialog: We
dialog: She sets the
dialog: it. The look
dialog: when another
dialog: through this
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: could use a cook.
text: check on the table. Her phone number written on
text: on her face is one of coy desperation. Who knows
text: handsome man even close to her age will wander
dialog: town again.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN (CONT'D)
dialog: Just a thought.
text: She stands there. He says nothing. Her coyness leaves her.
text: Only desperation remains. Finally, she walks off.
text: He looks at the bill: $18.49
dialog: 29.
text: He looks in her direction, pulls a wad of stolen money from
text: his pocket and counts out two hundred in twenties.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER -- VERNON, TEXAS -- CONTINUOUS.
text: Toby walks to the Taurus and looks up to see Tanner RUNNING
text: toward him.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Start the car.
text: Toby puts it together.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Shit.
text: He jumps in the car and fires it up. Tanner jumps
scene_heading: INT. TAURUS -- CONT.
text: Toby heads straight for the side streets.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: WHAT DID I TELL YOU!!! YOU’RE GONNA
text: GET US KILLED!!! THAT’S NOT A FIRST
dialog: TEXAS BRANCH ... I must be out of
dialog: my goddam mind to ask for your help
dialog: on this.
text: Tanner holds up a wad of cash.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Bet you don’t owe this much in
dialog: child support.
dialog: in.
text: He doesn’t. Toby collapses his head against the seat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You just put us a goddam day
dialog: behind.
text: Tanner lights a cigarette. Smiles.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You’re welcome.
scene_heading: INT. WEST TEXAS STATE BANK -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER.
text: The bank manager walks toward the teller, his head in a file.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: I need these copied in triplicate
dialog: before we lock up --
text: He looks up to see the terrified girl, mascara running down
text: her cheeks, shaking. He leans over the counter and sees the
text: open, almost empty drawer.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Did you hit the alarm?
text: She just shivers.
text: The manager leans his body over the counter and reaches his
text: hand underneath, hitting a white button. The teller screams
dialog: for all she’s worth and claws at his hands --
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: NOOOOO!!!!1!
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS’S LINCOLN -- LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Marcus’s cell phone rings. He hands it to PARKER.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Can’t answer your own phone?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I’m driving, all your doin’ is
dialog: twiddling your fat fingers.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Ranger Hamilton's phone (Listens,
text: then looks at Marcus) Turn around.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- CONT.
text: We watch as Marcus’s Lincoln whips around, heading back
dialog: north...
scene_heading: EXT. HANSON RANCH -- SUNSET.
text: We watch Toby plant peach trees in the red dirt that now
text: rests on the Taurus. Tanner sips a beer, standing under the
text: shade of a large mesquite.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That one looks crooked, Toby. Could
dialog: be a dead giveaway.
dialog: 31.
text: Tanner chuckles at his own joke. Toby marches toward the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Now we won’t make it to Lawton till
dialog: damn near midnight and we have to
dialog: stay over cuz we gotta get another
dialog: goddam car first thing tomorrow.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I‘ll still be drinking first thing
dialog: tomorrow. How bout third thing?
text: Toby storms off toward the house. Tanner empties his beer.
text: Tosses it on the ground, still laughing at his own joke as he
text: cracks open another. His smile disappears. With no one
text: watching, his bravado leaves him too. He no longer looks
dialog: dangerous. Just lonely ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS’S LINCOLN -- SUNSET.
text: Marcus and PARKER head north on a two lane black top.
text: Emptiness on either side of them.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Just over an hour between the first
dialog: two, then wait all day to hit the
dialog: bank in Vernon... Boy that’s bold,
text: driving all over in a car with
dialog: stolen money.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: It’s reckless is what it is.
dialog: Tweakers, I’m telling you.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I don’t think these boys is
dialog: reckless. Damn sure ain’t tweakers.
dialog: They know exactly what they’re
dialog: doing.
text: PARKER studies his partner.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How in the world are you gonna
dialog: survive without someone to out
dialog: smart? You need a hobby and quick
dialog: ... How bout a horse?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Beth was the rider. A horse would
dialog: just remind me of her.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You like to fish?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Not enough to do it every goddam
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: When I retire, I’m gonna move Esma
dialog: and me to Galveston, and buy a
dialog: fishing boat -- There’s these boats
dialog: got a bedroom, kitchen, bathroom,
text: everything. Like a floating
dialog: apartment. Live on that sombitch
text: right at the pier.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Guess you forgot about the
dialog: hurricane that washed away the pier
text: and the rest of Galveston with it.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: They're gonna rebuild it. I ain’t
dialog: retiring next week, you are.
text: The words stung more than either men expected. PARKER fumbles
text: idly with the seat belt while Marcus stares straight ahead.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Who knows, maybe one of these bank
dialog: robbers will want a gun fight, and
dialog: I'll dodge retirement in a blaze of
dialog: glory.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I seen you shoot. There won’t be
dialog: much glory in it.
text: Marcus laughs.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, I’m lucky I got a half breed
dialog: by my side to avenge me ... If you
dialog: can stay sober enough to do it,
dialog: knowing how you injuns like the
dialog: bottle.
text: PARKER laughs at the insult.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Oh, you'd avenge me, would you?
text: Marcus looks over at PARKER, dead serious.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I’d chase them all the way to hell
dialog: and kill ‘em on the devil’s
dialog: doorstep ... Take my damnation with
dialog: a smile, my friend.
text: We look out the windshield.
text: Black smoke blocks out the setting sun.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: What in the hell is that?
text: The road winds up a hill. They crest it and see:
text: CATTLE, HUNDREDS OF THEM, STANDING IN THE ROAD.
text: Marcus locks the brakes. The Lincoln slides and squeals to a
dialog: stop.
text: They sit in silence, surrounded by cattle.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Good Lord, Marcus.
text: COWBOYS on horseback race through the cattle, dismount, and
text: frantically cut the barbed wire on the fence along the far
text: side of the road.
text: Marcus leans out his window.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey, ya’ll burning this field?
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Why in the shit would we do that??
text: This kicked up along the highway.
dialog: Wind keeps turning, goddam if it
dialog: ain’t been chasing us for miles.
dialog: Whichever way we go, this damn fire
text: follows.
text: The cowboy is on his horse and riding up toward Marcus’s
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Wish we could do something for you.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: It'd be easier if I just stood here
dialog: and let it turn me to ashes. Put me
dialog: out of my misery ... It’s the 21’st
dialog: century and I’m racing a fire to
dialog: the river with three hundred
dialog: cattle. No wonder my kids don’t
dialog: wanna do this nonsense for a
dialog: living.
text: The sun has set. The cowboy whistles and three dogs spring
text: from nowhere, nipping at the heels of the cattle. One dog
text: jumps on the back of a cow, backlit by the dying sun. It’s
text: silhouette runs from the back of one to another and another,
text: terrifying the exhausted cattle into action.
text: The cattle moo and moan and move through the thirty-foot hole
text: in the fence.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Wanna call it in?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: It’ll burn out when it hits the
dialog: Brazos. No one to call around here
dialog: anyway. These boys is on their own.
text: The cattle pass, cowboys whooping and hollering behind them.
text: Marcus starts the car down the road, which is now covered in
dialog: cow shit.
text: Marcus crests the rise in the road and the fire comes into
text: view -- a vast expanse of smoldering black earth in its wake
text: ... Across the road, coyotes, one after the other, trot
text: across the road.
text: Up ahead a deer. Then another. And another. Seeking salvation
text: from the fire.
speaker_heading: PARKER
text: Looks like Noah’s Arc.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: If the Arc never showed.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Slow down.
text: Marcus looks at him cross-eyed.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You see that fire to the left of
dialog: us?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: There’s animals all over the damn
dialog: road and you’re --
text: The car jerks to a stop.
text: Standing in the middle of the road in the headlights is a
text: cougar. It looks at them like a man caught on the toilet.
text: Turns to run back toward the fire, then turns again and bolts
text: over the barbed wire fence, running off through the field.
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I never seen one of them before.
text: Marcus’s face is one of wonder -- as though all this chaos is
text: one last gift before the tedium of no purpose consumes him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Me neither.
text: Marcus opens his door and steps out onto the road. Fire moves
text: toward them through the field, crawling low to the ground,
text: like a snake.
text: As the dull orange of the setting sun disappears, the neon-
text: orange of the fire bleeds toward them like lava.
text: Two more deer trot across the road. Through the headlights,
text: an exodus of dozens of rabbits.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: This is the craziest thing I ever
dialog: seen.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What a day.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHEVY BLAZER -- NIGHT.
text: Tanner drives as Toby rides shotgun. Country music keeps them
text: company. The air between them is thick.
text: Tanner slows and turns onto a dirt road.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: What are you doing? We’re a day
text: behind as it is.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Casino ain't going nowhere. I need
dialog: a few things (Off Toby’s look). My
dialog: trailer’s right up here.
text: Toby stews as the Blazer bounces down the dirt road.
text: They turn onto an easement and come to a bump gate -- a
text: spring mounted gate one bumps with the grill of a car,
text: forcing the gate to open and very slowly close as a vehicle
text: passes through.
text: They hit it, it pops back and they pull through.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Whose land is this?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Jeremy Chalker’s. Let’s me keep it
dialog: here in exchange for killing
dialog: coyotes. And any poachers who
dialog: should wander this way.
text: Tanner winks at him. They bounce past mesquites and junipers
text: and come to a tattered trailer. It is missing a rear wheel --
text: the axle propped level with stacked wood.
text: It is faded and filthy. A portable generator sits beside it
text: as do propane tanks and gas cans.
text: The Blazer stops. Tanner hops out.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on in.
text: Tanner disappears into the trailer.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER -- CONT.
text: Toby steps into the ‘living area’. It is absolutely filthy.
text: Clothes, fast food bags, empty beer cans everywhere.
text: Toby almost holds his nose as he looks around.
speaker_heading: TANNER (0.S.)
text: There’s cold beer in the fridge.
text: Toby goes to the fridge and grabs one. Anything to beat the
text: stifling heat, made worse by standing in this tin box.
dialog: 37.
text: Toby notices a shelf that runs just beneath the ceiling. On
text: it are framed photos of them as boys, as teenagers, as young
dialog: men. They are the only things that are not broken or in
text: disarray.
text: He moves closer. Looks at them. One in particular: Tanner and
text: Toby on the front porch of the ranch house with their mother -—
text: - her cold, unforgiving gaze, tempered by Toby's
text: expressionless face, and Tanner -- all smiles.
text: Toby looks at it, his face now washed with regret.
speaker_heading: TANNER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: She looks meaner’n hell in that
dialog: one, don’t she?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Don’t look happy.
text: Tanner grins his devil grin.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: That's cuz I was standing next to
dialog: her. Grab this for me, will you?
text: He hands a duffel bag to Toby. The weight of it jerks Toby’s
text: arm down.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Toss it in the truck, I'll be right
dialog: out.
text: Toby exits and Tanner opens a small closet door, grabs an AR
text: 15 assault rifle, and a scoped 30-06 ...
scene_heading: EXT. TANNER’S TRAILER -- CONT.
text: Toby tosses the bag in the back. Unzips it: ammo cans.
text: Tanner walks out of the trailer carrying two rifle cases.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We don’t need those.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: They're my livelihood. Can’t just
dialog: leave ‘em in the trailer for days
dialog: on end.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Who’s gonna find ‘em out here?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No one now.
text: Tanner places them in the back then climbs in the driver's
text: seat. Toby turns and looks at the trailer --
dialog: This is how his brother lives. All he has to show for forty-
text: two years of life. Toby shakes his head, all anger gone. Pity
text: in its place.
text: He climbs in the Blazer, looks at his brother.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: It’s the kindest we’ve heard Toby speak.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION -- HIGHWAY -- LATER.
text: Tanner rests his feet on the dash while Toby pumps gas. Tank
text: filled, Toby hangs up the pump.

text: Winston lights and a Dr. Pepper.
text: Toby walks off. A NEW DODGE CHALLENGER, Painted to look
text: vaguely like the Dukes of Hazard vehicle, pulls up in all its
text: soulless pretension.
text: Behind the wheel is the post-modern version of white trash,
text: in his 20’s: head shaved, MMA tank top, and a mountain of
dialog: attitude.
dialog: How this dickhead afforded this car in the first place is a
dialog: mystery.
text: Tanner looks over at him. The young punk stares back.
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: What?
text: Tanner smirks. Looks away.
speaker_heading: PUNK (CONT'D)
dialog: What old man?
dialog: 39.
text: Tanner looks back at the steroid assisted build of this
text: asshole, and his skinny buddy riding shotgun.
speaker_heading: PUNK (CONT'D)
dialog: You looking for trouble, you came
dialog: to the right place, mother fucker.
text: Tanner turns lazily toward him, locks eyes.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Boy, you'd think there was ten of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: Oh yeah?
text: The punk flashes a pistol.
speaker_heading: PUNK (CONT'D)
dialog: Not so fucking tough now, are you?
text: The punk is stepping out when the car door is SLAMMED back
text: into him. The gun falls to the ground.
text: Toby grabs the punk by his ears and pulls him halfway out the
text: window, then proceeds to pound his face with elbow after
dialog: elbow. He does it with a speed and violence we did not expect
dialog: of him.
text: Tanner watches with a combination of amusement and affection.
text: Toby steps over to the passenger door while the punk hangs
text: unconscious from the driver's window.
text: When Toby throws open the passenger door, he is met with
text: raised hands and a look of terror.
speaker_heading: SKINNY PUNK
dialog: He had it coming! He had it coming!
text: Toby slams the door and walks toward the Blazer. Tanner leans
text: back, feet still on the dash.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Look at you, got a little spunk
dialog: left in you yet.
text: Toby bends over and picks up the pistol.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: And even remembered the gun. You’re

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: This asshole could have killed you.

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Not the way it would've gone,
dialog: little brother.

text: broken nose bleeding profusely.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Ten of me. I told you.

speaker_heading: VERNON PD
dialog: There’s an officer with your mama

speaker_heading: VERNON PD (CONT'D)
text: She's a little shook up. Perp took

speaker_heading: NATALIE

speaker_heading: NATALIE

speaker_heading: MARCUS

text: Walks up to him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You the bank manager?
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Yessir, I am.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Didn't happen to have your

speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Of course.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: So you got the robbery on video.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Of course we do. What kind of bank
dialog: would we be if we didn’t have video
dialog: surveillance?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: First Texas Bank. (Turns to PARKER
dialog: and winks) We have video. Care to
dialog: give it a watch while I wander over

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Would you order me something while

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Evening.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Howdy.
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: She's in the back. I’1l go get her.

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Ya'll been here for a while?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Long enough to watch someone rob

dialog: thirty years.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You say you saw them?
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
text: Saw the guy running from the bank.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What’d he look like?
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Had a mask on. But he ran pretty
dialog: good, so I'd gather he’s youngish.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That so ... What’s youngish in your
dialog: book?
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Younger’n you and me, but older
dialog: than all these little girls running
dialog: around here pouring tea. Pretty
dialog: sure they was sitting right over
text: there, having lunch.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That a fact. Can you describe them
dialog: any better than youngish?
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Tall, both of ‘em. Lean, like
dialog: cowboys. Looked like brothers if
dialog: you ask me. One had a mustache and
text: scruff, other one was clean shaved.
text: Scruffy one looked like trouble.
dialog: Other one just looked like a old
dialog: country boy.
text: Jenny Ann walks up to him. Looks at his badge.

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: JENNY ANN

speaker_heading: JENNY ANN

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: That a crime now?
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: How much.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: Two hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Can I see the bills they paid with?
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: Not a chance in hell.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That’s evidence.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN
dialog: It’s evidence if they’re the bank
dialog: robbers. Till then it’s my tip.
text: Her eyes grow fierce.
speaker_heading: JENNY ANN (CONT’D)
dialog: And half my mortgage. So you go get
dialog: a warrant and come after the money
dialog: I'll be using to keep a roof over

text: She turns and shakes her big ass back to the kitchen. The old
dialog: men laugh.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: She's a tiger, that one.
text: PARKER comes through the door.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Just one man hit the bank, like she
text: said. Checkered button down shirt.
dialog: Jeans. Ski mask. That’s about all
dialog: the video tells us.
text: Marcus looks over at the old timer.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Yep. Checkered shirt. That’s him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: (Pointing to the table by the

dialog: dollars.
text: Marcus smiles as he looks toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Go wrestle a description from the

dialog: check them bills.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: (To PARKER) Good luck.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yeah, I’d expect some resistance

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We're stayin’ the night?
text: Marcus smiles.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: This is where all the action is.
text: PARKER shakes his head and moves toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER

dialog: robbing banks and living to spend
dialog: the money’s long gone, ain’t they?
dialog: ... Long gone for sure.
dialog: 46.

speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That’s one way of putting it.

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: BIG MAN

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Enemies with who?
speaker_heading: BIG MAN

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: BIG MAN

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No.
text: Tanner leans across the table, inches from the BIG MAN’s

speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: It makes me a Comanche.

text: staring back. He rises and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. COMANCHE RED RIVER CASINO -- BAR -- NIGHT.
text: The hooker sits next to Toby now, pressing her bare leg
text: against him. He isn’t used to women this attractive who are
text: this aggressive. He teeters between wariness and fascination.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: How old is he?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Fourteen.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Does he look like you?
speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: HOOKER

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Look, I’m, thank you, but ... I’m
dialog: not here for me.
dialog: As foolish as it sounds, he says it anyway:
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m trying to do something noble
dialog: for once, and --

speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: There’s no shame in needing the

text: She puts a hand to his cheek.
speaker_heading: HOOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You need it, I know you do. How
dialog: long has it been? (She is inches
dialog: from his mouth) Let me touch you --
text: Something jerks her away. Toby looks up to find: Tanner has
text: her by the arm.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Tryin’ to work my little brother,
dialog: are you?
text: As an astute judge of character, she knows instantly what
text: kind of man she is now dealing with, and acts accordingly:
dialog: which is to say submissive and scared to death.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: I wasn’t doing anything but --
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: But but but. You spied that stack

dialog: don’t get me wrong, no one likes a

speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Hey, come on --
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: No, I --

text: hooker’s arm.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Where is he? Where’s the man that
dialog: holds your leash?
text: No one in the bar fits the bill. The bartender watches them
text: while pretending he isn’t.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe we'll just sample the goods
dialog: real quick.
text: Tanner peals off a couple of hundreds from his wad, works his

text: Toby stands up. Grabs Tanner’s arm and pulls it back.
speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Heart burn. I'll be fine.

dialog: the mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. BEST WESTERN -- VERNON, TEXAS -- NIGHT.
text: Marcus, dressed in his undershirt, jeans, and boots, steps
text: outside and walks toward the field behind the motel. He looks
text: out over the mesquites and cactus.
text: The warm air helps. Or maybe its just the walk. He looks up
text: at the sky -- clouds and ten thousand stars carpet the night.
text: An owl hoots. Flies over him. He watches the dark image move
text: silently over him.
text: Marcus walks toward a barbed wire fence, rests against it.
text: The warm air blows against him, pushing him like a tattered
text: sail. Marcus looks to the stars as he leans into the wind and
text: tries to laugh off his suffering.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: This is the thanks I get? Rotting

text: Toby climbs into his bed and rolls away from Tanner and the

text: she kisses him deeply.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I’m expecting a lot from you.
text: Tanner presses into her and she moans.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: What do you call that?

scene_heading: EXT. COMANCHE RED RIVER CASINO -- NIGHT.
text: Toby walks through the parking lot, past semi’s and motor

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Just when I was staring to feel

speaker_heading: MARCUS

scene_heading: EXT. USED CAR LOT -- LAWTON, OKLAHOMA -- DAWN.

speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: This little town fits their bill,

speaker_heading: TANNER

text: He looks at Tanner.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How long we known each other?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Since ... I don’t know. Always.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: --. It’s the insult of it. That
dialog: ranch is worth a half million
dialog: without the oil, but they loaned
dialog: the least they could get away with,
dialog: just enough to keep your mama poor,
dialog: on a guaranteed return. Thought
dialog: they could swipe that land from you
dialog: boys and suck on that oil for
dialog: twenty five thousand dollars. It’s
dialog: just so arrogant it makes my teeth
dialog: hurt ... To watch you pay those
dialog: bastards with their own money ...
dialog: (He laughs at the thought) If that
dialog: ain’t Texan I don’t know what is.
text: Toby stands and offers his hand.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: They can foreclose on Friday. Come
dialog: hell or high water you be at the

dialog: Thursday. And knowing them fuckers,

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We'll be there.

text: a Texas Porch that runs the length of the block.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: All these little towns. Dying. What
dialog: do you think’1l happen to ‘em?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: This is your plan? Just sit here
dialog: and see if this is the branch they
dialog: rob next ...
text: Marcus looks over at him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Not much of a thinker, are you?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Do you want to live here? Old
dialog: hardware store that charges twice
dialog: what Home Depot does? One

dialog: waitress? How are you supposed to
dialog: make a living here?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: People made a living here for a

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: People lived in caves for a hundred
dialog: thousand years, but don’t do it no
dialog: more, and they’re the better for
dialog: it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Maybe your people did.
text: Marcus smiles.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You're people did too. Long time
dialog: ago, your ancestors was the Indians
dialog: and someone else came along and
dialog: killed ‘em or broke ‘em down and
dialog: made you into one of them. A
dialog: hundred and fifty years ago, all
dialog: this was MY ancestors’ land.
dialog: Everything you can see.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything you saw yesterday. This

dialog: took it. Now it’s being taken from
dialog: them. Except it ain’t no army doing
text: it. (PARKER points at the bank)
dialog: It’s that son of a bitch, right
dialog: there.
text: Marcus studies his partner.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: And here I am thinking you was slow

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I may be. But that don’t make it
dialog: any less true.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: These boys should've hit this
dialog: branch by now.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Then why are we still sitting here?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Just cuz ... I like this little
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I know what you’re doing. You’re
dialog: tryin’ to make this last as long as
dialog: you can. Cuz the longer it lasts
dialog: the farther you are from your front
dialog: porch ... That ain’t fair --
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: To who? The bank? Only thing we can
dialog: do is wait for these boys to make a
dialog: mistake, and so far they ain’t. So
dialog: relax. Enjoy this little town. From

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TOBY

speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TANNER

speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wake me up at five.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yep.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. T BONES CAFE -- COLEMAN, TEXAS -- NIGHT.
text: The crickets are chirping so loud, it echoes off the old,
text: stone building. It doesn’t appear Marcus has moved in hours,
text: still staring out over the square. Across the way, PARKER is
text: carrying his suitcase into a motel.
text: Marcus takes out his can of Copenhagen, packs it, and places
text: a pinch in his cheek. Ready for a long night of reflection.
scene_heading: INT. HANSON RANCH HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT.
text: The wall clock says ten after five in the morning. Toby sits,
text: dressed like a gang banger, pistol and three magazines for it
text: on the table. He sips coffee as Tanner walks in dressed the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: I’ll never understand how those
dialog: gang bangers can walk around with
text: their pants like this, dangling off
dialog: their asses. No wonder they always
dialog: get caught when they run from the
dialog: police.
text: Toby slides him a cup of coffee. Tanner sits. They drink
text: their coffee in silence.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Want some breakfast?
text: Tanner thinks that one over.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Yeah. Breakfast sounds good.
text: Toby stands and heads to the fridge. Pulls out bacon and a
text: carton of eggs. Crosses over to the stove. Tanner watches his
text: brother as he cooks.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you do this for mama?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Every morning. She didn’t eat much

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Did you used to cook breakfast for

text: Toby stops.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah ... Been a long time, though.

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: You do the bacon first, then the

speaker_heading: TOBY

text: Marcus, asleep on the bench, chin to his chest.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: For someone who don’t want to spend

dialog: 83.
text: Marcus stirs. Looks up at PARKER who hands him coffee ina

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Restaurant don’t open for another

scene_heading: EXT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- JAYTON, TEXAS -- DAY.
text: Toby and Tanner stand in front of the bank, ski masks on.
text: They don’t move. Just stare straight ahead.
text: We look over their shoulder and see why:
text: The Jayton Branch is closed. Doors wrapped in chain and
text: locked. Windows covered with large plywood boards.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: We gotta hit the branch in Post.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We won’t get there till after ten.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: We don’t got a choice. Gotta have
dialog: that money to the branch in
dialog: Childress before they close
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Toby shakes his head as he pulls off his mask.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We don’t know Post. Don’t know the
dialog: patterns of the folks out there.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Pattern’s the same as it is
dialog: everywhere. All these towns is
dialog: dead. Post ain’t no different.
dialog: Let's go.
text: They turn and walk out of frame, leaving us to stare at the
text: closed bank in a closed town.
scene_heading: INT. T BONE’S CAFE -- DAY.
text: Marcus and PARKER sit sipping coffee, looking over a map of
dialog: Texas.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: First two banks were First Texas
dialog: branches. There’s seven total: main
dialog: branch in Fort Worth, and they
dialog: ain’t messing with that. The branch
dialog: in Olney they hit, the one in
dialog: Archer City they hit, the one here,
dialog: the one in Childress, Jayton --
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That one’s closed.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Okay. That leaves the branch in
dialog: Post. Childress is a decent sized
dialog: town, I don’t think they’11 mess
dialog: with that.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: The branch in Vernon wasn’t First
dialog: Texas and they hit that.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: One of ‘em did. Alone. And then ran
text: all the way across the square to
dialog: get back to the car. I think his
dialog: partner had no idea that was gonna
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What does that mean to us?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: It means the only other First Texas
dialog: branch that fits the bill is in
dialog: Post.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: There’s plenty of little banks in
dialog: other towns --
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: And they’d have robbed ‘em by now
dialog: if they was interested in other
dialog: banks, but they ain’t. They’re
dialog: after First Texas’s money and
dialog: that’s the only place they can get
dialog: it that makes any sense.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: It’s three hours away. If you wanna
dialog: head that way we should get on the
dialog: road.
text: They both stand, Marcus tossing a twenty on the table.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Let’s get some troopers moving in
dialog: that direction ... I’m feelin’
dialog: lucky.
text: They move off toward the door, pushing it open, and flooding
text: the restaurant with the blinding Texas sun.
scene_heading: EXT. STATE HIGHWAY 308 -- DAY.
text: The Blazer and Grand Am drive through the ragged land below
text: the CAP ROCK: a geological marvel where the great plains
text: plummet four hundred feet along a fault line, creating a
text: cliff that dissects West Texas.
text: On one side of the road is an endless wall of red dirt. On
dialog: the other: land so broken it looks as though God stabbed it
text: repeatedly with two giant shovels, punishing it for some
dialog: unknown offense.
text: The cars breeze by us, the Cap Rock wall towering beside
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 308 -- OUTSIDE POST, TEXAS -- DAY.
text: Both vehicles pull off the road. Toby gets out of the Blazer
text: and jogs to the Grand Am. He gets in. The Pontiac pulls back
text: on the road, past a sign that reads:
scene_heading: POST - 3 MILES.
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- POST, TEXAS -- DAY.
text: There are actual signs of life here. A few cars in front of
text: the grocery store. Pick up trucks in front of the diner. Cars
text: and trucks at the gas station.
text: The FIRST TEXAS BANK sign looms in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND AM -- CONT.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: This town looks busy.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Little bit. Look at the bank
text: though. Not a car in front of it.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We do this quick.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Gotta take the hundreds this time.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Make sure they fan ‘em out in front
dialog: of you. If an ink pack gets in the
dialog: bag, that money’s useless.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Yep.
text: They park in front of the bank. No other cars around. We
text: watch from a distance as they get out and hurry inside,
text: pulling on their masks.
text: We DOLLY down a side street, now looking at the bank’s red
text: wall. We CONTINUE until we are looking at First Texas Bank’s
text: parking lot. Which is full.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- POST, TEXAS -- CONT.
text: We stare at Toby and Tanner who stand frozen. We see what
dialog: they see --
text: Two dozen people staring at them. Frozen as well.
text: No one moves. No one knows what to do. Then it all happens in
text: a blur.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!!!
scene_heading: EVERYBODY.
dialog: 87.
text: Tanner raises his pistol, pointing it frantically at
dialog: everyone.
text: All the people hit the deck. Toby is cemented to the place
text: where he stands.
text: Tanner jumps the counter, pressing his gun hard to the face
dialog: of the teller.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Open the drawers! Every teller open
dialog: their drawer and take three steps
dialog: back.
text: Tanner spots his brother not moving.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: HEY!!!!
text: Toby snaps to, and covers the customers who are sitting and
text: laying on the bank floor.
text: Tanner begins grabbing the money himself from the teller
dialog: drawers.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: All of ya’1ll on your fucking knees.
speaker_heading: NOW.
text: All the tellers drop to their knees.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: A girl, in her twenties, laying on the floor, discreetly
text: sending a text on her phone. It reads:
text: THEY R ROBBING THE BANK
text: Tanner is frantically scraping money from the drawers, one
text: after the other, when an old SECURITY GUARD comes around the
text: corner, his pistol raised. He cocks the hammer --
text: Tanner spins and fires round after round into him. He falls
text: back as everyone screams.
text: Another man stands and pulls a pistol from his boot, fires at
text: Toby and misses.
text: Toby turns and fires while he ducks. They aren’t thirty feet
text: from each other, but the twisting and ducking is sending
text: bullets into the wall, the ceiling, everywhere but their
dialog: intended target.
dialog: 88.
text: Tanner takes aim and places a round in the side of the man’s
text: head, dropping him to a heap on the floor, like a jacket
text: falling from a coat rack.
text: Tanner leaps over counter.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go!
scene_heading: EXT. FIRST TEXAS BANK -- POST, TEXAS -- CONT.
text: Toby and Tanner push through the doors and are met by a hail
text: of gunfire.
text: The windows behind them shatter as they fire back and duck
text: behind the Grand Am, which is taking a beating.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I DIDN'T SEE ANY POLICE!
speaker_heading: TANNER
text: IT AIN'T. IT’S THE WHOLE FUCKING
text: TOWN SHOOTIN’ AT US!
text: Sure enough, across the road, hidden behind pickups, are
text: locals with deer rifles, shotguns, whatever was in the gun
text: rack when they heard shooting inside the bank. Tanner unlocks
text: the passenger door, lays against the seat, and sticks the key
text: in the ignition. Cranks it to life. Folds the seat forward.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in.
text: Toby dives in as the windows of the Pontiac shatter. Tanner
text: lays on the passenger seat, slams the car in reverse and uses
text: his hand to press the gas pedal to the floor, his feet still
text: hanging out the open door.
text: The car races backwards as gunfire pulverizes the vehicle.
text: When the Pontiac is at a somewhat safer distance, we see feet
text: disappear, the passenger door close, and the Grand Am is spun
text: angrily around and slammed into drive, hauling ass down the
dialog: street.
text: Locals climb in their trucks to give chase.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND AM -- CONT.
text: Toby is panicking. Can't catch his breath. He’s
text: hyperventilating. Tanner is as calm as he was at the poker
dialog: table.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Man, those concealed carry permits
dialog: sure complicate a bank robbery,
dialog: don’t they?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: What are we gonna do??
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Hey. We ain’t out of this, and I
dialog: need you focused. Believe me when I
dialog: say: this is where the rubber meets
dialog: the road, little brother.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: How are we gonna get away from
dialog: this? You killed two people. At
dialog: least.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: And let me tell you something, we
dialog: ain't through with that yet. You
dialog: want to be anything but a black
dialog: mark on your sons then I need you
dialog: mountain lion mean, you understand
dialog: me?
text: Tanner looks in the rearview mirror and sees a half dozen
text: pick ups and sedans coming up behind him.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on.
text: Tanner slams on the brakes. The Grand Am’s tires smoke and
text: scream as the car comes to a stop in the middle of the road.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAND AM -- HWY 308 -- CONT.
text: Tanner walks to the trunk, unlocks it, takes out the AR 15,
text: and walks down the center of the highway toward the oncoming
dialog: vehicles.
text: He raises the rifle to his shoulder and sprays the vehicles
text: with thirty bullets in less than a second.
text: All the vehicles slam to a stop as bullets pound into their
text: windshields, their hoods, their grills.
text: The vehicles are instantly in reverse and beating a hasty
text: retreat as Tanner drops the empty magazine, slams home
text: another, and peppers the fleeing vehicles again.
text: He turns and gets back in the Pontiac.
text: The door closes and the Pontiac speeds away.
scene_heading: EXT. HWY 308 -- DAY.
text: The Pontiac pulls along side the Blazer. Toby opens
text: and gets out.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Needless to say, don’t take the
text: highway back through Post. Head
dialog: south. South, then west, got it?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We're done.
text: Tanner looks over at him.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: No we're not. Get to the Casino and
dialog: change the money. Head north
dialog: through New Mexico to the
dialog: interstate. You take 287 back to
dialog: Childress. Like we planned. Like
dialog: you planned. This was your plan,
dialog: and it’s worked every step of the
dialog: way. Trust it.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Where are you headed?
text: Tanner just smiles.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t be stupid. You get the fuck
dialog: out of here too.
dialog: 90.
dialog: the door
text: Toby heads to the Blazer, unlocks the door, crams the money
text: under the seat, takes off his baggy jeans and baggy jacket,
text: revealing wranglers and a sweat drenched t shirt.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Hand those to me.
text: He hands the baggy clothes to his brother. Tanner tosses them
text: in the back seat. Toby climbs in the Blazer.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Call me when you make it back to
dialog: the ranch.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Hey ... I love you ... I mean that,
dialog: Toby.
dialog: 91.

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I love you too.

scene_heading: INT. GRAND AM -- DAY.
text: Tanner smokes a cigarette, A soulless country-rock song

speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Can’t nobody write a country song

text: In the distance, three TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
text: vehicles, lights flashing, are moving toward him.
text: Far to the left, a dirt road that winds up a shrub oak

text: canyons and arroyos.

scene_heading: YIPPEE HIYIYO, GET A LONG YOU

text: As the cruisers approach, so does the dirt road. Tanner yanks
text: the wheel, cutting in front of the cruisers, busting through
text: a barbed wire fence and spewing a rooster tail of dust as he
text: drives up the hill.
text: The police cruisers give chase. In the distance, two more are
text: coming, headed by Marcus’s unmarked Crown Victoria.
text: Tanner reaches the top of the hill, turns the car to face the
text: cruisers who are beginning to wind up the dirt road to him.
dialog: 92.
text: He pops the trunk, pulls out a satchel of rifle magazines,
text: his deer rifle, and a five gallon gas tank.
text: He unscrews the top, crams the ski mask in the opening, and
text: light it on fire.
text: He places it in the passenger seat of the Pontiac and puts
text: the car in gear.
text: The Pontiac begins moving toward the cruisers headed up the
text: road, it picks up speed, on a certain collision course with
text: them. The cruisers stop, and begin backing down the hill.
text: The Pontiac is catching up, and it is now that Tanner opens
dialog: fire.
text: He pounds the cruisers with gunfire. The Pontiac is ten feet
text: from them when the gas can explodes. The red fireball of
text: metal slams into the retreating vehicles, knocking two of
text: them into the arroyo that runs alongside the road.
text: Tanner nods at his achievement, grabs his rifles, and
text: crouches down, disappearing into the brush.
text: Marcus's vehicle pulls up with the two cruisers. They get out
text: and take in the chaos playing out above them.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: My word. We need a S.W.A.T. unit up
dialog: here and a chopper to pen this boy
dialog: down.
text: PARKER dials his cell.
text: Marcus looks up the hill. His eyes are alive. At last: a real
dialog: fight.
text: Troopers are running, zigzagging down the hill, motioning
text: with their hands for everyone to get down. Over the burning
text: vehicles one trooper yells.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: He’s got a rifle! Get down!
text: We hear the crack of Tanner’s deer rifle in the distance.
text: Marcus ducks behind a cruiser.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: This old boy’s out of his mind. Why
dialog: don’t you slip up this canyon and
dialog: tomahawk that son of a bitch.
dialog: 93.
text: Marcus turns back to PARKER, who is laid out on the pavement,
text: a bullet hole under his left eye. Marcus moves quickly to
text: him, pulling him behind their vehicle.
text: When he does he sees that the entire back of PARKER’s head is
text: gone. He lets go of his arm and sits there, looking over his
text: friend, all the excitement of the chase now gone.
text: Marcus hears trucks approaching, he turns and sees:
text: Townspeople approaching. Marcus runs toward the oncoming
text: vehicles, when they slow to a stop he hides behind the
text: passenger side of the truck in front.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Back these trucks up behind that
dialog: hill, he’s got a rifle up there.
speaker_heading: LOCAL
dialog: We know it, those bastards shot up
dialog: half the town.
text: Marcus takes in the irate cowboy and the deer rifle beside
text: him. The man puts his truck in reverse, Marcus walking beside
text: the truck as he backs up.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: How well do you know the land
dialog: around here?
speaker_heading: LOCAL
text: Like the back of my hand.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
text: He’s hid up under an old oak in the

speaker_heading: LOCAL
dialog: Give me half an hour, and I'1l have

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Can’t let you do it. Get me there.
speaker_heading: LOCAL
dialog: It’s gonna be a five hundred yard

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Get me there. I’1l do the rest.

speaker_heading: DEPUTY 2
dialog: Got yer license on you?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY 2
dialog: Let me see it.
text: Toby hands it over and the deputy calls it in. Toby sits for
text: what seems like an eternity, trying to act bored or innocent
dialog: or anything but what he is.
text: The deputy walks back to the Blazer and hands him the
dialog: license.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY 2 (CONT’D)
dialog: Have a good day.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yep. You too.
text: Toby puts it in drive and pulls past them.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK TREE -- DAY.
text: Tanner looks through his scope, with just the odd cowboy hat
text: peering out from behind vehicles. Tanner looks bored.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: This ain’t much of a gun fight.
text: Tanner considers pulling the trigger when one Trooper races
text: through the open from one vehicle to another.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Gonna have to come after me at some
dialog: point.
text: In the distance he sees more police vehicles approaching and
text: what looks to be a S.W.A.T. van.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now we're talking.
text: Tanner reaches for a cigarette.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I got time for one more.
text: He places a cigarette in his mouth. Flicks his lighter.
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE LINE -- CONT.
dialog: 96.
text: We watch the lone tree THROUGH A RIFLE SCOPE and hear the
text: labored breathing of a man far too old to crest hills like
dialog: the one he just climbed.
speaker_heading: LOCAL (0.S.)
dialog: You're pretty winded, you oughta
dialog: let me take the shot. Hell, it’s my
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (0.S.)
dialog: No.
text: We see them now, on the edge of a ridge almost half a mile
text: from the tree.
text: Marcus lays on his belly looking through the rifle scope, the
text: local beside him, looking through binoculars.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT’D)
dialog: He’s mine.
speaker_heading: LOCAL
dialog: I don’t see him yet.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Me neither. He’ll show himself soon
dialog: enough.
text: They sit, watching. A small plume of cigarette smoke rises
text: near a bush. They both hone in on it.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: I got him.
speaker_heading: LOCAL
dialog: Me too.
text: We look through the scope. We see the back of Tanner’s head.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (0.S.)
dialog: I got you ... (To the local) How
dialog: low is this rifle gonna shoot at
dialog: this distance?
speaker_heading: LOCAL (0.S.)
text: She's dead on at three hundred.
text: Hold ten inches above him and
dialog: you'll split his skull.
text: The scope’s cross hairs move above Tanner’s head ...
speaker_heading: MARCUS (0.S.)
dialog: Look at you. Sitting right on the
text: devil’s doorstep.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: Tanner draws on his smoke, relishing it. Looking down on the
text: scampering police below him.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Won't be long now.
text: Tanner nods with satisfaction.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lord of the plains.
text: He takes a drag.
speaker_heading: TANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s me.
text: He exhales. A strange feeling comes over him. He senses
dialog: something ...
text: WE LOOK THROUGH THE SCOPE.
text: We see Tanner turn his face toward us -- cross hairs just
text: above his head -- looking right into the lens.
text: The trigger is pulled. We hear the rifle roar. See the muzzle
text: flash through the scope. Tanner's face drops to the dirt.
dialog: Lifeless.

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: How many nights ... Sir?
speaker_heading: TOBY

text: on the TV.
text: A TV reporter stands in the city square of Post, a flurry of
text: activity behind her.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: ... When the townspeople of Post
text: confronted the robbers, a shoot out
dialog: reminiscent of the old west broke
text: out right here, in the city square.
text: The locals chased the robbers out
dialog: of town, but not before three of
dialog: their own were killed inside the
dialog: bank and on these city streets. And
text: like a story from a dime store
dialog: novel, both members of the Texas
dialog: Highway Patrol and locals chased
text: the robbers to a hillside twenty
dialog: miles east of town where the
text: gunfight continued. Three highway
dialog: patrolmen were injured, two
dialog: critically, and one Texas Ranger

dialog: Hamilton killed one of the gunman
text: with a rifle he borrowed from a
dialog: resident of this rugged little
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: What information do we have on the
dialog: bank robber that was killed?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: His name is Tanner Joseph Hanson,
dialog: from Hamlin, Texas. He was
dialog: convicted of an armed robbery back
dialog: in 1997, and served twelve years of
dialog: an eighteen year sentence.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Any word on his accomplice?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: No word yet. Officials speculate he
text: is hiding somewhere in the canyons

speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: They will continue the search
dialog: through the night and are warning
text: residents that he is armed and
dialog: extremely dangerous. But as of yet,
dialog: nothing is known about the
dialog: accomplice and officials are hoping
dialog: that someone will come forward and
dialog: give them information that will
dialog: lead to identifying who the other
dialog: part of this duo that has caused so
text: much havoc over the past few days.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Thank you, Kate. Wow. What a
dialog: shocking story coming out of West
dialog: Texas. In other news --
text: Toby shuts it off. Returns to staring at the ceiling,

speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: (Dry as a bone) Lucky guy.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Mmhmm.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: Just in the nick of time too...
dialog: What are the odds.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Not great.
text: He punches some numbers on his computer.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: This satisfies both the reverse
dialog: mortgage loan and the back taxes
dialog: that we paid on your mother’s
dialog: behalf. We do that as a courtesy.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I’m sure.
dialog: 100.
text: Toby hands Billy’s business card to the Loan officer.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You can fax the release of Lien to
dialog: this number.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: (Looking over the card) An
dialog: attorney.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah.
text: The loan officer nods.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: You’re aware that you can sell
dialog: mineral rights separate from the
dialog: surface rights of a property.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That a fact.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: Yeah. The odds there are actually
dialog: minerals to extract are, well, it’s
dialog: highly unlikely, but I can check
dialog: and see what value the rights have
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Long odds are working pretty good
dialog: so far. The release of lien, that’s
dialog: all I want.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: I’ll get that faxed over to your

text: The loan officer smiles. Toby doesn’t.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It is the end of the week. I want

speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
text: It take a little time to prepare.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I got all day.

speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: Very well. Let me get it printed
dialog: up.
text: The loan officer hits a button and the printer spits out the
dialog: document.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER (CONT’D)
dialog: If I can just get you to sign here.
text: Toby looks over the paper, reading every word.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s all pretty standard --
text: Toby’s eyes burn into him. He sits back. Toby reads it line
dialog: for line.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Didn't take that long, now, did it?
dialog: Says here you'll mail the deed
dialog: within seven days.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: That's right, that goes to your
dialog: attorney as well, correct?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Toby signs the paper and hands it back.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fax it.
text: The loan officer places it in the fax, enters the number from
dialog: the card.
text: The fax chirps and whines and pulls the paper through.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: That’s it.
text: The loan officer stands. Offers his hand.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER (CONT’D)
dialog: Pleasure doing business with you.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yes. Wasn’t it?
text: Toby turns to leave, then stops. Turns back. An evil gleam in
dialog: his eye.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me ask you a question. Do y’all
dialog: manage trusts?
scene_heading: EXT. MARCUS HAMILTON’S HOUSE -- ABILENE, TEXAS -— DAY.
text: It’s a month or so later. Marcus sits on his porch. Looks out
text: over his yard to the street. There’s traffic, there’s people
text: walking along the sidewalk.
dialog: If anyone’s wondering where all the people from the little
dialog: towns went ... They all came here.
text: A neighbor walks by pushing a stroller. She waves at Marcus.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Thought the summer would never end.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Was a hot one.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Don’t know what we did to deserve
dialog: it, but I'd say we’ve paid our
dialog: penance.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll see. Not sure if the Good
dialog: Lord's done with us yet.
text: She wanders on down the street.
text: A car horn honks. A dog barks. A siren in the distance. There
dialog: is no peace in this place.
text: Marcus finds solace in the newspaper. Flips to the sports
dialog: page.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (0.S.)
dialog: You're breaking in that rocking
dialog: chair, I see.
text: Marcus looks up, though he doesn’t want to. Finds BARNEY
text: CUMBERLAND, nearing 80, and happily settled into a life of no
dialog: purpose.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Going over to the Legion tonight,
dialog: there’s supper and a decent card
dialog: game. Wanna come along?
dialog: 103.
dialog: That sounds like hell.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I ain’t a veteran.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You'll come as my guest.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I appreciate it Barney, but I ain’t
text: much of a card player.
text: Barney laughs.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: You will be.
text: Barney heads back toward his house.
speaker_heading: BARNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Looking back) What else you gonna
dialog: do?
text: Marcus tries to focus on the paper, but the truth of Barney’s
text: statement lingers. It’s too much. He tosses the paper down
text: and heads in the house.
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS’S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- CONT.
text: He looks around -- thirty year old furniture in like new
text: condition. Can’t decide where to go. Decides on his recliner,
text: goes to it and sits.
text: He reclines it back. Clicks on the TV. ESPN. The dull hum of
text: football rises from it. He closes his eyes and leans back.
text: It’s not working. He can’t do this one more minute...
scene_heading: INT. TEXAS RANGER OFFICE -- ABILENE, TX -- DAY.
text: Marcus walks in, past a secretary.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
text: Afternoon, Marcus.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hello, Margaret.
text: A RANGER walks up to him.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: That didn’t take long.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Oh, just ... You know.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Not yet, but I will. Want some
dialog: coffee?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Sure. Think I could take a peak at
dialog: Tanner Hanson's file?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: How come?
text: Marcus smiles.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Nothing better to do.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: It’s in my office.
text: They walk toward an office just off the main foyer. The
text: Ranger hands Marcus the file as they both sit down. Marcus
text: flips through it.
speaker_heading: RANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Got Tanner's juvenile record
dialog: unsealed. What a piece of work that
dialog: boy was.
text: Marcus reads it over.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Killed his father in a hunting
dialog: accident?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: I’d love to know what he was
text: hunting in the barn. In April.
text: Marcus continues reading.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: His brother checked out?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: I don’t know about that, but
dialog: there’s nothing that ties him to
text: the robberies.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What about that little waitress in
dialog: Vernon?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: We showed her a picture, said she
dialog: never seen him ... Pretty upset you
dialog: took her tips as evidence.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That fat girl sure was sassy.
text: Marcus holds up Tanner’s file photo and a blown up picture of
dialog: Toby’s DMV photo --
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You show these to that old timer?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Yep. We showed him Toby’s DMV photo
dialog: and he said it didn’t look like the
text: fella from the diner.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Old timer said they looked like
dialog: brothers.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Well, he’s ninety years old, he
dialog: didn’t recognize Tanner’s photo
dialog: either.
text: Marcus sips his coffee as he continues through the file.
text: Holds up a REQUEST FOR WARRANT form.
speaker_heading: RANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, I asked for a warrant on his
dialog: bank accounts and the ranch, DA
dialog: wouldn't do it. Toby’s got no
dialog: record, never been arrested. Only
dialog: court appearance he ever made was
text: at his divorce.
text: Marcus continues reading.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: He owns this ranch?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Was his mamas. Now it’s in a trust
dialog: for his kids, she died a month ago.
text: Marcus raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Just before all this started ...
dialog: And the ranch is in a trust.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Mmhmm.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Ya’ll go out there?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Oh yeah. You wanna know the first
dialog: thing I noticed? Two drilling crews
dialog: from Chevron capping wells and
dialog: putting in pump jacks... The
dialog: engineer out there said they could
dialog: pull 2000 barrels a month off that
dialog: place. Know how rich that’1l make
dialog: those kids?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Then why was Tanner running around
dialog: robbing banks, if they’re so flush?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: I don’t know, whole thing stinks to
dialog: me. But you try convincing a judge
dialog: to issue warrants on somebody set
dialog: to clear fifty thousand a month for
dialog: stealing forty thousand from the
dialog: bank that manages the trust on the
dialog: property.
text: Marcus raises the other eyebrow.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: First Texas manages the trust?
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: They ain’t the executor, but they
dialog: hold the money. Oh, it’s one rotten
dialog: fish, but damned if I can figure
dialog: it. And you can bet your ass First
dialog: Texas ain’t pressing it over forty
dialog: thousand dollars. Lord knows what
dialog: they stand to make.
text: The Ranger sees the wheels turning in Marcus’s head.
speaker_heading: RANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Marcus, if you want to come up here
dialog: and dig through files, ask
dialog: questions, that’s fine. There's
dialog: always coffee in the pot for you,
dialog: but you can’t go out there, okay?
text: Marcus stares at the DMV photo of Toby.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: RANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Marcus ... You’re retired.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I hear you.
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Okay.
text: Off the Ranger, not quite believing him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HANSON RANCH HOUSE -- DAY.
text: Toby looks at a depression dug under a barbed wire fence that
text: leads to a small garden that has been destroyed.
text: Toby walks to an old pickup and grabs a lever action rifle
text: from the gun rack. He racks a round. Climbs over the fence
text: and follows pig tracks that lead from his garden to the
text: mesquite thicket just beyond. He follows.
text: He walks a deer trail through the thicket, following the pig
text: tracks. He slows, creeping along the trail. It bends to the
dialog: right.
text: He creeps along the trail, then notices something moving off
text: to his right, along the dirt road that leads to the house. He
text: ducks. Looks, and starts creeping back toward the house.
text: MARCUS WALKS THE ROAD UP TO THE HOUSE.
text: He looks up at it. It’s halfway through a new paint job,
text: paint cans and rollers rest beside the porch.
text: Toby steps quietly from the mesquites, coming up behind
text: Marcus. Marcus turns to him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Painting the house I see ...
dialog: Know who I am?
text: Toby steps closer, the rifle cradled in his arms. Marcus
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m the man who killed your
dialog: brother.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I know it. I also know you're
dialog: retired. And you're trespassing.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You could shoot me now and be
dialog: within your rights. And you totin’
dialog: a gun. How convenient.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I imagine you've got one too.
text: Marcus smiles. Toby stands there, waiting patiently
dialog: whatever Marcus came here to do. Or say. Marcus has
text: the edge of the porch.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You mind if I sit?
text: Toby almost smiles.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Feel free.
text: Toby walks to the porch sits in his chair.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You want a beer?
text: Marcus thinks about that.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Sure. I ain’t on duty no more.
dialog: 108.
dialog: for
dialog: a seat on
text: Toby grabs two from a small cooler and tosses him one.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice out here with the breeze, now
dialog: that it’s cooled down. Texas is
dialog: hell till September comes, ain’t
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It can be.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: How’d you do it -- never mind, I’‘1l
dialog: figure that in time ... Why’d you
dialog: do it?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I know why Tanner did it. He robbed
dialog: those banks cuz he liked it. He
dialog: shot my partner three hundred yards
dialog: away cuz he liked it. Made him feel
dialog: good. And if I hadn’t blown his
dialog: shit-for-brains out, there’d be a
text: brand new truck parked out front
dialog: and four wheelers and anything else
dialog: he could think to buy. He’d spend
dialog: it all just to have an excuse to
dialog: steal some more. But not you...
dialog: Painting this old house yourself.
dialog: Driving that beat up truck. Nothing
dialog: new I can see, ‘cept those pump
dialog: jacks and each of ‘em paying you a
dialog: week what you and your brother
dialog: stole from all four banks combined.
dialog: 109.
text: Marcus sips from his beer. Toby shifts the muzzle of his
text: rifle discreetly in Marcus’s direction.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me understand that ... Help
dialog: me understand why four people died
dialog: so you could steal money it don’t
dialog: seem you've spent. That it don’t
dialog: seem you need.
text: Toby looks at Marcus, and his grin that begs for a fight.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You got a family?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: My partner had a family. A big one.
dialog: They don’t have no pump jacks in
dialog: their back yard. They’re gonna have
dialog: to stretch a pension among the six
dialog: of em.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I didn’t kill your friend.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yes you did. By setting this thing
dialog: in motion. You expect me to believe
dialog: your dim-witted brother planned all
dialog: this? We’ve seen how he operated on
dialog: his own. No, this was smart. This
dialog: was you.
dialog: 110.
text: Beat. Toby looks over at a pump jack, undulating up and down,
dialog: drawing money from the earth with every revolution.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I been poor my whole life. So were
dialog: my parents, and their parents
dialog: before ‘em ... Like a disease,
dialog: passed from generation to
dialog: generation. And that’s what it
text: becomes, a sickness ... Infecting
dialog: every person you know ... But not
dialog: my boys. Not anymore. This is
dialog: theirs now. Ain’t no advice you can
dialog: give a child these days. No
dialog: lessons. No love. Nothing that can
dialog: guarantee they have a chance at
dialog: life, but money. I hate that the
dialog: world’s come to this, but it has.
dialog: And I dare you to look me in the
dialog: eye and tell me different ... I
dialog: never killed anyone in my life, but
dialog: if you want me to start with you,
dialog: let's get on with it, old man. See
dialog: if you can get that pistol from
dialog: your boot before I blast you off
dialog: this porch.
text: They hold each other’s gaze, no surrender in either man’s
text: eyes, but no anger either, just the grim acceptance that it
dialog: had to be this way.
text: An older Ford Expedition bounces up the dirt road and stops
text: in front of the house. Justin, Debbie, and RANDY, 11, step
text: out, book bags over the boys’ shoulders.
text: Debbie spots the gun in Toby’s lap.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: That pig was back in the garden.
dialog: (To Marcus) Feral hogs are tearing
dialog: up this place somethin’ fierce.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I’m an old friend of your husband.
text: Debbie recognizes Marcus instantly, but this isn’t her first

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I’m just here working on the house.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You don’t live here?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It’s not mine. It’s theirs.
text: Marcus looks at the boys. Then at Debbie. Stoic expressions,
dialog: giving away nothing ... They all know. He can tell. Has to
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Things you do for your kids, huh?
text: Marcus rises.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I'd best be going.
text: Toby stands as well.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Me too. (To Debbie) I’11 be back
dialog: over around nine tomorrow, try and

text: She nods. Toby looks at Marcus.
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I’m renting a little
dialog: house in town. If you wanna come by
dialog: and finish our conversation ...
dialog: You're welcome anytime.
text: A dare ... A threat ... Marcus looks back at him.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I‘1l do that. I haven’t figured
dialog: this whole thing out yet ... But I
dialog: will.
text: Marcus looks over at the boys. Studies them.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You as smart as your daddy?
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I never thought of daddy as all
dialog: that sharp.
text: Marcus laughs. Leans down to the boy.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Don ou underestimate him.
dialog: 'ty d timate hi
text: He looks back at Toby.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be seeing you.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Soon, I hope. I’m ready to be done
dialog: with this.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You’1l never be done with it. No
dialog: matter what. That’s the price. It’s
dialog: gonna haunt you, son. For the rest
dialog: of your days.
text: Marcus looks up to the sky, letting the autumn sun bathe his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: MARCUS (CONT’D)
dialog: But you won’t be alone. It’s gonna
dialog: haunt me too.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: When you come by, maybe I'll give
dialog: you peace.
text: Marcus smiles.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Maybe. Maybe I’1l give it to you.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I'd like that ... Till that day.
text: Marcus looks at this sad, simple man, and smiles. Tips his
text: hat, turns and walks up the dirt road.
text: The camera rises and looks down on them. The house’s gray,
text: faded shingles and Marcus’s silver hat standing out from the
