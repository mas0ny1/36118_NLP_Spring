scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY
text: But we don’t know what we’re looking at yet. In front of us
text: is just a greyish-white flurry with nothing to orient us and
text: no sound except the whistle of a strong wind at a high
dialog: altitude. We won’t know where we are until--
text: --a rocket flies right in front of us--right to left--and
text: disappears from the frame as fast as it came into it. But we
dialog: probably saw it long enough to know it wasn’t a rocket, it
text: was a world-class skier and we were standing five feet away
text: as she scorched the last few seconds of her run.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: A survey was taken a few years ago
dialog: that asked 300 professionals one
dialog: question:
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: “What’s the worst thing that can
dialog: happen in sports?”
dialog: We're at the bottom of the slope now where the skier we just
text: saw finished her run with a swoosh, and a hundred or so
text: spectators gave her a round. The skier snapped out of her
text: skis, picked them up, pushed up her goggles and looked back
text: up the slope toward the judges...
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Some people answered losing a Game
dialog: 7 and other people said getting
dialog: swept in 4. Some people said--
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --it was missing the World Cup and
dialog: some Brazilians said it was losing
dialog: to Argentina. Not just in the World
dialog: Cup--anytime, ever, in any contest.
text: We can see the whole slope now. It looks like a terrible way
dialog: to die. It’s a moguls course, meaning that skiers race
text: through a punishing series of 3-foot mounds of packed snow
text: and ice, lift-off and execute a mid-air trick, land and run
text: through another set of moguls, lift-off and execute a second
text: trick, land and race to the finish.
text: Spectators and race officials line the sides of the slope.
dialog: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE)
text: The skier we saw is looking back up the slope and now sees
dialog: her scores. Not bad, but not what she needed. She gets
text: another round from the crowd and a less-than-wholehearted hug
dialog: from her coach.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: But one person answered that the
dialog: worst thing that can happen in
dialog: sports was 4th-place at the
dialog: Olympics.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (TOP OF THE SLOPE)
text: We're at the top of the mountain where the next skiers are
text: waiting for their start. One of them has just jumped off the
text: mountain and into the course.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: This is a true story but except for
dialog: my own I’ve changed all the names
dialog: and I’ve done my best to obscure
dialog: identities for reasons that’1l
dialog: become clear. I’m Molly Bloom and
dialog: right now I’m ranked 3rd in North
dialog: America in Women’s Moguls.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)
text: The skier who just started has raced through the first set of
text: moguls, hits the ramp, which sends her up into mid-air where
text: she executes a trick and lands back on the course and hits
text: the second set of moguls.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0.)
dialog: I have a BA in Political Science
dialog: from the University of Colorado
dialog: where I graduated Summa Cum Laude
dialog: with a 3.9 GPA.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)
text: The skier’s made her way through the second set of
text: backbreaking moguls and hits the second ramp, which sends her
text: into the air. We watch the judges examine her trick with
text: expert eyes and then tap the keys on their laptops.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I got a 173 on the L-SATs. The
dialog: median L-SAT score at Harvard Law
dialog: School is 169.
dialog: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3.
scene_heading: EXT. A DIFFERENT SKI SLOPE - DAY
text: This one’s much friendlier and families are skiing together
text: in the sun with the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop. A COACH is
text: working with a 12-YEAR-OLD BOY, showing him the right
text: mechanics for his push-off.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I was raised in Loveland, Colorado,
dialog: about an hour outside Denver or
dialog: four hours if it’s snowing. On a
dialog: weekend family ski trip when I was
dialog: 5 I was spotted by a coach.
text: The COACH stopped paying attention to the 12-YEAR-OLD BOY and
text: became captivated by the sight of a 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL--a
text: prodigy--who’s just exploded into his field of vision. The
text: COACH watches and then glances back up the slope where the
text: girl’s FATHER is standing and watching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Attack it, Molly! Attack it!
text: The COACH watches as the 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL hits the mini-mogul
dialog: section of the run.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0.)
dialog: I'd spend the next 18 years chasing
dialog: winter and being coached by the
dialog: best in the world.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: Runners are competing in a road race and the front of the
text: pack comes toward us as well-wishers cheer and hand out cups
text: of water along the sides.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I also ran pretty well.
text: A 12-YEAR OLD GIRL appears among the runners--both the first
text: kid and the first female we’ve seen. She’s running alongside
text: her FATHER and you can tell just by looking at her stride
dialog: that this is an athlete.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I was running in a charity 5K when
dialog: my back exploded.
scene_heading: 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL
dialog: (to her FATHER)
dialog: Something’s wrong.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Tough it out.
text: The 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL gives her father a quick “thanks” glance
text: that her father doesn’t see before she pulls out several
text: strides ahead of him and the rest of the men around her.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: The 12-YEAR OLD-GIRL is being prepped for surgery.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I had what’s called rapid onset
dialog: scoliosis.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: An x-ray of a terribly curved spine.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: My spine was curved at 63 degrees
dialog: and I’d need a 7-hour surgical
dialog: procedure that involved--
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: An x-ray of the same spine now fused with steel rods.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: --straightening my spine,
text: extracting bone from my hip, fusing
text: eleven vertebrae together and
text: fastening steel rods to the fused
dialog: segments.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: The 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL is in a hospital bed, post-op. From her
text: POV we can barely make out what a DOCTOR is saying to her
text: FATHER and MOTHER.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: She’s gonna be fine, but I wouldn’t
dialog: let her ski anymore. Definitely not
text: moguls and skiing competitively is
dialog: out of the question.
text: The FATHER is quietly devastated and slumps down on the
text: closest surface while the DOCTOR and the MOTHER assure him
dialog: that “...she’s gonna be fine, she just won’t ski”, etc. We
text: stay on the 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL’s eyes--she’s clocked her
text: father’s reaction and even through her post-op morphine haze
text: her eyes are fighting back.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I was on skis again in a year,
dialog: running moguls in 18 months and by
dialog: my 20th birthday I’d made the U.S.
dialog: Ski Team.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (TOP OF THE SLOPE)
dialog: It’s the slope we started at.
dialog: Number 87
speaker_heading: is MOLLY.
speaker_heading: RACE OFFICIAL
dialog: Number 87 up.
dialog: (pointing)
text: 56 on deck.
text: takes her place at the starting gate and Number 56
text: She’s got earbuds in and a coach is vigorously
text: rubbing down her legs to keep them warm.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: It’s the last round of qualifying
dialog: for the Salt Lake City Olympics.
dialog: This is the Champion Run at Deer
dialog: Valley.
text: We can see that visibility is terrible, with snow coming down
text: diagonally and the wind whistling ominously at this altitude.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: The altitude’s 8100 feet and the
dialog: pitch is 52 degrees which is the
dialog: same as the sides of the Great
dialog: Pyramids.
text: MOLLY stomps on her feet to keep them warm and starts to
text: loosen her shoulders and neck.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: The wind’s 20-25 miles an hour
text: blowing left to right. It’s 3-below
text: zero at the top of the slope and
text: with 17 skiers in front of me, it’s
dialog: gonna be like trying to stick a
text: landing on a frozen infinity pool.
text: The COACH points to his ears, indicating that it’s time for
text: Molly to take out her ear buds. She hands the coach her iPod
dialog: as he says--
speaker_heading: COACH
text: Kiki blew out of her line. Shannon
dialog: was off-balance on her second
dialog: landing.
dialog: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 6.
text: MOLLY nods that she understands.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: He’s talking about Kiki Bandy and
dialog: Shannon Keebler, my two toughest
dialog: competitors who had significant point
dialog: deductions on their final runs--
speaker_heading: QUICK INSERT
text: A skier landing slightly off-balance after a trick.
speaker_heading: QUICK INSERT
text: Another skier skiing out of her line and scrambling to
dialog: recover.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (TOP OF THE SLOPE)
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: --setting the table for me.
text: MOLLY snaps her boots into her bindings and taps her skis to
dialog: check how they feel.
speaker_heading: RACE OFFICIAL
text: Number 56 up. 44 on deck.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Go get it, here we go.
text: MOLLY snaps her goggles down as the Coach steps back. MOLLY’s
text: all alone now at the top of the mountain, snow blowing around
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: I can make the Olympic team right
dialog: now. And if I have three perfect
dialog: runs in Salt Lake--the best runs of
dialog: my life--I can beat the Austrians
dialog: and the Swiss and have a realistic
text: shot at the podium. Then the law
dialog: school of my choice and then a
dialog: start-up. A foundation that seeds
dialog: entrepreneurial women and also
dialog: teaches young girls to ignore most
dialog: of their current role models.
speaker_heading: RACE OFFICIAL
dialog: Competitor ready.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: But first this.
dialog: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 7.
text: A small light, accompanied by beeps, blinks red, then yellow,
dialog: then--
text: MOLLY jams her poles into the snow and launches herself onto *
dialog: the slope.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: Good start. My father’s at the
text: bottom trying to telepathically get
dialog: me to check my line.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - SAME TIME (BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE)
text: Molly’s FATHER is looking up the slope--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Check your line.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - SAME TIME (TOP OF THE SLOPE) *
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: I check my line.
speaker_heading: MOLLY’S POV
text: Out of the sea of moguls she’s slashing through her eyes find
text: the path she’s chosen and, for a moment, it becomes
text: demarcated for us like runway lights before it goes away.
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - SAME TIME (TOP OF THE SLOPE) *
text: She’s carving through this minefield, kicking up snow and ice and
text: not being able to see more than ten feet in front of her face.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Good snow contact, calm upper-body, *
dialog: legs together, good shape, no line
dialog: deviation and set up for the D-Spin *
dialog: and-- *
text: MOLLY sails into the air and executes a perfect back-flip *
text: with an off-axis twist.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --stick the landing. Now two things
dialog: you need to know before the second
dialog: trick which’ll be a 720.
text: As MOLLY attacks the next set of moguls we start to gradually *
text: SLOW DOWN THE PICTURE...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The first is that when visibility *
dialog: is bad the way it is now, race
text: officials jam pine boughs in the
text: snow at the edge of the jump so the
dialog: skiers have some foreground depth
dialog: reference. The second is that the *
dialog: tightness of your bindings is
dialog: determined by what’s called a DIN
dialog: setting. If you’re a beginner your
dialog: DIN setting is probably 2 or 3. If
dialog: you’re an experienced weekend skier
dialog: it’s probably 7 or 8. Mine’s 15. My
dialog: boots are basically welded to my
dialog: skis. Right...so how does this
dialog: happen?--
text: In semi-slow motion, MOLLY gets airborne for her second trick *
text: and almost as soon as she does, her right ski comes off and
text: falls to the ground.
text: All sound except Molly’s voice goes out.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: It happened because I hit a pine
dialog: bough and I hit it so precisely *
dialog: that it simply snapped the release
dialog: on my bindings. Right in that
dialog: moment I didn’t have time to
dialog: calculate the odds of that
dialog: happening because I was about to
dialog: land pretty hard on my digitally
dialog: remastered spinal cord which is
dialog: being held together by spare parts *
dialog: from an Erector Set.
text: MOLLY crashes to the ice and snow with terrible impact. *
text: We go back to FULL SPEED now with Molly’s other ski
text: immediately snapping off and skidding away as MOLLY keeps
text: sliding and flipping over.
text: We're still without sound--just the occasional slap of her
text: helmet on the packed snow. And then her helmet flies off just
text: before she breaks through--MOS--the wood and wire fence and
text: into a group of gasping and shouting spectators.
text: We watch the whole thing again full speed. And we watch others
text: watch it--SPECTATORS, her COACH, the JUDGES, TELEVISION CAMERAS
dialog: and her FATHER...
text: Sound kicks back in and we hear the gasping crowd along with the
text: radio crackle of the SKI PATROL and EMTs as they race to the
text: scene. Molly’s FATHER tries to get to her as fast as he can.
text: MOLLY’s on her back, unconscious, blood-soaked snow on her *
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: None of this has anything to do
dialog: with poker. I’m only mentioning it
dialog: because I wanted to say to whoever
dialog: answered that the worst thing that
dialog: could happen in sports was 4th
dialog: place at the Olympics--seriously,
dialog: fuck you.

scene_heading: INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It’s a modest one-bedroom in West Hollywood and at the moment

text: The CAMERA FINDS an open carton containing new copies of a
dialog: book--Molly’s Game: My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of

dialog: confusion.
text: MOLLY opens her eyes, thinking she’s heard something, but now

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, there were 31 people named in

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: And the fifth was also taken but he
dialog: recommended I call you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I told him I wanted someone who'd
dialog: worked in the prosecutor’s office.
dialog: That didn’t narrow the field much
dialog: but then I told him I needed
dialog: someone who wasn’t even a little
dialog: bit shady because I’ve had some
dialog: experience with that and that’s
dialog: when the list got short. I told him

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT’D)

dialog: Did you commit a felony and then
dialog: publish a memoir about it?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I haven’t run a game in over two
dialog: years. Not to spoil the ending but
dialog: that’s when the government raided
dialog: my game and took all my money,
dialog: assuming all of it was made
dialog: illegally which it wasn’t. I’ve

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I went to live with my mother at

dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And it was there that you wrote

speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: Isn’t that against some sort of

text: CHARLIE points a bodyguard to where he wants Molly to sit--
text: four taped off seats on the right side toward the back. As

text: MOLLY’s clocked all that.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: You got a good judge, he’s a good

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT’D)

dialog: Do you know what a “Vor v Zakone”
dialog: is? A “Vor"?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The literal translation is “thief-
dialog: in-law.” It’s the Russian
dialog: equivalent of a Don or a Godfather.
dialog: Nikolai Illyanovich is a Vor. He's
dialog: the one who tried to fix the Salt
dialog: Lake City Olympics.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I wasn’t there.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He’s also had a lot of people
dialog: killed. It’s basically do what I’m

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I've never had an audience with the

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (pause--then quietly)
dialog: Your old boss--the one you call

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You said you left ten-times that

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Counsel, I need to record your

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please the Court Your Honor, just

dialog: You were extending credit. You’re

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I had to.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Didn’t anyone try to buy your debt

speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I couldn’t be sure how they were

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Alright, here it is: Banks are

dialog: shouldn’t. You’re a bad risk, they
dialog: know that. So the debt service on
dialog: your loans is close to 20 percent
dialog: which is crazy. 20 percent is
text: barely survivable if it’s a bridge
dialog: loan but, for instance, it’s taken
dialog: you 10 years to build seven houses,
dialog: all of which are worth less than
dialog: they were before you built them
dialog: because the housing market’s on a

dialog: describing.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: My game had a tricky ecosystem. It
dialog: was built around escapism and
dialog: exclusivity. These guys could buy
dialog: their way into anything and anyone
dialog: but here in this room you couldn’t
dialog: buy your win. You couldn’t buy me,
dialog: you couldn’t buy the girls and you
dialog: couldn’t buy a seat at the table.
dialog: There’s nothing as sweet as a win
dialog: you have to work for and the wins
dialog: and losses were compelling and they
dialog: were real. Of course it helped that

speaker_heading: PLAYER X

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you destroy evidence and

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I understand that you’ve had

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You don’t understand. There are
dialog: going to be those messages and
dialog: they’1ll be embarrassing but there
dialog: are also going to be messages that
dialog: would destroy lives. Other lives.
dialog: There are messages that would end
dialog: careers and obliterate families. If

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: They won't be.

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: prohibited from disclosing--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: My last lawyer sold my deposition
dialog: to the National Enquirer, Charlie!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That happened. But the information
dialog: in that deposition will be nothing

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

text: CHARLIE walks to his desk and picks up his copy of Molly’s
dialog: Game.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Children will find out their

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The movie stars you named in the
dialog: book--you’d already named them
dialog: under oath in the Bad Brad Marion
dialog: deposition.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It was that or perjure myself and
dialog: Brad had already named everyone in

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s not what I’m getting at.
dialog: Your lawyer back then--Butterball--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Butterman.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 87.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Butterman leaked your deposition to

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yeah.
text: CHARLIE nods that now he understands...
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s why those were the only real
dialog: names you used in the book, the
dialog: ones that were given up by
text: Butterbean.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And is that why you have creative
dialog: differences with the Hollywood
dialog: offers? They want information you
dialog: won’t give them?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: None of this has anything to do
dialog: with the Russian mob, right?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What’s on the hard drives, Molly?
dialog: Famous married guys hitting on you?
text: MOLLY nods her head “yeah”.
text: CHARLIE picks up his cell phone and tosses it to her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It’s got every e-mail and text
dialog: message I’ve sent in the last year
dialog: as well as a variety of
dialog: incriminating evidence about my

dialog: you can sell my phone to the

speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 88.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: In order to demonstrate the

text: Everyone’s much fresher and more energetic. DIEGO’s dealing.
speaker_heading: HARLAN

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: Harlan Eustice was the producer of
dialog: backyard wrestling videos who
dialog: Player X badly wanted in the game.
dialog: Harlan was excited about the

text: throwing for his wife in 24 hours.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Kobe beef, black truffle pasta,
dialog: Dover sole--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I liked Harlan. There was no
dialog: affectation, no Hollywooding, no
text: flossing--he wasn’t ticking off the
dialog: menu items to show off, he was
dialog: genuinely excited about the party
text: he was giving his wife.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: She doesn’t know anything, she
dialog: thinks we’re having dinner with her
text: brother and his wife.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0.)

speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 91.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He played tight, didn’t give a lot
dialog: of action and always got his money
dialog: in good which means he was running
dialog: the odds. In other words he was
dialog: playing poker and the others were
dialog: gambling.
text: In a SERIES OF SHOTS we see HARLAN folding hands--

scene_heading: INT. LUXURY SUITE - LATER
text: CASSIE’s dealing in the middle of a hand. There’s already a
text: small pot in the middle and the only two players left are
text: HARLAN and BRAD. The four cards turned over in the middle are
dialog: queen-eight-nine-nine.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: By midnight Harlan had tripled his
dialog: original fifty-thousand dollar buy-
dialog: in but everything came off the
dialog: rails with one hand. And that’s how
dialog: it happens, that’s how you go full
dialog: tilt. Harlan, the best player at
dialog: the table, the best player at most
dialog: tables, was about to get bluffed
dialog: off the nuts by, of all people, Bad
dialog: Brad.
text: CASSIE turns over a fifth card--a king.
dialog: He OK
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 92.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: How? Because this was only Brad’s
dialog: second game, Harlan hadn’t been at
dialog: his first, and Harlan didn’t know
dialog: yet that Brad was bad.
text: Animation shows Harlan’s hand--an 8 and a 9--which when added
text: to the table cards (KQ899) gives Harlan a full house.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Harlan’s got a boat, nine’s full.
text: Animation shows Brad with a 3 and a 5, which when added to
dialog: the table cards equals nothing.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: Brad’s got nothing but his pre-flop
dialog: betting made it look, entirely
dialog: accidentally, like there was a
dialog: chance he had pocket kings, which,
dialog: if true, would give him the better
dialog: full house.
text: HARLAN counts his chips and pushes some into the pot--
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: 30-thousand.
text: BRAD begins counting his chips.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: And there it is. Brad’s counting
dialog: off 30-thousand which means he’s
dialog: gonna call and Harlan knows that if
dialog: Brad’s gonna call and not raise it
dialog: means he didn’t have the boat and
dialog: he’s betting a high two-pair--
dialog: probably kings and queens. But then
dialog: instead of calling the bet--
dialog: BRAD pushes ALL his chips in--
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I’m all in.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --Brad pushes 72-thousand dollars
text: into the pot. Harlan looks at Brad.
dialog: Every tell Harlan knows about--
text: carotid artery pumping, stiff hands-
dialog: -Brad’s doing the opposite.
dialog: Harlan’s betting had represented a
text: huge hand by calling on the flop,
dialog: check-raising the turn and bombing
dialog: the river.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course Harlan didn’t know that
dialog: Brad didn’t know what any of that
dialog: meant. So Harlan, always a good
dialog: sport, said--
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Nice bet. I’m laying this down.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0.)
dialog: --as he tossed in what he didn’t
dialog: realize was the winning hand. Brad
text: tosses in his cards too and one of
text: them flips over and Harlan sees
dialog: it’s not a king.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Oh, sorry about that.
text: HARLAN puts his finger on the flipped card to keep the dealer
dialog: from collecting it.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: You didn’t have pocket kings?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I didn’t have any kings. Except the
text: one in the middle.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: You had two pair?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I had one pair, the nines in the
dialog: middle.
text: Everyone starts laughing raucously at Harlan--asking “How
dialog: could you fold that?!”, “Bill Buckner!”--further humiliating
text: Harlan and patting Brad on the back. HARLAN is frozen.
text: faced. MOLLY of course is clocking all this.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: It wasn’t even that it was that
dialog: much money--Harlan only lost about
dialog: 40-thousand on the hand--
text: HARLAN gets up and starts pacing around the room.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --but a circuit breaker blew and
dialog: Harlan was out for blood.
dialog: Everyone's.

text: HARLAN watches while another pair of hands haul in the pot.
text: He gets up and goes to MOLLY.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: By 5am Harlan was down half a
dialog: million. He'd abandoned everything
dialog: he knew about poker and was playing

speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Another hundred.

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: Text messages were going out

speaker_heading: HARLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just gonna get back to even.
text: MOLLY looks at him and then pulls $500,000 in chips and *
dialog: counts them for Harlan.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0.)
dialog: That should be the second line of
dialog: every gambler’s obit. “Mr.
dialog: Feldstein died while trying to get
dialog: back to even.” Harlan never did.
dialog: And he never got to his wife’s
dialog: birthday party. She filed for
dialog: divorce two days later but there
dialog: was one last punch coming that

dialog: good.

dialog: cousin of Marie Antoinette.
text: Again, we see animation on the screen as MOLLY describes
dialog: their hands.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: Harlan had pocket queens. His
dialog: Excellency had Ace-King. They were
text: both in 65K pre-flop.
text: DIEGO burns a card and then deals three in the middle.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
text: The flop’s queen-seven-seven.
text: Harlan has a full-house again,
dialog: queens full of sevens--with three
text: rounds of betting in front of him.
dialog: The Count has nothing.
text: FREDERICK stacks his chips and pushes them all in.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: And the Count goes all in. He wants
dialog: Harlan to think he’s got two more
dialog: sevens under there. Bite me, says
dialog: Harlan, he’s not falling for this
text: again and he snap calls all in.
text: There’s $750,000 on the table.
text: Diego burns a card and deals the
text: turn. A king. Otto von Bismarck now
dialog: has two pair, kings and sevens, but
dialog: two-pair’s nothing next to a full
dialog: house. And at this point, the only
dialog: hand left that can beat a queen
dialog: full house--
text: DIEGO turns over the fifth card. It’s a king--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --is a king full house. Captain von
text: Trapp bluffed two pair and rivered
dialog: into kings full!
dialog: Then all of a sudden--

speaker_heading: PLAYER X
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: And if I did, who would care?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You fold your hole cards--a five of

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: You didn’t have to be a strategic

speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: You have one asset. Write your

dialog: Write about a girl from Loveland

dialog: You don’t know anything that can

dialog: you know things that can help them.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Did you know that 97 percent of
dialog: federal cases never go to trial?
dialog: Even though your chance of being
dialog: convicted at trial is a little more
dialog: than one in a hundred?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you want to go to trial that’s
dialog: fine but it’s gonna cost in the
dialog: area of three and a half million
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Which the Justice Department knows
dialog: I don’t have because they took all
dialog: my money in a civil forfeiture
dialog: which they can do without a warrant
dialog: because your property doesn’t have
dialog: a presumption of innocence. Then
dialog: after I was arrested by 17 agents
dialog: holding automatic weapons--totally
dialog: necessary and not at all meant to
dialog: intimidate me--they gave me two
dialog: days to hire a lawyer and appear in
text: a courtroom on the other side of
dialog: the country.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you’re saying that everything
text: that happens in a federal bust from
dialog: the moment you’re arrested is
dialog: designed to persuade you to plead
dialog: guilty, you’re correct.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: So tell me all the ways I can help
dialog: ‘cause I really feel I owe it to
dialog: them. Speaking of owing, the IRS
dialog: has put a tax lien on the money
dialog: they took from me.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good to get that off your chest?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It needed to be said.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not really. So to be clear, you're
dialog: not interested in entering into a
dialog: cooperation agreement with the
dialog: prosectors.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because you feel the Government has
dialog: acted--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: --like the neighborhood
dialog: extortionist? No. The U.S.
dialog: Attorney's Office does everything
dialog: within the law to fight crime and
dialog: also for some reason to keep taking
dialog: my stuff, I get it. And if I had
dialog: testimony that could lead to the
dialog: conviction of a bad guy no one
dialog: would have to coerce me into
dialog: cooperating. But I don’t. I have
dialog: dirt. I have dish. I have gossip.
dialog: So my value to the prosecution is
dialog: exactly the same as it is to
dialog: Hollywood. I’m here to ensure the
dialog: New York Post covers the trial. I’m
dialog: here to sell tickets.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Which is nonetheless value to the
dialog: prosecution so what we do is

dialog: It’s nice to meet you though. Let
dialog: me know if there’s ever anything I
dialog: can do for you, I like to do
dialog: favors. They’ll put your drinks on
dialog: my card.
text: MOLLY gets up and heads out and suddenly we --
speaker_heading: SNAP TO BLACK
text: We sit in silence for a moment before...
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: There are some gaps in my memory,
dialog: which they say is common when
dialog: you've had what they call an event.
dialog: For instance I don’t remember where
dialog: I was coming from and I don’t
dialog: remember walking into my building.
dialog: Just that my doorman, Reggie, said
dialog: he had packages for me.

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Ms. Bloom, I think I’ve got some

dialog: I'll bring them on up.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Thanks, Reg.
scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: MOLLY’s running a bath for herself.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: It was a night off and my plan was
dialog: to take a bath and to try not to
dialog: take drugs.
text: The DOORBELL rings--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Reggie came up with my packages.
text: MOLLY unlocks the front door and begins to open it. As soon
text: as she does the door flies open and a STRANGER--a heavy set
text: man in his 50’s--pushes MOLLY back into the apartment and
text: slams the door shut behind him and locks it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I’m sorry, you’re in the wrong--
dialog: Wait, just hang on--
text: The STRANGER grabs MOLLY by the throat and slams her head
text: against the wall.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Shut the fuck up. You need to shut
dialog: your fuckin’ mouth right now, you
dialog: follow me?
text: He flings her head against the other wall and SLAMS HER INTO
speaker_heading: IT HARD--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you get me?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (barely a rasp)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Open your mouth.
text: MOLLY’s frozen. The STRANGER slaps her hard across the face.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 156.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Open your mouth.
text: MOLLY opens her mouth a little and the STRANGER takes out a
text: gun and puts it between her teeth.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re gonna keep quiet now.
text: MOLLY’s teeth are chattering against the gun.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Nod that you understand.
text: MOLLY nods slightly. The STRANGER takes the gun out of her
text: mouth and puts it to her head.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Walk to the bedroom.
text: The STRANGER walks her down the hall toward the bedroom.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: They say you got a smart mouth.
dialog: What else can that mouth do?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The STRANGER throws MOLLY down on the bed and MOLLY turns
text: over so she’s sitting up by the headboard.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I have a lot of money, it’s all
dialog: cash.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: In the safe.
text: The STRANGER grabs MOLLY by the hair--
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: In the closet. Right here.
text: He drags MOLLY by the hair to the safe and pushes her to her
text: knees and gestures toward the safe with the gun.
text: MOLLY taps her code into the keypad and the door swings open,
text: revealing rubber-banded stacks of hundreds and some jewelry
dialog: boxes as well as documents.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 157.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Give me the cash and the jewelry.
dialog: Put it in a bag.
text: MOLLY grabs one of her designer bags and puts the cash and *
text: jewelry inside.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay.
text: The stranger stoops down to MOLLY and grabs her face, shoving
dialog: it up against his.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You don’t call the shots, you
dialog: little cunt. This is your fault.
text: He pulls her to her feet by her hair.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: If you weren’t such a bitch to my
dialog: friends, I wouldn’t have to do this *
dialog: now. *
text: He slams MOLLY’s head into the wall. It knocks her semi- *
text: conscious. Then he punches her in the face. He punches her in
text: the face again.
text: Her face is covered with blood as she backs away as far as
text: she can into the closet. She’s having a hard time breathing
text: as she chokes on her own blood. He punches her again. Then he
text: grabs her and pulls her to her feet and out of the closet.
text: He takes his gun out of his jacket.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Please don’t. I have a family. *
speaker_heading: STRANGER

speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Open your eyes. Open your eyes,
dialog: Molly.
text: She’s barely conscious but she opens her eyes...
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: It wasn’t an offer they made. It
dialog: wasn’t a suggestion. This’ll be
dialog: your only reminder.
text: The last punch knocks her unconscious. She lies there as we
text: HEAR the stranger’s footsteps walk away off-screen, then the
text: door opening and closing.
text: We move through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES--
text: --MOLLY still unconscious on the floor.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: So that happened.
text: --MOLLY pulling herself up to lock the deadbolt on the front
text: door and then sliding back down to the floor.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: I couldn’t call a doctor or go to
dialog: an E.R. They’d take one look at me
dialog: and call the police.
text: --Blood and water swirling down a shower drain.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: My eyes were swollen and black, my
dialog: lips were cut and bloody--
text: --MOLLY holds a folded, wet towel to her face, then lifts her
text: face off the towel and looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --there was dried blood caked all
text: over my neck and chest and I
dialog: couldn’t feel my face. It was
dialog: Christmas Eve.
text: --MOLLY sits alone, staring into space in her darkened
text: apartment, lit only by the city lights out the window.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Pat had set up the meeting. And he
dialog: was how they knew where I lived.
text: --MOLLY closes the blackout curtains in her bedroom against
text: the daylight and then picks up a bag of ice and holds it
text: against her face.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 159.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I stayed in my apartment for two

dialog: and waiting for the phone call I
dialog: knew was coming.
text: --MOLLY checks her phone.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: But the call didn’t come. Where was
dialog: the call from Joey Bag-a-Donuts
dialog: saying--
text: --She checks her phone again.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --"So maybe you’ve had a change of
dialog: heart?”
text: --MOLLY opens her front door and there’s a stack of
text: uncollected newspapers there.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: After 10 days I opened my front
text: door for the first time. People
dialog: were coming back into town after--
text: --She’s going through the newspapers, throwing out the old
text: ones after she scans the front page.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: --New Year’s in Cabo and St. Bart’s
dialog: and South Beach. My phone was
dialog: blowing up with “When’s the next

scene_heading: INSERT OF THE TIMES HEADLINE--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: My face had healed enough so that a

dialog: together a week of games.
scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER
text: She’s getting dressed in one of her killer outfits.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: One week of games to get the 2.8-

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: At the suite. At the Plaza.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Why are you hiding in the bathroom?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I would never tell them anything
dialog: about--I said, “Guys, you want me
dialog: to go further, you want me to go
dialog: other places, I'll do it. But
dialog: nothing about Molly, she can’t be
dialog: touched. Just the Russians.”
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Doug, you’re drunk and a little
dialog: hard to understand so I’ll see you
dialog: in a few minutes when I get there.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Securities fraud.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You’re speaking in book titles.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Do you have an attorney? Does your
dialog: attorney understand that I would
dialog: never help them build a case
dialog: against you? I would never--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hang on--
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: --give them anything against you?
dialog: commit perjury before I did that.

dialog: MOLLY’s starting to put this together--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What did you mean when you said
dialog: “securities fraud”?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: It was such bullshit, it was 2006.

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: I love you whether you believe me
dialog: or not.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Are you informing for the FBI?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Should I have told you? That’s a
dialog: question that’ll, you know, that’1ll
dialog: haunt me for my days. For my days,

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You're an FBI informant?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)

scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: MOLLY’s quickly rummaging through a series of designer bags
text: until she finds some hundreds. She grabs them, grabs her

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I fully expected the lobby to be
text: filled with guys wearing

scene_heading: INT. MOLLY’S LOBBY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: REGGIE

dialog: nine-hundred and ninety-nine
dialog: thousand, nine-hundred and ninety-
dialog: nine dollars and ninety-nine cents

text: WELLSTONE and BRENNAN, two prosecutors in their 30’s.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: And she flew to Denver.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She flew to Denver where her mother
dialog: picked her up and drove them both
text: to her mother’s home in Keystone.
dialog: That was two years ago. It’s been
dialog: two years since Ms. Bloom ran a
dialog: game. I want to mention as well
dialog: that two days after arriving in
dialog: Keystone she voluntarily checked
text: herself into a 28-day rehab and has
dialog: been clean and sober for two years.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: MOLLY, in jeans, a t-shirt, and a baseball cap, is waiting on
text: line at the checkout along with a half-dozen others--all
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 165.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: My third week at rehab they took us
text: on a field trip to a grocery store
dialog: because most addicts have to be
dialog: reintroduced to simple things like
dialog: making your bed and buying eggs.
text: One of the women further up in the line sees something on the
text: magazine rack and pulls it off. She begins excitedly talking
text: to the others next to her and flipping through the pages.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: At the check-out line I saw one of
text: my roommates pull a magazine off
dialog: the rack. She started looking at me
text: and back at the magazine and back
dialog: at me. Then she showed me the cover
dialog: and said, “Is this you?!” It was
dialog: me, along with four of the players
dialog: from the Hollywood game, including
dialog: Player X and Player Y.
scene_heading: EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: MOLLY sits on the curb reading the magazine.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: They’d gotten a hold of someone's
dialog: deposition from the Brad Marion
dialog: bankruptcy suit. The game was run
text: by a cocktail waitress turned poker
dialog: princess who, they said, provided
dialog: the players with drugs and
dialog: prostitutes. A blind quote referred
dialog: to Donnie Silverman, who they mis-
dialog: referenced as a winner of the World
dialog: Poker Championship. I can’t be a
dialog: hundred percent sure that Louis
dialog: Butterman gave my deposition to the
dialog: tabloids, but I’m a hundred percent
dialog: sure Louis Butterman gave my
text: deposition to the tabloids.

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The purpose of the meeting--
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: We're off the record.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No we’re not.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Do you see a stenographer in here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, we are off the record inasmuch
dialog: as there’s no record but you’re
dialog: free to act on information that
dialog: you’re given and we’re not giving
dialog: it to you for free. I’ve been
dialog: sitting at this table for five
dialog: hours, waiting for the opportunity
dialog: to implore you to do the right
dialog: thing while begging my client for
dialog: the last three weeks to act in her
dialog: own best interest. And neither of

dialog: The purpose of this meeting is for
dialog: you to meet Molly Bloom and
dialog: discover, as I have, that she’s not
dialog: the person the press has invented.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: She’s not under federal indictment
dialog: for getting bad press, Charlie. And
dialog: the purpose of the meeting, for me,
dialog: is to discover if your client is
dialog: willing to cooperate with the

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: You’re not willing to cooperate?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No, I’ve never traded sex for

dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m still not sure if there’s a
dialog: record but if there is I wanted to
dialog: make sure that was in it.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: It appears to me that throughout
dialog: your career as a gamerunner you
dialog: were extremely diligent about
text: vetting the players.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I was.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: But you let four guys play in the
dialog: game without knowing they were
dialog: connected?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Plus an FBI informant, it’s pretty
dialog: embarrassing.
text: They’re still waiting for an answer.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was high at the end and doing my
dialog: job badly. I'll also add that in my
dialog: limited experience with the Russian

speaker_heading: HARRISON

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: If I did--
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Yes you do. You can provide color.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You can paint a picture. You can
dialog: tell us that Druzhinsky wore a

dialog: tell us that Illya Gershen showed
dialog: up with a quarter-million dollars
dialog: cash in a backpack and you can tell
dialog: us how much action Helly was taking
text: on a sports bet.
text: MOLLY’s starting to get dizzy from this but she’s fighting
dialog: through it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Uh...No one was allowed to place
dialog: sports bets from the room, they had
dialog: to go outside--I’d have no idea how
dialog: much anyone was taking or laying.
speaker_heading: BRENNAN
dialog: So now you’re saying you knew they
dialog: were making and taking sports bets?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No sir, that was the point of them

dialog: -text messages, emails--movie
dialog: stars, rock stars and billionaires
dialog: who were explicit--some of them
dialog: married with kids--but that’s the
text: tip of the iceberg. A guy comes
dialog: this close to being named U.S.
dialog: Ambassador to Monaco, he’s
dialog: withdrawn from consideration at the
dialog: last minute and nobody knows why.
text: She does. CEOs with college-age
dialog: mistresses, an SVP of an investment
dialog: bank who wanted her to help him put
text: a marked deck in the game, the head
dialog: of a movie studio who texted her
dialog: that a particular star was too

dialog: on Bobby!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She could’ve written a best seller,
dialog: she could have been set for life,
dialog: she’s got the winning lottery
dialog: ticket and she won’t cash it.
dialog: She settled the Brad Marion suit
dialog: for a half a million dollars just
dialog: so she wouldn’t have to testify and
dialog: that was only the first time you
dialog: guys cleaned her out. Your office
dialog: took every dollar she had ina
dialog: Constitutionally fucked up seizure
dialog: and then you put the IRS on her to
dialog: tax the money you seized? I’ve been
dialog: in those strategy meetings. You
dialog: broke her back so she couldn’t
dialog: possibly afford to defend herself.
dialog: And now she has an opportunity to
dialog: guarantee her own freedom by

dialog: she still won’t do it. This woman
dialog: doesn’t belong in a RICO
dialog: indictment, she belongs in
dialog: Congress. She belongs in the pulpit
dialog: of a synagogue, she belongs on a
dialog: box of Wheaties. So yes I am, I’m
dialog: imploring you to do the right
dialog: thing. She knows nothing about the

dialog: Between the two of us we’ve
dialog: appeared in front of this judge 28
dialog: times as prosecutors and not once
dialog: has he deviated from our sentencing
dialog: recommendations, he’s not gonna
dialog: start now. I know you’ve been

dialog: jail, including and especially the
dialog: only person in this room who’s had
text: one of them put a gun in her mouth.

dialog: the same way every casino in

text: There’s silence after that long speech. Then HARRISON to
dialog: turns to MOLLY--
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Do you have anything you’d like to

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I am guilty.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yeah.

dialog: Molly, I'd like to talk to your

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLY

scene_heading: EXT. CORNER OF FIFTH AVE. AND CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - NIGHT
text: The city’s decked out for Christmas. MOLLY’s standing in
text: front of a hot dog cart across the street from the Plaza
text: Hotel and staring up at her old stomping ground. She turns
text: suddenly to the hot dog vendor.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 172.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hm? I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: HOT DOG VENDOR
dialog: Did you want a hot dog?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Uh...a pretzel please.
text: MOLLY takes two singles out of her wallet and trades them for
dialog: the pretzels.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HOT DOG VENDOR
dialog: Merry Christmas.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: To you too.
text: MOLLY walks up the sidewalk a little bit--the street is lined
text: with carriages and horses. MOLLY stops at the first carriage
dialog: and asks the driver--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Is it okay if I feed your horse?
dialog: The driver nods, “Sure go ahead.”
text: MOLLY takes a piece of her pretzel, offers it in her
text: flattened hand and the horse takes it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: On my signal, the revolution will
dialog: begin, and I will lead us all to
dialog: freedom.
text: MOLLY rips her pretzel into a few pieces and drops them in
text: the horse’s feed bucket. She shoves her hands in her coat
text: pockets and moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
text: MOLLY’s walking down a path and the skating rink comes into
text: view. It’s lit up and the skaters are making their way around
text: the rink with Christmas music coming from the speakers.
scene_heading: EXT. SKATE RENTAL - NIGHT
text: MOLLY steps up to the window which is being manned by a
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 173.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hi, I’d like to rent a pair of
dialog: skates, size 6, but I just spent my
dialog: last two dollars on dinner which I
dialog: ended up feeding to a horse. These
dialog: are 800-dollar leather Chanel
dialog: gloves and I’1ll trade you.
speaker_heading: SKATE RENTAL WOMAN
dialog: 800 dollar gloves?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes. And they keep your hands just
dialog: as warm as the 10-dollar kind.
speaker_heading: SKATE RENTAL WOMAN
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Mm-hm. I’m divesting.
scene_heading: EXT. SKATING RINK - NIGHT
text: MOLLY’s finishing lacing her skates on a bench, takes off her
text: coat and steps out onto the rink. As soon as she begins
text: skating it’s clear that she knows how to skate. And as she
text: starts skating faster it’s clear that if she hadn’t chosen
dialog: skiing she could’ve had a future in speed skating.
text: She begins to skate faster and faster--weaving through the
text: other skaters with impressive grace and athleticism. And
text: speed. More and more and more speed as she begins her second
text: lap. Faster. Effortless speed.
text: Two RINK EMPLOYEES on skates and in orange vests see her and
text: one of them shouts out--
scene_heading: RINK EMPLOYEE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: HEY! SLOW DOWN!
text: MOLLY pays no attention as she flies through the other
dialog: skaters.
speaker_heading: RINK EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
dialog: HEY MISS! SLOW DOWN!
text: The two rink employees set out chasing after her on their
dialog: skates.
scene_heading: RINK EMPLOYEE #2
dialog: LADY! SLOW DOWN!!
text: MOLLY flips around, skating backwards now, just as fast as
dialog: she was before.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 174.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Catch me!
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Come on! Catch me!
text: MOLLY flips forward again and rockets away. As she passes the *
text: group of observers watching from the railing she hears a
text: man’s voice off-screen.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Bend your knees.
text: MOLLY turns around to see who just said that-- *
text: --it was her FATHER. MOLLY crashes into the railing and falls
text: down, creating a chain reaction pile-up of skaters who fall
text: over her and then over each other.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (to the other skaters)
dialog: Sorry. Sorry.
text: The two RINK EMPLOYEES skate up and grab MOLLY by each arm.
scene_heading: RINK EMPLOYEE
dialog: We're taking you off the ice right
dialog: now, miss, and if you give us any
dialog: trouble we’re calling the police.
text: As the RINK EMPLOYEES continue to skate MOLLY off the ice
text: like a prisoner, her father asks simply--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: How’s it goin’?
scene_heading: EXT. BENCH NEAR THE RINK - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: MOLLY’s father puts her coat over her as she sits on the
dialog: bench.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What are you doing in New York and
dialog: how did you know I was at the
dialog: skating rink?
dialog: ee OK
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I’m both your father and a doctor
dialog: of the mind. I’m in New York
dialog: because that’s where you are and I
dialog: called your mom at the hotel and
dialog: she said you were here. Listen,
dialog: it’s not a big deal but from what I
dialog: saw out there I think you’re having
text: a small breakdown.
speaker_heading: HH HK
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 175.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That’s weird, I can’t think of why.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I would think it was because of the
dialog: arrest and not knowing what’s going
dialog: to happen.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Old man, do you really not
dialog: recognize sarcasm?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Do you? Drink this.
text: He’s handed her a styrofoam cup.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I can’t drink, I’m an alcoholic but
dialog: thanks for remembering.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: It’s hot chocolate.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: And for diagnostic purposes, do
dialog: you think we’re in a cocktail
dialog: lounge right now? ‘Cause if you do
dialog: I have to walk you into Bellevue
dialog: tonight. Did you know I can do
dialog: that? I can institutionalize
dialog: people, it’s fantastic. I want to
dialog: check your pulse.
text: He takes her wrist and looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Dad--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Hang on.
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Dad, I can see you're getting
dialog: warmed up but I don’t have the
dialog: emotional bandwidth to defend my
dialog: “as usual irresponsible behavior.”
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I know, I got your e-mail. I get
dialog: that I’m not welcome in your life
dialog: right now as your father though you
dialog: should know I could give a shit if
dialog: I’m welcome or not. But I’m not
dialog: here in my capacity as your father.
dialog: I’m indifferent to whether your
dialog: father lives or dies. I'm a very
dialog: expensive therapist and I’m here to
dialog: give you one free session.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You think what I need right now is
dialog: a therapist?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (almost laughing)
dialog: Yuh-huh!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I have to be back at my lawyer’s
dialog: office soon.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You like your lawyer?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I wasn’t asking for money when I
dialog: called you, dad, I just needed my
dialog: dad. And God forbid you part with a
dialog: nickel.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yeah Tiny Tim, you grew up on a
dialog: lake and you've skied all over the
dialog: world, were those work houses

text: MOLLY does as she’s told. There’s a long silence before...
speaker_heading: FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Alright. We’re gonna do three years
dialog: of therapy in three minutes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I’m gonna do what patients have
dialog: been begging therapists to do for a
dialog: hundred years--I’m just gonna give
dialog: you the answers.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: To what?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Well let’s start with this. Why
text: does a young woman who, at 22, has
text: a gold-plated resume--why does she
dialog: run high-stakes poker games?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Why did I choose to make a lot of
dialog: money, that’s a head scratcher.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You were gonna be a success at
dialog: anything you wanted and you know
dialog: it. If you’d gone to law school
dialog: you'd have been a partner by now.
dialog: Why this?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t know. Drugs.
dialog: Her father waves that off--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You didn’t start with drugs until
dialog: the end. They weren’t the problem,
dialog: they were the medicine. No. It was
dialog: so you could control powerful men.
dialog: Your addiction was having power
text: over powerful men.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That’s really what you think?
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 178.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No, I know it for sure. You’ve now
dialog: completed your first year of
dialog: therapy.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I saw an opportunity, it wasn’t
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: It wasn’t just about me.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It wasn’t at all about you.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: It was. Second year, second
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Do you think you were a good
dialog: husband?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: What do you care?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I care because you were married to
dialog: my mother! I care because my
dialog: father’s an asshole!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Congratulations, you’ve completed
dialog: Year Two. For the record, your
dialog: father raised three kids on a
dialog: college professor’s salary. One of
dialog: them is a two-time Olympian, sixth-
dialog: round draft pick of the
dialog: Philadelphia Eagles and a leading
dialog: philanthropist. Another is a
dialog: cardiothoracic surgeon at Mass
dialog: General and the third built a multi-
dialog: million dollar business using not
text: much more than her wits.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I’m about to plead guilty ina
dialog: federal court.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Nobody’s perfect. The point is I
dialog: must have done a few things right.
dialog: Last question.
dialog: *
dialog: 179.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Last question, Mol. I’1l answer it
dialog: but you have to ask it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Why didn’t you like me as much as
dialog: my brothers?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: There it is. I did. It only from
dialog: time to time appeared that I
dialog: didn’t.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It only appeared that you didn’t?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That’s some Category-5 bullshit,
dialog: dad. Why would--It only appeared--
dialog: Why would--Okay, I had an attitude.
dialog: I talked back. And I broke some
dialog: normal adolescent rules. I snuck
dialog: phone time past curfew, I took your
dialog: car when I wasn’t allowed to--
speaker_heading: FATHER
text: --and drove it into a McDonald's.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: And kids get punished for that but
dialog: they don’t get--you’d turn into
dialog: another person--your voice, your
dialog: face, it was--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: --because I knew you knew.
speaker_heading: MOLLY

scene_heading: QUICK CUT TO:

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You knew, honey, and I knew you knew.
dialog: And that’s how I reacted to the shame.
dialog: And you reacted by showing seething
dialog: contempt for me, by driving my car
dialog: into a McDonald’s--
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 181.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: --and wanting to have power over
dialog: powerful men?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No, that was a red herring just to
dialog: make you mad.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You’re such an asshole, dad--
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: YOU TRIPPED OVER A STICK!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: OKAY?!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Ten years ago you tripped over a
dialog: stick. It was a one-in-a-million
dialog: thing. You tripped over a stick.
dialog: That’s what you did wrong.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There’s your session. It’s funny
dialog: how much faster you can do it when
dialog: you’re not charging by the hour.
dialog: I’m your father. Trying to
dialog: comprehend how much I love you
dialog: would be like trying to visualize
dialog: the size of the universe.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I didn’t know you’d gotten beaten
dialog: up until I read it in your book, it
dialog: was a helluva way to learn about
dialog: it. You should know I’m hiring
dialog: someone to find the guy who did it
dialog: and then I’m hiring someone to kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Don’t even joke about that, Dad.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I’m not.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It wasn’t a purse snatcher, it was

scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: CHARLIE’s alone in his office with the city flickering out

text: the middle and folds.
text: MOLLY comes and stands in the doorway for a moment...
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Did you know that the center of our
text: galaxy smells like rum and
dialog: raspberries? It’s true. At the
dialog: center of the galaxy is ethyl
dialog: formate, which is the same gas that
text: gives rum its smell and raspberries
dialog: their taste.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why do you know these things?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: To stay busy during games I surfed
dialog: the internet. Then I started taking

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 183.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: We hand over our forensic imaging.
speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: I don’t get it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We give them the forensic imaging

dialog: exchange--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: In exchange--What could they
dialog: possibly offer me to do that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Your money back.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They’1l return all of your money.
text: MOLLY takes in that information...doesn’t know whether to
dialog: laugh or cry and just says...
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yeah, that sounds about right.
text: CHARLIE laughs a little.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that why they took the money in
dialog: the first place? So they could
dialog: offer it back to me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think they just wanted to buy an
dialog: espresso machine.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: A four and a half million dollar
dialog: espresso machine?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. Hey, for what it’s worth, if
dialog: we were going to trial we’d have to
text: hand over the forensic imaging in
dialog: discovery.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes but that’s different from
text: voluntarily handing it over.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 184.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But it’s not really voluntary

dialog: recommend--three years.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why do you keep breaking eye
dialog: contact with me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m looking right at you.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You think I should do it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You have to let me keep you out of

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah--
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: Wives, lives on both coasts--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Listen to me. When a rich guy goes

dialog: His lawyer knows how to take care
text: of it. He spreads money around and
dialog: you don’t have any. The composition
dialog: of female inmates in federal prison-
dialog: -they did not commit financial
dialog: crimes. They’re drug dealers and
dialog: they get raped by prison guards and
dialog: you will not be anonymous, Molly,

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: book, by settling the Brad Marion
dialog: suit, by turning down four and a
dialog: half million dollars of your own
dialog: money and by going to jail? Where’d
dialog: everybody go?!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It’s not their names I’m
dialog: protecting, Charlie, it’s mine.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Your integrity?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Frame it anyway you want but it’s
dialog: still throwing other people under
dialog: the bus.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And you know I admire that but we
dialog: have to live in the real world now.
dialog: I’m sufficiently convinced that
dialog: he’s gonna recommend jail time as a

text: Degenerate gluttons of sloth. Crass
dialog: and stupid misogynists who measure
dialog: their worth in worthless ways.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And then you met me?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, Counselor Ego. I’ve known good
dialog: men--beginning with my father and
dialog: my brothers.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know, I was just--
text: She puts her hand on his shoulder--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: But you confirmed it wasn’t a
dialog: fluke.
scene_heading: EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
text: It’s a freezing cold day. Paparazzi and a couple of TMZ-type
text: film crews are behind police sawhorses. MOLLY--along with her
text: MOTHER, FATHER and her two handsome brothers, JORDAN and
text: JEREMY, step out of a black SUV where they’re met by CHARLIE,
text: STELLA, and a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS. They head
text: up the courthouse steps as cameras come to life and some
text: questions we can’t really make out are shouted and ignored.
text: Molly’s MOTHER takes her arm. MOLLY turns to her--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (pause--not allowing
dialog: herself to cry)
dialog: New Yorkers think this is cold
dialog: weather? In Colorado this is a
dialog: beach day.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: There you are.
dialog: (then to her FATHER)
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 189.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: These people taking pictures and
dialog: shouting? The desire--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: --to punch them as hard as I can in
dialog: the mouth--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: --is overwhelming.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yup.
dialog: They head into the courthouse as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - A MOMENT LATER
dialog: Not too many people. It’s just another day’s business for the
text: court. The family takes its seats and STELLA takes a seat a
text: few rows down and on the aisle. HARRISON and BRENNAN are
text: already at the prosecutor’s table discussing some things.
text: MOLLY walks in with CHARLIE and they head down to the defense
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: Why isn’t Stella in school?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She insisted.
text: MOLLY turns and goes back up the aisle and kneels down where
text: STELLA’s sitting.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There’s gonna come a moment in your
dialog: life that tests your character.
dialog: When that moment comes, it’1l be
dialog: better if you don’t have any.
text: After a moment, STELLA smiles and then laughs a little. MOLLY
text: gives her a light smack on the knee and joins Charlie at the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 190.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: The business of the court began.
text: We continue semi-MOS as Molly begins narrating over a series
dialog: of easy DISSOLVES--
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: MOLLY and
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: We stood for the Honorable Judge
dialog: Dustin Foxman and counsel entered
dialog: their names for the record.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: The docket was called and some pro
dialog: forma instructions were given to
dialog: counsel.
text: CHARLIE stand up.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: And I was asked a series of
text: questions from a script the judge
text: had in front of him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: What is your full name?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Molly Dubin Bloom.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: How old are you?
text: The questioning continues.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Have you taken any drugs, medicine
dialog: or pills or had any alcoholic
dialog: beverages in the past 48 hours?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sudafed.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Is there anything about the reasons
dialog: for your taking Sudafed that would
dialog: interfere with what’s going on here
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
dialog: 191.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: I state for the record that I’ve
dialog: also taken Sudafed in the last 48
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: 87 questions he was required to ask
dialog: before he’d permit me to plead
dialog: guilty.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Is your mind clear today, Ms.
dialog: Bloom?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Do you understand what is going on
dialog: here today?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Under the Constitution and laws of
dialog: the United States you have a right
dialog: to plead to the charges in the
dialog: indictment, do you understand that?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: And do you understand that?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: At that trial you would be presumed
dialog: to be innocent and you would not
dialog: have to prove that you were
dialog: innocent, do you understand that?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
dialog: 192.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes Your Honor.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: If you plead guilty and I accept
dialog: your plea, you will give up your
dialog: right to appeal along with all the
dialog: other rights I’ve enumerated, do
dialog: you understand?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Even now as you are entering this
dialog: plea you have the right to change
dialog: your mind and plead not guilty to
dialog: Count Twenty of the indictment and
dialog: go to trial, do you understand
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Do you understand that you are
dialog: charged in Count Twenty with
dialog: operating an illegal gambling
dialog: business in violation of Title 18
speaker_heading: United States Code Sections 1955
dialog: and 2?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes, I understand.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Understanding everything you've
dialog: just been told, do you now wish to
dialog: enter a plea?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 193.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: How do you plead to the charge?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Guilty, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Your plea has been so recorded and
dialog: you can take your seat. Before we
dialog: move to the sentencing phase I'd
dialog: like a word with counsel please.
text: CHARLIE, HARRISON, and BRENNAN all stand up to approach the
dialog: bench--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: And then something happened.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
speaker_heading: (to CHARLIE)
dialog: Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey, just
dialog: government counsel.
text: CHARLIE’s a little confused, this is very unusual.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes Judge.
text: CHARLIE sits back down as HARRISON and BRENNAN have a private
text: conversation at the bench.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: The wait continues...
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What is it usually?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I can’t feel my legs. I’ve never
dialog: been this scared in my life.
text: CHARLIE looks at her...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes you have.
speaker_heading: The JUDGE
speaker_heading: MOLLY and
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 194.
text: tells the prosecutors they can step back.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Would the defendant please rise for
dialog: sentencing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE stand.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Based on all available information,
dialog: this court manifestly disagrees
dialog: with the government’s sentencing
dialog: recommendation. This courthouse is
dialog: located three streets from the
dialog: financial district, which is
dialog: populated by men and women who will
dialog: commit more serious crimes by
dialog: lunchtime today than the defendant
dialog: has committed in this indictment. I
dialog: simply don’t see how either the
dialog: People or the cause of justice are
dialog: served by locking Molly Bloom in
dialog: prison.
text: We see the family’s reaction--holding their breath, as
text: CHARLIE closes his eyes a moment and exhales in relief and
text: anticipation. The JUDGE continues semi-MOS--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0.)
dialog: It was as casual as if he was
text: ordering lunch off a menu.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FOXMAN
dialog: Ms. Bloom, this court sentences you
dialog: to two-hundred hours of community
dialog: service, one year of supervised
dialog: probation and drug testing and a
dialog: one-hundred thousand dollar fine.
dialog: This case is adjourned.
text: He raps his gavel. Everyone rushes a stunned Molly to
text: congratulate her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: And that was that. There was crying
dialog: and hugging, jokes from my brothers--
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
text: --as MOLLY, CHARLIE, STELLA, and MOLLY’s FAMILY exit and head
text: down the stairs with CHARLIE casually waving off questions.
dialog: 195.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: --tough talk about how no one
text: messes with the Blooms and level-
dialog: headed talk about Christmas
dialog: miracles.
scene_heading: INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The seven of them are having a lively dinner.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: Steaks and beer bought by my father
text: and full reenactments.
text: In the middle of the revelry, we start to slowly PUSH IN on
text: MOLLY, whose face is beginning to change a little.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
text: And in the middle of it all, as
dialog: grateful as you are, the reality
dialog: starts creeping toward you like the
dialog: tide. And that’s the first time you
dialog: have the thought...”What do I do
dialog: now?”
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY
dialog: It’s the slope we were on at the beginning, windy and
text: forbidding. We’re watching from a few hundred feet away and
text: we can barely see MOLLY on the ground where she’s just had
text: her accident. She’s surrounded by EMTs, ski patrol, her coach
dialog: and her father. From time to time we’ll see the other skiers
text: standing by silently, waiting and hoping.
text: We can hear the two TV COMMENTATORS--one male, one female--
text: and a female REPORTER on the ground near the action.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She’s been laying still for about a
dialog: minute now. I want to emphasize
dialog: again, our cameras can’t get in
dialog: there so we don’t know if she’s
dialog: conscious.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She fell hard and then kept going
text: at a punishing speed.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I'm a felon. I’m 35 years old,
dialog: unemployed, and pled guilty ina
dialog: mob indictment.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 196.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Molly Bloom is of course the sister
dialog: of Jeremy Bloom who holds the
dialog: world’s number one ranking. That’s
dialog: her longtime coach there, Ted
text: Keene, and her father.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: I owe the government close to two-
dialog: million dollars in taxes assessed
dialog: on the civil forfeiture plus the
dialog: hundred-thousand dollar fine. And
dialog: they’re gonna come get it.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
text: On the doorstep of making the
dialog: Olympic team.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: I have a quarter of a million
dialog: dollars in legal bills.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
text: She came back from an injury when
dialog: she was just 13. Emergency back
dialog: surgery. You know I wonder if
dialog: Tracy’s got an update for us on the
dialog: ground--Tracy?
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: I don’t know what I’d say in a job
dialog: interview, or if I’ll ever be given
dialog: a job interview. I won’t know how
dialog: to explain this. And for some
dialog: reason I’m never allowed to go to
dialog: Canada.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.0O.)
dialog: Guys, we’re hearing the chopper
dialog: blades down here.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: That’s the sound you don’t want to
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: They don’t think--
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, they don’t think they can get
dialog: her off this mountain.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: And I’m not allowed to vote.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 197.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.0O.)
dialog: If she can hear those chopper
dialog: blades--
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: She’s moving, guys!
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
text: She’s moving.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
text: She’s waving off the chopper.
text: We see someone with the ski patrol get on their radio and
text: look to the sky where the chopper is.
text: MOLLY sits up even though the EMTs and her father and the
text: coach are telling her to sit still.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: This is something.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
dialog: I’ll tell you guys, as banged up as
dialog: she has to be right now, she
text: appears more angry with herself
text: than she is hurt.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
text: We can see she’s being helped to
text: her feet now.
text: MOLLY takes a towel and wipes the remaining blood off her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Did anything good come of this? Not
dialog: really. But I learned things. For
dialog: instance the largest diamond ever
dialog: found isn’t on Earth. It’s a burned
dialog: out corpse of a star that’s 50
text: light years away in the
text: Constellation Centaurus.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
text: She’s on her feet.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: It weighs 5-million trillion
dialog: trillion pounds which is 10-billion
dialog: trillion trillion carats.
speaker_heading: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 198.
speaker_heading: TRACY (V.O.)
text: She’s looking back up the slope,
dialog: trying to figure out what went
dialog: wrong, I’m sure that question’s
text: gonna haunt her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.0O.)
dialog: So I learned that our galaxy smells
text: like rum and raspberries and has a
text: floating diamond the size of
dialog: Polaris.
text: APPLAUSE from all the spectators and officials.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: You have to wonder about the
dialog: psychological toll. Coming that
dialog: close after 18 years only to lose
dialog: it like that.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: And I learned that I’m very hard to
dialog: kill.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.0O.)
dialog: You and I both know people who’ve
dialog: never gotten over it.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: I don’t know if the young woman
dialog: we've just seen is one of those
dialog: people. We may not see her ski
dialog: competitively again but I think
dialog: we’re gonna see her. She’1ll be
dialog: back.
text: As the ski patrol starts to move MOLLY down off the slope,
text: the camera counters in the other direction--still at a
text: distance--so that we’re turning to look at the crash site
dialog: from a different angle.
text: And as we continue the camera move, coming into the
dialog: foreground of the shot...
text: ...we see the PINE BOUGH.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She’ll be back.
speaker_heading: MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Alright, next up in the gate is
dialog: Whitney Summerhill who’s currently
dialog: sitting in 12th place after--
speaker_heading: SNAP CUT TO:
dialog:
