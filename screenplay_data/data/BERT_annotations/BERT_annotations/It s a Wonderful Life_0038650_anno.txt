speaker_heading: NIGHT SEQUENCE
text: Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town
text: of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets
text: are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over
text: the above scenes we hear voices praying:
speaker_heading: GOWER'S VOICE
dialog: I owe everything to George Bailey.
dialog: Help him, dear Father.
speaker_heading: MARTINI'S VOICE
dialog: Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend
dialog: Mr. Bailey.
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY'S VOICE
dialog: Help my son George tonight.
speaker_heading: BERT'S VOICE
dialog: He never thinks about himself, God;
dialog: that's why he's in trouble.
speaker_heading: ERNIE'S VOICE
dialog: George is a good guy. Give him a
dialog: break, God.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE
dialog: I love him, dear Lord. Watch over
dialog: him tonight.
speaker_heading: JANIE'S VOICE
dialog: Please, God. Something's the matter
dialog: with Daddy.
speaker_heading: ZUZU'S VOICE
dialog: Please bring Daddy back.
text: CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through
text: the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly
text: toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we
text: hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice
text: is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: Hello, Joseph, trouble?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: Looks like we'll have to send someone
dialog: down  a lot of people are asking
dialog: for help for a man named George
dialog: Bailey.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his
dialog: crucial night. You're right, we'll
dialog: have to send someone down immediately.
dialog: Whose turn is it?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: That's why I came to see you, sir.
text: It's that clock-maker's turn again.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings
dialog: yet, has he? We've passed him up
dialog: right along.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: Because, you know, sir, he's got the
dialog: I.Q. of a rabbit.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, but he's got the faith of a
dialog: child  simple. Joseph, send for
dialog: Clarence.
text: A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It
text: twinkles as Clarence speaks:
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: You sent for me, sir?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth
dialog: needs our help.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Splendid! Is he sick?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: No, worse. He's discouraged. At
dialog: exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight,
dialog: Earth time, that man will be thinking
dialog: seriously of throwing away God's
dialog: greatest gift.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've
dialog: only got an hour to dress. What are
dialog: they wearing now?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: You will spend that hour getting
dialog: acquainted with George Bailey.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Sir... If I should accomplish this
dialog: mission  I mean  might I perhaps
dialog: win my wings? I've been waiting for
dialog: over two hundred years now, sir 
text: and people are beginning to talk.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: What's that book you've got there?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: Clarence, you do a good job with
dialog: George Bailey, and you'll get your
dialog: wings.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: Poor George... Sit down.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Sit down? What are...
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: If you're going to help a man, you
dialog: want to know something about him,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Well, naturally. Of course.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: Well, keep your eyes open. See the
dialog: town?
text: The stars fade out from the screen, and a light,
text: indistinguishable blur is seen.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Where? I don't see a thing.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your
dialog: wings yet. Now look, I'll help you
dialog: out. Concentrate. Begin to see
dialog: something?
text: The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a
text: group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Why, yes. This is amazing.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: If you ever get your wings, you'll
dialog: see all by yourself.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, wonderful!
scene_heading: EXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL  DAY  CLOSE SHOT
text: Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on
text: large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out
text: onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (as he slides)
dialog: Yippee!!
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, who's that?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: That's your problem, George Bailey.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: A boy?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: That's him when he was twelve, back
dialog: in 1919. Something happens here you'll
dialog: have to remember later on.
text: Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the
text: hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others
text: applaud.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George Bailey at bottom of slide.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (through megaphone)
dialog: And here comes the scare-baby, my
dialog: kid brother, Harry Bailey.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  HARRY
text: On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm not scared.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by
text: the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice
text: at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears
text: into the water.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm coming, Harry.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to
text: pull him out he yells:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Make a chain, gang! A chain!
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain.
text: When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they
text: pull them both to safety.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: George saved his brother's life that
dialog: day. But he caught a bad cold which
text: infected his left ear. Cost him his
dialog: hearing in that ear. It was weeks
dialog: before he could return to his after-
dialog: school job at old man Gower's
dialog: drugstore.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm,
text: whistling. Their attention is drawn to an elaborate
text: horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM PAN SHOT
text: The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly
text: man riding in it.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: The boys watching the carriage.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mr. Potter!
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE
dialog: Who's that  a king?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: That's Henry F. Potter, the richest
dialog: and meanest man in the county.
text: The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The
text: drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored
text: water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So long!
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee-
dialog: haw.
scene_heading: INTERIOR DRUGSTORE  DAY
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter
text: on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wish I had a million dollars.
text: He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hot dog!
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch,
text: a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get
text: his apron from behind the fountain.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (calling toward back
dialog: room)
dialog: It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room.
text: We see him take a drink from a bottle.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: You're late.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools
text: at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same
text: age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (with warm friendliness)
dialog: Hello, George.
text: (then, flatly, as she
dialog: sees Mary)
dialog: 'Lo, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (primly)
dialog: Hello, Violet.
text: George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are
text: two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Two cents worth of shoelaces?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: She was here first.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm still thinking.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Violet)
dialog: Shoelaces?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Please, Georgie.
text: George goes over to the candy counter.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (to Mary)
dialog: I like him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You like every boy.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (happily)
dialog: What's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Here you are.
text: George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice
text: shoelaces. Violet gives him the money.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (the vamp)
dialog: Help me down?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Help you down!
text: Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching,
text: sticks out her tongue as she passes.
text: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Made up your mind yet?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll take chocolate.
text: George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: With coconuts?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't like coconuts.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You don't like coconuts! Say,
dialog: brainless, don't you know where
dialog: coconuts come from? Lookit here 
dialog: from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral
dialog: Sea!
text: He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: A new magazine! I never saw it before.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Of course you never. Only us explorers
dialog: can get it. I've been nominated for
dialog: membership in the National Geographic
dialog: Society.
text: He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf
text: ear toward her. She leans over, speaking softly.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Mary, whispering.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Is this the ear you can't hear on?
dialog: George Bailey, I'll love you till
dialog: the day I die.
text: She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she
dialog: has said.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm going out exploring some day,
dialog: you watch. And I'm going to have a
dialog: couple of harems, and maybe three or
dialog: four wives. Wait and see.
text: He turns back to the cash register, whistling.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain.
text: Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven,
text: chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It
text: is evident he has been drinking.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: George! George!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: You're not paid to be a canary.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, sir.
text: He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open
text: telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he
text: starts to read it.
scene_heading: INSERT: THE TELEGRAM
dialog: It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert,
dialog: died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything
dialog: possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions
scene_heading: from you. EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE."
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses
text: itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the
text: ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward
dialog: Gower.
scene_heading: INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE  DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mr. Gower, do you want something...
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Anything I can do back here?
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: No.
text: George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite
text: drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
dialog: George and Gower.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll get them, sir.
text: He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower
text: waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in
text: his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background.
text: George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the
text: powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George
text: stands still, horrified.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: Take these capsules over to Mrs.
text: Blaine's. She's waiting for them.
text: George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or
text: say. His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison.
text: George's fingers fumble.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria
dialog: there, haven't they, sir?
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: Ummmm...
text: Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns
text: to him, the box in his hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is it a charge, sir?
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: Yes  charge.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mr. Gower, I think...
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: Aw, get going!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE  DAY
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he
text: sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says:
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: "ASK DAD HE KNOWS"  SWEET CAPORAL
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the
text: street. Mary follows him with her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  DAY
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two-
text: story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building
text: and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting
text: at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There
text: is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a
dialog: door marked:
text: "PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands,
text: obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a
text: very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With
text: him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a
text: waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and
text: Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. The office vibrates with
text: an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly
text: toward his father's office.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to
text: enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where
dialog: you headin'?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Some other time, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's important.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
text: There's a squall in there that's
text: shapin' up into a storm.
text: During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone,
dialog: and now she calls out:
speaker_heading: COUSIN TILLY
dialog: Uncle Billy... telephone.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: COUSIN TILLY
dialog: Bank examiner.
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: CLOSEUP  UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND There are pieces of string
text: tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of
text: things he has to do.
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: Uncle Billy looking at his hand.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Bank examiner! I should have called
dialog: him yesterday. Switch it inside.
text: He enters a door marked: "WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE". George
text: stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs
text: of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more
text: keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his
text: father's office and enters.
scene_heading: INT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE  DAY
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing
text: swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle
text: man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other
text: people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind
text: which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits
text: Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The
text: following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument
dialog: had been in process for some time.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Well, you're begging, and that's a
dialog: whole lot worse.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: All I'm asking is thirty days more...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Pop!
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Just a minute, son.
dialog: (to Potter)
dialog: Just thirty short days. I'll dig up
dialog: that five thousand somehow.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (to his goon)
dialog: Shove me up...
text: Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pop!
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Have you put any real pressure on
dialog: those people of yours to pay those
dialog: mortgages?
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of
dialog: these people are out of work.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Then foreclose!
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: I can't do that. These families have
dialog: children.
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  POTTER AND BAILEY
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pop!
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: They're not my children.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: But they're somebody's children.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Are you running a business or a
dialog: charity ward?
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Well, all right...
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Not with my money!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  POTTER AND BAILEY
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Mr. Potter, what makes you such a
dialog: hardskulled character? You have no
dialog: family  no children. You can't begin
dialog: to spend all the money you've got.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: So I suppose I should give it to
dialog: miserable failures like you and that
dialog: idiot brother of yours to spend for
dialog: me.
dialog: George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his
text: father. He comes around in front of the desk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He's not a failure! You can't say
dialog: that about my father!
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: George, George...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're not! You're the biggest man
dialog: in town!
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Run along.
text: He pushes George toward the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bigger'n him!
text: As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's
text: shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bigger'n everybody.
text: George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on
text: his shoulder. As they go:
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George and his father at the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't let him say that about you,

speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to

speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: (drunkenly)
dialog: Why, that medicine should have been

text: He hangs up the phone and turns to George.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?
text: He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Capsules...
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: (shaking him)
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Yes, sir, I...
text: Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open
text: hands. George tries to protect himself as best he can.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: What kind of tricks are you playing,
dialog: anyway? Why didn't you deliver them
dialog: right away? Don't you know that boy's
dialog: very sick?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (in tears)
dialog: You're hurting my sore ear.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND GOWER
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: You lazy loafer!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're
dialog: doing. You put something wrong in
dialog: those capsules. I know you're unhappy.
dialog: You got that telegram, and you're
dialog: upset. You put something bad in those
dialog: capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr.
dialog: Gower...
text: George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely
text: rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy
text: venomously.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Just look and see what you did. Look
dialog: at the bottle you took the powder
dialog: from. It's poison! I tell you, it's
dialog: poison! I know you feel bad... and...
text: George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower
text: looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced
text: on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder
text: out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then
text: abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to
text: look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened.
text: Gower steps toward him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't hurt my sore ear again.
text: But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and,
text: sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is
text: crying too.
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: No... No... No...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't hurt my ear again!
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: Oh, George, George...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

dialog: won't.
speaker_heading: GOWER

speaker_heading: JOE
text: An overnight bag  genuine English

speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE

speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE

speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE

dialog: tell anyone about the pills?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH'S VOICE
dialog: Not a soul.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE'S VOICE

text: He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could
dialog: use this as a raft in case the boat

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No charge.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (indicating name on

speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: What's my name doing on it?
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: about driving me home in style?
text: Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Sure, your highness, hop in. And,
dialog: for the carriage trade, I puts on my
dialog: hat.
text: As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he
text: sees Violet (now obviously a little sex machine) come toward

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: (calling upstairs)

dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: Okay, Mom.
text: She goes up the stairs. Pop is smiling and poking his plate.
text: A commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare

text: deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Here's a present for you, Pop.
text: Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns
text: with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down
dialog: and have dinner.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I've eaten.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Well, aren't you going to finish

speaker_heading: HARRY
text: I don't care. It's George's tux.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Annie, I'm in love with you. There's

text: As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny.
text: She screams. The noise is cut off by the swinging door. George
text: and his mother sit down at the table.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Pop, can I have the car? I'm going

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What plates?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats

dialog: As she goes:

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm going to miss you, too, Pop.
dialog: What's the matter? You look tired.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Oh, I had another tussle with Potter
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: I thought when we put him on the
dialog: Board of Directors, he'd ease up on
dialog: us a little bit.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wonder what's eating that old money
dialog: grubbing buzzard anyway?
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and
text: sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his
dialog: soul, if he has one. Hates everybody
dialog: that has anything that he can't have.
dialog: Hates us mostly, I guess.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: The dining room. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen,

speaker_heading: MOTHER

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, Mom. You coming later? You
dialog: coming later, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you mean, and be bored to
dialog: death?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Couldn't want a better death. Lots
dialog: of pretty girls, and we're going to
dialog: use that new floor of yours tonight,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I hope it works.
speaker_heading: POP

speaker_heading: ANNIE

dialog: they need gin?
text: She exits.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Father, did I act like that when I
dialog: graduated from high school?
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Pretty much. You know, George, wish
dialog: we could send Harry to college with
dialog: you. Your mother and I talked it
text: over half the night.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We have that all figured out. You
dialog: see, Harry'll take my job at the
dialog: Building and Loan, work there four
dialog: years, then he'll go.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: He's pretty young for that job.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, no younger than I was.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Maybe you were born older, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: I say, maybe you were born older. I
dialog: suppose you've decided what you're
dialog: going to do when you get out of
dialog: college.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, well, you know what I've always
dialog: talked about  build things... design
dialog: new buildings  plan modern cities 
dialog: all that stuff I was talking about.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Still after that first million before
dialog: you're thirty.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, I'll settle for half that in
dialog: cash.
text: Annie comes in again from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Of course, it's just a hope, but you
dialog: wouldn't consider coming back to the
dialog: Building and Loan, would you?
text: Annie stops serving to hear his answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I...
dialog: (to Annie)
dialog: Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
dialog: Then you'd be more comfortable and
dialog: you could hear everything that's
text: going on.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I would if I thought I'd hear anything
dialog: worth listening to.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You would, huh?
text: She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen.
text: Bailey smiles and turns to George.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: I know it's soon to talk about it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't
text: face being cooped up for the rest of
dialog: my life in a shabby little office.
text: He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean
dialog: that remark, but this business of
dialog: nickels and dimes and spending all
dialog: your life trying to figure out how
dialog: to save three cents on a length of
dialog: pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do
dialog: something big and something important.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You know, George, I feel that in a
dialog: small way we are doing something
dialog: important. Satisfying a fundamental
dialog: urge. It's deep in the race for a
dialog: man to want his own roof and walls
dialog: and fireplace, and we're helping him
dialog: get those things in our shabby little
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (unhappily)
dialog: I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But
dialog: I've been hoarding pennies like a
dialog: miser in order to... Most of my
text: friends have already finished college.
dialog: I just feel like if I don't get away,
dialog: I'd bust.
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: Yes... Yes... You're right, son.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: This town is no place for any man
dialog: unless he's willing to crawl to
dialog: Potter. You've got talent, son. You
dialog: get yourself an education. Then get
dialog: out of here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pop, do you want a shock? I think
dialog: you're a great guy.
text: To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door
dialog: and calls:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, did you hear that, Annie?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Annie listening through glass in door.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I heard it. About time one of you

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd
dialog: give the kids a treat.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Old college graduate now, huh?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright,
dialog: they call me. Well, freshman, looks
dialog: like you're going to make it after
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yep.
text: Sam sees Harry and leaves George in the middle of a gesture.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Harry! You're the guy I want to see.
dialog: Coach has heard all about you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He has?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah. He's followed every game and
dialog: his mouth's watering. He wants me to
dialog: find out if you're going to come
dialog: along with us.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, I gotta make some dough first.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: George, welcome back.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Putting a pool under this floor was

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Dance with her, will you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny
dialog: enough already, with all these kids.
speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: MARTY

scene_heading: CLOSEUP  MARY HATCH
text: She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass
text: of punch in her hand. For the first time, she is wearing an

text: she sees George. For a second she loses her poise, staring
text: at him.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: And the next thing I know, some guy
dialog: came up and tripped me. That's the

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George, staring at Mary.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: ...that race would have been a cinch.
dialog: I tried to find out who it was
dialog: later...
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP  MARY
text: Still staring at George, and smiling.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd

speaker_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP
text: Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: ...what kind of...

speaker_heading: CLOSEUP  FREDDIE
text: Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking
text: daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too

speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: What's the matter, Othello  jealous?
dialog: Did you know there's a swimming pool
dialog: under this floor? And did you know
dialog: that button behind you causes this
dialog: floor to open up? And did you further
dialog: know that George Bailey is dancing
dialog: right over that crack? And I've got
dialog: the key?
text: Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns
text: the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each
text: half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts.
text: Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so
text: engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers
text: and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals
text: an attractive, lighted swimming pool. George and Mary are
text: so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening.
text: Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Beautiful.
text: CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And I told Harry I thought I'd be

dialog: Here, let me hold that old wet dress
dialog: of yours.
text: He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look
text: at each other.
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, why don't you say it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
dialog: How old are you anyway?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Eighteen.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
dialog: you were seventeen.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Too young or too old?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits
dialog: you. Yes, sir, you look a little
dialog: older without your clothes on.
text: Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly
dialog: on:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I mean, without a dress. You look
dialog: older... I mean, younger. You look
dialog: just...
text: In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh-oh...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (holding out her hand)
dialog: Sir, my train, please.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the
dialog: old Granville house.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
scene_heading: MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE
text: It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that
text: once was no doubt resplendent.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No. You see, you make a wish and
dialog: then try and break some glass. You
dialog: got to be a pretty good shot nowadays,
dialog: too.
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of
dialog: romance, that old place. I'd like to
dialog: live in it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: In that place?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
dialog: Now watch... right on the second
dialog: floor there.
scene_heading: MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE
text: George hurls the rock at the house. We hear the SOUND of a
text: window breaking.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair
text: on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What'd you wish, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, not just one wish. A whole
dialog: hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going
dialog: to do tomorrow and the next day and
dialog: the next year and the year after
dialog: that. I'm shaking the dust of this
text: crummy little town off my feet and
dialog: I'm going to see the world. Italy,
text: Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum.
dialog: Then I'm coming back here and go to
dialog: college and see what they know...
dialog: and then I'm going to build things.
dialog: I'm gonna build air fields. I'm
dialog: gonna build skyscrapers a hundred
dialog: stories high. I'm gonna build bridges
dialog: a mile long...
text: As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally
text: stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Are you gonna throw a rock?
scene_heading: MEDIUM LONG SHOT
text: The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more
text: we hear the SOUND of breaking glass.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you
dialog: wish, Mary?
text: Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off
text: down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Buffalo Gals, can't you come out
dialog: tonight...
text: George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: MARY AND GEORGE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: ...can't you come out tonight, can't
dialog: you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals
dialog: can't you come out tonight and dance
text: by the light of the moon.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What'd you wish when you threw that
dialog: rock?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary.
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY
text: They have stopped walking and now face one another.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Come on, tell me.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: If I told you it might not come true.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it you want, Mary? What do
dialog: you want? You want the moon? Just
dialog: say...
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: Full moon shining through the trees.
text: BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ...the word and I'll throw a lasso
dialog: around it and pull it down. Hey,
dialog: that's a pretty good idea. I'll give
dialog: you the moon, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll take it. And then what?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, then you could swallow it and
dialog: it'd all dissolve, see? And the
dialog: moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers
dialog: and your toes, and the ends of your
dialog: hair.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: Am I talking too much?
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH OF HOUSE
text: As George finishes talking, he jumps up out of his chair:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead
dialog: of talking her to death?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How's that?
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Why don't you kiss her instead of
dialog: talking her to death?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Want me to kiss her, huh?
text: CLOSE SHOT  PORCH OF HOUSE
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong
dialog: people.
text: As he speaks, the man leaves the porch and goes into his
text: house, slamming the front door.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come
dialog: on back out here, and I'll show you
dialog: some kissing that'll put hair back
dialog: on your head. What are you...
text: Mary runs off scene. George has been once more standing on
text: the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Mary...
text: He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe. He
text: cannot see her anywhere.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay, I give up. Where are you?
text: CLOSEUP  BUSH AT EDGE OF SIDEWALK
text: We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Over here in the hydrangea bushes.
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY
text: George walks toward the bush.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Here you are. Catch.
text: He is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Wait a minute. What am I doing? This
dialog: is a very interesting situation.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (from the bushes)
dialog: Please give me my robe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hmm... A man doesn't get in a
dialog: situation like this every day.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: I'd like to have my robe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
text: Mary thrashes around in the bushes. We hear her say:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ouch!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Gesundheit. This requires a little
dialog: thought here.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (getting mad)
dialog: George Bailey! Give me my robe!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I've heard about things like this,
dialog: but I've never...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Shame on you. I'm going to tell your
dialog: mother on you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, my mother's way up the corner
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: I'll call the police.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: They're way downtown. They'd be on
dialog: my side, too.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm going to scream!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's
dialog: see. No, the point is, in order to
dialog: get this robe... I've got it! I'll
dialog: make a deal with you, Mary.
text: Headlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile
text: drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: George! George! Come on home, quick!
dialog: Your father's had a stroke!
text: George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, George, let's hurry.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you get a doctor?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Yes, Campbell's there now.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP  THE HYDRANGEA BUSH

scene_heading: EXT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN SIGN OVER ENTRANCE
scene_heading: INT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE  DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  DIRECTORS MEETING
text: There are about twelve directors seated around a long table.
dialog: They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr.
text: Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate
text: salesman, etc. Prominently seated among them is Henry F.
text: Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George
text: are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is
text: Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on
dialog: which they have been reporting. Before each of the directors
dialog: there are individual reports for them to study.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: I think that's all we'll need you
dialog: for, George. I know you're anxious
dialog: to make a train.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: I want the Board to know that George
dialog: gave up his trip to Europe to help
dialog: straighten things out here these
dialog: past few months. Good luck to you
dialog: at school, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: Now we come to the real purpose of
dialog: this meeting  to appoint a successor
dialog: to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my
dialog: real purpose.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Wait just a minute now.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Wait for what? I claim this
dialog: institution is not necessary to this
dialog: town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I
dialog: make a motion to dissolve this
dialog: institution and turn its assets and
text: liabilities over to the receiver.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: George, you hear what that buzzard...
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after
dialog: Peter Bailey's death to discuss
text: chloroforming the Building and Loan.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Peter Bailey died three months ago.
dialog: I second Mr. Potter's motion.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: Very well. In that case I'll ask the
text: two executive officers to withdraw.
text: Dr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy
text: start to collect their papers and leave the table.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: But before you go, I'm sure the whole
dialog: board wishes to express its deep
text: sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thank you very much.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: It was his faith and devotion that
dialog: are responsible for this organization.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I'll go further than that. I'll say
dialog: that to the public Peter Bailey was
dialog: the Building and Loan.
text: Everyone looks at him surprised.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (trying to control
dialog: himself)
dialog: Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from
dialog: you, considering that you probably
text: drove him to his grave.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Peter Bailey was not a business man.
dialog: That's what killed him. Oh, I don't
dialog: mean any disrespect to him, God rest
dialog: his soul. He was a man of high
dialog: ideals, so-called, but ideals without
dialog: common sense can ruin this town.
dialog: (picking up papers
dialog: from table)
dialog: Now, you take this loan here to Ernie
dialog: Bishop... You know, that fellow that
text: sits around all day on his brains in
dialog: his taxi. You know... I happen to
dialog: know the bank turned down this loan,
dialog: but he comes here and we're building
dialog: him a house worth five thousand
dialog: dollars. Why?
text: George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and
text: papers, ready to leave.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
dialog: You have all the papers there. His
dialog: salary, insurance. I can personally
dialog: vouch for his character.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: A friend of yours?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: You see, if you shoot pool with some
dialog: employee here, you can come and borrow
dialog: money. What does that get us? A
text: discontented, lazy rabble instead of
dialog: a thrifty working class. And all
text: because a few starry-eyed dreamers
dialog: like Peter Bailey stir them up and
dialog: fill their heads with a lot of
dialog: impossible ideas. Now, I say...
text: George puts down his coat and comes around to the table,
text: incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Just a minute  just a minute. Now,
dialog: hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right
dialog: when you say my father was no business
dialog: man. I know that. Why he ever started
dialog: this cheap, penny-ante Building and
dialog: Loan, I'll never know. But neither
dialog: you nor anybody else can say anything
dialog: against his character, because his
dialog: whole life was... Why, in the twenty-
dialog: five years since he and Uncle Billy
dialog: started this thing, he never once
dialog: thought of himself. Isn't that right,
dialog: Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough
dialog: money to send Harry to school, let
dialog: alone me. But he did help a few people
dialog: get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
dialog: And what's wrong with that? Why...
dialog: Here, you're all businessmen here.
dialog: Doesn't it make them better citizens?
dialog: Doesn't it make them better customers?
dialog: You... you said... What'd you say
dialog: just a minute ago?... They had to
dialog: wait and save their money before
dialog: they even ought to think of a decent
dialog: home. Wait! Wait for what? Until
text: their children grow up and leave
dialog: them? Until they're so old and broken-
dialog: down that they... Do you know how
dialog: long it takes a working man to save
dialog: five thousand dollars? Just remember
dialog: this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble
dialog: you're talking about... they do most
dialog: of the working and paying and living
dialog: and dying in this community. Well,
dialog: is it too much to have them work and
dialog: pay and live and die in a couple of
dialog: decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my
dialog: father didn't think so. People were
dialog: human beings to him, but to you, a
dialog: warped, frustrated old man, they're
dialog: cattle. Well, in my book he died a
dialog: much richer man than you'll ever be!
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I'm not interested in your book. I'm
text: talking about the Building and Loan.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know very well what you're talking
dialog: about. You're talking about something
dialog: you can't get your fingers on, and
dialog: it's galling you. That's what you're
dialog: talking about, I know.
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: Well, I've said too much. I... You're
dialog: the Board here. You do what you want
dialog: with this thing. Just one thing more,
dialog: though. This town needs this measly
dialog: one-horse institution if only to
dialog: have some place where people can
dialog: come without crawling to Potter.
dialog: Come on, Uncle Billy!
text: George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy.
text: Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man"
text: remark was gall in his veins.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Sentimental hogwash! I want my
dialog: motion...
text: He is interrupted by a babble of talk, as the directors take
dialog: up the argument
scene_heading: INT. OUTER OFFICE  BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: George, visibly shaken, is busy with his bag, his papers. He
text: is worried about the outcome of the meeting. Dissolving the
text: Building and Loan will alter his plans. Uncle Billy follows
text: him around, chattering.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him,
dialog: George, old boy. You shut his big
dialog: mouth.
dialog: (to Cousin Tilly and
dialog: Cousin Eustace)
dialog: You should have heard him.
speaker_heading: COUSIN EUSTACE
dialog: What happened? We heard a lot of
text: yelling.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Well, we're being voted out of
dialog: business after twenty-five years.
dialog: Easy come, easy go.
speaker_heading: COUSIN TILLY
dialog: (reading a newspaper)
dialog: Here it is, "Help Wanted  Female."

text: Ernie is in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ERNIE

scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND THE OTHERS
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: Yeah, I'll be right down.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Hey, you'll miss your train. You're
dialog: a week late for school already. Go
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (indicating Board
dialog: room)
dialog: I wonder what's going on in there?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Oh, never mind. Don't worry about
dialog: that. They're putting us out of
dialog: business. So what? I can get another
dialog: job. I'm only fifty-five.
speaker_heading: COUSIN TILLY
dialog: Fifty-six!
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Go on  go on. Hey, look, you gave
dialog: up your boat trip, now you don't
dialog: want to miss college too, do you?
text: Dr. Campbell comes running out, all excited.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: George! George! They voted Potter
dialog: down! They want to keep it going!
text: Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly and Uncle Billy cheer wildly.
text: Dr. Campbell and George shake hands.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Whoopee!
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: But they've got one condition  only
dialog: one condition.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What's that?
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: That's the best part of it. They've
dialog: appointed George here as executive
text: secretary to take his father's place.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: You can keep him on. That's all right.
dialog: As secretary you can hire anyone you
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: Dr. Campbell, now let's get this
dialog: thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm
dialog: leaving right now. I'm going to
dialog: school. This is my last chance. Uncle
dialog: Billy here, he's your man.
scene_heading: DR. CAMPBELL
dialog: But, George, they'll vote with Potter
dialog: otherwise.

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY

dialog: (to Ruth)
dialog: What's a pretty girl like you doing
dialog: marrying this two-headed brother of
dialog: mine?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Well, I'll tell you. It's purely

speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (as he moves off)
dialog: Oh, he gets you and a job? Well,
text: Harry's cup runneth over.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: George... about that job. Ruth spoke
dialog: out of turn. I never said I'd take
dialog: it. You've been holding the bag here
dialog: for four years, and... well, I won't

dialog: ever talks about.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Ruth, this... what about this job?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, well, my father owns a glass

dialog: Harry started in the research
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is it a good job?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a
dialog: good future, you know. Harry's a

speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Old Building and Loan pal, huh...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now you just turn this way and go

speaker_heading: GEORGE

scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: Hmmm?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: Well, she's not crazy about him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, how do you know? Did she discuss

scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well then, how do you know?
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why,

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: And besides, Sam Wainwright's away

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And all's fair in love and war?
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: (primly)
dialog: I don't know about war.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mother, you know, I can see right
dialog: through you  right back to your
dialog: back collar button... trying to get
dialog: rid of me, huh?
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: They kiss. Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: Building and Loan pal, I think I'll
dialog: go out and find a girl and do a little

scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY

speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Violet is locking up for the night. A couple of men are

scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND VIOLET
speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hello, Vi.
text: He looks her over. Violet takes her beauty shop seriously

text: continues on down the street with him.
scene_heading: CLOSE MOVING SHOT  GEORGE AND VIOLET
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What gives?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: VIOLET

text: He is silent for a moment, then blurts out:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes... what are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (feigned surprise)
dialog: Not a thing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night

speaker_heading: VIOLET

dialog: Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Let's go out in the fields and take
dialog: off our shoes and walk through the
dialog: grass.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Then we can go up to the falls. It's
text: beautiful up there in the moonlight,
dialog: and there's a green pool up there,
dialog: and we can swim in it. Then we can
dialog: climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the
text: pines, and watch the sunrise against
dialog: the peaks, and... we'll stay up there
dialog: the whole night, and everybody'll be
dialog: talking and there'll be a terrific
dialog: scandal...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: George, have you gone crazy? Walk in
dialog: the grass in my bare feet? Why, it's
text: ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Shhh...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: You think just because you...
text: By this time a small crowd has collected to watch the above
text: scene. Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and
text: George is trying to quiet her. Finally:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay, just forget about the whole
dialog: thing.
text: As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter, and we
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He stares
text: meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking

text: back again.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM WINDOW  HATCH HOME  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back
dialog: and forth.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What are you doing, picketing?
text: George stops, startled, and looks up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hello, Mary. I just happened to be
text: passing by.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up
dialog: your mind?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Have you made up your mind?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: About coming in. Your mother just

scene_heading: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM LONG SHOT

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: MARY

text: Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes
text: her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs
text: into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel.
scene_heading: INSERT: THE SKETCH
text: It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the
text: moon. Lettering on the drawing says: "George Lassos The
dialog: Moon."
dialog: BACK TO SHOT

text: stands there waiting for George.
scene_heading: INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: George is struggling with the gate  he finally kicks it
text: open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, are you coming in or aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I'll come in for a minute, but
dialog: I didn't tell anybody I was coming
dialog: over here.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Mary and George are in the entrance hall.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tuesday.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where'd you get that dress?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you like it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's all right. I thought you'd go
text: back to New York like Sam and Ingie,
text: and the rest of them.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, I worked there for a couple of
dialog: vacations, but I don't know... I
dialog: guess I was homesick.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Homesick? For Bedford Falls?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, and my family and... oh,
dialog: everything. Would you like to sit
dialog: down?
text: They go through the doorway into the parlor.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: All right, for a minute. I still
dialog: can't understand it though. You know
dialog: I didn't tell anybody I was coming
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Would you rather leave?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, I don't want to be rude.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, then, sit down.
text: George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a
text: close look at it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (indicating cartoon)
dialog: Some joke, huh?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George and Mary sitting on the divan. He is uncomfortable,

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I see it still smells like
dialog: pine needles in here.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thank you.
text: There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing
text: with the phonograph record which has been playing all through
dialog: the above scene:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "And dance by the light..."
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah...
text: He looks at his watch, as though about to leave.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: It was nice about your brother Harry,
dialog: and Ruth, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't you like her?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, of course I like her. She's a
dialog: peach.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, it's just marriage in general
dialog: you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
speaker_heading: GEORGE

scene_heading: MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

scene_heading: MRS. HATCH

speaker_heading: MARY

dialog: gets hold of this Building and Loan

dialog: house built in this town. He's already
dialog: got charge of the bank. He's got
dialog: the bus line. He's got the department
dialog: stores. And now he's after us. Why?
dialog: Well, it's very simple. Because we're

dialog: why. And because he wants to keep
dialog: you living in his slums and paying
dialog: the kind of rent he decides.
text: The people are still trying to get out, but some of them

dialog: you for that broken-down shack?

dialog: have let you keep it?
dialog: (turns to address the

dialog: Can't you understand what's happening
dialog: here? Don't you see what's happening?
dialog: Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying!
dialog: And why? Because we're panicky and
text: he's not. That's why. He's picking
dialog: up some bargains. Now, we can get
dialog: through this thing all right. We've

scene_heading: INT. POTTER'S OFFICE  DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George.
text: The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr.
dialog: Potter.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: You like it? I'll send you a box.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Well, I... I suppose I'll find out
dialog: sooner or later, but just what exactly
dialog: did you want to see me about?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: George, now that's just what I like
dialog: so much about you.
dialog: (pleasantly and
dialog: smoothly)
dialog: George, I'm an old man, and most
dialog: people hate me. But I don't like
dialog: them either, so that makes it all
dialog: even. You know just as well as I do
dialog: that I run practically everything in
dialog: this town but the Bailey Building
dialog: and Loan. You know, also, that for a
dialog: number of years I've been trying to
dialog: get control of it... or kill it. But
dialog: I haven't been able to do it. You
dialog: have been stopping me. In fact, you
dialog: have beaten me, George, and as anyone
dialog: in this county can tell you, that
dialog: takes some doing. Take during the
dialog: depression, for instance. You and I
dialog: were the only ones that kept our
dialog: heads. You saved the Building and
dialog: Loan, and I saved all the rest.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes. Well, most people say you stole
dialog: all the rest.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: The envious ones say that, George,
dialog: the suckers. Now, I have stated my
dialog: side very frankly. Now, let's look
dialog: at your side. Young man, twenty-
dialog: seven, twenty-eight... married,
dialog: making, say... forty a week.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: Forty-five!
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which,
dialog: after supporting your mother, and
dialog: paying your bills, you're able to
dialog: keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child
dialog: or two comes along, and you won't
dialog: even be able to save the ten. Now,
dialog: if this young man of twenty-eight
dialog: was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd
dialog: say he was doing fine. But George
dialog: Bailey is not a common, ordinary
dialog: yokel. He's an intelligent, smart,
text: ambitious young man  who hates his
dialog: job  who hates the Building and
dialog: Loan almost as much as I do. A young
dialog: man who's been dying to get out on
dialog: his own ever since he was born. A
dialog: young man... the smartest one of the
dialog: crowd, mind you, a young man who has
text: to sit by and watch his friends go
dialog: places, because he's trapped. Yes,
text: sir, trapped into frittering his
dialog: life away playing nursemaid to a lot
dialog: of garlic-eaters. Do I paint a
dialog: correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: My point? My point is, I want to
dialog: hire you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: Hire me?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I want you to manage my affairs, run
dialog: my properties. George, I'll start
dialog: you out at twenty thousand dollars a
dialog: year.
text: George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off
text: the sparks from his clothes.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (flabbergasted)
dialog: Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars
dialog: a year?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest
dialog: house in town, buying your wife a
dialog: lot of fine clothes, a couple of
dialog: business trips to New York a year,
dialog: maybe once in a while Europe. You
dialog: wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Would I?
dialog: (looking around
dialog: skeptically)
dialog: You're not talking to somebody else
dialog: around here, are you? You know, this
dialog: is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship
dialog: has just come in  providing he has
dialog: brains enough to climb aboard.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, what about the Building and
dialog: Loan?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid
dialog: of success? I'm offering you a three
dialog: year contract at twenty thousand
dialog: dollars a year, starting today. Is
dialog: it a deal or isn't it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I
dialog: ought to jump at the chance, but
dialog: I... I just... I wonder if it would
dialog: be possible for you to give me twenty-
dialog: four hours to think it over?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and
dialog: talk about it to your wife.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd like to do that.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: In the meantime, I'll draw up the
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: All right, sir.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (offers hand)
dialog: Okay, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (taking his hand)
dialog: Okay, Mr. Potter.
text: As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion.
text: Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that
dialog: moment of physical contact he knows he could never be
text: associated with this man. George drops his hand with a
text: shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (vehemently)
dialog: No... no... no... no, now wait a
dialog: minute, here! I don't have to talk
dialog: to anybody! I know right now, and
dialog: the answer is no! NO! Doggone it!
dialog: (getting madder all
dialog: the time)
dialog: You sit around here and you spin
dialog: your little webs and you think the
dialog: whole world revolves around you and
dialog: your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr.
dialog: Potter! In the... in the whole vast
dialog: configuration of things, I'd say you
dialog: were nothing but a scurvy little
dialog: spider. You...
text: He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside
text: Potter's wheelchair.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ...And that goes for you too!
text: As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr.
text: Potter's secretary in the outer office
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And it goes for you too!

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM  GEORGE AND MARY'S HOUSE  NIGHT

text: or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George
text: comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts,
text: relating to incidents in his past life.
speaker_heading: POTTER'S VOICE
dialog: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest
dialog: house in town. Buying your wife a
dialog: lot of fine clothes, going to New
dialog: York on a business trip a couple of
dialog: times a year. Maybe to Europe once
dialog: in a while.
text: George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser
text: and stares at his reflection in the mirror.
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: I know what I'm going to do tomorrow
dialog: and the next day and next year and
dialog: the year after that. I'm shaking the
dialog: dust of this crummy little town off
dialog: my feet, and I'm going to see the
dialog: world... And I'm going to build
dialog: things. I'm going to build air fields.
dialog: I'm going to build skyscrapers a
dialog: hundred stories high. I'm going to
text: build a bridge a mile long.
text: While the above thoughts are passing through George's head,
text: his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the
dialog: dresser:
scene_heading: INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALL
text: It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first
text: saw in Mary's living room. The lettering reads: "George Lassos
dialog: The Moon."
speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE
dialog: What is it you want, Mary? You want
dialog: the moon? If you do, just say the
dialog: word; I'll throw a lasso around it
dialog: and pull it down for you.
text: Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Buffalo Gals, won't you come out
dialog: tonight, won't you come out tonight,

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary Hatch, why in the world did you
dialog: ever marry a guy like me?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: To keep from being an old maid.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You could have married Sam Wainwright
dialog: or anybody else in town.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I didn't want to marry anybody else
dialog: in town. I want my baby to look like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You didn't even have a honeymoon. I
dialog: promised you...
dialog: (does a double take)
dialog: ...Your what?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My baby.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY

speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (sobbing)

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (screaming at him)
dialog: Where's that money, you stupid, silly

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's what it means! One of us is
dialog: going to jail! Well, it's not going

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it, a sore throat or what?
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The doctor? Was the doctor here?
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Gosh, it's this old house. I don't

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: GEORGE

scene_heading: INT. ZUZU'S BEDROOM  NIGHT
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same

speaker_heading: ZUZU

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: All right, all right. Here, give
dialog: Daddy the flower. I'll give it a

speaker_heading: ZUZU
dialog: Look, Daddy... paste it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste
dialog: this together.

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: There it is, good as new.
speaker_heading: ZUZU
dialog: Give the flower a drink.

speaker_heading: ZUZU

speaker_heading: ZUZU

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know  I know, but you just go to
dialog: sleep, and then you can dream about
dialog: it, and it'll be a whole garden.
speaker_heading: ZUZU
dialog: It will?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is that Zuzu's teacher?
speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch? This is
dialog: George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.
dialog: Say, what kind of a teacher are you
dialog: anyway? What do you mean sending
dialog: her home like that, halfnaked? Do
dialog: you realize she'll probably end up
dialog: with pneumonia on account of you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: George!
text: She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off.
text: She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is
dialog: really a tirade against the world, against life itself,
text: against God. Over the phone we hear Mrs. Welch's voice
text: sputtering with protest.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is this the sort of thing we pay
dialog: taxes for  to have teachers like
dialog: you? Silly, stupid, careless people
dialog: who send our kids home without any
dialog: clothes on? You know, maybe my kids
dialog: aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe

scene_heading: MR. WELCH'S VOICE

text: George hears this and grabs the receiver from Mary.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Mary)
dialog: Wait a minute.
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Hello? Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch?
dialog: Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Gives
dialog: me a chance to tell you what I really
dialog: think of your wife.
text: Mary once more tries to take the phone from him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: George...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (raving at her)
dialog: Will you get out and let me handle

dialog: (into phone  shouting)
dialog: Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will,
dialog: huh? Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you
dialog: think you're man enough... Hello?
dialog: Any...
text: But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear
text: a click on the phone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh...
text: He hangs up the receiver, and turns toward the living room.
text: His face is flushed and wet.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah"?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: How should I know? What do you think
dialog: I am, a dictionary?
text: He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Tommy, stop that! Stop it!
text: Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

text: he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them
text: into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified.
text: George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (gasping for breath)
dialog: I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I

dialog: sorry. What do you want to know?
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Not that it makes any difference to
dialog: me, but why did you come to me? Why
dialog: don't you go to Sam Wainwright and
dialog: ask him for the money?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: I can't get hold of him. He's in
dialog: Europe.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Well, what about all your other
dialog: friends?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: They don't have that kind of money,
dialog: Mr. Potter. You know that. You're
dialog: the only one in town that can help
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I see. I've suddenly become quite
dialog: important. What kind of security
dialog: would I have, George? Have you got
dialog: any stocks?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of
dialog: any kind?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (pulls out policy)
dialog: I have some life insurance, a fifteen
dialog: thousand dollar policy.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Yes... how much is your equity in
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Five hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Look at you. You used to be so cocky!
dialog: You were going to go out and conquer
dialog: the world! You once called me a
dialog: warped, frustrated old man. What are
dialog: you but a warped, frustrated young
dialog: man? A miserable little clerk crawling
dialog: in here on your hands and knees and
dialog: begging for help. No securities  no
dialog: stocks  no bonds  nothing but a
dialog: miserable little five hundred dollar
dialog: equity in a life insurance policy.
dialog: You're worth more dead than alive.
dialog: Why don't you go to the riff-raff
dialog: you love so much and ask them to let
dialog: you have eight thousand dollar? You
dialog: know why? Because they'd run you out
dialog: of town on a rail... But I'll tell
dialog: you what I'm going to do for you,
text: George. Since the state examiner is
dialog: still here, as a stockholder of the
dialog: Building and Loan, I'm going to swear
dialog: out a warrant for your arrest.
dialog: Misappropriation of funds 
dialog: manipulation  malfeasance...
text: George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up
text: the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: All right, George, go ahead. You
dialog: can't hide in a little town like
dialog: this.
text: George is out of the door by now. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to
dialog: Potter.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Bill? This is Potter.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

text: over the door, and drives off.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: An attractive little roadside tavern, with the name
text: "Martini's" in neon lights on the front wall.
scene_heading: INT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles
text: sparkle. There are Christmas greens and holly decorating
text: the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini
text: himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the
text: checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of
text: festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a
text: public drinking place. George is seated at the bar  he has
dialog: had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.
speaker_heading: MARTINI'S VOICE
dialog: (greeting new customers)
dialog: Merry Christmas. Glad you came.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: How about some of that good spaghetti?
speaker_heading: MARTINI'S VOICE
dialog: We got everything.
text: During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the
text: bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other
text: side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of
text: beer. George is mumbling:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: God... God... Dear Father in Heaven,
dialog: I'm not a praying man, but if you're
dialog: up there and you can hear me, show
text: me the way. I'm at the end of my
dialog: rope. Show me the way, God.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: Are you all right, George? Want
dialog: someone to take you home?
text: George shakes his head. Martini comes over to his side.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Why you drink so much, my friend?
dialog: Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is
dialog: Christmas Eve.
text: The ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts
text: sharply to the name "Bailey."
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Bailey? Which Bailey?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: This is Mr. George Bailey.
text: Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at
text: George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several
text: others rush to pick him up.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (to George)
dialog: And the next time you talk to my
dialog: wife like that you'll get worse. She
dialog: cried for an hour. It isn't enough
dialog: she slaves teaching your stupid kids
dialog: how to read and write, and you have
dialog: to bawl her out...
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You get out of here, Mr. Welch!
text: Mr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money.
speaker_heading: WELCH
dialog: Now wait... I want to pay for my
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Never mind the money. You get out of
dialog: here quick.
speaker_heading: WELCH
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: You hit my best friend. Get out!
text: Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to
text: help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You all right, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: He's gone. Don't worry. His name is
dialog: Welch. He don't come in to my place
dialog: no more.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh  Welch. That's what I get for
dialog: praying.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: The last time he come in here. You
dialog: hear that, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes, you bet.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where's my insurance policy?
dialog: (finds it in pocket)
dialog: Oh, here...
text: He starts for the door.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Oh, no, Please, don't go out this
dialog: way, Mr. Bailey.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm all right.
text: Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm all right.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Please don't go away  please!
text: George opens the door and exits to the street.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling
text: snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the
text: sidewalk of a house. George gets out to look at the damage,
text: and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to
text: shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident.
text: The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George
text: stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up,
text: looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: (with indignation)
dialog: Now look what you did. My
dialog: greatgrandfather planted this tree.
text: George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to
dialog: the man.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Hey, you... Hey, you! Come back here,
dialog: you drunken fool! Get this car out
dialog: of here!
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM LONG SHOT
text: George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck
text: swings around the corner and nearly hits him.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hey, what's the matter with you?
dialog: Look where you're going!
text: The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow
text: catwalk at the railing.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge.
text: The snow is now falling hard.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN from George's angle TO the water, dotted
text: with floating ice, passing under the bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE AT RAILING  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP  GEORGE
text: He stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up
text: his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water,
text: fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as
text: though about to jump.
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water
text: with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from river)
dialog: Help! Help!
text: George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing
text: into the water.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water,
text: and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Help! Help! Help!
scene_heading: EXT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes
text: running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines
text: on the two figures struggling in the water below.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
dialog: The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we
text: have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs
text: hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER
text: George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which
text: his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter
text: underwear. He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at
text: the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the
text: tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved
text: problems. Clarence is standing on the other side of the
text: stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous
text: seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night
text: shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at
text: the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees. The
text: tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them
text: suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but
text: each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or
text: says. Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing
dialog: the tollkeeper.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I didn't have time to get some stylish
dialog: underwear. My wife gave me this on
dialog: my last birthday. I passed away in
dialog: it.
text: The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of
text: it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's
text: attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is
text: hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
text: Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.
dialog: You should read the new book Mark
dialog: Twain's writing now.
text: The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.
speaker_heading: TOLLKEEPER
dialog: How'd you happen to fall in?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I didn't fall in. I jumped in to
dialog: save George.
text: George looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You what? To save me?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go
dialog: through with it, did you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Go through with what?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Suicide.
text: George and the tollkeeper react to this.
speaker_heading: TOLLKEEPER
dialog: It's against the law to commit suicide
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Yeah, it's against the law where I
dialog: come from, too.
speaker_heading: TOLLKEEPER
dialog: Where do you come from?
text: He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next
dialog: statement.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Heaven.
dialog: (to George)
dialog: I had to act quickly; that's why I
dialog: jumped in. I knew if I were drowning
dialog: you'd try to save me. And you see,
dialog: you did, and that's how I saved you.
text: The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually
text: looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (offhand)
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Your lip's bleeding, George.
text: George's hand goes to his mouth.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in
dialog: answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (comes around to George)
dialog: Oh, no  no  no. I'm the answer to
dialog: your prayer. That's why I was sent
dialog: down here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (casually interested)
dialog: How do you know my name?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, I know all about you. I've watched
dialog: you grow up from a little boy.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What are you, a mind reader or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, who are you, then?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Angel, Second Class.
text: The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash.
text: He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on
text: two legs. Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the
text: door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest
dialog: cop.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (to tollkeeper)
dialog: Cheerio, my good man.
text: George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini
dialog: put in those drinks?
text: He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, what's with you? What did you
dialog: say just a minute ago? Why'd you
dialog: want to save me?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: That's what I was sent down for. I'm
dialog: your guardian angel.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Ridiculous of you to think of killing
dialog: yourself for money. Eight thousand
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Yeah... just things like that. Now
dialog: how'd you know that?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I told you  I'm your guardian angel.
dialog: I know everything about you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, you look about like the kind
dialog: of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen
dialog: angel, aren't you? What happened to
dialog: your wings?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I haven't won my wings yet. That's
dialog: why I'm an angel Second Class.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know whether I like it very
text: much being seen around with an angel
dialog: without any wings.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll
dialog: help me, won't you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (humoring him)
dialog: Sure, sure. How?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: By letting me help you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Only one way you can help me. You
dialog: don't happen to have eight thousand
dialog: bucks on you?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, no, no. We don't use money in
dialog: Heaven.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.
dialog: Comes in pretty handy down here,
dialog: bub.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, tut, tut, tut.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I found it out a little late. I'm
text: worth more dead than alive.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Now look, you mustn't talk like that.
dialog: I won't get my wings with that
dialog: attitude. You just don't know all
dialog: that you've done. If it hadn't been
dialog: for you...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
dialog: everybody'd be a lot better off. My
dialog: wife, and my kids and my friends.
dialog: (annoyed with Clarence)
dialog: Look, little fellow, go off and haunt
dialog: somebody else, will you?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: No, you don't understand. I've got
dialog: my job...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: Aw, shut up, will you.
text: Clarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces
text: across the room, thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy.
dialog: (to George)
dialog: So you still think killing yourself
dialog: would make everyone feel happier,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (dejectedly)
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I guess you're
dialog: right. I suppose it would have been
dialog: better if I'd never been born at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I said I wish I'd never been born.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, you mustn't say things like that.
dialog: You...
dialog: (gets an idea)
dialog: ...wait a minute. Wait a minute.
dialog: That's an idea.
text: (glances up toward
dialog: Heaven)
dialog: What do you think? Yeah, that'll do
dialog: it. All right.
dialog: (to George)
dialog: You've got your wish. You've never
dialog: been born.
text: As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside
text: the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the
text: door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (looking upward)
dialog: You don't have to make all that fuss
dialog: about it.
text: As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring
text: his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what
dialog: Clarence has said.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You've never been born. You don't
dialog: exist. You haven't a care in the
dialog: world.
text: George feels his ear as Clarence talks.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: No worries  no obligations  no
dialog: eight thousand dollars to get  no
dialog: Potter looking for you with the
dialog: Sheriff.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE
text: George indicates his bad ear.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Say something else in that ear.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (bending down)
dialog: Sure. You can hear out of it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, that's the doggonedest thing...
dialog: I haven't heard anything out of that
dialog: ear since I was a kid. Must have
dialog: been that jump in the cold water.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Your lip's stopped bleeding, too,
dialog: George.
text: George feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut
text: he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you know about that... What's
dialog: happened?
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: George looks around, as though to
dialog: get his bearings.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?
dialog: What's happened here?
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Come on, soon as these clothes of
dialog: ours are dry...
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Our clothes are dry.
text: George feels the clothes on the line.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you know about that? Stove's
dialog: hotter than I thought. Now, come on,
dialog: get your clothes on, and we'll stroll
dialog: up to my car and get...
text: They start dressing. George interrupts himself.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You haven't got your wings. Yeah,
dialog: that's right.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: This is the same empty street where George's car swerved
text: into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come
text: into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car
text: smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car
text: is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Well, this is where I left my car
dialog: and it isn't here.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You have no car.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, I had a car, and it was right
dialog: here. I guess somebody moved it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  AT CURB
text: The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages
text: under his arm.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: (politely)
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, say... Hey... where's my car?
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My car, my car. I'm the fellow that
dialog: owns the car that ran into your tree.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: What tree?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you mean, what tree? This
dialog: tree. Here, I ran into it. Cut a
text: big gash in the side of it here.
text: The owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then
text: straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: You must mean two other trees. You
dialog: had me worried. One of the oldest
text: trees in Pottersville.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford
dialog: Falls.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: I mean Pottersville.
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Don't you think I know where I live?
dialog: What's the matter with you?
text: The owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely
text: bewildered.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my

dialog: (to Clarence)
dialog: ...or you are!
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: It isn't me!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, maybe I left the car up at

speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful
text: Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking
text: joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People
text: are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the
text: bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the
text: difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up
text: to the bar.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (as they come in)
dialog: That's all right. Go on in. Martini's
dialog: a good friend of mine.
text: Two people leave the bar as they approach.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: There's a place to sit down. Sit
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP
text: Nick is wiping off the bar as they
dialog: sit down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You want a martini?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink
dialog: or don't you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay  all right. Double bourbon,
dialog: quick, huh?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (to Clarence)
dialog: What's yours?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I was just thinking...
text: (face puckers up with
dialog: delicious anticipation)
dialog: It's been so long since I...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Look, mister, I'm standing here
dialog: waiting for you to make up your mind.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (appreciatively)
dialog: That's a good man. I was just thinking
text: of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not
dialog: cold enough for that. Not nearly
dialog: cold enough... Wait a minute...
dialog: wait a minute... I got it. Mulled
text: wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light
dialog: on the cloves. Off with you, me lad,
dialog: and be lively!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks
dialog: in here for men who want to get drunk
dialog: fast. And we don't need any
text: characters around to give the joint
dialog: atmosphere. Is that clear? Or do I
dialog: have to slip you my left for a
dialog: convincer?
text: As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his
text: left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled by
dialog: this conduct.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (to George)
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (soothingly)
dialog: Nick  Nick, just give him the same
dialog: as mine. He's okay.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay.
text: Nick turns away to get the drinks.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What's the matter with him. I never
dialog: saw Nick act like that before.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You'll see a lot of strange things
dialog: from now on.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you
dialog: worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You don't huh? Well, you got any
dialog: money?
text: Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No wonder you jumped in the river.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I jumped in the river to save you so
dialog: I could get my wings.
text: Nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, that's right.
text: A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the
text: SOUND of the bell.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Made what?

dialog: Every time you hear a bell ring, it
dialog: means that some angel's just got his
dialog: wings.
text: George glances up at Nick.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, I think maybe you better not
dialog: mention getting your wings around
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Why? Don't they believe in angels?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (looking at Nick)
dialog: A... Yeah, but... you know...
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Then why should they be surprised
dialog: when they see one?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: He never grew up. He's...
dialog: (to Clarence)
dialog: How old are you, anyway, Clarence?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Two hundred and ninety-three...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: ...next May.
text: Nick slams the bottle down on the counter.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That does it! Out you two pixies go,
dialog: through the door or out the window!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, Nick. What's wrong?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: And that's another thing. Where do
dialog: you come off calling me Nick?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What's that got to do with it? I
dialog: don't know you from Adam's off ox.
dialog: (sees someone come in)
dialog: Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: A small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a
text: broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP  GEORGE
text: He can hardly believe his eyes. It is Gower the druggist.
text: BACK TO SHOT  NICK AT THE BAR
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Gower)
dialog: Didn't I tell you never to come
dialog: panhandling around here?
text: Nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the
text: face with it. The crowd laugh brutally. Gower smiles weakly
text: as the soda runs off his face.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George
dialog: Bailey! Don't you know me?
speaker_heading: GOWER
dialog: No. No.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to his bouncers)
dialog: Throw him out. Throw him out.
text: The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes
text: back to the bar.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick...
dialog: Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You know, that's another reason for
dialog: me not to like you. That rumhead
dialog: spent twenty years in jail for
dialog: poisoning a kid. If you know him,
dialog: you must be a jailbird yourself.
dialog: (to his bouncers)
dialog: Would you show these gentlemen to
text: the door.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Sure. This way, gentlemen.
scene_heading: EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in
dialog: the snow.
scene_heading: INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings!
scene_heading: EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange,
text: puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they
text: landed, looking at each other.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You see, George, you were not there
dialog: to stop Gower from putting that poison
dialog: into the...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you mean, I wasn't there? I
dialog: remember distinctly...
text: George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with
text: the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE"
text: instead of "MARTINI'S."
text: George and Clarence get to their feet.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: What the... hey, what's going on
dialog: around here? Why, this ought to be
dialog: Martini's place.
text: He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort
text: of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, who are you?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: I told you, George. I'm your guardian
dialog: angel.
text: George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his
text: arm. It's flesh.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.
dialog: What else are you? What... are you a
dialog: hypnotist?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well then, why am I seeing all these
dialog: strange things?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Don't you understand, George? It's
dialog: because you were not born.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You're nobody. You have no identity.
text: George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but
dialog: without success.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you mean, no identity? My
dialog: name's George Bailey.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: There is no George Bailey. You have
dialog: no papers, no cards, no driver's
dialog: license, no 4-F card, no insurance
dialog: policy...
dialog: (he says these things
dialog: as George searches
dialog: for them)
text: George looks in his watch pocket.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: They're not there, either.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
text: Zuzu's petals.
text: George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You've been given a great gift,
dialog: George. A chance to see what the
dialog: world would be like without you.
text: George is completely befuddled.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute
dialog: here. As, this is some sort of a
dialog: funny dream I'm having here. So long,
dialog: mister, I'm going home.
text: He starts off. Clarence rises.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Home? What home?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Now shut up! Cut it out! You're...
dialog: you're... you're crazy! That's what
dialog: I think... you're screwy, and you're
dialog: driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing
dialog: things. I'm going home and see my
dialog: wife and family. Do you understand
dialog: that? And I'm going home alone!
text: George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him,
text: glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, I didn't have a drink!
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
text: MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE
text: The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville."
text: George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street
text: toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH
text: him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where
text: before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become
text: in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS
text: of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and
text: the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority
text: of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque
text: house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment,
dialog: and so on.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George stops before what used to be the offices of the
text: Building and Loan. There is a garish electric sign over the
text: entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people
text: are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and
text: dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw
text: into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey... hey. Where did the Building
dialog: and Loan move to?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: The Building and what?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: The Bailey Building and Loan. It was
dialog: up there.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: They went out of business years ago.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP
text: George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as
text: a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, Violet!
dialog: (to the cop)
dialog: Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I know. I know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know that girl!
text: The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees
text: Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, Ernie  Ernie!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (a much harder Ernie)
dialog: Where do you live?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't
dialog: you start pulling that stuff. You
dialog: know where I live. Three-twenty
dialog: Sycamore. Now hurry up.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
text: All right. He pulls down the flag
text: on the meter and starts the cab.
scene_heading: INT. CAB  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ERNIE
text: Ernie is puzzled by the stranger.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look here, Ernie, straighten me out
dialog: here. I've got some bad liquor or
dialog: something. Listen to me now. Now,
dialog: you are Ernie Bishop, and you live
dialog: in Bailey Park with your wife and
dialog: kid? That's right, isn't it?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: You seen my wife?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Seen your wife? I've been to your
dialog: house a hundred times.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Look, bud, what's the idea? I live
dialog: in a shack in Potter's Field and my
dialog: wife ran away three years ago and
dialog: took the kid... And I ain't never
dialog: seen you before in my life.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay. Just step on it. Just get me
dialog: home.
text: Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger.
text: As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing
text: beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions
text: to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back.
text: Bert gets into his car and follows.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM LONG SHOT
text: The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops.
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Is this the place?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Of course it's the place.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Well, this house ain't been lived in
dialog: for twenty years.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house.
text: Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof
text: has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges.
text: Like a doomed man, George approaches the house.
scene_heading: EXT. CAB  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and
text: Ernie stand watching George's actions.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What's up, Ernie?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: I don't know, but we better keep an
dialog: eye on this guy. He's bats.
text: Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the
text: beam toward the old house.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike,
text: by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging
text: and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice
text: that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
dialog: Where are you?
text: Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: They're not here, George. You have
dialog: no children.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Where are you?
dialog: (then, to Clarence)
dialog: What have you done with them?
scene_heading: INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand.
text: Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: All right, put up your hands. No
dialog: fast moves. Come on out here, both
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
text: He rushes toward Bert.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Stand back.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bert, what's happened to this house?
dialog: Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Watch him, Bert.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Come on, come on.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with
dialog: you two guys? You were here on my
dialog: wedding night. You, both of you,
dialog: stood out here on the porch and sung
dialog: to us, don't you remember?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Think I'd better be going.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Look, now why don't you be a good
dialog: kid and we'll take you in to a doctor.
dialog: Everything's going to be all right.
text: Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George
text: struggles with him, trying to explain.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will
dialog: you take me over to my mother's house?
dialog: Bert, listen!
dialog: (gesturing to Clarence)
dialog: It's that fellow there  he says
dialog: he's an angel  he's tried to
dialog: hypnotize me.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I hate to do this, fella.
text: Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does
text: so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist,
text: forcing him to let George go.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Run... George! Run, George!
text: George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert
text: grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground,
text: wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on
dialog: Clarence.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Help! Joseph, help!
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Oh, shut up!
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!
text: Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert
text: gets up, amazed by his vanishing.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had
dialog: him right here.
text: Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (stammering)
dialog: I need a drink.
text: He runs out of the scene.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Well, which way'd they go? Help me
dialog: find 'em.
scene_heading: EXT. BAILEY HOME  NIGHT
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George runs up the path to the front door of the house and
text: raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass,
text: when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading:
dialog: "Ma Bailey's Boarding House."
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AT THE DOOR
text: The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but
text: she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In
text: her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold
text: suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him.
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mother...
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: Mother? What do you want?
text: It is a cruel blow to George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mother, this is George. I thought
dialog: sure you'd remember me.
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: George who? If you're looking for a
dialog: room there's no vacancy.
text: She starts to close the door, but George stops her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.
dialog: Something terrible's happened to me.
dialog: I don't know what it is. Something's
dialog: happened to everybody. Please let me
dialog: come in. Keep me here until I get
text: over it.
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: Get over what? I don't take in
dialog: strangers unless they're sent here
dialog: by somebody I know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Well, I know everybody you know.
dialog: Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, sure I do.
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: When'd you see him last?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Today, over at the house.
speaker_heading: MA BAILEY
dialog: That's a lie. He's been in the insane
dialog: asylum ever since he lost his
dialog: business. And if you ask me, that's
dialog: where you belong.
text: She slams the door shut in George's face.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT
scene_heading: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
text: George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out
text: to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features
text: are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see
text: Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his
text: volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Strange, isn't it? Each man's life
dialog: touches so many other lives, and
text: when he isn't around he leaves an
dialog: awful hole, doesn't he?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: (quietly, trying to
dialog: use logic)
dialog: I've heard of things like this. You've
dialog: got me in some kind of a spell, or
dialog: something. Well, I'm going to get
dialog: out of it. I'll get out of it. I
dialog: know how, too. I... the last man I
dialog: talked to before all this stuff
dialog: started happening to me was Martini.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You know where he lives?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sure I know where he lives. He lives
dialog: in Bailey Park.
text: They walk out of scene.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY  NIGHT
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey
text: Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery,
text: with graves where the houses used to be.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.
dialog: All I know is this should be Bailey
dialog: Park. But where are the houses?
text: The two walk into the cemetery.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (as they go)
dialog: You weren't here to build them.
scene_heading: CLOSE MOVING SHOT
text: George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones,
text: Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare
text: with frightened eyes at:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  A TOMBSTONE
text: Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George
text: scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription,
text: and we read: "IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON  HARRY BAILEY 
dialog: 1911-1919"
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CLARENCE
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke
dialog: through the ice and was drowned at
dialog: the age of nine.
text: George jumps up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to
dialog: war! He got the Congressional Medal
dialog: of Honor! He saved the lives of every
dialog: man on that transport.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Every man on that transport died.
dialog: Harry wasn't there to save them
dialog: because you weren't there to save
dialog: Harry. You see, George, you really
dialog: had a wonderful life. Don't you see
dialog: what a mistake it would be to throw
dialog: it away?
scene_heading: CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Clarence...
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Yes, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where's Mary?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Oh, well, I can't...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I don't know how you know these
dialog: things, but tell me  where is she?
text: George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If you know where she is, tell me
dialog: where my wife is.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I'm not supposed to tell.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (becoming violent)
dialog: Please, Clarence, tell me where she
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: You're not going to like it, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
text: She's an old maid. She never married.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (choking him)
dialog: Where's Mary? Where is she?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: She's...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (in self-defense)
text: She's just about to close up the
dialog: library!
text: George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to the
text: ground, where he rubs his neck.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: There must be some easier way for me
dialog: to get my wings.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LIBRARY  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see
text: George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different
text:  no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love
text: of life. Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close
text: to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-
text: satisfied and efficient.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: George, as he watches her.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George and Mary, on the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary!
text: She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary!
text: Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary! Mary!
text: He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a
text: tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary, it's George! Don't you know
dialog: me? What's happened to us?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: I don't know you! Let me go!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to
dialog: me. Please, Mary, help me. Where's
dialog: our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me,
dialog: Mary!
text: Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door
text: she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar.
scene_heading: INT. BLUE MOON  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many
dialog: of the people are the same who were present during the run
text: on the Building and Loan. Mary comes running in, screaming.
text: The place goes into an uproar. George comes in, practically
text: insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Mary...
dialog: (to men holding him)
dialog: Let me go! Mary, don't run away!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Somebody call the police!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: Hit him with a bottle!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: He needs a strait jacket!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (from back of room)
dialog: That man  stop him!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (recognizing some of
dialog: them)
dialog: Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!
text: Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a
text: couple of women at the bar.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Mary!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh, no you don't!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Mary!
text: George can't fight through the men holding him. Desperately
text: he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK  NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his
text: police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into
text: George as he comes out.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Oh, it's you!
text: He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the
text: button, knocking him down, then continues running down the
text: street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun
text: and fires several shots after the fleeing figure.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (to crowd)
dialog: Stand back!
text: Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets
text: off in pursuit of George.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: The same part of the bridge where George was standing before
text: Clarence jumped in. The wind is blowing as it has all through
text: this sequence. George comes running into shot. He is
text: frantically looking for Clarence.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence.
dialog: Get me back. Get me back. I don't
dialog: care what happens to me. Only get me
dialog: back to my wife and kids. Help me,
dialog: Clarence, please! Please! I want to
dialog: live again!
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP
text: George leaning on the bridge railing, praying.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I want to live again. I want to live
dialog: again. Please, God, let me live again.
text: George sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind
text: dies down. A soft, gentle snow begins to fall.
text: CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE SOBBING AT THE RAILING
text: The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert
text: comes into scene.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Hey, George! George! You all right?
text: George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Hey, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll
dialog: hit you again! Get out!
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What the Sam Hill you yelling for,
dialog: George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't... George?
text: George talks hopefully  George touches Bert unbelievingly 
text: George's mouth is bleeding again.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bert, do you know me?

dialog: over.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Isn't it wonderful?
text: The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and
text: smiles. Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets,
text: in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table 
text: pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but
text: lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George.
text: More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of
text: "Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out
text: its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George
text: stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he
text: sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins. Tears
text: course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (emotionally at the
dialog: breaking point)
dialog: Mary did it, George! Mary did it!
dialog: She told a few people you were in

dialog: town collecting money. They didn't
dialog: ask any questions  just said: "If
dialog: George is in trouble  count on me."

dialog: I've been saving this money for a
dialog: divorce, if ever I get a husband.
text: Mr. Partridge, the high school principal, is the next donor.
speaker_heading: PARTRIDGE
dialog: There you are, George. I got the

dialog: Quiet  quiet. Now, this is from
dialog: London.
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop.
dialog: My office instructed to advance you
dialog: up to twenty-five thousand dollars.
dialog: Stop. Heehaw and Merry Christmas.
dialog: Sam Wainwright.
text: The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on
text: top of the pile of money on the table.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Mr. Martini. How about some wine?
text: As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and
text: glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord.
text: She starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the
text: entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS
text: of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are
text: still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter,
text: the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly
text: looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In
text: the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters,
text: accompanied by Bert, the cop.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hello, George, how are you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Harry... Harry...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (as he sees the money)
dialog: Mary  looks like I got here too
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Mary, I got him here from the airport
dialog: as quickly as I could. The fool flew
text: all the way up here in a blizzard.
text: Mrs. Bailey enters scene.
scene_heading: MRS. BAILEY
dialog: Harry, how about your banquet in New
dialog: York?

text: Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my
text: big brother, George. The richest man
dialog: in town!
text: Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie
text: at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld
text: Lang syne," and everyone joins in.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the
text: pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top
text: of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's
text: copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription
dialog: written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure
dialog: who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (looking at book)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's a Christmas present from a
dialog: very dear friend of mine.
text: At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of
text: the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver
text: bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery
text: tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the
dialog: bell.
speaker_heading: ZUZU
dialog: Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every
text: time a bell rings an angel gets his
dialog: wings.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: That's right, that's right.
text: He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Attaboy, Clarence.
