dialog: This is true...
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003)
dialog: 
text: The night is stillborn.
dialog: 
text: Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see
text: are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions
text: of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw
text: huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in
dialog: the dirt...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father
dialog: and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"
text: (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light
text: seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly
text: orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming
text: into this village carrying flaming torches.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming
text: from outside, and suddenly --
dialog: 
text: SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!
dialog: 
text: The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
text: tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
text: (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!
text: Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --
dialog: "Don't shoot!" --
dialog: 
dialog: KAK! KAK! KAK!
dialog: 
text: And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
text: boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
text: free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
dialog: 
text: THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
text: storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
text: into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
text: SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
text: WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
text: of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED
text: PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CHAOS! -- PANDEMONIUM! -- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire --
dialog: 2
dialog: 
text: families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the
dialog: adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the
text: women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled
dialog: together and weeping --
dialog: 
text: -- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to
text: another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled
text: from the group and forced onto her knees...
dialog: 
text: ... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying
text: something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM
text: shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --
dialog: 
text: CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down --
text: blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet --
text: crying -- shaking with fear...
dialog: 
text: ... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the
text: hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and
text: son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him
dialog: now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this
dialog: terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we --

text: OVER A LOUDSPEAKER... TAKING US TO...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - (AUGUST/1998)
dialog: 
text: And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in
text: jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,
text: with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-
dialog: looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is
text: tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark
text: eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRISON RECEIVING AND RELEASING - DAY
dialog: 
text: We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal
text: affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a
text: watch, some silver rings and a lighter.
dialog: 
text: He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile --

dialog: Ya'll go fuck yourself now, k?

scene_heading: EXT. PRISON - DAY
dialog: 
text: A beat-up CHEVY VEGA parked at the curb. Sam's wife, LYNN, 30's, in

dialog: 
text: Sam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees
text: him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hey baby.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT SIDE OF ROAD/INT. LYNN'S CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the
dialog: back. There's nothing tender about what we're watching here. Sam

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Gimme a smoke.

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Don't got any.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Vega pulls up to a beat-to-shit single-wide and Sam and Lynn get
text: out. We see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads,
dialog: "Welcome Home Daddy!"
dialog: 
text: And now Sam's daughter PAIGE (6) bursts out of the trailer and down
text: the steps... Followed by Sam's mother, DAISY, mid 60's, comes out of
dialog: the trailer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAIGE

text: passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell.
dialog: 
text: Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight

text: quietly goes outside without saying a word.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Sam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - RURAL UGANDA - DAY
dialog: 
text: A dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every
text: direction... and we see a BRIGHT YELLOW BUS speeding toward us in
text: the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air...
text: and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof,
text: hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road...

scene_heading: INT. BUS - DRIVING - RURAL UGANDA - SAME
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They always drive this fast?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Traveling is the most dangerous time in

dialog: 
text: An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to
dialog: connect here, but Deng is reticent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You got kids, Deng?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: No. I have no children.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where you from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: A little village called Aweil. Many hours
dialog: from here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's where your family is?
dialog: 
dialog: And Deng simply says...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: My family was killed by LRA.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Unyama is about two hours from here. We
dialog: will stop there for lunch.
dialog: 30
dialog: 
text: Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching

text: this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY
dialog: 
text: A dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of
dialog: each other.
dialog: 
dialog: Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly
text: colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant
text: cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some
text: with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The
text: poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming.
dialog: 
text: And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: The Muslim North has tried to kill the

scene_heading: EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY
dialog: 
text: A row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area.

dialog: who are most desperately ill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there

speaker_heading: SPLA SOLDIER 1
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)

speaker_heading: DENG
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)

speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Course, do what you gotta do.
dialog: 
text: Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of
text: humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid
text: workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One
text: of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's --
dialog: her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without
text: Borders. She sees Sam across the tent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
dialog: Excuse me. You. Can you help please?
dialog: 
dialog: Sam moving to her --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to transfer her to the bed. Get
dialog: her shoulders...
dialog: 
text: Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid
dialog: worker gets her feet...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE (CONT'D)
dialog: One, two, three...
dialog: 
text: And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer
text: piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls
text: away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off
dialog: of her face...
dialog: 
text: ... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her.
text: Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked
text: by what he's seen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What happened to her face?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
text: The rebels cut off her lips because she
dialog: argued. These are Kony's orders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who's Kony?
dialog: 
text: Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
dialog: Who are you with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm with Deng over there.
dialog: 32
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
dialog: What organization are you with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Working with a Christian group down
dialog: South. Just up here takin a look around,
dialog: seein a bit of the country.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
dialog: This isn't a tourist destination, this is
dialog: a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll
dialog: be killed.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Thank you for your help.

scene_heading: EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A stale room with two cots, bare, institutional. Deng on the edge of

text: the empty street below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A
dialog: shapeshifter. He calls himself a
dialog: Christian...
dialog: 
text: He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a
dialog: cigarette...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
dialog: ... but I say he is Satan, who devours

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Kony is the leader of the LRA?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: He is the one we have been fighting for
dialog: years. But there is very little we can
dialog: do. Our weapons are old, and our boots

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you here?

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: S'cuse me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ain't lookin for nuthin.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: And then you will get your picture and go

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT/EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette... and suddenly
text: we hear voices... through the open window... children's voices...
text: Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty
text: streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like
text: apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying
text: bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk...
text: laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then
dialog: more... fifty... a hundred...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NUMILE, SUDAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Deng steps onto the balcony next to Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
text: They are night commuters. They come from
text: deep in the bush. Their parents send them
dialog: out because it is safer to sleep here
dialog: than in their own homes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Because death comes at night in the
dialog: villages and refugee camps.
dialog: 
dialog: And we continue to watch this great migration of children... now
text: streaming into this town... a few of them finding a dark corner just
text: below us... unrolling their reed mats... huddling up against each
dialog: other for the long night...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
dialog: These are the lucky one so far. The ones

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em

text: more children, but Deng stops him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Sam, there are too many...
dialog: 
text: And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we
dialog: thought... hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
dialog: ... you can't help them all.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can help these here.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DENG
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: Settle down... it's alright... you can
dialog: sleep here till morning...
dialog:

dialog: particular BOY in this group... maybe 8 years old... wearing bright
text: GREEN SHORTS... and we watch as he and his SISTER move to a corner
text: of the room and unroll their mats...
dialog: 
text: ... and eventually Sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the

speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - RURAL SUDAN - DAY
dialog:

text: dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts...
text: the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of
text: black smoke twisting into the air...
dialog: 
text: ... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass
text: CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters
text: returning to their village... some of them huddled together,
dialog: weeping...
dialog: 36
dialog: 
text: ... and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN
text: SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet
text: masks of fear as they move closer to their home.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - YEI, SUDAN - DAY
dialog: 
text: The pickup arrives and Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers hop out...
dialog: and this is what they see:
dialog: 
text: Complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside
text: smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping
dialog: next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it
text: would smell of burnt flesh and death.
dialog: 
text: Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him...
dialog: 
text: ... and now we see GREEN SHORTS and his sister arriving at the
dialog: village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their
text: mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the
text: sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN
text: SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents --
dialog: and suddenly --
dialog: 
text: MOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet...
text: darting into the open... running across the dirt... GREEN SHORTS
text: going after it, yelling his name...
dialog: 
text: Sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of
dialog: sight...
dialog: 
dialog: ... for a moment...
dialog:

speaker_heading: BOOOOM!

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - YEI, SUDAN - DAY
dialog:

text: cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with
dialog: surprise...
dialog: 
text: ... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy
text: into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a
text: terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a
text: fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds
dialog: this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage
dialog: world...
dialog: 
text: ... and as Sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment...
text: and we see him looking up to the heavens...
dialog: 37
dialog: 
text: tears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but
dialog: it's a promise... to God...
dialog: 
dialog: To save the children of Sudan.

text: the other side... their happy, expectant faces...
dialog: 
text: But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden...
text: watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this
dialog: moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same
dialog: way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on
dialog: the side of road in Yei...
dialog: 
text: ... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door
text: and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Well I figured I was done for, so I sat
dialog: down under an old tree with this useless

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: ... and then the strangest thing
dialog: happened. Them boys ran right on past me.
dialog: Didn't even see me sittin there. Now the

dialog: that shotgun instead of this here Bible.
dialog: And that's probably the first time I can

speaker_heading: SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: ... I'm comin home.
dialog: 
text: And we're watching her here, clocking the resignation in his voice.
text: A moment of quiet for both of them. Lynn sensing the dimensions of

scene_heading: EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: BEGIN SEQUENCE. Giving us a sense that many months are passing.
dialog: 
text: -- Sam and a crew of VILLAGE MEN hauling the charred remnants of
text: tukuls and burned building out of the compound on their backs.
dialog: 
dialog: -- The remainder of the bamboo fence that once surrounded the
text: orphanage being torn down.
dialog: 
text: -- Nineteen, Marco, A.J. and a few other SPLA soldiers cutting the
text: bush away from the edge of the compound with machetes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Cut it all down... so they got nowhere to
dialog: hide...
dialog:

speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: How far?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: All the way around...
dialog:

text: surrounding the compound with heavy gage CHAINLINK FENCE.
dialog: 
text: -- New DORMS being built from brick. An INFIRMARY. A MESS HALL.
text: SOLDIER'S BARRACKS. And finally, Sam laying the last brick on the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A simple administrative office with a short-wave radio and sat

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Come on in...
dialog: 
text: The door opens and we see Deng.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Preacher, you need to come see this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam following Deng to the center of the compound where we see 5 or 6
text: camp women (including Betty and Rose) dressed in colorful robes and
text: headdresses. Maybe 80 children here, quietly sitting in the dirt,
text: watching the women. Nineteen, Marco, A.J. and the rest of the SPLA
text: soldiers here too, watching from the side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's goin on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: The Acholi people were farmers before
dialog: they were driven from their ancestral
dialog: homeland. Each year they blessed the soil
text: before a planting.
dialog: 
text: And now the women begin to move in unison... singing an ancient
text: Acholi song as one of the older orphan boys beats a small drum in
dialog: accompaniment...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TRANSLATING)
dialog: They are saying that fire brings strength
dialog: and ashes abundance...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TRANSLATING)
dialog: ... when the land burns, the next year

speaker_heading: BETTY
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: The children are your fields...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
speaker_heading: (TRANSLATING)
dialog: ... she says you are a farmer and these
dialog: children are your crops...
dialog: 59
dialog: 
text: Sam looking to the 80 little orphans watching this from the side...
text: and now Betty bends down and scoops up a bit of ashen earth and runs
text: her finger across his forehead, blessing him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: ... and this ground will grow them tall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: ... and this ground is richer now and

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Days later and we see Sam here with Nineteen and a few other SPLA
text: soldiers, eating lunch, trying to learn their language. And it's
text: humorous to these guys as Sam tries to pronounce some words in
dialog: Arabic...
dialog: 
text: And suddenly we hear YELLING coming from outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam coming out fast, sees soldiers pulling open the front gate as
text: THREE pickup trucks speed into the compound -- SPLA military trucks -
text: - skidding to a stop.
dialog: 
text: Sam rushing over as soldiers help two YOUNG BOYS out of one of the
text: trucks. Both are around 5 years old, injured and crying. And then a
text: third child is lifted out in a makeshift stretcher -- this is ALICE -
text: - 10 years old -- her broken body limp and bleeding profusely --
text: mumbling something to herself in Arabic over-and-over again --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: -- DOORS BANGING OPEN! -- CONTROLLED CHAOS as the children are
dialog: hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst

text: little girl still mumbling quietly --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is she saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: She is asking what she did wrong?
dialog: 
text: Sam taking Alice's hand in his... very slowly her beautiful eyes
text: open and she sees him... and says something in Arabic...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TRANSLATING)
dialog: She is asking if you are `The Preacher.'
dialog: 60
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: Tell her she's gonna be ok.
dialog: 
text: Betty translates and Alice smiles faintly... and now one of the

scene_heading: EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DUSK
dialog:

text: out. She looks down at them and simply shakes her head...
dialog: 
dialog: And we know Alice is dead.
dialog: 
text: And it looks like a grenade has gone off inside Sam. And suddenly he

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUV - DRIVING - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt.
text: Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding
text: in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the

scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY

scene_heading: INT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LRA JEEP - DRIVING - DAY
dialog: 
text: With two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past
text: bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering
text: wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick
text: smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out
dialog: vision of the road ahead...
dialog: 
text: ... and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup
text: truck... and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before
dialog: coming out the other side... and this is what we see --
dialog: 
text: SAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a

dialog: 
text: WHOOOOSH! -- an RPG streaks right at us and DETONATES -- KABOOOOM! --

scene_heading: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 62
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: -- the pickup truck reversing out of the black smoke -- OUT OF

text: the cab -- scrambling for cover behind the truck.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam, Deng, A.J. and the others hustling through the smoke and
text: finding cover. From Sam's vantage point he sees rebels hiding
text: behind the disabled truck for cover -- shooting back -- a withering
text: firefight -- the big .30 cal ROARING offscreen but the truck is
dialog: protecting the rebels -- no clear shot --
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: William and the other child soldiers here with two ADULT REBELS --
text: crouched behind the truck for cover -- the ADULT REBELS returning
text: fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless.
dialog: 
text: William peers around the truck and sees Sam fifty yards away, turns
text: to the boys next to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: It's the white preacher!
dialog: 
text: The other boys reacting, this means something to them. And now one

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADULT REBEL
dialog: STAND UP AND FIGHT!!!
dialog: 
text: And he pops up and returns fire, but the boys don't move.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH - DAY
dialog: 
text: MARCO running through the smoke toward Sam. He hits the ground and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No shot! There are children behind the

dialog: 
text: Marco hears this, ditches the RPG and picks up his AK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Cover me!
dialog: 
text: Marco laying down suppression fire as Sam sprints across the road --
text: advancing on the transport truck -- firing his AK from the hip --
text: bullets zinging past him -- he dives behind a berm and finds himself
text: next to Deng. Neither man says a word as they jam fresh mags into
text: their AK's, gunfire erupting all around them.
dialog: 63
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
dialog: 
text: The adult rebels continue fighting -- alternately popping up from

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADULT REBEL
dialog: Fight you cowards!!!
dialog: 
text: But William and the other boys don't move, and the Adult Rebel keeps

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BERM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam and Deng behind the berm. Sam peers over just as GUNFIRE misses

speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - SAME
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: BA-WHOOOM! --
dialog: 
text: AND OUR VISION EXPLODES TO WHITE
dialog: 
text: For a long beat... only silence... and then slowly the white begins

text: over him... someone stepping into his POV...
dialog: 64
dialog: 
text: it's William, hands held open in surrender, staring curiously at
text: this strange white man laying in the dirt... and now Deng and Marco
text: appear next to Sam and help him to his feet.
dialog: 
text: And we see the battle is over. The remaining child soldiers slowly
text: emerging from behind the LRA truck... laying down their weapons and
text: walking toward Sam... joining William... staring at this white man
text: in front of them...
dialog: 
text: ... William reaches into his pocket and...
dialog: 
text: ... Deng and Marco REACT -- lifting their AK's -- "Don't move! Don't

scene_heading: INT. DORM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The children on their mats in the dark now... quiet... a few of the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're right. We got problems right here.
dialog: But with that kinda money we could feed

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I

speaker_heading: LYNN

dialog: he says...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Stay outta my way.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Seven or eight heavily armed vehicles coming through the gate. Maybe
text: 20 or 30 SPLA soldiers guarding a black SUBURBAN in the middle of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINETEEN
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: It's Garang! -- It's Garang! --
dialog: 
text: Palpable excitement ripples through the compound... Sam's soldiers
text: grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the Suburban
text: as it stops...
dialog: 75
dialog: 
text: ... the back door to the Suburban opens and a black man, dressed in
text: shirtsleeves and slacks, steps out. The same man we saw giving the
dialog: fiery speech on the little outdoor TV in Nimule earlier -- JOHN
speaker_heading: GARANG.
dialog: 
dialog: Sam turns to Deng --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who's this guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: That's our leader.

speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam and Garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: They call you Preacher. Is this what I
dialog: should call you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sam is fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: I hear what you have done for the SPLA
dialog: and I am grateful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We can thank God for his blessins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: Yes, we can. How many children do you
dialog: look after, Sam?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Couple hundred with us here. Feed another
text: thousand a day from nearby villages.
dialog: Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.
dialog: 
text: And they continue through the camp. A few of the children running up
text: to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: What you are doing is noble, but too
dialog: dangerous. I must advise you to stop
dialog: risking your life in our struggle.
dialog: 76
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Until someone starts fightin for these
dialog: children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: You are stubborn, aren't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: As a mule.
dialog: 
text: Garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: You and I come from very different
dialog: worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.
dialog: 
text: And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints
dialog: away giggling...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG (CONT'D)
dialog: I founded the SPLA in order to fight for
dialog: the future of Sudan because nobody else
dialog: would. We fight for freedom from the
dialog: government in Khartoum, for the right to
dialog: vote, and for the right to worship any
dialog: god one may choose.
dialog: 
text: More children running up... Garang touching their heads...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG (CONT'D)
dialog: But most important to me is our struggle
dialog: for the children. Their laughter has been
dialog: lost to this country for far too long.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: There are Peace Talks scheduled for the
dialog: end of August in Naivashu. I'd like you
dialog: to come as my guest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is
dialog: a waste of time. You gotta go out and
dialog: make it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG
dialog: You are correct, but we must fight them
dialog: at every level. Part of my battle is
dialog: waged in those rooms. We must talk of
dialog: peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.
dialog: 
text: Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. Realizing that
text: both of them are warriors in the same fight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe together you and I can make Sudan
dialog: free once again.
dialog: 77
dialog: 
text: And now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle
text: of the compound. Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming
dialog: dark...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARANG (CONT'D)
dialog: There is a cost for freedom, Sam. A price
dialog: for the future of these people. Some pay
dialog: with their lives, others pay in different
dialog: ways.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: My only hope is that your cost is not too
dialog: great.

speaker_heading: PAIGE

speaker_heading: DONNIE

speaker_heading: PAIGE

speaker_heading: DONNIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAIGE
dialog: Never mind, Donnie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Ok.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAIGE
dialog: Dad usually kisses me on the forehead

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Sure I can.
dialog: 
text: And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sweet dreams.
dialog: 
text: And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this
text: through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: And we see Sam, Betty and Rose leading a group of children, their

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Keep em closed! A little bit more!

dialog: Ok, stop! Open your eyes!

speaker_heading: BETTY
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: Open your eyes!
dialog: 
text: And we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something
text: off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at.
dialog: 
text: REVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few
text: see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe.
dialog: 
text: And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like
text: ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something
dialog: we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of
text: laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding
dialog: back.
dialog: 79
dialog: 
text: And now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing
text: around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in
text: Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the
text: bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the
text: bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the
dialog: pegs...
dialog: 
text: And he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears
text: with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he
text: bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile
dialog: on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a
dialog: boy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER
dialog: 
text: Hours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children
text: on the swingset. Deng approaches...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: Some of the child soldiers say there is a
dialog: bounty on your life. That Kony is
dialog: offering money for your nose and ears.
dialog: 
text: Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to assign a few more men to you
dialog: during the day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to
dialog: see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer
dialog: soldiers where they're needed. I can take
dialog: care of myself.
dialog: 
text: Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue.
text: And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the
text: ground by himself, not playing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: He said anything yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
dialog: All we know is that his family was killed
dialog: and that he and his brother were taken
speaker_heading: into the LRA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: DENG

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the

dialog: 
dialog: William, no response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You know sometimes it helps to tell
dialog: somebody what you got locked up inside,
dialog: know what I mean?
dialog: 
text: William, no reaction whatsoever. Something dawning on Sam in this
dialog: moment...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You have no idea what I'm sayin, do you?
dialog: 
text: William just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak
text: English. And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring
text: at the children playing on the playground. And then Sam, feeling the
text: need to unburden himself, begins to talk...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I done a lotta things I ain't proud of.
dialog: Hurt a lotta people. Truth is, helpin you
dialog: kids is about the only good thing I ever
dialog: done in this life.
dialog: 
text: William watching him quietly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: But I'm scared. Scared one day I'll close
dialog: my eyes to all this and make it somebody
dialog: else's problem.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Just like everybody else in this world.

scene_heading: EXT. RAVINE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. SUV - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Deng, tell camp we're comin back with

speaker_heading: DONNIE

speaker_heading: AGNETE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm just tryin to help these people. Same
dialog: as you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
dialog: War upon war does not fix what is broken

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE
dialog: Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers.

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE (CONT'D)
dialog: They say you are doing good. That you

dialog: 
text: Sam looking at her and there's a warning in what she says next...

dialog: 
text: ON THE SMALL SCREEN we see a school production... children dressed
text: in costumes shuffling across the stage... lines being spoken by

text: but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds
dialog: heartache... the distance from his family... from their innocence...
dialog: simply too great to bear in this moment...
dialog: 
text: ... and then he hears giggling... and he realizes two young orphan
text: BOYS have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his

speaker_heading: DENG

text: "chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter
dialog: in scene #29) --
dialog: 
text: -- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore --
text: BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck -- SAM AND
scene_heading: NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE -- THE SOUND DEAFENING -- headlights

scene_heading: EXT. DITCH - SIDE OF DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: 
dialog: Boys and girls... none of them older than twelve... tied together

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: The front axle is broken... this truck

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What'd he say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
text: The truck is too damaged to move.
dialog: (meaning the children)
dialog: We don't have room for them all,

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell her I'm not gonna hurt her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENG
speaker_heading: (ARABIC)
dialog: It's ok... he will not hurt you...
dialog: 
text: And slowly the little girl steps forward... and Sam gently unbuttons
text: her shirt and begins to examine her little body... turning her
text: around in the harsh light of the SUV's headlamps... and he finds
text: five infected gashes on her back... whip wounds... already turning
text: gangrene... and he gently pushes her toward Deng...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Put her in the truck.
dialog: 
text: And Sam continues with the group... assessing each child's health...
text: tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies...
text: somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of
dialog: line...
dialog: 
text: ... and he reaches the last child and we see that the SUV is now

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell em we're comin back.

dialog: 
text: ... and then a voice from somewhere far off. Sam stopping, looking
text: into the haze as a figure materializes... coming toward him calling

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Most of you want me to stand up here and
dialog: make some sense outta this. That's why

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What ministry?! They see what you've

dialog: 
text: And we see William working his way through the room... refilling

scene_heading: INT./EXT. TRUCK/RURAL ROAD - SUDAN - DAY

speaker_heading: AGNETE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGNETE (CONT'D)
dialog: We have only medical supplies -- non-
speaker_heading: MILITARY --
dialog:

speaker_heading: LRA LEADER
dialog: Shut your mouth!

dialog: 
text: -- and he SLAMS her in the face with the butt of his rifle and she
text: goes down hard... and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back
dialog: of her head... he's going to shoot her -- and --
dialog: 
dialog: KAK! KAK! KAK!
dialog: 
text: His chest EXPLODES! -- three bursts from behind -- the other rebels
text: spinning toward the gunshots as --
dialog: 
dialog: KRATAKRATAKRATAKRAK!!!
dialog: 
text: A firestorm of lead -- Sam, Deng, and the rest of his team coming
text: onto the bridge shooting -- rebels scrambling for cover but it's too
text: late -- dropping as they try and sprint away -- and in an instant
text: it's all over.
dialog: 
text: Agnete sees Sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she
text: freezes. He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment -- a
text: killer's thousand-yard stare -- barely human -- more like a machine
dialog: than a man.
dialog: 
text: And he moves past her down the bridge, to the LRA LEADER on the
text: ground who is still alive. And he puts the barrel of his rifle
dialog: against the rebel's head and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOOOM!
dialog: 
text: He's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge.

dialog: This is my brother. His name is

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you know if he is alive?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)

dialog:

speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you remember your parents?
dialog: 
dialog: And we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes
text: filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his
dialog: head again.
dialog: 
dialog: And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each

speaker_heading: DENG (CONT'D)

dialog: I am worried about my friend. I want to

scene_heading: INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

dialog: 110
dialog:

dialog: here... his world starting to cave in on him...
dialog:

dialog: closing against the world... and...
dialog: 
dialog: WE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR
dialog: 
text: Sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes

dialog: 
text: ... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground
text: with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting
text: on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I remember my parents when I sleep. I see
dialog: them in my dreams sometimes.
dialog: 
text: Sam looking to William... this small boy sitting above him...
dialog: telling his story...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: My father was big like you. They shot
dialog: him. We were so scared. Then the rebels
dialog: gave me a club and told me if I didn't
dialog: kill my mother they would shoot my
dialog: brother and me.
dialog: 
text: And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face
text: becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears
dialog: in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I refused, but my mother told me to swing
dialog: hard... that I must make her proud...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And so I did. I made her proud.

dialog: moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these
text: two broken souls finding each another here... and William says...

speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: If we allow ourselves to become full of

dialog: 
text: And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm thinkin of a tree...

dialog: 
text: And then we see Sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer

dialog: 
text: Deng and the other soldiers staring as Sam pops the ball into the

dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: horizon...
dialog: 
text: And we see Sam here too... alone with himself... sitting at the

dialog: the soft serenade of the women... the beauty of it all...
dialog: 
text: ... and then he gets up and walks into the river... and he kneels
text: down so that water reaches his waist (reminiscent of his first
text: baptism in scene #35)... and now the women on the riverbank stop
text: their work, watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans
text: back... submitting to the water... and when he comes up again we see
text: in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act.
dialog: 
text: And the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we
dialog: go...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY

dialog: 
dialog: AND THEN THE SOUND OF MEN
dialog: 
text: A squad of LRA rebels coming through the scrub... William hiding

dialog: saw him or not... his mind racing... voices getting louder...
text: starting to hyper-ventilate from the fear -- and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM BOLTS
dialog: 
text: Sprinting through the bush -- running for his life -- rebels see him

scene_heading: INT. LRA TRUCK - DRIVING - DUSK
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.'
dialog: 115
dialog: 
text: And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and
