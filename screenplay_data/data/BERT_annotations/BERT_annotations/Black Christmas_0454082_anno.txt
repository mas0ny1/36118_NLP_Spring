scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - (1970)
text: Falling snow drifts upon the Mansard rooftop of a large,
text: isolated, and decrepit New England colonial. Paned
text: windows in the gables are cracked and broken. Worn stone
text: steps lead to a rotting open porch. An equally ragged '48
text: Chevy Aerosedan sits in the driveway.
text: Behind the house lies a void of evergreen and leafless
text: birch. Far down the road, lies a lone neighborhood house.
text: There are only two houses on this street.
text: Here, Christmas lights are strung, but many of the fat
text: bulbs are burned out. The building appears like a
text: haunted house on Christmas Eve. The windows are dark,
text: except for a pale blue light in the living room..
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE - A TREE ORNAMENT
text: A reflection of a bassinet and an eerie blue light wraps

speaker_heading: A BASSINET
text: BILLY'S FATHER, early 20's, lights a cigarette while

scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE - ZIPPO LIGHTER
text: Across the lid of a well worn lighter: Khe Sanh '67-'68.
text: On the base: PVT. LENZ. FRANK is above a Marine Corp

dialog: bassinet.
text: CAMERA PUSHES PAST the FATHER to the bassinet, MOVING
text: INTO the opening of the blankets to REVEAL the eyes of a
dialog: newborn.
text: Although not demonic or supernatural, the eyes are
text: unsettling; inhuman. Yellowed with a chronic jaundice,
text: the eyes are much too focused and intense for a newborn.
scene_heading: BILLY'S MOTHER
text: slumps in the corner of the couch, back to father and
text: son, as if imagining herself as far from them as
text: possible. An empty bottle of Tanqueray sits on the coffee

text: them, blank.
text: She stands, drunk, and moves toward the Evergleam pink
text: aluminum Christmas tree. The mother reaches out...

text: in one hand, a Screwdriver in a highball glass in the

dialog: Christmas tree.
text: In the b.g., the bassinet is long gone. Billy's father,
text: appearing haggard, helps his five year old son, BILLY,
text: place the plate beneath the pink aluminum Christmas tree.
text: Billy's back is to CAMERA and partially obscured by the
text: tree branches. He wears long sleeve pajamas.
scene_heading: REVERSE - BILLY'S MOTHER
text: CAMERA IS LOW MOVING TOWARD her as she glares at them
text: with disgust. She appears anxious; jittery. The years
dialog: have not been good to her, either...
scene_heading: BILLY'S MOTHER
dialog: Why you bothering putting with those

scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - NIGHT (1975)
text: A flashlight FLARES INTO CAMERA REVEALING the closet acts
text: as the boy's hidden "fort."
text: IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: In the corner of the closet is a six inch triangular hole
text: where wood has rotted or been damaged by termites. A
text: space exits between the closet wall and the inner

text: CAMERA IS LOW to the floor as it moves toward the closet
text: door, slightly ajar. Outside, a winter wind HOWLS
text: As CAMERA REACHES THE CLOSET the argument is broken by a
text: TOPPLING of a NIGHT STAND. Glass shatters. An adult male
text: MOANS; another. Then, abruptly... SILENCE.
text: In the darkness of the closet, Billy's yellow eyes
text: appear, looking out as if listening with his sense of
dialog: sight.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - (1975) 7
text: CAMERA REMAINS LOW to the ground CREEPING DOWN THE

scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - NIGHT 10

scene_heading: INT. BENEATH BILLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - (1975)
text: The flashlight beam rolls onto the bloodied face of
text: Billy's father, in the plastic bag which has torn from

text: slipped out of his shirt pocket.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - BILLY'S MOTHER

text: CAMERA TRACKS parallel to the rooms, REVEALING a window
text: in which hangs a small holly wreath with white micro
dialog: lights.
text: MEGAN HELMS, 23, can be seen pacing angrily while on her
text: cell phone. Although furious with whomever is on the
text: receiving end, Megan is clearly trying to keep her voice
text: DOWN. She pulls the phone away and flips it off before
text: hanging up.
text: CAMERA MOVES PAST HER WINDOW just as Megan sits at her
text: desk before an open laptop and looks sickened, at the
text: monitor. The next room is dark, yet not vacant.
text: Attractive and urban, LAUREN HANNON, 21, leans out over
text: the sill of her open window smoking a cigarette. CAMERA
text: CONTINUES as she shudders at the mounting storm and
text: exhales, somewhat sad, before dropping the butt into a
dialog: beer bottle.
text: CAMERA CONTINUES TO the next room in which CLAIR CROSBY,
text: 20, appears excited, yet anxious while pacing with a
text: sheet of high quality gift wrapping paper, cellophane
text: tape, ribbons and scissors. As she sits, Clair disappears
dialog: from view...
text: CAMERA BEGINS RISING... toward the third story, while
text: also PUSHING IN ON a gabled window framed with Christmas
text: lights on the top level of the house. Behind the
text: weathered mutins stands an illuminated plastic Santa
dialog: Claus.
text: The window is ajar; softly KNOCKING against the sill...
dialog: 34
dialog: 35
dialog: 36
dialog: 17.
text: From the dim spill of the decorative lights, it is
text: apparent the large area behind the window is not a living
text: space, but, rather, the attic which was once Billy Lenz's
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT 34

dialog: cold.
text: The breathing stops... beat... then... with a startling
text: SCREECH an old rocking chair is placed at the window and

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT - THE KILLER'S P.O.V.

scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - ATTIC TRAP DOOR 35
text: CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a corridor of dark wood walls and

scene_heading: INT. CLAIR'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - A WINE CORK 36

scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE - A SMALL GIFT BOX
text: wrapped with tasteful paper and great care sits on the

dialog: Thick. Sharp.
speaker_heading: CLAIR CROSBY
text: Unaware of the presence outside her door, Clair appears
text: mixed with dreaded apprehension and excited anticipation
text: as she opens a blank Christmas card and gathers her
dialog: thoughts. The first being, her thoughts could use some
text: wine. She pours the Pinot into a glass. OUTSIDE, the
text: storm is a CONSTANT presence.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: ON THE BED
text: a couple travel bags are packed, but open. CAMERA INCHES

scene_heading: IN THE OPEN CLOSET

speaker_heading: ON THE FLOOR

dialog: gift.
scene_heading: CLOSE - STORE WRAPPED GIFT

scene_heading: CLOSER - ANOTHER GIFT

scene_heading: CLOSE - THE WINE BOTTLE
text: Is set down beside her, alongside a pair of open

speaker_heading: CLOSE - CLAIR

scene_heading: CLOSE - BLANK CHRISTMAS CARD

scene_heading: CLAIR'S POV - BASE OF THE FLOOR
text: Air wisps through the heating vent...
speaker_heading: CLAIR

scene_heading: CLOSE - THE FLOOR
text: Clair reaches for the pen, but it is no longer there...
speaker_heading: CLOSE - CLAIR
text: Puzzled, turns a quarter and looks to the floor...
scene_heading: CLAIR'S POV - THE FLOOR

speaker_heading: CLAIR

scene_heading: CLOSE - CLAIR'S MOUTH
text: Like a vacuum, the plastic CLASPS to her face; mouth wide

scene_heading: CLOSE - THE FOUNTAIN PEN

speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Hello... Hey!
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: That is so gay.

speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: I have the same phone, but mine plays

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: KELLI

speaker_heading: KELLI

speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: We're opening presents. Can you see if

text: Lauren turns back down the hall toward Clair's room as

speaker_heading: what? MEGAN (0.S.)
dialog: ats
text: Kelli appears concerned by Megan's tone...
speaker_heading: KELLI

scene_heading: 41 INT. MEGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT 4l

speaker_heading: LAUREN

dialog: D.I.
speaker_heading: LAUREN (CONT'D)
dialog: We're opening presents, NOW! If you're
dialog: not down there, your gifts will be mine.
text: Lauren walks away from Clair's door without awaiting a
text: response. She tosses to Kelli...
speaker_heading: AT MEGAN'S DOOR
text: Kelli sighs with derision at Lauren's method as she

speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: Megan... you okay?
speaker_heading: MEGAN (0.S.)
dialog: Yes... no... just... FUCK
dialog: CHRISTMAS! FUCK IT!

speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: He's gonna be pih-issed, then come back

text: Ms. Mac reacts to the residue smell of cigarettes left in
text: Lauren's wake.
dialog: MS. MAC
dialog: Not as pissed as I'm gonna be if you've
dialog: been smoking in your room.
text: Lauren shakes her head with feigned innocence as she
text: swipes someone's full glass of red wine and as she takes
dialog: a sip...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Must've been Billy's ghost.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Don't think he's dead. Is he?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: Watches, then sighs, confessional...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Okay, look... I drew "that name."
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: beneath the tree, Ms. Mac looks to Heather. Lauren pauses

text: inches up on the edge of the sofa; posture defensive...
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I just say... I'm sorry, but, I am
dialog: very not okay with any of this. I mean,
dialog: buying a Christmas present for a serial
dialog: killer?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Serial killers murder repeatedly for
dialog: sexual thrill. Billy Lenz was a spree
dialog: killer. Dude just fuckin' lost it!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What-ever. I'm just offended by a...
dialog: pagan sacrifice... to ward off evil
dialog: spirits on Christmas.
text: Ms. Mac moves toward the fireplace and picks up a foot
text: and a half long, two pronged barbecue fork. As she sticks

dialog: MS. MAC
dialog: Come on, Heather, it's just a bit of

speaker_heading: DANA

scene_heading: CLOSER - LIVING ROOM
text: Heather is rattled and not as good at rancorous debate as
dialog: Lauren, who knows it...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: What Christmas shit in this room reflects
dialog: anything Christian? Huh?
text: The girls pause, then look about the room as Lauren
text: randomly points at various Christmas decorations...
speaker_heading: LAUREN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's all neo-pagan magik. Christmas
dialog: tree's a magical rite ensuring the return
dialog: of the crops. Mistletoe is a conception
dialog: charm...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Then, get it away from me.
text: Kelli smiles. Lauren's momentum picks up...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Fifth century Christians jacked a Roman

speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I saw them, yesterday, at Wal-Mart.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: And fuckin' Santa Claus? This voyeur that

dialog: in the middle of the night? And that's
dialog: different from what Billy did, how?

speaker_heading: THE HOUSE PHONE

speaker_heading: KELLI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KELLI (CONT'D)
dialog: Need to work on it, Kyle.
text: Then quickly, Kelli grows alarmed. She pulls away from

speaker_heading: KELLI (CONT'D)
dialog: I think someone's in trouble...
text: She quickly presses the "hold" button, sets the receiver
text: in the cradle and hits the "speaker" button. CAMERA TILTS
text: DOWN to the PHONE which FILLS THE FRAME...
text: The SOUND emitting through the speaker is like the low
text: wailing of a wounded animal, yet with an edge of
text: unsettling perversity. Although not discernibly obscene,
text: it is quite sexually chilling.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: The SOUND freezes the girls with collective anxiety. They

dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Yeah, he's in trouble. Dude's whackin'
text: off with egg nog lube.
text: Melissa GIGGLES and begins adding to the joke, until...
text: The PHONE ERUPTS with a nightmarish cacophony of VOICES;
text: women, men, a crying baby. INSANE and DEMONIC;
text: intertwined with one another. GROANS, DISTANT SHRIEKS,
text: CACKLES; it SOUNDS as if a Dore etching of Hell could
dialog: speak.
text: Meanwhile, Bing Crosby's rendition of "I'll Be Home For
text: Christmas" plays low on the living room C.D. Meant to be
text: comforting, it subliminally adds to the tension...
text: CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the stunned Phi Kappa sisters'
text: FACES listening to the awful SOUNDS emitting from the
dialog: phone.
text: Then, cutting through the STATIC of eerie VOICES... yet
text: remaining distant... a VOICE... neither male or female,
text: yet an absolutely crone-like cackle...
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.)
dialog: Bill-ly! What have you done?!
text: The girls are rattled. A MALE VOICE begs...
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What your mother and I must know,
dialog: Billy... is what did you do with the
dialog: baby?
text: A COARSE, GRAVELLY male voice, intense, insanely
text: lascivious, and yet, mischievous, like an pre-pubescent
text: boy, JUMPS THROUGH the speakers...
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is Agnes?
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: .--She's our family, now.

speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Hey, shouldn't you get goin'? Don't you
dialog: have lots of toys to deliver tonight to
dialog: good little boys and girls?
text: While Melissa LAUGHS, Dana and Ms. Mac gesture for Lauren
text: to hang up. Lauren gestures, as if, "don't worry."
text: The voice lowers an octave with insane intensity and,
dialog: most chilling, extremely matter of fact...
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.)
dialog: I'm going to kill you.
text: Heather quickly disconnects. The room turns deathly
text: SILENT. The girls look to one another, rattled...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Call the police.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Puh-lease. Police ain't gonna do shit
dialog: about one whack job phone call.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Campus security is down to, like, one guy
dialog: 'til after Christmas.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Campus security? That's probably who just
dialog: called.
speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: That couldn't have been one person.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What was the caller I.D.? Was it on
dialog: campus?
speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: Sorry, didn't even look. My brain was on
dialog: Kyle...
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Dial *69.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: That just calls him back. Unless there's
dialog: something you need him to clarify...
text: AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
text: A figure steps INTO the F.G., remaining at the top of the

text: Melissa taps some buttons on the phone, Heather returns
text: to the gathered group of girls, remaining angry at
dialog: Lauren...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You shouldn't provoke someone like that.
speaker_heading: MELISSA

speaker_heading: MELISSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Call log says Clair's cell.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: The information goes unregistered as everyone is focused
text: on the rising confrontation. Lauren glares at Heather...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: What would you know about dealing with
dialog: anyone other than a NASCAR dad?
text: Heather's eyes flare with anger. She steps aggressively
text: toward Lauren. Kelli places a restraining hand on
dialog: Heather...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I'm going home.
text: Disgusted, Heather starts toward the stairs...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Yeah, yeah, run to daddy.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Is that a problem?
text: Heather stops, then turns, pointedly, at Lauren...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Least my family wants me to come home.
text: From Lauren's reaction, Heather has gone straight for the
text: heart and scored a bull's-eye. The other girls know it...
speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: Guys, c'mon... it's, like, Christmas
dialog: time.
text: Desperate to break the increasing tension, Ms. Mac
text: returns to the idea of Christmas cheer...
dialog: MS. MAC
dialog: Yeah. Heather, what about your present?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Give it to Billy.
text: The figure steps directly in front of Heather, who stops
dialog: cold.
scene_heading: LOWER ANGLE - EVE
text: In sorority terms, EVE GUARALDI, 23, is a "mistake." A
dialog: quiet girl whom events in her life could have caused her
text: either to blossom into a social butterfly or a sullen
text: creepy misfit. The latter is the case.
text: The lenses of her glasses are thick, suggesting a past
text: injury rather than merely vision dysfunction. Eve's
text: physical features could pass for an adult Agnes.
dialog: 32.
text: Wearing a coat and duffel bag over her shoulder, Eve

speaker_heading: EVE

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: KELLI

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Before that. Remember? She wanted to move

speaker_heading: DANA

dialog: No, it wasn't there, even a half hour

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: LEIGH

scene_heading: INT. MEGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT 95

speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KELLI

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: LOW ANGLE

text: The eye sockets are empty and black. O.S., the HUMMING
dialog: continues...
speaker_heading: KELLI & LEIGH
text: frightened. Sickened.
speaker_heading: A SECOND CANDLE
dialog: Is lit...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
text: The flickering light dances across her dead,
text: expressionless, face. Her eyes have been removed...
speaker_heading: KELLI & LEIGH
text: CAMERA CONTINUES TOWARD THEM... both frozen and
dialog: mortified...
scene_heading: KELLI & LEIGH'S POV - ATTIC
text: In the corner... a display.
dialog: The sincere intent had been a Currier and Ives family at
text: Christmas print, however, it appears as if sculpted by an
dialog: insane Gothik/Punk artist.
text: The bodies of the murdered sorority sisters, Megan,
text: Clair, and Melissa are posed, as if exchanging presents,
text: beneath an Evergleam pink aluminum Christmas tree. Seven
text: pairs of actual human eyeballs ornament the tree.
text: A dozen candles illuminate the area. Placed on the floor
text: are sheets of crumpled wrapping paper, ribbon and bows,
text: as if presents have jest been opened.
text: Clair's music box is placed in Megan's hands.
speaker_heading: THE KILLER
text: HUMMING Tchaikovsky, turns toward Kelli and Leigh. The
text: yellow, unblinking, unmoving eye, catches some spill
dialog: light.
text: Then with a tone heard in the phone calls, one that is
text: not not evil or crazed, but rather eerily pathetic with a
text: pleased, happy smile, spoken to Kelli and Leigh... and
dialog: quoting Melissa...
speaker_heading: KILLER
dialog: Everyone should be home for Christmas.
dialog: 99.
text: The figure starts toward them...
speaker_heading: KELLI AND LEIGH
text: Trembling and rattled, try pulling Leigh from the floor
text: who grasps the wooden supports; strains...
speaker_heading: CLOSE - LEIGH'S LEGS
text: Slips deeper through the plaster.
speaker_heading: THE KILLER
dialog: Approaches...
speaker_heading: KELLI & LEIGH
text: Suddenly... CRACK! The floor gives way. Collapses! Leigh
text: falls through the floor and into one of the girls's
dialog: bedroom.
text: Kelli turns, checks the killer's position...
speaker_heading: THE KILLER
dialog: a step away...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Tries to jump through the hole in the floor, but the
text: killer grabs her shoulders. A plastic bag begins whipping
text: over her head, but Kelli raises an arm and blocks it.
text: She lunges forward...
scene_heading: CLOSE - THE BBQ FORK
text: Kelli grabs it...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Rolls, turns, then drives the weapon toward the killer...
scene_heading: THE KILLER'S EYES
text: The prongs plunge into the yellowed iris. The figure's
text: head is thrown back.
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Kelli rears, looking up to the figure...
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
text: The hooded head slowly levels. Oddly, the fork remains in
text: the eyeball with no release of blood or fluid. The fork
text: extends out, stuck in the eye.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Reacts, shocked, confused...
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
text: A first true look at the face of the figure, albeit in
text: the eerie flickering amber light, REVEALS an unnerving
text: androgyny. Although the face is large and, somewhat,
text: masculine, the lips and nose are feminine. The skin
text: texture appears shiny, plastic-like and sweaty.
text: Thick scar tissue encircles the neck.
text: With no reaction of pain or emotion, the figure reaches
text: up, grabs the fork handle, and with effort, twists the
text: fork and head until the prosthetic eye is pulled from the
dialog: socket.
scene_heading: CLOSE - THE PROSTHETIC EYE
text: remains on the tip of the fork. At this image size, it is
text: clear that the iris has been hand painted or tinted
dialog: yellow...
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
text: The empty socket is black with scar tissue. The head
text: turns, looking at the eye on the end of the fork and
text: REVEALING the surviving right eye is a brilliant bright
dialog: blue...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN, repulsed, frozen with fear and shock.
text: She whispers...
speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: They are not your family... Agnes.
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: Indeed, the killer, Agnes Lenz, drops the fork...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Although trembling with fear, addresses Agnes...
speaker_heading: KELLI (CONT'D)
dialog: I am not your family. You're brother is
dialog: not here.
speaker_heading: AGNES

text: an eerie child-like smile...
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: But... my daddy is.
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Kelli doesn't understand. Then, suddenly... MUTED...
text: "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" CHIMES from her back
text: pocket. Her expression flashes a hope of possibility...
text: as she hustles toward the attic door while removing her
text: cellphone from her back pocket. She is SCREAMING,

dialog: phone...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: HELP! HELP! I'M IN THE ATTIC OF
scene_heading: THE PHI KAPPA SIGMA SORORITY. 566
text: OAKDALE LANE...
text: Kelli reaches the door, however...
scene_heading: CLOSE - THE DOOR
text: A hatch lifting ring is inset and flush against the wood.
text: Kelli's trembling fingers struggle to lift the ring.
speaker_heading: KELLI (CONT'D)
text: PLEASE! PLEASE! CALL 911! I NEED
dialog: HELP! 911!!
speaker_heading: AGNES
dialog: Approaches...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: CAMERA SWEEPS IN AS FROM THE PHONE... the chilling, now
text: familiar voice calmly declares...
speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.)
dialog: You're... my family now.
text: Kelli reacts, stunned and puzzled. Behind her, Agnes
text: whisks a green Hefty trash bag whips over Kelli's head...
speaker_heading: CLOSER - KELLI
text: GASPS! The plastic vacuums to her face. She stumbles to
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: AGNES
text: straddles Kelli...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Tears the plastic away...
dialog: 185
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: AGNES - LOW ANGLE
text: Raises the glass unicorn...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Dekes her head. The glass spike catches a piece of her
text: earlobe as it drives into the floor and breaks off.
text: Kelli grabs Agnes' wrist...
scene_heading: AGNES - LOW ANGLE
text: looks at the ornament. Now, a block of glass...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Quickly grabs for the broken glass spike. Grabs it. She
text: plunges her hand upward...
scene_heading: AGNES - LOW ANGLE
text: Brings the glass rock downwards, but Kelli's weapon makes
text: impact first, plunging just below the right eye socket.
text: As she rears back, Kelli grabs Agnes' arm with both
text: hands, trying to free the ornament from Agnes' hand.
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Knocks the ornament from Agnes' hand...
speaker_heading: THE ORNAMENT
text: Knocks over a pair of candles...
speaker_heading: KELLI AND AGNES
text: Agnes maintains a grasp on Kelli. They fall backwards...
speaker_heading: A CANDLE
text: Lands atop a piece of wrapping paper on the ground. It
text: begins burning beneath the flammable tree...
speaker_heading: KELLI AND AGNES
text: Stumble backward toward the wall and to fall into the

speaker_heading: AGNES
text: Tumbles grotesquely all the way to the basement...
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Manages to break and stop her fall at some point mid way

speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: HELP! HELP ME!
scene_heading: BETWEEN THE WALLS - AT THE BASE OF THE WALL
text: Agnes, from the base of the house begins climbing toward
dialog: Kelli...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - LEIGH 186
text: Lies on the floor, disoriented and stunned. She awakens
text: upon HEARING KELLI'S calls for help.
speaker_heading: LEIGH
dialog: Kelli?
scene_heading: INT. WITHIN THE WALLS - NIGHT 187
text: Kelli KNOCKS on the wall, pushes against it.
speaker_heading: KELLI
text: LEIGH?! LEIGH?! In the wall. I can't
dialog: move.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - LEIGH 188
text: Initially, Leigh is confused. Kelli's CRIES, however, can
text: be heard within the wall. Leigh moves to the wall and
text: places her ear against the wood, trying to determine
dialog: Kelli's position.
speaker_heading: KELLI (0.S.)
text: SHE'S IN HERE! HURRY!
text: Leigh turns and quickly tries to find a heavy object in
dialog: the darkness...
speaker_heading: ON THE FLOOR

speaker_heading: KELLI'S POV - AGNES

speaker_heading: KELLI
text: Bangs on the wall... tries to push...
speaker_heading: LEIGH (0.S.)
text: KELLI! KELLI! KNOCK ON THE WALL!
text: Hearing Leigh's voice, Kelli begins pounding on the
dialog: wall...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 190
text: Leigh attempts to discern Kelli's position, listening to
text: the KNOCKING within the wall. Leigh places her ear to the
dialog: wall for one final check.
text: Leigh rears back with the dumbbell and smashes the
dialog: wall...
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT - THE BURNING CANDLE 191
text: On the floor, near the lip of the wall... rolls with the
text: concussion of the dumbbell impact.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - LEIGH 192
text: SMASH! Again, until finally, a hole is created...
scene_heading: INT. WITHIN THE WALLS - NIGHT - KELLI 193
dialog: Looks up...
scene_heading: KELLI'S POV - UP THE WALL
text: The interior of the wall is very dark, except for the

speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: Looks up...
speaker_heading: KELLI

scene_heading: HOLE IN THE WALL
text: CAMERA SWEEPS IN TO REVEAL BILLY LENZ. His yellow eyes

speaker_heading: LEIGH
text: the wall ERUPTS as Billy's other arm POUNDS through the

scene_heading: HOLE IN THE WALL - BILLY
speaker_heading: YELPS!
speaker_heading: LEIGH

speaker_heading: KELLI'S POV - AGNES
text: Climbs up toward her...
speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: Looks up...
scene_heading: KELLI'S POV - UP THE WALL
text: Through the light in the wall, sees another form. It

speaker_heading: LEIGH
speaker_heading: KELLI!?

scene_heading: INT. WITHIN THE WALLS - NIGHT - LOW ANGLE 198
text: Agnes scales the wall, growing closer to Kelli, who tries
dialog: to move, but cannot.
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE - BILLY
text: crawls toward Kelli, below him...
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 199
text: Leigh races to the next door. As she opens it, a form
text: appears to be waiting for her. Leigh SCREAMS!
text: It is the laundry room. Some clothes hang near the door.
text: Leigh brushes them aside and moves to the wall. Kelli's
text: SCREAMS seem to be directly on the other side.
speaker_heading: KELLI (0.S.)
text: LEIGH! LEIGH! THEY'RE COMING!
text: Leigh realizes she does not know Kelli's exact location.

speaker_heading: KELLI (0.S.) (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: HURRY!

scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT 212
text: With all her remaining strength, Leigh pulls Kelli from

speaker_heading: LEIGH AND KELLI
text: Race out of the room...
speaker_heading: IN THE HOLE
text: A frame within the wall, is enveloped with flame. As

scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 213

speaker_heading: A REVERSE

text: She looks up, checks a room number...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 217
text: This is a two bed hospital room. An ELDERLY MAN sits up

dialog: LOW...
text: As Leigh enters, however, they turn respectfully quiet,

speaker_heading: LEIGH
dialog: Your family will be here in a couple of

text: Kelli nods.
speaker_heading: LEIGH (CONT'D)
dialog: These are the things you had on you when

dialog: to pose the question which, both understand, is
dialog: unanswerable.
speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: They must have been in the house since he

speaker_heading: LEIGH
dialog: We'll never know, Kelli. How could we

text: Kelli averts her eyes. Leigh considers, shrugs.
speaker_heading: LEIGH (CONT'D)
dialog: I think... maybe... they were doing the

speaker_heading: LEIGH (CONT'D)
dialog: This Christmas... they came back home,

dialog: (without sentiment)
dialog: They're always there.
text: Kelli averts her eyes. 0.S., in the adjacent cubicle, the

dialog: at Phi Kappa Sigma, earlier this evening.
text: Kelli and Leigh tense. Leigh reaches into her coat and
text: removes Clair's wrapped present.
speaker_heading: LEIGH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll never be able to open this in front
dialog: of my sister. So... I'll open it in front

speaker_heading: HOSPITAL VISITOR (0.S.)
dialog: Turn that off. They don't want to hear

speaker_heading: KELLI
dialog: Must be my parents.

dialog: 112.
text: CAMERA SWEEPS IN TO the display... "KYLE AUTRY'S CELL."
speaker_heading: RETURN
text: Kelli holds the phone in her hand as the "Sugar Plum

dialog: emotionless...
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK as the RINGTONE continues. There is not

text: into the room.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 218
text: CAMERA is several stories high, looking through the
