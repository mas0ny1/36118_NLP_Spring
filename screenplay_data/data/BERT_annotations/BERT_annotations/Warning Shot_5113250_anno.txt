speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 1
dialog: This is one of those country cemeteries that would be an
text: ordinary pasture without the grim slabs.
text: AUDREY, 30s, in a flowing dress that gently rolls like waves
text: in the breeze, stands next to...
text: CHEYENNE, 8, an adorable little likeness of her mother.
text: Together, they’re a symbol of all that’s beautiful about
text: life. They gaze blankly at a casket in an open grave,
text: pondering mortality.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We should go.
text: She puts her hands on Cheyenne’s shoulders. Steers her toward
text: a single car parked on the gravel road.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: How come everyone left so soon?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Probably had things to do.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: There weren’t that many people.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Grandpa was pretty old.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Then it seems like he would have
dialog: had more friends than anyone.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Most of his friends have already
dialog: died, sweetie.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 2
text: The house is small with add-ons, isolated and derelict, with
text: a couple of dilapidated buildings behind it, an old barn and
text: machine shed. Other than the dusty road leading to it, it’s
text: surrounded by woodlands.
text: Audrey's car pulls up the gravel driveway, stops behind the
text: house. Audrey and Cheyenne climb out, scan the area.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Have I ever been here before?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yes. You were too young to
dialog: remember. I usually visited while
dialog: you were with grandma and grandpa.
text: They approach the barn like they’re walking in the park.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I thought this was my grandpa.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No, this was my grandpa.
text: Cheyenne drifts toward a field as Audrey reaches the doorway.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t go too far, Cheyenne. And
dialog: don’t get your dress dirty.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - DAY 3
text: Audrey steps cautiously into the dingy building. It’s filled
text: with a lifetime’s worth of dusty old farm equipment. A COIL
text: OF ROPE hangs on the wall.
text: Audrey touches an old harness, smacks the dust off her hands.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GROUNDS - DAY 4
text: Cheyenne approaches a large woodpile. When she gets close...
text: a covey of quail suddenly erupts from the pile, their
text: TWEETING filling the air.
text: Caught off guard, Cheyenne falls back onto the ground. She
text: watches in wonder as the birds fill nearby trees.
text: Audrey steps out of the barn to see what’s going on.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What did you do?
text: Cheyenne climbs off the ground and shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Nothing. I just walked to the
dialog: woodpile.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Well, come away from there. Don’t
dialog: bother the birds.
text: Cheyenne makes her way back.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I didn’t.
text: Audrey brushes Cheyenne’s dress off.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I told you not to get dirty and
dialog: it’s the first thing you did.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: She points to a dusty spot on Audrey’s dress. Audrey brushes
dialog: it off.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I guess I should have told myself
dialog: not to get dirty too.
text: They share a laugh. Audrey puts her arm around Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on. Let’s look around some
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Are we going into the house?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I have to get the key from Mr.
dialog: Pendleton.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY’S OFFICE - DAY 5
text: BOBBY, 30s, affluent and sleazy, paces behind his desk.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Those water rights have been in his
dialog: family since the eighteen hundreds.
text: We now see the two men Bobby speaks to...
text: First there’s JAWARI, late 30s, an African-American with a
text: moustache. His face has a gentle quality.
text: Then there’s RAINY, 30s, slouched in his chair. His eyes
text: would be completely empty except for a sinister tinge.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: The old man’s personally owned them
dialog: since nineteen-thirty-nine. It’s
text: going to take some persuasion.
text: Bobby leans over his desk to bring full attention to what
text: he’s about to emphasize.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to persuade him. Do you
dialog: two know each other?
text: Jawari and Rainy look each other over.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I’ve seen him around.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I got a friend who said he bought a
text: skimpy bag of weed from him.
text: Jawari stiffens, offended.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I don’t sell skimpy bags.
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: Had a bunch of stems in it.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Bobby dismisses them with a wave as he sits.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: All right, all right. Jawari,
dialog: Rainy. Rainy, Jawari. Can you two
dialog: work together?
text: Rainy leans on Bobby’s desk with a smart aleck smirk.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Hey, man, I’m a professional.
text: Bobby looks at Jawari for an answer. Jawari nods.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: All right, listen. I just want you
dialog: to loosen the old man up. Do not
dialog: kill him.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: When do you want it done?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Tomorrow. Around noon. Just hold
dialog: him there. I’1l drop by later with
dialog: the papers.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What if he gives us trouble?
text: Bobby flashes Rainy a sharp look.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Listen, asshole. What did I just
dialog: say? Do not kill him. He can’t sign
dialog: any papers dead.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I was just asking. He might have a
dialog: shotgun or something.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He’s in his nineties. Can’t you
dialog: handle a guy in his nineties?
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK -— DAY 6
text: The back door of a tiny trailer opens. Audrey leans out,
text: hanging off the doorframe.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Cheyenne! Dinner’s ready!
text: She retreats, closing the door, almost like a cuckoo clock.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - DAY 7
text: Audrey turns from the back door, makes her way through the
dialog: modest family area and to the...
speaker_heading: KITCHEN 8
text: She stops over the stove where a pot of soup simmers. Grabs a
text: ladle and stirs.
text: Cheyenne rushes through the front door, breathing heavily,
text: carrying a piece of paper with tape on it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why are you out of breath?
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: James and Chris were chasing me and
dialog: Lucia. They said they were going to
dialog: throw us in the pond.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh really? Go wash up.
text: Cheyenne starts for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
text: Cheyenne hurries back, still hyper, holding the paper out.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: It was on the door. What’s for
dialog: dinner?
text: She hands Audrey the paper and scurries off.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Vegetable soup.
text: Audrey examines the paper. It’s a FINAL EVICTION NOTICE. She
text: frowns, looks up. Cheyenne’s already in the bathroom with the
text: water running. Audrey calls out.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: What did you think of the farm? Did
dialog: you like it?
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah! It was okay!
text: Audrey pulls two bowls from the cupboard.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Just okay?
text: Cheyenne comes back to the kitchen as Audrey fills a bowl.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: It was fun to run around. There’s
dialog: lots of places to go.
text: They sit at the table to eat. Audrey nudges a package of
text: crackers toward Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: There's crackers if you want.
text: Cheyenne grabs some, crushes them over her soup.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: So, you know, Grandpa was kind of a
dialog: hermit in his old age. I’m probably
dialog: the only family he really had any
dialog: contact with.
text: She waits for a reaction. Cheyenne sips her soup.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: He might leave me something in his
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Really? Like what?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Like, I don’t know. Mr. Pendleton
dialog: hinted he might leave me the farm.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Really?
text: Audrey hesitates, trying to be tactful.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It has a lot more space than the
dialog: trailer.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Do you have to work tonight?
text: Audrey’s a little surprised by Cheyenne’s disinterest.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Who’s watching me?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Lucia’s mom.
text: Cheyenne looks up, grinning. Audrey smiles.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t let the boys throw you in the
dialog: pond.
text: Cheyenne giggles.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 8.
scene_heading: 9 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 9
text: It’s a small all-night place. Audrey finishes scribbling down
text: an order for a TRUCK DRIVER at the counter.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Would you like more coffee?
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I‘ll put this right in.
text: She glides to a table as TWO CUSTOMERS leave behind scattered
text: empty dishes.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Thanks, guys.
text: She stacks dirty plates. Notices the tip. She picks up...
text: maybe a dollar and a half in change. Total. She’s stunned.
scene_heading: 10 INT. MARTY’S OFFICE - LATER 10
text: MARTY, the owner, 50s, sits at his desk looking over tax
text: papers, confused and frustrated. Audrey knocks.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Got a minute?
text: Marty glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: A minute is about all you got. I’m
dialog: stressin’ over this tax mess. This
dialog: is my last extension.
text: Audrey sits across from him.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m having some hard times
dialog: financially.
text: Marty gestures at the tax papers.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Aren’t we all?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I need to make some extra money.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: That’s what tips are for. You want
dialog: more money? Flirt with the
dialog: customers more.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m not asking for a raise. I was
dialog: just wondering if I could get some
dialog: extra hours.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I’m looking at cutting back hours
dialog: as it is.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I got a kid, Marty.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Please don’t give me a sob story. I
dialog: get at least one of those a week.
text: Marty goes back to work, ignoring her. Defeated, Audrey
text: starts to leave. Marty sighs, rubs his face.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, look. You need some
dialog: extra cash and I need to relax.
dialog: We're a match made in heaven.
text: He shrugs, wondering if she gets his meaning. She gets it and
text: she doesn’t appreciate it. She summons courage.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You owe me overtime pay.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I told you, you'll get your
dialog: overtime when I get my tax refund.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I know you have the money. You just
dialog: bought a new car.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: So we’ve come to this? You wanna
dialog: play hard ball? Might I remind you
dialog: that there’s no actual record of
dialog: this alleged overtime.
text: Audrey stares in disbelief. It quickly turns to anger.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I knew you would do this.
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You all agreed to it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You changed all our time-sheets.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You signed them.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What choice did we have?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I’m gonna pay you. I just can’t do
dialog: it right now. You'll just have to
dialog: wait... like we agreed.
text: She turns away, speaking under her breath.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Asshole.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I heard that. That’s a code of
dialog: conduct violation. I could dock
dialog: your pay for that.
text: She walks away while he’s talking.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY 11
text: Jawari parks his car a few spaces over from Rainy’s truck.
text: Rainy climbs out, clumsily carrying a rifle and a handgun,
text: all while holding onto a plastic ring for a sixpack of beer.
scene_heading: INT. JAWARI’S CAR - DAY 12
text: Jawari watches stunned as Rainy awkwardly climbs into his
text: car. Once settled, Rainy holds up the sixpack.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Wanna beer?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What? It’s just beer.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I’m talking about you carrying guns
text: right out in the open.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Nobody saw me.
dialog: (re: the rifle)
dialog: Besides, this isn’t a gun. It’s a
dialog: rifle.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You really think we need an assault
dialog: rifle for an old man?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Here’s your weapon.
text: He gives Jawari the handgun.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: A six shooter?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: It's a thirty-eight. That’s
dialog: respectable.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: How come I get a six shooter like
dialog: I’m a fuckin’ cowboy and you get a
dialog: semi automatic rifle?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Man, ‘cause that’s what I got. That
dialog: was my daddy’s gun.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Daddy? You call your old man daddy?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What is your problem? I just
dialog: thought we’d have a beer together.
text: Jawari glances at the chamber.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Where’s the bullets?
text: Rainy digs them out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I got your bullets right here, man.
text: He pulls out six bullets, hands them to Jawari.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Six bullets? That’s all I get?
dialog: 13
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: How many do you need? It’s a six
dialog: shooter. Besides, we’re not
dialog: supposed to kill anyone, remember?
text: Jawari stuffs the bullets in his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: You got any weed?
text: Jawari gives Rainy an annoyed look.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: It’s all stems, man.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, come on, man. You know I was
dialog: just messin’ with you about that.
dialog: Besides, I know your personal stash
dialog: will be the good shit.
text: Jawari hesitates, then pulls a fat bag from his pocket. Rainy
text: grins from ear to ear.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what I’m talkin’ about.
scene_heading: INT. MR. PENDLETON’S OFFICE - DAY 13
text: MR. PENDLETON, 80s, a relaxed folksy lawyer, removes a key
text: from a drawer. He steps around his desk to meet Audrey and
dialog: Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: This is Mr. Pendleton. He’s
dialog: handling Grandpa's estate.
text: Mr. Pendleton smiles at Cheyenne.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: My, I never knew he had such a
dialog: pretty great granddaughter.
text: Cheyenne smiles.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: My great grandpa had an estate?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Yes, he owned eighty acres.
text: Cheyenne has no idea how much that is, but it sounds
dialog: impressive.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Wow, that’s a lot.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: He looks up at Audrey as he hands her the key.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you have any plans for it if he
dialog: leaves it to you?
text: Audrey stares at the key, cautious about her words.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It needs a lot of work. I probably
dialog: couldn’t sell it for much. I’ve
dialog: been wondering if it wouldn’t be
dialog: cheaper to live there.
text: Cheyenne looks up. This is news to her.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Well, the will won't be officially
dialog: executed until next week. We'll go
dialog: over the specifics then.
text: Audrey glances down at Cheyenne, smiles awkwardly. Mr.
text: Pendleton picks up on her distress.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: I was at the funeral. I don’t know
dialog: if you saw me.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, thanks. And thanks for the
dialog: flowers.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: You know, I worked with your
dialog: grandfather on my very first job.
dialog: We were just boys.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I didn’t know that.
text: Mr. Pendleton smiles at the thought.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Picking the best corn we ever ate.
text: Audrey smiles. Mr. Pendleton turns to Cheyenne.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: The first time I saw your mother,
dialog: she was younger than you are now.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: And do you know, she ran away from
dialog: me?
text: Cheyenne giggles. Audrey tries to recall.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Seriously?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: I stopped by for a visit one day.
dialog: They said you took time to warm up
text: to people. After about ten minutes,
dialog: I caught you spying on me from the
text: corner of the house. Another ten
dialog: minutes and you were offering me a
text: cup of pretend tea.
text: Audrey and Cheyenne laugh.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: By the time I left, you were
dialog: hanging onto my neck. They had to
dialog: pull you off me.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So I warmed up to you finally?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Oh yeah. You were a clever one too.
dialog: You used a coffee can lid for a
dialog: Frisbee and got it stuck on the
dialog: roof. You tied a rope to a baseball
text: mitt and threw it up there.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Now that sounds like me.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Did she get it down?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: She sure did.
text: As the laughter subsides, Mr. Pendleton gives Audrey a
text: sympathetic look.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: An answer has no purpose without a
dialog: problem, you know.
text: Audrey stares at him, perceiving he’s referring to her
dialog: current situation now.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But is there always an answer?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Oh, I think a clever girl will find
dialog: one. Sometimes you just need to
dialog: repurpose a few things.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: And if that doesn’t work?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Leave it to the wind. It’1l
text: eventually blow off whatever’s on
text: the roof.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m the one who runs away, though,
dialog: remember?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: But you come back.
text: His words lift Audrey's spirits a little. She glances at the
text: key and returns a fragile smile.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: 14 INT. BOBBY’S GRANDFATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY 14
text: Bobby helps his GRANDFATHER out of a wheelchair and into bed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m going to meet with the old man
dialog: this afternoon.
text: His grandfather strains to climb into bed. He coughs, sickly.
text: He’s on his deathbed.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I quit worrying about that old man
dialog: thirty years ago. We hated each
dialog: other but we respected each other.
dialog: 15
dialog: 16.
text: He nestles into a comfortable position. Bobby sits at his
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But you could never get him to
dialog: sell. Even Dad couldn’t do it.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I don’t want you to end up like
dialog: your father.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I won’t. I’m gonna show you I can
dialog: run the business.
text: His grandfather puts his hand on Bobby’s. Reminisces.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: What are you gonna do, Bobby? In my
dialog: day, when you didn’t like someone,
dialog: you told him to his face, right
dialog: before you loosened his jaw for
dialog: him. If he had any guts, he cracked
dialog: a chair over your head.
text: He coughs. Bobby watches, knowing he’s the last remnant of
text: his family with his grandfather so close to perishing.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
text: The old days are gone. Washed away
dialog: like a creek bed. You can’t just
dialog: muscle your way around anymore. No
dialog: one respects guts anymore.
text: He closes his eyes, drifts off. Bobby clutches his hand.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m gonna make you proud of me.
text: His grandfather grumbles under his breath.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Thanks for helping me off the
dialog: shitter.
scene_heading: INT. JAWARI’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 15
text: Rainy finishes off a beer.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: We need some more beer. You got any
dialog: money?
dialog: 16
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I will after we get this job done.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: We need some money now.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 16
text: Jawari’s car pulls to a stop at a red light. Rainy’s elbow
text: hangs out the open window. He looks over at the driver of the
text: car in the next lane.
text: It's a pretty blonde woman, 20s. NOTTA CHANCE. Her window is
text: partially up and there’s a splotch of birdshit on it.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What’s your name, darlin’?
text: She gives Rainy a cold sneer.
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: Notta.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Notta. Is that Mexican?
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Notta what?
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: Notta chance.
text: Jawari bursts out laughing. Rainy glances at him, turns
text: playfully back to Notta.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You got birdshit on your window.
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: Why don’t you lick it off?
text: Rainy hangs out the window.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You think I won’t?
text: A sly grin sneaks onto Notta’s face. She’s game.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: I’‘1l give you ten dollars if you
dialog: lick that birdshit off.
text: Rainy climbs out. The light turns green.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, come on, man. The light turned
dialog: green.
text: Rainy steps toward Notta’s car.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Bitch, do you even have ten
dialog: dollars?
text: He gets close enough to see down into Notta’s car. She pulls
text: a ten dollar bill from her wallet. Rainy sees she has a lot
text: more money. She waves the ten.
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: I don’t believe you'll do it.
text: He looks into her eyes with a smart aleck smirk as he sticks
text: his tongue out and... licks that birdshit off her window like
text: it’s chocolate and whipped cream.
text: Notta’s mouth falls open.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Mmmmmmmmmmn. Now gimme my money.
text: Notta, still shocked, holds out the ten. Rainy grabs it with
text: one hand and with the other... slings open a balisong (a.k.a.
text: a butterfly knife), presses the blade against Notta’s throat.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll take the rest of it too.
text: Jawari sees what’s going on from his car. Scans, panicked.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: What are you doing, man? Let’s get
dialog: out of here.
text: Notta holds up the wallet. Rainy grabs it, backs away.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Remember, I got your address. If
dialog: you call the police, you better
dialog: hope they find me before I find
dialog: you.
text: As he climbs into Jawari’s car, Notta can’t help but ask...
dialog: 17
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: NOTTA
dialog: If you were going to rob me, why
dialog: did you lick the birdshit off my
dialog: window?
text: Rainy hangs out the window as Jawari pulls away.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: That's just somethin’ for you to
dialog: remember me by, darlin’.
text: He laughs like a crazy man as they drive off.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 17
text: Audrey bickers with an upset Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m sorry I didn’t say anything
text: before. It’s not set in stone.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What about school? Will I still go
dialog: to the same school?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What about all my friends?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Honey, I don’t know what’s going to
dialog: happen. All I know is we can’t
dialog: afford the rent anymore.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What about dad? Can we ask him to
dialog: help us?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Your dad doesn’t give us any money.
text: Cheyenne’s eyes well with tears.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: But if he knew we might lose our
dialog: home, then he might.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: All he'd do is try and take you
dialog: away from me.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that what you want? To live with
dialog: your dad? You’d still have to
dialog: change schools.
text: It gets really quiet for several moments. Both Audrey and
text: Cheyenne gaze ahead, pondering. Then...
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I know the birthday cards from dad
dialog: are really from you.
text: Audrey glances between Cheyenne and the road, surprised.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: No postage stamps or return
dialog: address. So you can’t threaten me
dialog: with living with dad. I already
dialog: know he wouldn’t take me.
text: Audrey smiles, bittersweet, at Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You’re pretty smart, you know that?
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Yes. Just don’t put a bumper
text: sticker on the car about it.
text: They share a laugh.

scene_heading: 19 INT. JAWARI’S CAR - DAY 19
text: Jawari and Rainy scan the area.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: This place is a piece of shit.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Yeah, but there’s supposedly a lot
dialog: of water around here.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Seems weird Bobby would go through
dialog: all this trouble for some water.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: He’s just trying to impress his
dialog: grandfather.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 20
text: Jawari and Rainy get out. Jawari puts his gun in his jacket.
text: Rainy hangs his rifle over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You have to carry that out in the
dialog: open?
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: I‘1l stick it down in my pants.
dialog: (grabs his crotch)
dialog: Nobody will see it next to my dick.
text: Jawari rolls his eyes. They walk toward the back door.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s yours?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: If it was up your ass, I bet you’d
dialog: know where it was.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Damn, brother, what spoiled your
dialog: taco?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Taco? What do you mean by taco?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Ain’t that what they eat down there
dialog: in Dominica or wherever?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Fuck you, man.
text: They arrive at the door. Jawari knocks. They wait idly.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: So how long did it take you to
dialog: smear that doo-doo across your lip?
text: Jawari rubs his moustache, self-satisfied.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Shit, I shave twice a day.
dialog: 22.
text: Rainy bangs on the door.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Open up, old man! We know you’re in
dialog: there!
dialog: (re: Jawari’s moustache)
dialog: If you shave twice a day, I shit
dialog: gold bricks. You could hardly
dialog: tickle a twat with that Velcro
dialog: looking thing.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You can kiss my damn ass, cowboy. I
dialog: get more pussy than you can
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, if we’re counting imaginary
dialog: pussy, then I guess you’re gonna
dialog: win.
text: Rainy bangs on the door again.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re not fooling anyone! We know
dialog: you’re in there!
text: A few more moments go by.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think he’s in there.
text: Jawari turns and scans the grounds.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: He must be around here somewhere.
text: The two men spread out as they approach the barn.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: You check the woods on that side
text: and come up behind the barn. I’11
dialog: check the other side and come up by
dialog: that woodpile.
text: Rainy stops near a tree while Jawari is still close by.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I hate trees.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: How can you hate trees? No one
dialog: hates trees.
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I do. Once when I was hiding out
dialog: from the police, I was stuck in the
dialog: woods for weeks. Nothin’ but
dialog: goddamn trees everywhere.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: No one hates trees, man. It’s
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fuck trees.
text: Rainy looks up the tall tree with contempt.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna
dialog: piss on this goddamn tree.
text: Rainy unzips his pants, and true to his word, starts peeing
text: on the tree. He flips the tree off.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck you, tree.
text: Jawari shakes his head and moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE ROAD - DAY 21
text: Audrey’s car crunches gravel along the road toward the farm,
text: stirring up dust and pinging rocks off the fender wells.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S CAR - DAY 22
text: Dust floats past the windows.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’‘1l never get used to all this
dialog: dust. I hope the gravel doesn’t
text: tear the car up.
text: They pull up next to a large mailbox. Audrey lowers the
text: window, opens the box. It’s filled with letters and
text: newspapers. Audrey takes them in.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: We've got to cancel Grandpa’s
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
text: The mailbox is so big.
dialog: 23
dialog: 24
dialog: 25
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We could live in the mailbox if the

text: They giggle as Audrey raises the window.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 23
text: Audrey's car pulls up the driveway and parks behind Jawari’s.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S CAR - DAY 24
text: Audrey studies Jawari'’s car, confused.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Whose car is that, Mom?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t know.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 25
text: Audrey and Cheyenne get out of the car. Audrey pulls out the
text: key as she walks toward the door.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Maybe it’s someone from the lumber
dialog: company. I think Grandpa was going
dialog: to thin the forest.
text: Cheyenne separates, toward an apple tree in the back yard.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t you want to see inside?
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I just want to see the apples.
text: Audrey arrives at the door, unlocks it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay, but don’t eat any apples
dialog: until you let me check them out
dialog: first.
text: Then... the massive TWEETING of a large covey of quail grabs
text: Audrey’s attention. She turns to see the birds filling the
text: trees. She steps away from the house, calls out.
dialog: 26
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Cheyenne, I told you not to bother
dialog: the birds!
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m right here, Mom.
text: Audrey looks toward a bush near the apple tree. There’s
text: Cheyenne, looking right at her.
text: Audrey isn’t sure what to think. She looks toward the
text: woodpile with an uneasy feeling.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait here.
text: Audrey cautiously approaches the woodpile, scanning.
text: FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARN
text: Rainy hides in the back. Jawari is crouched behind the
text: woodpile. Rainy peeks around the corner and pulls back.
text: Jawari peeks through an opening in the woodpile.
text: Audrey stoops a little as she steps nearer. She searches the
text: woodpile until she lays her eyes...
text: Directly on Jawari’s. Audrey’s eyes widen in terror.
text: Jawari stands. Audrey turns and runs, screaming...
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Cheyenne, get in the car! Get in
dialog: the car and lock the door!
text: Cheyenne sees Jawari chasing her mother. She reacts quickly.
text: Climbs into the car and locks the door.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S CAR - DAY 26
text: Cheyenne clambers to the driver’s side and opens the door.
text: She locks it again, then pushes it wide open.
text: She barely makes it back over before Audrey scrambles in.
text: Audrey slams the door just as Jawari reaches for the latch.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: (outside)
dialog: Open the door! Open the door!
text: Audrey fumbles for her keys in a panic. Drops them in the
text: passenger floorboard. Cheyenne grabs them, finds the key.
dialog: 27
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Here it is!
text: Jawari bangs on the window as Audrey gropes the ignition. She
text: Manages to get the key in and start the car.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Open up! We’re not gonna hurt you!
text: Audrey backs up with Jawari following, banging on the roof.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re not gonna hurt you!
text: Audrey works the shifter into drive. As she starts to pull
dialog: forward...
text: Rainy appears at the passenger side window with the rifle
text: aimed directly at Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Stop the car or I'll kill the kid.
text: Audrey freezes instantly, horrified.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
text: Put the car into park.
text: Audrey hesitates. Not defiantly but paralyzed with fear.
text: Rainy aims upward. BANG! Fires off a round, then aims at
dialog: Cheyenne again.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: That was a fucking warning shot.
dialog: Put the car into park or I'll shoot
dialog: her.
text: Audrey struggles to get her bearings. Puts the shifter into
text: park. Rainy keeps his rifle trained on Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
text: Unlock the door.
text: Audrey fights to focus, then unlocks her door.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 27
text: Jawari opens the door.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Get out.
dialog: 28
dialog: 27.
text: He takes her by the arm as she climbs out. Looks at Rainy.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we gonna do with them?
text: Rainy lowers his rifle.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You see any rope around here?
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 28
text: Rustic charm, fallen into disarray. Dusty unkempt furniture,
text: deteriorated over years of wear and neglect.
text: Audrey and Cheyenne, both with their hands bound behind them,
text: are marshalled into the kitchen and family room area. It’s so
text: small the kitchen table is adjacent to the couch.
text: Rainy pushes Audrey onto the couch. Cheyenne sits beside her.
text: Rainy tosses the extra rope onto the table. Kneels in front
dialog: of Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Let’s start with names. I know
dialog: you’re Cheyenne. That’s a pretty
dialog: name. Is it because you’re shy?
text: Cheyenne shakes her head. Rainy’s attention turns to Audrey.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s your name?
text: Audrey is so scared, her mouth is dry when she speaks.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Audrey.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Audrey? That’s not that pretty.
dialog: What’s your middle name?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Michelle.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Michelle. That’s much better.
text: He looks up playfully at Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: (sings Beatles’ song)
dialog: Michelle. Ma belle.
dialog: 28.
text: He laughs. Jawari keeps a stony face.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, man, can I talk to you?
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: In a minute.
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: Where’s the old man?
text: Audrey absorbs a moment, confused as to what they want.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Grandpa?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yeah, Grandpa.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He died.
text: Jawari steps forward.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Died? Who owns the water rights?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Water rights? I don’t know. Whoever
dialog: he left them to, I guess.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: When will we find out who gets ‘em?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: The will gets read next week.
text: Rainy stands.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: We can’t watch them for a whole
dialog: week.
text: Jawari steps toward the next room.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Let’s talk.
dialog: They go into the...
dialog: 29
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM —- DAY 29
text: It's as large as the other two rooms put together, with a
text: large open space in the middle of the floor. Jawari faces
text: Rainy so they can talk privately.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Okay, first off, I don’t like you
text: pointing a rifle at a kid.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Really? The old man was once a kid.
dialog: Audrey was once a kid. If someone’s
dialog: seventeen and turns eighteen
dialog: tomorrow, do I have to wait until
dialog: tomorrow for it to be okay to point
dialog: a rifle at them?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I’ve had it with your smartass
dialog: bullshit.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’ve had it with your pussyfooting.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, fuck you, cowboy.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fuck you, Zulu.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, I was born in America, dumb
dialog: shit. And do you even know what a
dialog: Zulu is?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yeah, he’s the guy who spends all
dialog: day playing with chicken bones
dialog: ‘cause he’s got the best drugs.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: That’s a sangoma, dumbass.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: It’s all ooga booga shit to me,
dialog: buddy.
text: They stare holes into each other another moment, then look
text: toward the next room.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we gonna do with them?
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: 30 FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 30
text: Jawari and Rainy return.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: If you'll sign the water rights
dialog: over, we'll let you go.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: We don’t even know if she'll get
dialog: them.
text: Jawari keeps his gaze fixed on Audrey.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: If she does, then we’ll already
dialog: have the contract. How about it?
text: Audrey stares, confused a moment, then gently nods.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Bobby will be by in a bit with the
dialog: papers. You sign and that’s it.
text: Rainy kneels in front of Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What about you, shy one? You know
dialog: anything about this?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: Does she talk?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: She’s scared.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: (to Cheyenne)
dialog: You mad at me because I pointed a
dialog: rifle at you?
text: Cheyenne nods.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, well, if you don’t talk, I’m
dialog: gonna aim it at you again. And this
dialog: time, I might fire it.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Damn it, Rainy, I told you not to
text: threaten the kid with a rifle.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You said you didn’t want me to
dialog: point it at her. Did I point it at
dialog: her?
dialog: (to Cheyenne)
dialog: Go on, shy one.
text: Cheyenne looks to her mother for approval.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Go ahead and answer him, sweetie.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Mom and me can’t afford rent so we
dialog: thought we might move in here.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, now, that’s interesting. How
dialog: do you know you’ll get the house?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We don’t.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Was I talking to you? Let her
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Mr. Pendleton said we’1ll probably
dialog: get it because Grandpa was a hermit
dialog: and didn’t have much family left.
text: Jawari reaches into his jacket.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: So that’s it then. She’1ll probably
dialog: get the water rights too. Problem
dialog: solved.
text: He pulls out his gun. Sets it on the table as he sits.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: All we have to do is wait for
dialog: Bobby.
text: Rainy swaggers to the refrigerator. Noses around inside.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I need a fucking beer.
dialog: 32.
text: He goes through the cupboards.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn. What did the old man eat?
dialog: Chipped paint? There’s more mouse
dialog: shit than food in these cupboards.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: He was ninety. Maybe mouse shit was
dialog: his secret to longevity. Why don’t
dialog: you eat some, cowboy?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You think I won’t? How much?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I told you, I don’t have any money.
dialog: You got some beer in the car,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, that’s right. Why don’t you go
dialog: get it for me?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Rainy playfully checks out Audrey.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Audrey, go get my beer.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Untie me.
text: Rainy chuckles.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: She’s got wit. I like that.
text: Rainy eyes Audrey as he sits next to Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, man, step out for a spell.
text: Jawari looks at Rainy. Glances at Audrey.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: We didn’t come here for that.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I know, but, you know...
text: Speaks quietly.
text: Jawari gives Rainy a look that says he’s not playing around.
dialog: 31
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Leave her alone.
text: Rainy smirks, not intimidated, but provocative.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You draw the line at pushing around
dialog: old men, huh?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Just leave her alone.
text: Rainy stands, slings his rifle over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You must be the life of the party,
dialog: Zulu.
text: He saunters to the door. Winks at Audrey right before he
text: walks out. She cringes.
text: Jawari digs the bullets out of his jacket, puts them down on
text: the table. Picks up the gun and opens the revolver.
text: He picks up one bullet, pauses before shoving it in the
dialog: chamber.
text: He looks at Audrey. She’s frightened. He looks at Cheyenne.
text: Same frightened face.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Don’t worry. It’s for him, not you.
dialog: Just in case.
text: He continues loading the gun.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please don’t let him hurt us.
text: Jawari pauses again, looks at Audrey. Softly nods.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GROUNDS - DAY 31
text: Rainy ambles to the car. Notices the tree he peed on earlier
text: as he passes by. Smirks, flips it off.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fuck you.
text: He leans in the car, rummages around, pulls away with a
text: sixpack. Pulls one free and sets the rest on the roof.
dialog: 32
dialog: 34.
text: PSSSHHHT. Pops the can open. Takes a big long guzzle. Lets
text: out a loud obnoxious sigh.
text: He wanders down the driveway, notices the woodpile. Picks a
text: rock off the driveway and throws it...
text: POP! The rock bounces off a log. TWEETING erupts as quail
text: rush for the trees.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
text: Loud ass birds.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - LATER 32
text: Jawari finishes rolling a joint. Lights it and takes a puff.
text: Rainy enters with three beers left hanging off the ring.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me you were
dialog: firing one up?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You didn’t ask.
text: Rainy sets his beer on the table, reaches for the joint.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Let me have some of that.
text: Jawari hands it to him.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Here. Maybe it’1l mellow you out.
text: Rainy takes a big draw. Blows out a fog of smoke, coughing.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: (while coughing)
dialog: Goddamn, this shit could bore a
text: hole through a bank vault.
text: Jawari laughs.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Nah, man, it’s an acquired taste.
text: Rainy holds it out to Audrey.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You want some?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You sure? It’ll loosen you up. Get
dialog: the tension out. And believe me,
dialog: darlin’, I can see you’re under a
dialog: lot of pressure right now.
text: Audrey just shakes her head. Rainy holds it out to Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: She doesn’t want any.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I didn’t ask you.
text: Cheyenne glances at her mother, then shakes her head.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, suit yourself.
text: Rainy takes another big draw.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You know what you are, cowboy?
dialog: You're a glutton. You don’t know
dialog: when to quit.
text: Rainy coughs a cloud of smoke, hands the joint to Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: If you want it back, you could just
dialog: ask. You don’t have to get
dialog: personal.
text: Jawari laughs, taking the joint. Rainy stares at Audrey with
text: that sinister tinge blooming in his eyes again. He squeezes
text: between her and Cheyenne.
text: Jawari notices, keeps an eye as he takes a draw. Rainy looks
text: Audrey up and down.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Comfortable?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No. Would you be, tied up with two
dialog: psychos in your house?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: It’s not your house yet, remember?
dialog: Besides, Jawari isn’t a psycho.
dialog: 36.
text: He laughs. Jawari laughs along with him.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: The worst thing Jawari has ever
text: done is sell skimpy bags of dope.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, I told you, man. I don’t sell
text: skimpy bags.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, now, my friend wouldn’t lie.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Your friend is a lying sack of
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Now, take it easy. There’s nothin’
dialog: wrong with turning a profit.
text: He looks down at Audrey’s lap.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Getting a little extra out of a
dialog: deal...
text: He puts his hand on her leg.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there?
text: He eases up her leg. Audrey, horrified, looks at Jawari.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, man, come on.
text: Rainy pauses, looks at Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You know something, Jawari? I’m
dialog: getting awful tired of your
dialog: blocking. What are you, Zorro?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Man, all we got to do is wait for
dialog: Bobby. You wanna fuck something
dialog: that simple up?
text: Rainy contemplates, then leaps off the couch. Walks around to
text: the other side of Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You’re a real killjoy, you know it?
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Just chill, man.
text: Jawari takes a draw with his back to Rainy. Rainy raises his
text: rifle, pointed toward the ceiling.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Why don’t you take a nap?
text: BAM! He brings the rifle butt down on the back of Jawari’s
text: head. Audrey screams. Jawari slumps forward, falls from the
text: chair into a heap on the floor.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, that guy was annoying. He’1l
text: be pissed when he wakes up.
text: He steps toward Audrey. She draws back, terrified.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please don’t hurt us.
text: He sits between her and Cheyenne again.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Don’t fret, darlin’. I wouldn’t
dialog: dream of forcing myself on you. You
dialog: know what I want? I want you to ask
dialog: for it. Go on. Ask for it.
text: Audrey is so nervous, she can hardly speak.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I -- I don’t know what you want me
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I want you to ask... for... it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You can. And you will.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Cheyenne. Can she leave...
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: No, fuck that. You can say it with
dialog: Cheyenne here. She’s too young to
dialog: understand anyway.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I can't.
text: Rainy stares at her long and hard.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Okay, then.
text: He turns a chair facing the doorway to the next room. Pulls
text: Audrey off the couch and sits her in the chair. Grabs some
text: rope and ties her ankles to the chair legs.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then you can sit here and see what
text: happens next.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please. I don’t know what you want
dialog: me to say.
text: Rainy grabs Cheyenne by the arm.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Maybe Cheyenne will ask for it.
text: He pulls Cheyenne off the couch. She breaks into tears,
text: scared to death, even though she doesn’t understand what’s
text: happening. Audrey is horrified.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No, please, just tell me what you
dialog: want me to say.
text: Rainy pulls Cheyenne along, toward the next room.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Come on, Cheyenne, let’s leave
dialog: Audrey to think about things.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please, I’ll say whatever you want.
text: Rainy forces Cheyenne into the next room, out of sight,
text: leaving Audrey not knowing what’s happening. Audrey screams
text: with tears streaming down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Take me! Take me!
text: Her pleas are met with eerie silence.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Take me! Take me! Take me!
dialog: 33
dialog: 39.
text: The silence is terrifying. Audrey can hardly speak from
text: crying. She makes one last desperate call.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Take me!
text: She finally breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably. Rainy peeks
text: back in the doorway, holding his hand over Cheyenne’s mouth.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, if you’re gonna beg...
text: He pushes Cheyenne down on the couch. Loosens the binds
text: around Audrey’s ankles.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew my charm would wear you
dialog: down .
text: Audrey's eyes meet Cheyenne’s. The girl is traumatized.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sweetie, I need you to be strong
dialog: for mama, okay? It’s going to be
dialog: all right.
text: Then... KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, at the front door. Rainy shushes
text: Audrey. He peeks out the window.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I think it’s one of those door to
dialog: door proselytizers.
text: He waits. There’s the sound of a pamphlet being left in the
text: door. Rainy shakes his head, steps to the...
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY 33
text: The man, DAVID, 30s, is walking away carrying a Bible when
text: Rainy opens the door. The pamphlet flutters to the porch.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What's this?
dialog: (picks it up)
dialog: Why, it’s a pamphlet. Whatever
dialog: could it be about?
text: A smile fills David’s tender face as he returns. He’s
dialog: innocent.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi. My name is David. I just wanted
dialog: to drop by to see if you’ve heard
dialog: the good news concerning our lord
dialog: and savior Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Do you know what country you're in?
text: David’s smile fades.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: It's a simple question, David. Do
dialog: you know... what country... that
dialog: you are in?
text: David digests, unsettled by the awkwardness.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: That's right. This is America.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re
dialog: getting at.
text: Rainy points down the road.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Did you see that church on the
dialog: corner down there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, the big one? It’s nice.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, it’s one of about a million
dialog: on damn near every corner in the
dialog: country. Do you really think you’re
dialog: gonna run into someone who’s never
dialog: heard of Jesus fuckin’ Christ.
text: David just stares speechless.
dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l tell you where you need to go.
dialog: You need to go to one of those
dialog: remote areas of Africa, with all
dialog: those crazy tribes that worship
dialog: tigers and shit. That’s where
dialog: you'll find people who’ve never
dialog: heard of Jesus.
text: David shakes his head, trying to focus.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay. I’m sorry to bother you.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Wanna know why Christians don’t go
dialog: to places like that to proselytize?
dialog: Because you'll get a spear in your
dialog: ass, that’s why. They’1ll make a
dialog: necklace out of your fucking head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’1l move on.
text: He starts to turn and sees...
text: Audrey in the window, horror all over her face. She mouths,
text: “Help me.” David turns away.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a good day, sir.
text: Rainy glances toward the window, suspicious. Audrey’s gone.
text: He leans back in the doorway. Looks at David walking away.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You saw something, didn’t you?
text: David turns around.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Don’t act stupid. You saw
dialog: something, didn’t you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
text: about. I’11l move on.
text: He turns away. Rainy grabs his rifle, walks out, pursuing.
dialog: 34
dialog: 35
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: That’s why I hate you people.
dialog: You'll lie like the devil the
dialog: second it suits you.
text: David turns, sees the rifle. Runs away. Rainy chases.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, now you’re gonna run away like
text: a little pussy.
text: Rainy gets close enough, RAPS David on the head. David hits
text: the ground, senses reeling.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I hate liars, David.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 34
text: Rainy shoves David, hands bound behind him, to the floor.
text: This is the living room with the large open space.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’m not trying to be an asshole. I
dialog: just want you to admit you lied.
text: He walks into the next room, still talking. David listens,
text: frightened, unsure what’s going to happen.
speaker_heading: RAINY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Audrey here did something to tip
dialog: you off.
text: We hear Audrey moan as Rainy grabs her. FOOTSTEPS approach.
speaker_heading: RAINY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Then you acted like you were
dialog: leaving when you were really going
dialog: for help.
text: Rainy tugs Audrey into the room, shoves her to the floor.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I asked you if you saw
dialog: something and you lied.
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 35
text: Cheyenne toils with her binds. She glances cautiously between
text: Jawari unconscious on the floor and the doorway to the next
dialog: room.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: 36 LIVING ROOM - DAY 36
text: David looks up at Rainy with a tight face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look. I don’t know what’s going on.
dialog: I don’t know why you didn’t just
text: not answer the door.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: This isn’t about me not answering
dialog: the door. This is about you lying
dialog: and not being able to admit it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, I lied.
text: Rainy kneels by David.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, now, that’s not a sincere
dialog: admission, now is it, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know what you want me to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yeah, there’s a lot of that going
dialog: around.
text: He stands, grabs the strap to his rifle to hold it secure.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want you...
text: He kicks David in the stomach. David draws in, groaning.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: +.. to admit...
text: Rainy kicks him again. And again. And again. While Audrey
text: screams for him to stop.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D) AUDREY
dialog: ++. you lied. Now is that... Stop it! Leave him alone!
dialog: so hard? Just... admit... Please! Stop it!
dialog: you lied.
text: Rainy finally stops, breathing heavily. Gazes down at David.
dialog: 37
dialog: 38
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want a little sincerity,
dialog: David. Is that too much to ask?
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 37
text: Cheyenne works to free herself. She’s halfway there. She
text: focuses on the gun. Resting on the table. Then...
text: Jawari groans. Cheyenne quickly hides her hands behind her.
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY 38
text: David looks up with watery eyes, completely sincere.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasn’t sure what I saw. I thought
dialog: I kind of knew. But I wasn’t sure.
dialog: I didn't know what I was going to
dialog: do.
text: He looks at Audrey, face filled with regret.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I don’t know if I would
dialog: have helped you. I wasn’t sure what
dialog: I saw. I probably wouldn’t have
dialog: gotten involved.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Did you hear that, Audrey? Mr.
dialog: Christian was just going to leave
dialog: you here to rot. It’s okay,
dialog: sweetheart. You still have me.
text: Rainy pulls David up to his knees.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you wish that prayer bullshit
dialog: really worked right about now,
dialog: don’t you?
speaker_heading: JAWARI (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, cowboy!
text: Rainy whirls to see Jawari pointing the gun.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: I ought to blow your head off.
text: Rainy steps back.
dialog: 39
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Come on, Zulu. You’re not mad at me
text: over that little bump on the head,
dialog: are you? I was just trying to get a
dialog: little time alone with my lady.
text: Jawari steps closer, still aiming the gun. Notices David.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Who the hell is this?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: That's my new friend, David. He
dialog: likes to preach the gospel when he
dialog: isn’t leaving women and children
text: behind to save himself.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I owe you a whack.
text: BAM! Jawari cracks Rainy on the head with the handle of his
text: gun. Rainy drops to the floor like a sack of flour. Jawari
text: feels his head, grimaces.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope his head hurts as much as
text: mine when he wakes up.
text: He turns toward Audrey and David.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: David knocked and he answered.
text: Jawari shakes his head, tries to think.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: All right. Let’s all go in the
dialog: other room. We’re gonna wait for
dialog: Bobby.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY’S OFFICE - DAY 39
text: Bobby stuffs papers in his satchel. His grandfather steps
text: into the room. Bobby pauses when he sees him.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What are you doing out of bed?
dialog: Where’s your wheelchair?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Needed to walk a bit. Get the blood
dialog: going.
text: Bobby goes back to filling his satchel.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Off on business?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I got somethin’ I gotta take
dialog: care of.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Busy man.
text: He makes his way to a chair, eases into it.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: When I was young, when I built all
dialog: this, I was a busy man. I had
dialog: nothing, and I wanted everything.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I know. You told me.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: My father told me, "If you wanna
dialog: make a million dollars, you’re
dialog: gonna have to do a million dollars
dialog: worth of work."
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I know. You put it in a frame
dialog: and hung it in your office.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Everybody thinks getting rich is
dialog: getting lucky. They think of
dialog: winning the lottery, or hitting the
dialog: jackpot, or picking the right
dialog: stocks. They don’t think about the
dialog: hard work. The sacrifice. They
dialog: didn’t see me digging wells,
dialog: shoveling mud so thick I couldn't
text: lift my boots out of it.
text: Bobby opens a desk drawer. Inside is a PISTOL. He glances at
text: his grandfather to make sure he can’t see, then sneaks it
text: into his satchel.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: They know who you are once you got
dialog: money, though, don’t they?
dialog: 40
text: His grandfather nods, preoccupied.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I worked so hard to make sure my
dialog: children wouldn’t have to. Now I
dialog: wonder if I did the right thing.
dialog: 47.
text: Bobby stops in the middle of closing his satchel.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why would you say that? We’ve got
dialog: money, don’t we? That’s power.
dialog: Nobody pushes us around.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I remember the thirst, Bobby. The
text: parched mouth and the blistered
dialog: lips. It was all about the land and
dialog: the pipes in those days. They
dialog: worked us like a chain gang.
dialog: Somebody else decided when you got
dialog: a break. When you got a drink. I
dialog: said to myself, one day I’m gonna
dialog: have all the water. I’m gonna dig
text: in this dirt until the land bleeds.
dialog: No one is ever gonna tell me when I
dialog: can drink again.
text: Bobby rounds the desk to help his grandfather up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Come on. Let’s get you back to bed.
text: His grandfather ignores him, lost in nostalgia.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: A man should have a right to drink
dialog: water whenever he wants.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I agree, but I gotta go.
text: Bobby's grandfather stands to go with him.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I remember the Bendix washing
dialog: machine.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY’S GRANDFATHER'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS
text: Bobby helps his grandfather walk to the bed.
dialog: on about the past.
speaker_heading: LATER 40
dialog: He’s still going
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: When you get old, things change.
dialog: You can’t stop it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I know.
text: Bobby helps him sit on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Your grandmother was right, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: About the vacation. She wanted us
dialog: all to go to the World’s Fair. Expo
dialog: fifty-eight. In Brussels. Your
dialog: father was just a boy. Your
dialog: grandmother said we needed to spend
dialog: time together as a family. I yelled
dialog: at her and gave her this spiel
dialog: about providing a better life for
dialog: us.
text: Bobby helps him lie back.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Now look at everything. My son went
dialog: to prison because he wanted money
dialog: the easy way. He didn’t want to
dialog: earn it. And water? You just turn
text: on the faucet. Nobody thinks twice
dialog: about it. Your grandmother is gone,
dialog: God rest her soul, and there’1l
dialog: never be another like her. And me?
dialog: I’m lying here taking my last
dialog: breaths, wishing I’d gone to
dialog: Belgium when I had the chance.
text: Bobby pulls the blanket up for him.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: They say nobody dies wishing they’d
dialog: worked more. But they don’t tell
dialog: you what you do wish for. All the
dialog: little things that meant nothing
dialog: before become so important.
text: Bobby frowns, impatient and disinterested.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 41
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I really gotta go, okay?
text: He moves toward the door, leaving his grandfather staring
text: wistfully at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: That's life, Bobby. Nothing becomes
dialog: everything and everything becomes
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 4l
text: Audrey and Cheyenne are on the couch. David sits in a
text: recliner next to it. Jawari is at the table with his gun on
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: This was just supposed to be a
dialog: simple job. All we had to do was
dialog: get the old man to sign the papers.
dialog: Now here we are with three
text: hostages. The old man is dead.
text: Jawari pauses, thinking. Audrey breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: If I sign the papers whenever this
dialog: Bobby gets here, will you let us
dialog: all go?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: That’s the plan. You can’t tell
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We won’t say anything. I don’t even
dialog: want the water rights. You could
dialog: have just asked me for them. I
dialog: can’t take care of all the pipes
dialog: and filters anyway.
text: Jawari gazes at her a moment, then laughs.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: We could have just asked for them.
text: He laughs harder. As it dissipates, Audrey takes a chance.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So how did you get mixed up in all
dialog: this? You seem nice.
dialog: 50.
text: Jawari stops laughing, looks at her.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Lady, don’t get the wrong idea. I’m
dialog: not that nice.
text: Audrey hesitates, still trying to gauge Jawari.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: What is this? You trying to use
dialog: psychology or something?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m just thankful for what you did.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Really? ‘Cause it sounds like
dialog: you're trying to get to know me.
dialog: Like maybe you think if I get to
dialog: know you, I’ll be more reluctant to
dialog: hurt you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It’s not like that.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You watch too much TV, Audrey.
text: Audrey decides it’s best to just stay silent. Jawari rises.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go to the bathroom. You
dialog: think you can stay here without
dialog: supervision while I do that?
text: Audrey nods. Jawari steps to the door.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: I can hear what’s going on out
dialog: here.
text: He steps into the next room. Audrey, Cheyenne and David
text: exchange nervous glances.
text: Audrey quietly rises, motions Cheyenne and David to come with
text: her. David balks. Audrey and Cheyenne sneak to the front
text: door. Audrey stops, notices David has stayed behind.
text: Their eyes meet. David shakes his head, trying to discourage
text: them. Audrey struggles to get her bound hands high enough to
dialog: unlock the bolt.
dialog: 42
dialog: 43
dialog: 51.
text: CLACK. It’s not that loud, but in this quiet room, and under
text: the circumstances, it may as well be pots and pans clanging.
text: Audrey manages to turn the doorknob.
text: CREAK. The door opening is like tires squealing in the
text: silence. Audrey opens slowly to mitigate the noise.
text: Finally, it’s open enough. Audrey backs out.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY 42
text: As soon as Audrey turns to run, she bumps right into...
text: Jawari. She gasps.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I knew I couldn’t trust you,
dialog: Audrey.
text: He ushers them back into the...
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 43
text: Audrey and Cheyenne step back into the room.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Can you blame us?
text: Jawari gestures for them to sit.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: No, but it means I can’t leave you
text: alone for a second.
text: Audrey and Cheyenne sit back on the couch. Jawari sits at the
text: table, rubs his face, disappointed.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, Audrey. I really do have to
dialog: shit, too.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I promise I won’t do it again.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You think I’m gonna trust you now?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: There’s no way I can know whether
dialog: or not it’s a trick.
dialog: 44
dialog: 45
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I know I can trust preacher. Damn,
dialog: preacher, I can’t believe you
dialog: didn’t even try to escape.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m trying to keep us alive.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Looked more like you were trying to

scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - LATER 44
text: Rainy rouses. Feels his head. Winces. Struggles to get his

scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 45
text: Rainy appears in the doorway, rifle trained on Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Zulu?
text: Jawari looks up, not the slightest bit scared.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Put the gun down. You’re not going
dialog: to shoot anyone.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: First off, I told you, it’s a
dialog: goddamn rifle.
text: He lowers the rifle, focused on a rant now.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: A rifle! Don’t you know the fuckin’
dialog: difference!
text: He holds the rifle up by the barrel.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: A rifle has a goddamn rifled bore!
text: It causes the bullet to come out
text: spinning! Like a football! A gun
dialog: has a smooth bore so its accuracy
dialog: is shit!
text: He aims the rifle at Jawari.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Secondly, I thought you knew me
dialog: better. What makes you think I
dialog: won’t shoot your ass dead?
text: Jawari picks the MAGAZINE for the rifle off the table, holds
text: it up for Rainy to see.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I took the bullets out. You’d think
dialog: a gun expert such as yourself would
dialog: have noticed his magazine was
dialog: missing.
text: Rainy spins his rifle over, sees the empty slot.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You’re done playing cowboy. From
dialog: here on, we just wait for Bobby.
text: Rainy stares a moment, then lowers the rifle, completely
text: changing his tune. Ambles toward Jawari.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Ah shit, I was just messin’ with
dialog: you. I wasn’t gonna shoot you.
text: Jawari grabs his gun, points it at Rainy.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Just have a seat. We wait for
dialog: Bobby.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Can’t I even sit at the table?
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: That’s too close.
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: Fine. I’1l sit on the couch with
dialog: Audrey.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: No.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: You sit on the couch.
dialog: (to Rainy)
dialog: You take the recliner.
dialog: 54.
text: David switches to the couch. Cheyenne scoots over to be in
text: the middle. Rainy saunters to the recliner.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fine. I wanted the recliner anyway.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I can’t believe the mess you've
dialog: made.
text: Rainy plants himself in the recliner.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Me? I was just having a little fun.
dialog: Like the old days. Rape, pillage,
dialog: burn and all that.
text: Rainy glances at the small wood-burning stove next to him.
text: There are several thin logs on top and a couple of larger
text: ones at the base. Rainy pulls out his balisong.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you mind if I whittle while we
dialog: wait?
text: He grabs a thin log. Slings the knife open by spinning it
text: gracefully around his fingers.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I thought you hated trees.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I do. That’s why I don’t mind
dialog: cutting them up.
text: Jawari sighs. Rainy idly whittles.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’‘ll carve you a little tiki
dialog: statue.
text: Jawari rolls his eyes. A few moments of silence go by.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Audrey? Want me to make you
dialog: something?
text: Audrey pauses, staring, not sure what to say. Turns away.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Just make your tiki statue.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I don’t think Jawari appreciates my
dialog: efforts. Besides, you’re much
text: prettier than Jawari.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t want anything from you.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, Audrey, that’s cold. That hurt
dialog: my feelings.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I doubt you have any feelings.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: That's not true. I’m a sensitive
dialog: guy. Really.
text: He’s met with cold silence.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me ask you something. If I was
dialog: just some guy you met. And you
dialog: didn’t know anything about me.
dialog: Would you even talk to me?
text: She turns her face toward him, still not answering.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: If I just walked up to you
dialog: somewhere and you didn’t know me.
dialog: If we talked, just about simple
dialog: things. And I didn’t do anything to
dialog: creep you out. What would you think
dialog: of me?
text: Audrey vacillates, uncertain, then softly answers.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You might fool me.
text: Rainy smiles.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I fool myself sometimes.
text: Audrey raises her chin, strong with a bit of defiance.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But I do know you.
text: The smile fades from Rainy’s face.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I know all I need to know. You’re
dialog: evil. You’re cruel and vicious.
dialog: You’re a monster. And I wouldn’t
dialog: want to talk to you. I wouldn’t
dialog: want to see you. I wouldn’t want to
dialog: have anything to do with you.
text: Rainy scowls, speechless for once. Jawari laughs. Rainy
text: glances angrily at him. Jawari keeps laughing as he pulls a
text: bag and rolling papers from his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You struck the fuck out, man.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Hey, fuck you, Zulu.
text: Jawari just laughs more. Starts rolling a joint. Rainy fights
text: to compose himself. When he calms down enough, it’s like
text: another personality washes over him. He chuckles.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s pretty good, Audrey. You
dialog: really got me. That’s funny.
text: He starts whittling again.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I’m gonna make you,
dialog: Audrey? A little giraffe. You like
dialog: giraffes, don’t you? Everyone likes
dialog: giraffes. I don’t know anyone who
dialog: doesn’t like giraffes.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I didn’t think there was anyone who
dialog: didn't like trees.
text: Rainy pauses.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I was in the woods for weeks. All
dialog: those trees became like prison
dialog: bars. Who’s ever had an experience
dialog: like that with giraffes?
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: Do you like giraffes, Audrey?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t have anything else to say
dialog: to you.

speaker_heading: JAWARI

dialog: completely.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Hey, let me have a hit off that.
text: Jawari digs out a lighter.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Nope. You stay over there.
text: Rainy eyes Jawari a moment. Smirks with a chuckle as he
text: resumes whittling. He focuses on Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What about you, shy one? Do you
dialog: like giraffes?
text: Cheyenne nods.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, a lot of people think
dialog: giraffes are weak because they got
dialog: those long necks. But did you know
text: a giraffe could kick a lion’s head
dialog: off?
text: Jawari laughs.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: A giraffe couldn’t kick a lion's
text: head off. Not with those bony legs.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: They're bigger than you think.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: They're not that big.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Their legs can get taller than a
dialog: man. Their hindquarters can get
text: bigger around than my waist.
text: Jawari keeps laughing as he blows smoke.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Rainy shakes his head.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I can’t believe you're going to
dialog: smoke that all by yourself.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Hey, man, you ever heard of paying
dialog: for it?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I paid for the beer.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I didn’t drink any beer.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: How much you want for a joint?
text: Rainy pulls out his (Notta’s) wallet. Slips out two dollars.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’‘1l give you two bucks.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Two bucks?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: How much you want?
text: Jawari starts rolling a joint.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I’1l take two bucks and you calm
dialog: the hell down, how’s that sound?
text: Rainy grins. Sets his sights on David.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: So what church do you belong to? I
dialog: know you’re not Mormon. They travel
dialog: in pairs.
text: He glances at Jawari. They both laugh. David speaks softly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Church of the Living Word.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What is that, Jehovah’s Witnesses?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It’s protestant.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 59.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What do they think about you being
dialog: a homo?
text: David looks up, stunned silent.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s what I thought. You know
dialog: that’s a sin according to your
dialog: bible, right?
text: David forces a response.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not gay.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Just like you didn’t see Audrey?
text: David averts his eyes, caught out.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you spent your whole life
dialog: trying to get away from it. I bet
dialog: you try and pray it away every day.
text: David insists.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No... I don’t... I’m not...
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: It’s in the eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can’t tell if someone's gay
text: just by looking at them.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yes, you can.
text: He leans a little closer to David, provocatively.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: They promised you inner peace, but
dialog: you didn’t get shit, did you? Door
dialog: to door in the hot sun for Jesus,
dialog: and all you get in return is hi and
dialog: bye on Sunday. Put your money in
dialog: the plate and see you next week.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. It’s more than that.
dialog: +e
speaker_heading: +H OF
dialog: *
speaker_heading: +e HFK OF
dialog: + %
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 59A.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You ever feel the Holy Spirit in
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A couple of times.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Ever speak in tongues? Allah ballah
dialog: ballah...
text: Jawari bursts out laughing. Tosses the joint to Rainy.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: There you go, man. Just mellow out.
text: Rainy sticks the joint in his mouth.
speaker_heading: JAWARI (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: his lighter)
dialog: I want this back.
text: Jawari tosses the lighter. Rainy catches it. Lights the joint
text: and takes a big draw. Blows smoke like all the tension is
text: leaving his body with it.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Ah. This is some fine green, my
dialog: friend. Not nary a crack or a pop
dialog: of stem nor seed.
dialog: 60.
text: He tosses the lighter back. Jawari catches it.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: I told you my stuff doesn’t have a
text: bunch of stems in it.
text: Jawari pulls out a small bag of cocaine. Rainy perks up.
text: Jawari spreads some of the powder onto the table top.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You need to borrow my knife?
text: Jawari pulls a switchblade from his pocket. Pushes a button
text: forward... FLICK. A blade springs out. Jawari grins.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: No, thank you, cowboy. I got a real
dialog: knife.
text: He starts cutting up the coke.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: A balisong is better than a
text: switchblade.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Come on, seriously? Think about it.
dialog: My flick to your click-clack. See
dialog: the difference? Two steps to one.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fan knives are more reliable.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: You push a button, you got a knife.
dialog: What could be more reliable?
dialog: Besides, everybody knows
text: switchblades are cooler than
dialog: butterfly knives. There isn’t even
dialog: a competition.
text: Rainy starts carving on his log.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You can’t carve a giraffe with a
text: switchblade. The blade’s too
dialog: flimsy.
text: Audrey interrupts...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Do you have to do all this in front
dialog: of my daughter?
dialog: 61.
text: Jawari pauses, almost as if he sees her point. Rainy blows
text: smoke right toward Audrey and Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You can’t get high off secondhand
dialog: pot smoke. If you could, we’d all
dialog: be high off Jawari.
text: BING. Jawari retracts the blade of his knife.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: It's just some coke. I’1l keep it
text: away from her.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’1l tell you what, Audrey. I’11
dialog: put out the joint if you’1l tell me
dialog: about yourself.
text: Audrey looks at Rainy, reluctant to agree.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What do you want to know?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What do you do for a living?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m a waitress. Now will you stop
dialog: blowing smoke at us?
text: Rainy takes a draw. Blows smoke at Audrey.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: After you answer some questions.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How many questions?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. Let’s say, five.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’ve already answered one.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Okay, then. Four more. Were you
dialog: ever a cheerleader?
text: Audrey is caught off guard.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’m asking the questions.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Were you popular in high school?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That's completely subjective.
text: Rainy wags his finger at her as he leans forward.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: No. No, see, it’s not. Whether or
dialog: not you were popular in high school
dialog: will tell me virtually everything
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How is that?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Because high school is where people
dialog: are shaped for the rest of their
dialog: lives. What you were then versus
dialog: what you are now tells me
dialog: everything.
text: Audrey muses over those words a moment.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Well, I don’t know whether I would
dialog: be considered popular or not.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yes, you do. People know whether or
dialog: not they were popular in high
dialog: school.
text: Audrey pauses, hesitant to answer.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I was valedictorian.
text: Rainy leans back excitedly.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I knew there was something about
dialog: you. And now you’re a waitress.
dialog: See, that tells me a lot. Did you
dialog: go to college?
dialog: 63.
text: Audrey answers with an air of sadness.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I went for a couple of years but
dialog: had to drop out.
text: Rainy puts the joint out. It’s nearly finished now anyway.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Look how much we’ve learned in just
dialog: four questions. You were
dialog: valedictorian. You dropped out of
dialog: college and became a waitress.
text: Rainy leans forward with a telling smirk.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: And don't think I didn’t notice the
dialog: wording. You “had to” drop out. Not
dialog: “I dropped out.” But “had to.”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It doesn’t mean anything. Lots of
dialog: people drop out of college.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Not lots of valedictorians.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It had more to do with money than
dialog: anything else.
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: A valedictorian who can’t get a
dialog: scholarship?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Is that your final question?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: No. My final question is...
text: He ponders. His eyes rest on... Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: My final question is, did you drop
dialog: out because you were pregnant?
text: Audrey gazes at him, stunned speechless. She looks at
text: Cheyenne. Cheyenne looks up at her mother.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Cheyenne is the best thing that
dialog: ever happened to me.
dialog: 64.
text: Rainy sighs, annoyed.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: That’s what every parent says.
dialog: That’s such a generic load of
dialog: bullshit.
text: He leans toward Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me tell you something, shy one.
dialog: People lie like lies will magically
dialog: turn to money. And no one lies more
dialog: than parents.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sounds like someone had a bad
dialog: childhood.
text: Rainy smirks.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Kids come from fuckin’. So don’t
dialog: act like you did somethin’ noble.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Do you have to talk that way in
dialog: front of Cheyenne?
text: Rainy shifts his focus back to Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Parents have babies for two
dialog: reasons. They can’t control
dialog: themselves sexually and babies are
dialog: cute.
text: Rainy’s aggression unsettles Cheyenne. Her eyes well up.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: But babies grow up. And as they do,
text: the shine wears off. Then parents
dialog: start resenting the burden. That’s
dialog: all parents.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Leave her alone.
text: Cheyenne starts crying.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s not true, Cheyenne.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: It is true. All parents reach a
dialog: point where they long for the
dialog: freedom they once had. They
dialog: secretly dream of all the things
dialog: they might have achieved if they
dialog: weren’t stuck.
text: Audrey looks at Cheyenne, desperate to comfort her.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s not true. I’ve never once
dialog: regretted having you.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: See, Audrey, you’re just like
dialog: everyone else. Why can’t you just
dialog: be honest?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You’ve had your last question. Now
text: it’s my turn to answer.
text: She looks down at a tearful Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: This is the truth, Cheyenne, I
dialog: swear. Yes, I’ve had regrets in
dialog: life. I’ve screwed up a lot of
dialog: things. But I screwed them up. Not
dialog: you.
text: She looks up at Rainy.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: It's true. I got pregnant in
dialog: college. I dropped out because I
dialog: couldn't afford it.
text: Nostalgia washes over her face.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I didn’t know what I wanted to do
dialog: with my life anyway. Motherhood
dialog: seemed as good a purpose as any.
text: Audrey's eyes meet with Cheyenne’s.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: It was the hardest thing I’ve ever
dialog: done. It was tough and I barely
dialog: scraped by. I thought so many times
dialog: I’d never make it. But I swear, I
dialog: never once regretted it.
dialog: 66.
text: Cheyenne faintly smiles. Rainy gauges Audrey, unconvinced.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: There’s something you’re not
dialog: telling us.
text: Cheyenne looks indignantly toward Rainy.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Why are you so mean?
text: Jawari laughs as he pulls out a straw.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Yeah, cowboy, why don’t you tell us
dialog: about your family?
text: He snorts a line of coke off the table. Sniffs and tweaks his
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’‘1l1 tell you about my family if
dialog: you'll give me a couple of lines.
text: Jawari nods.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Okay. I gotta hear this.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, I wasn’t no high school
dialog: valedictorian, I can tell you that.
text: He and Jawari snicker.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: My old man was a con artist.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Why am I not surprised?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: We travelled from place to place
dialog: all the time. I was helping him run
dialog: a shell game when I was only six.
text: Jawari laughs.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Little Rainy.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I remember he broke into a used car
dialog: lot office to steal keys one Sunday
dialog: afternoon. And some people showed
text: up thinking the lot was open. He
dialog: sold ‘em a car.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: He sold ‘em a car?
text: Rainy drifts off. Shakes his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: He filled out the paperwork and
dialog: everything. He even pretended to
dialog: call and check on their credit.
text: He looks up at Jawari, still in awe after all these years.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: The banks weren’t even open.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Damn, Rainy, your old man had a big
text: set of balls on him.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I asked him why he did it and he
dialog: just said, “I don’t know, I just
dialog: wanted to see where it went.”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Where was your mother?
text: Rainy snaps out of his trance, looks at Audrey.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I never knew her.
text: Jawari snorts another line. Raises his head, twitching.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: So you just ran around with your
dialog: dad? That’s pretty cool.
text: Rainy drifts off again. This time there’s something eerie
dialog: about the whole thing.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: When I was twelve, we broke into a
dialog: house to rob the place. There was
dialog: just supposed to be a woman alone.
dialog: My dad made me wait in the living
text: room. I could hear her begging.
dialog: 68.
text: Audrey swallows, nervous about where this is going. David and
text: Jawari both have the same look.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I heard these noises. I didn’t
dialog: really know what it was at the
dialog: time. Then her husband came home. I
dialog: ran to get my dad. When I opened
text: the door, I saw him on top of her.
dialog: He was so mad.
text: Rainy sinks deeper into the memory.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: He threw a pillow at me. Told me to
dialog: get out. I guess the pillow hitting
dialog: a lamp let her husband know we were
text: there. He got a gun.
text: Rainy’s eyes look as if he’s there, witnessing it all over.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I climbed out the window first and
text: hid in the bushes. I heard a shot.
text: I saw my dad hit the ground. He
text: just looked at me. His eyes were
text: open but I could tell he was dead.
text: Jawari gazes at Rainy, spellbound.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Wow. That’s fucked up, man.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I went to a state house. I’ve been
text: a menace to society ever since.
text: He chuckles. Stops laughing when David speaks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: “Put up again thy sword into his
dialog: place: for all they that take the
dialog: sword shall perish with the sword.”
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Is that from the Bible?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus said it. When they came to
text: arrest him, one of his disciples
text: cut off the ear of the high
text: priest’s servant. Jesus put the ear
text: back on and said those words.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Jesus put someone’s ear back on?
dialog: After it was cut off?
text: Rainy glares, fighting to contain a dark fury.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Give me some Kool-Aid and a glass
dialog: of water and I’1l show you how to
dialog: turn water into wine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus’s miracles are documented.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: By who? His disciples? The same
dialog: people who made a living off him?
dialog: That's a little like Copperfield’s
text: cable pullers claiming he can
dialog: really fly, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There were others. Jesus healed
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Ever hear of the immune system?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The immune system can’t make the
dialog: blind see.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Ever hear of a setup? You fake
dialog: stuff for money.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All those people wouldn't lie.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: ‘Cause people are known for their
dialog: honesty, right?
text: David pauses, musing. Looks away.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wanna see a magic trick? I bet I
text: can make a line of coke disappear.
dialog: (to Jawari)
dialog: What do you say, bro? Look, I’11
text: put the rifle down.
text: Rainy lays his rifle on the floor. Holds up the knife.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
text: I’‘1l put the knife down.
text: He sets it on the stove-top and shows his hand empty, front
text: and back. Holds up the log.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l put the log down.
text: He sets the log down NEXT TO THE KNIFE. Raises his hand to
text: show it empty, PALM SIDE ONLY.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I need something to help me relax
dialog: after all this emotional
text: outpouring.
text: As he says this, we move behind him where we see... the knife
text: blade is clipped between his middle fingers, hidden from
text: view. Jawari laughs, oblivious.
speaker_heading: JAWARI
dialog: Okay, come on. You earned it.
text: Rainy slowly approaches, hands still in the air.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Did I ever tell you why I was on
dialog: the run from the police when I
dialog: spent all those weeks in the woods?
text: Jawari shakes his head, holds a straw out. Rainy reaches for
text: it with his empty hand. With his other hand, he...
text: Flicks his wrist, slinging the knife into his hand.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Murder.
text: He grabs Jawari’s hand as he stabs him in the gut. Jawari
text: grunts, doubles over. The hostages stiffen, horrified.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I killed my ex girlfriend and her
dialog: lover. I had to change my identity
dialog: and everything.
text: He lets go. Jawari slumps over, leaving Rainy with a bloody
text: knife in one hand and the straw in the other. He snorts a
text: line off the table. Shakes his head, twitching.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what I’m talkin’ about.
dialog: 71.
text: Jawari shoves Rainy away. Grabs his switchblade and starts to
text: push the button. Rainy puts his hand over it...
text: BING. The spring releases but the blade doesn’t emerge.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: See, the thing about switchblades,
text: the blade has to lock.
text: He stabs Jawari in the gut again. Jawari grunts.
text: Rainy steps back. Jawari turns the knife handle upside down.
text: The blade limply slides out.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: If something blocks it on the way
dialog: out, it’s like a limp dick. I told
dialog: you balisongs were better.
text: Jawari carefully grabs the blade with index finger and thumb.
text: Pulls it out until it locks with a CLICK. He looks up at
text: Rainy, face pale. Sweating. Quivering.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s a matter, Zulu? You look a
dialog: little peaked.
text: Jawari raises his blade. The two men square off for a knife
text: fight. Rainy laughs playfully.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is one of those "what if"
dialog: scenarios, like what happens when a
dialog: shark meets a killer whale?
text: He waves his knife.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m the killer whale and you’re the
dialog: shark.
text: Jawari takes a meager stab at Rainy and misses. Rainy slashes
text: Jawari’s arm. Jawari yells.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like the killer whale is
dialog: winning.
text: Rainy stabs Jawari in the stomach. Twists the blade. Jawari’s
text: eyes have a look of certain death.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the same look my daddy had.
dialog: 72.
text: Jawari slumps to the floor by the table. Rainy kneels, wipes
text: the blood on the back of Jawari’s shirt.
text: When he stands, he folds the knife and puts it away. Snorts
dialog: another line.
text: He raises his head, sniffing and fidgeting. Audrey and the
text: others watch, panicked. Rainy picks up the magazine.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please don’t hurt us.
text: Rainy steps toward the recliner.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: My giraffe’s not good enough for
dialog: you, remember?
text: He grabs the rifle. Inserts the magazine.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’‘1l do anything you want. Just
dialog: don’t hurt Cheyenne.
text: David sits forward.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, there was no reason for this
text: to escalate to murder. There still
text: isn’t. He may still be alive.
text: Rainy glances at Jawari. Slides a round in the chamber.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Thanks for pointing that out,
dialog: David.
text: BANG! He shoots Jawari in the back. The hostages avert their
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is just sell-out central
dialog: around here today, isn’t it? First
dialog: Audrey drags you into it. Then you
text: try to weasel out of helping her.
dialog: Now you want to make sure Jawari is
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn’t mean it like that.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What you mean is to keep yourself
text: alive. Even at the expense of poor
dialog: Audrey and Cheyenne here.
text: He aims the rifle at David.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: So I‘1l tell you what I want you to
dialog: do. I want you to pick someone.
dialog: Whoever you pick gets killed and
dialog: the other two can live. Which one’s
dialog: it gonna be, David?
text: David fights to keep composed. Sweat beads on his forehead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t make that choice.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, but you must. You’re the one
text: who goes around door to door asking
dialog: everyone to make the most important
dialog: decision of their lives right there
text: on the spot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You better.
text: David's eyes dart around. His mind races for a way out.
text: Finally, he relents.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I won’t choose.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: All right, then. I’11 make you
dialog: choose.
text: Rainy trains the barrel directly at Cheyenne’s face.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No. Please. Don’t hurt my daughter.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Shoot me!
dialog: 46
dialog: 47
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Shut up! You’re too good for me!
text: Then... David leaps from the couch and runs. Rainy aims.
text: David reaches the threshold to the...
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM —- DAY 46
text: BANG! A bullet rips through his knee. David groans as he
text: tumbles to the floor. Rainy storms into the room.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You cowardly piece of shit!
text: He pulls David up, leans him against the doorframe.
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 47
text: Rainy tromps to Cheyenne and aims at her face again. Tears
text: stream down the little girl’s cheeks.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: (to David)
dialog: I’m going to count down from ten to
dialog: one. You're going to choose between
dialog: yourself and Audrey. If you don’t
dialog: make a choice by the time I get to
dialog: one, then your choice is Cheyenne.
text: Audrey bawls helplessly.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please don’t hurt my daughter.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Shut up! You don’t get a choice.
dialog: The choice is David’s. Are you
dialog: ready, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please...
text: David tries to move his leg. Yells in pain.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Here we go.
text: Audrey begs while Rainy counts. We cut back and forth between
text: the faces of all of them.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D) AUDREY
dialog: Ten... nine... eight... Please! No! I’m begging
dialog: seven... six... five. you. I’11 do anything. No!
dialog: 
dialog: four... three... two... Shoot me! Shoot me!
text: David softly murmurs...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shoot me.
text: Rainy pauses. Turns to David, lowering his rifle.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shoot me.
text: Rainy approaches him.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’m impressed. You finally grew
dialog: some balls.
text: He raises the rifle to David’s face.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l give you one last chance to
dialog: change your mind.
text: David looks at Audrey, his face quivering.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry. He’s right. I’ve been a
dialog: coward. I was afraid. I’ve been
dialog: afraid my whole life. Always
text: running away.
text: He looks up at Rainy, courage filling his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not afraid anymore.
text: Rainy braces the stock against his shoulder.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Look at the bright side. You won’t
dialog: have to go door to door no more.
text: Audrey's voice cuts across the room.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (0.S.)
dialog: I was raped.
dialog: 76.
text: Everyone turns toward Audrey. The room seems to freeze that
text: way for a moment.
text: Audrey fights back a flood of emotions.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: In college. At a frat party. I was
dialog: smart enough to get a scholarship
dialog: and dumb enough to think this guy
dialog: cared about me.
text: Her eyes turn glassy. Like she can see it all again.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I wanted to impress him. I was
dialog: nervous and I drank too much. The
dialog: music was so loud. There were so
text: many people. It was hot and stuffy.
dialog: I got nauseous, so I asked him
dialog: where the bathroom was. I remember
text: tripping on the stairs. He caught
dialog: me and we laughed at how tipsy I
dialog: was. I trusted him.
dialog: (getting more immersed)
dialog: When he pushed me on the bed, I
dialog: didn’t even know where I was at
text: first. The room was spinning. When
dialog: I told him to stop, he said it was
dialog: my idea. I remember his weight. The
dialog: pressure. I couldn’t move. I could
dialog: barely breathe. I felt like I was
text: in a coffin. But he wouldn’t stop.
text: She pops back to the present, glances around.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I turned him in to the president.
dialog: It was his word against mine and he
dialog: said it was consensual. When I
dialog: wouldn’t let it go, I was expelled.
text: She pauses, staring into empty space.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I just left. I just gave up. I
dialog: thought my life was over.
text: Tears well in Audrey’s eyes as they fix on Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: And then the day came when I saw
dialog: her. They put her in my arms and it
dialog: was like... she was magical or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: She was so small and frail and she
dialog: needed me to take care of her.
text: She looks up at Rainy, teary-eyed.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: So I carried on. The days went by
dialog: and things got a little easier.
dialog: Then one day I realized... she
dialog: saved my life.
text: Audrey turns sadly to Cheyenne. This is the big one. It’s
dialog: scary but it’s time to confess the whole story.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Thomas, the man you know as your
dialog: father, was my first husband. The
dialog: truth is, the reason he doesn’t pay
dialog: child support is because he doesn’t
dialog: have to. After we divorced, he
dialog: asked if he could still see you and
dialog: I said yes. He helped us for a
dialog: while but after he remarried, he...
dialog: he quit.
text: Finally, the floodgates give way and Audrey breaks down.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: He’s a good man. And I am so sorry
dialog: I lied to you. Your real father
dialog: doesn’t want anything to do with
dialog: you. I was too scared to tell you
dialog: the truth. Because I’m a coward.
text: Cheyenne’s eyes reach out with the kind of forgiveness only a
dialog: child can offer so quickly.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: You’re not a coward, Mom. I forgive
dialog: you.
text: Rainy sneers. He’s had enough.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, didn’t this all just turn
dialog: into family time. But it doesn’t
dialog: change a thing. David has already
dialog: agreed to go the Jesus route.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No one agreed to anything!
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: Audrey?
dialog: 48
dialog: 49
dialog: 78.
text: She looks at David. He’s filled with a calmness.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s okay.
text: Cheyenne manages to get her hands free. She looks toward...
text: the gun, sitting on the table.
text: Rainy raises the barrel toward David, braces the stock
text: against his shoulder once again.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yeah, see? He wants to do it.
text: Then... Cheyenne jumps from the couch, grabs the gun. It’s so
text: big comparatively, she can hardly hold it up. Audrey’s eyes
text: widen in horror.
text: Rainy grins.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you even know how to use that
dialog: thing, shy one?
text: BANG! Cheyenne wildly fires toward the ceiling, the kick
text: knocking her down. Pieces of ceiling fall on Rainy.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: shit!
text: While Rainy is distracted, Audrey leaps from the couch and
text: rushes at him, screaming. Shoulders him with all her might.
text: They both trip over David’s legs and...
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM —- DAY 48
text: They slam onto the floor. The rifle slides near a buffet
text: table. Rainy grabs Audrey and pulls her down. She kicks him
text: repeatedly. The kicks are ineffective and Rainy laughs.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, darlin’, stop it. You’re
dialog: turnin’ me on.
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 49
text: Cheyenne climbs to her feet, lugging the gun. David waves her
text: over with a nod. She hurries to him. He holds out his binds.
text: Cheyenne furiously tugs at them.
dialog: 50
dialog: 51
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 79.
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM —- DAY 50
text: Rainy climbs on top of Audrey, still laughing. Audrey is
text: fighting so hard, it’s about all he can handle.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I love a woman who can wrestle.
text: This goes on until... David raises the gun barrel to Rainy’s
text: temple, ropes still hanging off his wrist.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get off her.
text: Everything stops. Rainy stares at David. It’s quiet for
dialog: several moments. Then...
text: From outside, TIRES CRUNCH ACROSS GRAVEL. A car stops in
text: back. A CAR DOOR OPENS. CLOSES.
text: Everyone stays still and quiet. After a few moments, we hear
scene_heading: the BACK DOOR OPEN. FOOTSTEPS.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY 51
text: Bobby enters carrying a satchel. The first thing he notices
text: is Cheyenne. He looks at her, shocked.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Cheyenne.
text: Bobby notices David sitting in the doorway to the living room
text: with his leg bleeding.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: David.
text: Bobby sees Jawari lying dead on the floor.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the hell is going on here?
text: He steps so that he can see into the living room. He sees
text: Rainy on top of Audrey on the floor. He sees that David is
text: pointing a gun at Rainy.
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 79A.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Rainy?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Uh... we had some issues.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the goddamn hell is going on
dialog: here? What happened to Jawari?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: We got into it and I accidentally
dialog: killed him.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Shut up, Audrey! You don’t know
dialog: what the hell you’re talking about!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Where’s the old man?
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: He’s dead.
text: Bobby angrily throws his hands in the air.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Goddamn it! I told you not to kill
dialog: the old man!
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: He was already dead.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, where is he?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He died four days ago.
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: The will doesn’t get read ‘til next
dialog: week.
text: Bobby stares slack-jawed a moment. Glances at David.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why is this asshole pointing a gun
dialog: at you?
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: He got it while I was wrestling
dialog: with Audrey. She’s probably gonna
dialog: get the water rights next week.
dialog: 81.
text: Bobby reaches into his satchel.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: Then she can go ahead and sign.
text: He whips out his pistol, points it at David.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: First, you can put that gun down.
text: David starts to set the gun down on the living room side.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
text: On the other side. Over here.
text: David sets the gun down on the family room/kitchen side.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Slide it away.
text: David shoves the gun. It slides to a stop a few feet away,
text: near the door.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Rainy)
dialog: Get your gun.
text: Rainy grimaces.
speaker_heading: RAINY
text: It’s a rifle.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don’t give a good goddamn if it’s
dialog: Jawari'’s dick, pick it up.
text: Rainy sighs, stays on his knees and leans across the floor to
text: grab the rifle.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Untie her.
text: Rainy unties Audrey. Bobby puts his pistol back into his
text: satchel and pulls out a contract. Rainy hands it to Audrey.
text: Bobby holds out a pen.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sign it.
text: Rainy hands Audrey the pen. She doesn’t even try to read the
text: contract, she just signs it. Rainy hands the items back to
text: Bobby. He stuffs them into his satchel. Lowers the satchel by
text: David, who eyes it intently.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, what you may not realize is
dialog: that wills are retroactive. It
dialog: doesn’t matter when it’s read. The
dialog: date of ownership of bequeathed
dialog: items legally begins the moment the
text: decedent dies.
text: Bobby looks at Rainy with eyes of cold stone.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to leave now so you can
dialog: clean up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We were promised we'd be let go!
text: He scans between the two rooms, glancing at Jawari.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wanted things to stay simple but
dialog: as you’ve seen, Rainy is somewhat
dialog: of a loose cannon. I think it’s
dialog: best at this point to just clean up
dialog: and go home.
text: Then... David grabs Bobby’s satchel, pulls him into the
text: living room. Bobby trips over David’s legs, falls on top of
text: Rainy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Run!
text: Audrey climbs to her feet and jumps over David, grabbing
text: Cheyenne and pulling her along. As Audrey opens the door,
text: Cheyenne snatches the gun off the floor.
text: Rainy gets to his feet, rifle in hand.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Go get them. I’11 watch him.
text: Rainy jumps over David. As he does, David grabs his ankle and
text: trips him. Rainy hits the floor, scrambles to his feet. He
text: starts to kick David.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on. I’1l take care of him.
text: Bobby kicks David in his injured knee. David screams in
text: agony. Rainy scuttles out the door.
dialog: 52
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - GROUNDS - DAY 52
text: Rainy bursts out the door in time to see Audrey and Cheyenne
text: running away. He aims his rifle.
text: Audrey and Cheyenne barely make it behind the tree that Rainy
text: peed on earlier before... BANG! A bullet smacks a patch of
text: bark off the trunk. Rainy laughs.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fuckin’ tree!
text: BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG! He fires round after round as he
text: closes in.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE
text: Audrey, back to the trunk, holds Cheyenne tightly to her
text: while bullets riddle the tree. BANG, BANG, BANG! Pieces of
text: bark explode on both sides.
text: Then... silence. Audrey listens. Starts to peek when...
text: Rainy’s face pops up.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Boo!
text: Audrey flinches, screams, quickly tucks Cheyenne behind her.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m gonna miss you, Audrey. This is
dialog: the most excitement I’ve had since
dialog: my daddy tried to drown me.
scene_heading: BEHIND AUDREY
text: While Rainy talks, Cheyenne slips the handle of the gun into
text: Audrey’s hand.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, that and killin’ my ex
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: And her lover.
text: Rainy grins.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: And her lover.
text: He raises the rifle, calls to the house.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I got ‘em!
text: While he’s distracted, Audrey whips the gun around and points
text: it at him. Rainy does a double-take.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’ve got a gun too.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Audrey, Audrey, Audrey. I’m
dialog: disappointed in you. This is a
dialog: rifle.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m sorry. You have a rifle. And I
dialog: have a gun.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Thank you. But what you don’t
dialog: have... is the balls.
text: He starts to make a move. It’s cut short...
text: BANG! A bullet streaks by Rainy’s ear, leaving a trail of
text: blood across the side of his head. Audrey screams, taken off
text: guard by the recoil. Rainy yells as he’s thrown back. He hits
text: the ground with a thud.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Come on!
text: She starts to run. Cheyenne grabs the barrel of Rainy’s
text: rifle, jerks her hand back when it burns.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: It’s hot.
text: Audrey grabs her.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Let’s go!
text: They head for the barn. Rainy grabs the side of his head.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Audrey, you bitch!
text: Rainy stumbles to his feet. Starts for the barn. Notices the
text: tree. Angrily kicks it.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuckin’ tree.
dialog: 53
dialog: 54
dialog: 55
dialog: 85.
text: He turns and staggers toward the barn.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER 53
text: The door creaks open. Rainy peeks in cautiously. Steps in
text: just as cautiously, scanning the area.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I’m impressed, Audrey. I misjudged
dialog: you. That doesn’t happen often.
text: He steps further in, looking around, assessing. There's a
text: loft above on one side, long abandoned livestock stalls on
text: the other. A door out the back.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I forgot I was dealing with a high
dialog: school valedictorian.
text: He snickers to himself.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: You got guts, Audrey. And you’re
dialog: smart. And that’s a dangerous
dialog: combination.
text: He turns, certain she’ll give herself away.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you’re in here.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN’S BACK DOOR - DAY 54
text: Audrey waits by the side of the door with a shovel in her
text: hands. Breathing heavily, trying to keep as quiet as she can.
text: The gun is tucked into her pants.
speaker_heading: RAINY (0.S.)
dialog: You could have killed me. But you
dialog: couldn’t bring yourself to do it.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - DAY 55
text: Rainy nears the back door. He trains his rifle on the loft.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: You don’t have the kind of guts it
dialog: takes to kill a man. It’s the eyes.
dialog: Something about the eyes.
dialog: 56
dialog: 57
dialog: 58
dialog: 86.
text: BANG! He fires a round into the loft. It blasts a chunk of
text: the old wood into dust, tearing a hole through the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN’S BACK DOOR - DAY 56
text: Audrey flinches at the sound.
speaker_heading: RAINY (0.S.)
dialog: I sure hope shy one wasn’t in that
dialog: loft.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - DAY 57
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! Several holes are blasted into the loft.
text: Rainy turns toward the back door.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Where did you go, Audrey? Did you
dialog: go off into the woods?
text: He starts to step through the doorway.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's scary out in the woods --
text: Suddenly, the back of a shovel flies right toward his face.
text: PING! It smacks him square in the nose, knocking his head
text: back. He falters, hits the dirt. Audrey screams, charging in
text: with the shovel over her head. She levels it like an axe
text: splitting wood. Rainy puts his arms up to shield himself.
text: CRACK! Right across his forearm. Rainy yells. He tries to aim
text: his rifle while Audrey draws back again. Just as he aims...
text: Audrey screams, swings like a baseball bat.
text: WHACK! Knocks the rifle out of his hand and into a stall.
text: Rainy manages to grab the shovel’s handle near the scoop.
text: Audrey tries to pull it back. Rainy laughs.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m gonna bury you with this
dialog: shovel.
text: Audrey abandons the shovel, runs out the back door.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GROUNDS - DAY 58
text: Audrey runs for her life. Approaches a bush.
dialog: 59
dialog: 60
dialog: 61
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Cheyenne!
text: Cheyenne peeks out from behind the bush. Audrey grabs her
text: hand as she goes by.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s go!
text: The two of them head for the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN’S BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 59
text: Rainy totters out the door with his rifle. He sniffles from
text: his possibly broken nose and grunts from his busted forearm.
text: Not to mention the blood across his temple from the bullet.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE GROUNDS - DAY 60
text: Rainy staggers into the open, near the woodpile. Bobby hangs
text: out a window in the living room.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What’s going on out there?
text: Rainy calls out to him.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: I think I’m in love!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Quit fuckin’ around!
text: Rainy regains some composure, stomps off toward the woods.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Oh, I’m done playing.
scene_heading: INT. WOODS - DAY 61
text: Audrey and Cheyenne pause to listen.
speaker_heading: RAINY (0.S.)
dialog: The next two shots you hear are
dialog: gonna be the last!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He’s coming after us. Let’s go.
text: They turn and continue on, deeper into the woods.
dialog: 62
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY 62
text: Bobby pulls back into the house.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m tired of all this messing
dialog: around.
text: He sits on the buffet. David sits in the doorway. Sweat beads
text: on his face and his breathing has become erratic.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t believe you're going to
text: kill a mother and her little girl.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, well, you’re next, if that
dialog: helps you forget.
text: He chuckles. David turns away. Notices something.
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 63
text: By Jawari’s body. The switchblade.
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM —- DAY 64
text: David looks back at Bobby. Bobby pulls out a cell phone.
text: Glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wonder if I still have time to
dialog: file today with the Water Resources
dialog: Department.
text: He pauses, looking at David.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: The kid was probably just going to
dialog: be another nobody anyway.
text: Bobby starts dialing. David looks at the switchblade again.
dialog: Can he sneak to it before Bobby notices?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (phone)
dialog: Yeah, how late are you open?
text: He climbs off the buffet, leaving his satchel behind.
dialog: 65
dialog: 66
dialog: 67
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: How long does it take to process a
dialog: transferral of water rights?
text: He turns his back absentmindedly. David sees his chance.
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 65
text: David crawls across the floor toward Jawari.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (0.S.)
dialog: Oh really? So there’s really no way
dialog: I could make it today.
text: David grits his teeth, fighting the pain. Trying to do this
text: as stealthily as he can.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: So if I get there first thing
dialog: tomorrow morning, I could have the
dialog: rights in my company name before
dialog: the day is out?
text: David is almost there. Then he notices... eerie silence. He
text: pauses. Looks back at the doorway. Nothing. What is Bobby
text: doing? David waits. Waits. Then...
speaker_heading: BOBBY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s great. I can be there by
dialog: nine. Can I get your name?
text: The conversation is winding up. David hurries.
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY 66
text: Bobby turns around as he speaks.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thank you, Karen. I’1ll see you --
text: He stops cold when he sees the empty doorway.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tomorrow. Bye.
text: He shuts the phone off, eyes blazing. Rushes to the doorway.
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM / KITCHEN - DAY 67
text: David is at the front door, reaching for the knob.
dialog: 68
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Trying to escape? What’s the matter
dialog: with you?
text: Bobby kicks him. David grunts, slides down onto the floor.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t believe you thought you
dialog: could crawl away.
text: Bobby kicks him again. David groans, doubling over.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I should have shot you right from
dialog: the get-go.
text: He grabs David. Turns him over to pull him up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Go to hell.
text: David stabs Bobby in the leg with the switchblade. Bobby
text: screams as he falls back onto the floor with the knife still
text: stuck in his leg.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You son of a bitch!
text: David crawls toward the doorway to the living room. It takes
text: all his strength but he desperately forces himself.
text: Bobby grabs the knife handle. Screams as he pulls the blade
text: out. Struggles to climb to his feet.
text: David passes the threshold. Bobby lurches after.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You should have slashed my throat.
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY 68
text: David reaches the middle of the floor when Bobby limps in
text: with the switchblade.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You made the same mistake I did.
text: David climbs up the buffet. Reaches for the satchel. Just as
dialog: he touches it...
text: Bobby stabs him right in the back. David cries out. Falls
text: back to the floor. The satchel drops beside him. Some papers
text: slip out. The pistol slides out on top of them.
dialog: 69
dialog: 91.
text: Bobby draws back and stabs David in the back again. And
dialog: again. And again. Until...
text: KINK! The blade breaks off. Bobby sees the broken metal,
text: angrily tosses the handle away. He grabs the pistol. Uses the
text: buffet to pull himself to his feet.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you wish you'd killed me from
dialog: the start now, don’t you?
text: David strains to turn himself over. Looks up at Bobby,
text: quivering. He’s about to die and he knows it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t have any more regrets.
text: He relents and succumbs.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY 69
text: Audrey and Cheyenne hike through overgrowth. Climb down into
text: a large shallow pit, grown over with grass. In the middle,
text: Audrey stops. Looks around, confused.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: Cheyenne stops. Watches her mother.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I remember this. This is the
dialog: reservoir. Or it was.
text: She glances around again, double-checking.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: The reservoir was right here. I’m
dialog: sure of it.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What happened to it?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t know.
text: She scans ahead. Points.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: If I remember right, the creek must
dialog: be right over there somewhere.

dialog: 71
dialog: 72
dialog: 73
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER AREA 70
text: Rainy trudges along, searching. He pauses, noticing
text: something. A leaf about the level of his head.
text: He steps closer. Takes the leaf into his hand and sees...
text: blood. He feels his temple. The blood is his own. He smacks
text: the leaf aside in frustration.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Fucking circles!
text: He looks down a pathway. The depth of field contracts. The
text: trees appear to close in. Rainy shakes it off. Looks another
text: direction. The trees close in that direction too.
text: He looks another direction. Same thing. Then another. Once
text: again, the trees are closing in. He calls out.
speaker_heading: RAINY (CONT'D)
dialog: Audrey!
speaker_heading: AUDREY 71
text: Whirls, hearing him. She turns to Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: He’s gotten farther away. He must
dialog: be going the wrong way. Let’s go.
text: They head into a long stretch of woods, angled downward.
speaker_heading: RAINY 72
text: Runs through the forest like a madman. He trips over a root
text: sticking out. Smacks the ground. He raises his face, then
text: pauses, hearing something. The gentle WHOOSH of water.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: The creek.
text: He climbs to his feet, moves its direction.
speaker_heading: AUDREY 73
text: Reaches the edge of the creek, followed by Cheyenne. They’re
text: about twenty feet up and it’s a steep drop on both sides.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Should we go downstream? Maybe the
dialog: water isn’t as deep.
dialog: 74
dialog: 75
dialog: 76
dialog: 93.
text: Audrey studies the drop, covered with thick exposed roots.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No. I think the roots will hold.
text: She climbs down, stepping on roots like crooked ladder rungs.
text: Audrey pauses when she’s completely over the side.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay, Cheyenne. Be very careful.
dialog: I’'ll be right below you.
text: Cheyenne balks, extremely nervous.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I’m scared.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I know you are, sweetie, but we'll
dialog: be down before you know it.
speaker_heading: RAINY 74
text: Forces his way through small branches. Emerges at a large
text: creek bed. Smiles.
text: It’s much lower than where Audrey and Cheyenne are but the
text: bed covers a larger area. Rainy’s footsteps sink in the soft
text: bed as he approaches the creek.
text: Rainy drops to his knees at the bank. The creek flows
text: peacefully. Rainy splashes water on his face, upsetting the
dialog: tranquility.
speaker_heading: AUDREY 75
text: Keeps one hand free to catch Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Make sure you have your footing
dialog: before you take your next step.
text: Cheyenne reluctantly places her foot on a root. It slips off.
text: She screams.
speaker_heading: RAINY 76
text: Raises his face, looking upstream. Grins. Grabs his rifle.
text: Splashes across the creek to the other side.
dialog: 77
dialog: 78
dialog: 79
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: AUDREY 77
text: Clutches Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It’s okay. I’ve got you.
text: Cheyenne holds onto her mother, paralyzed with fear.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Climb onto my back.
text: Cheyenne hesitates. Tries to pull herself together.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on, Cheyenne. We don’t have
dialog: time. You can do it.
text: Cheyenne shakily climbs onto Audrey's back. Audrey navigates
text: the roots, struggling with the additional weight.
text: They finally reach the very narrow creek bed. The creek, on
text: the other hand, is wide and the water is rushing. Audrey
text: sets Cheyenne down. Surmises.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Are we going to cross it?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t think we have a choice.
text: Audrey climbs down into the water. It’s nearly waist deep.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
text: Climb on.
text: Cheyenne climbs onto Audrey’s back and Audrey wades across.
speaker_heading: RAINY 78
text: Follows the creek on the other side. The whoosh of water is
text: faster now. He treks uphill.
speaker_heading: AUDREY 79
dialog: Is right at the bank. One more step and she’1ll be there. She
text: loses her footing and falls forward. Cheyenne catches the
text: edge of the bank while Audrey goes under.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Mom!
dialog: 95.
text: Cheyenne’s face fills with panic. She pulls herself onto the
dialog: narrow bank.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom!
text: Audrey breaks the surface, gasping. Reaching for the bank.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom!
text: Cheyenne looks back and sees a root. She grabs it with one
text: hand. Reaches for Audrey’s hand with the other.
text: Smack! Their hands clasp. Cheyenne pulls with all her might.
text: Audrey claws at the bank. With Cheyenne’s help, Audrey
text: Manages to pull herself to the bank.
text: She climbs out of the water. Rests on the bank. Struggles to
text: catch her breath.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE (CONT’D)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: An undercurrent caught my foot.
text: Cheyenne looks at her mother, shaken by the whole thing.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Audrey nods, still catching her breath.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: All we got is each other.
text: Audrey smiles with tears of pride welling in her eyes.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s plenty. Let’s go.
text: They pull themselves to their feet. There’s another “root
text: ladder” going up the other side.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I think I can do it myself this
dialog: time.
dialog: 80
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You sure?
dialog: (off her nod)
dialog: Okay, then, go on. I'll be right
dialog: behind you.
text: Cheyenne starts climbing up the roots.
scene_heading: BANK/WOODS - MOMENTS LATER 80
text: Just as Cheyenne is about to reach the top...
text: A rifle lowers into her face. Her eyes widen. Audrey,
text: realizing Cheyenne has stopped, looks up to see... Rainy.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What do we have here? This is a
dialog: regular reunion. Speaking of, you
dialog: must have had your first high
dialog: school reunion by now.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I didn't go.
text: Rainy shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Well, that’s a shame. And you were
dialog: valedictorian. I would have thought
dialog: you would have felt obligated to
dialog: attend.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I couldn’t get the night off.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Waitress duty called, eh?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I would appreciate it if you would
dialog: stop pointing that gun in my
text: daughter’s face.
text: Rainy smirks.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Audrey, how many times do I have to
dialog: tell you? It’s a goddamn rifle.
text: He braces the stock against his shoulder. Desperate, Audrey
text: looks toward Cheyenne.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Cheyenne? It’s not hot right now.
text: Cheyenne’s eyes move to the rifle barrel. Rainy smiles
text: playfully, oblivious.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: Yes, it is rather nice out here by
dialog: the creek, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (to Cheyenne)
dialog: Push it up.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: When?
text: Rainy gets suspicious.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: What are you two talking about?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Now!
text: Cheyenne grabs the rifle barrel, shoves it upward. From
text: behind, Audrey reaches over and points her gun at Rainy. His
text: eyes widen.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: This is your last warning shot,
dialog: motherfucker.
text: BANG! Rainy grunts. Looks down. A bloodstain on his shirt
text: over his chest grows with the pump of his heart. He looks at
text: Audrey in disbelief.
text: Cheyenne pulls the rifle from his limp hand. It clangs down
text: the drop and splashes into the creek.
text: Rainy stands. Looks at his own blood on his trembling hands.
text: Struggles to speak.
speaker_heading: RAINY
dialog: If it... hadn’t been... for that...
dialog: fuckin’ tree.
text: He falls over the edge. Tumbles down the drop and splashes
text: into the water.
text: Cheyenne and Audrey climb up into the woods by the drop.
text: Audrey gazes down, stunned by her own actions. After a few
text: moments, she realizes something.
dialog: 81
dialog: 82
dialog: 83
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay, step back.
text: She motions for Cheyenne to clear some room.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: Audrey raises the barrel into the air.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: There needs to be two shots.

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: There went the other one.
text: He limps into the...
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY 82
text: He puts his papers back into his satchel. Puts his gun back
text: in. Takes the phone and dials.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY’S GRANDFATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY 83

speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BOBBY AND HIS GRANDFATHER ON THE PHONE

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It’s Bobby.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I was sleeping.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I know but this is important.
dialog: 99,
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Well, it damn well better be.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I got ‘em, Grandpa. I got the water
dialog: rights.
text: Grandfather recoils in disbelief.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You're jerking my chain.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No. I really got ‘em.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I don’t believe a word of it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It’s true. I swear. The old man
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Died? When did that happen?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Four days ago.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Four days ago! I can’t keep up with
dialog: it anymore. I wish I'd known. I
dialog: would have gone to the funeral. Or
dialog: sent flowers or something.
text: Bobby can’t wipe the smile off his face.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I got his granddaughter to sign.
text: Grandfather's face goes blank.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You muscled his granddaughter?
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who cares?
text: Grandfather asks more sternly this time.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Which one?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Audrey.
text: Grandfather thinks back. Nostalgia fills his face.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yes, Audrey. I remember little
dialog: Audrey. I haven’t seen her in
dialog: years. What’s she doing now?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who cares? We got the water rights.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You didn’t hurt Audrey, did you?
text: Bobby hesitates, just now realizing he may have screwed up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No. Of course not.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I'd be very upset if anything
dialog: happened to Audrey.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: She’s fine.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I always liked her. If I remember
dialog: right, she was the one who always
dialog: liked to rub my whiskers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fuck Audrey, okay? She’s fine.
text: Grandfather's face takes on a chilling tone.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Don’t talk to me that way.
text: Bobby turns immediately submissive.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I’1l smack your nose around to the
dialog: other side of your head.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t mean it.
dialog: Audrey's fine, okay? I’m just
dialog: tryin’ to tell you something.

speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can get the rights transferred
dialog: tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Listen, Bobby. You’re next in line.
dialog: If you screwed this up, it’s over
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I didn’t screw it up. It’s fine.
text: Bobby calls out to the next room.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Rainy, hurry up. I gotta get going.
dialog: You need to clean up before it gets
dialog: dark.
text: Audrey appears out of the shadows, aiming the gun. Bobby
text: freezes, shocked to see her. Audrey steps into the room.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hang up the phone.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: What’s going on, Bobby?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nothing. I’1l call you back.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Something's wrong, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No. Everything’s fine. I just gotta
dialog: get off the phone.

text: Bobby disconnects. Drops the phone in the satchel.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No one told you to drop the phone
text: in the satchel.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I’m sorry. You wanted the phone to
dialog: call the police?
text: Bobby starts to reach in. Audrey raises her gun higher.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Don’t.
text: Bobby stops, frowns. He steps into the open as Audrey steps
dialog: further in.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey, now, I didn’t kill anybody.
dialog: All I wanted was for you to sign
dialog: the papers. All I wanted was the
dialog: water rights. I just told those
dialog: guys to get the old man to sign.
dialog: When they found out he was dead,
dialog: they should have left. I didn’t
dialog: know what they were gonna do.
text: Audrey fixes the gun on Bobby. He stares down the barrel,
text: visibly shaken. Audrey’s aim is steady. Her face is sure.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I want you to reach in slowly. If
dialog: you want to live... take out the
dialog: phone. If you want to die... take
text: out the gun.
text: Bobby vacillates. Then he reaches into the satchel so slow,
text: it seems like forever. He nervously clutches something.
text: Audrey watches, wearing a poker face.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I’ve already got the
dialog: signature. So I guess there’s no
dialog: sense in any more violence.
text: He raises the satchel with his hand still in it...
text: BANG! Blood spatters as a bullet rips through his chest. He
text: groans, wildly raising the satchel into the air.
dialog: 85
dialog: 103.
text: BANG! He fires a round, blowing out the side of the satchel,
text: and into the ceiling. Pieces of ceiling rain down on him.
text: We follow him as he falls back in SLOW MOTION, his face
text: filled with disbelief. All the way until he hits the floor
text: with a RESOUNDING THUMP. Dead.

speaker_heading: CHEYENNE (0.S.)
dialog: Here I am!
text: Cheyenne comes running. Audrey looks at her like it’s the
text: most amazing thing she’s ever seen.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Cheyenne.
text: They run into each other’s arms. Hug tightly, trying to
dialog: absorb the moment for all it’s worth.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: I love you too.
text: They pull back with bittersweet faces.

scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: And so this concludes his last will

dialog: officially yours.
dialog: the folder.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m not sure if you'll want to live
dialog: in it now or not, given all that’s
dialog: happened. But it’s yours to do with
dialog: as you please. Are there any
dialog: questions?
text: Audrey and Cheyenne, dressed nicely, sit across from him.
dialog: Audrey is
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I didn’t hear you mention anything
dialog: about the water rights.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Water rights? Your grandfather got
dialog: his water from the district.
text: confused. This is news to her.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But I thought Grandpa’s water was
dialog: gravity fed from a creek. I
dialog: remember playing around the
dialog: reservoir when I was a kid.
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Yes, when you were a child, maybe.
dialog: But he switched to district water
dialog: over twenty years ago. He was too
dialog: old to maintain the pipes.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Then who owns the water rights?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: The state. The law is that if water
dialog: rights aren’t exercised for five
dialog: years or more, they go into
dialog: forfeiture.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Did Grandpa know this?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: I don’t know. He would have been
dialog: nearly eighty when it went into
dialog: forfeiture. It’s entirely possible
dialog: he couldn’t read or understand the
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t think he did. So Grandpa
dialog: couldn’t have sold the water rights
dialog: even if he wanted to?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: He could have gotten them from the
dialog: state. Anyone could.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You mean those rights were up for
dialog: grabs for anyone who wanted them?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: Yes, anyone.
text: Audrey stares, completely flabbergasted. She can’t process
text: it. Mr. Pendleton becomes concerned.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: She doesn’t answer. She just stares, distant.
speaker_heading: MR. PENDLETON (CONT’D)
dialog: Audrey?
text: Finally, Audrey breaks down. She buries her face in her hands
text: and cries. It upsets Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What’s wrong?
scene_heading: MR. PENDLETON
dialog: It'll be all right. You can sell
dialog: off some of the trees to the
dialog: sawmill. That should get you by.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: Don’'t cry, Mom.
text: As Audrey's “crying” progresses, it becomes more and more
text: evident that she’s not crying at all. She’s laughing.

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m not crying, sweetie.
text: She raises her face. She’s on the verge of crying, but
text: laughing nonetheless.
speaker_heading: CHEYENNE
dialog: What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
