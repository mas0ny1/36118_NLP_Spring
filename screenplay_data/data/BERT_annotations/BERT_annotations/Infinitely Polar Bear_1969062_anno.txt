text: At the top of the hill there is a boulder. It catches his

text: Laid out on the surface of the rock is a cheap fake beard.
text: He looks around. There is not a person or a building in
text: sight. The tall grass bends in the wind.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE. DAY
text: Cam, now wearing the fake beard, stands on the rock, gazing

scene_heading: INT. CHILDS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: In the darkness, we hear:
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: Girls, wake up. Wake up.
text: A flashlight clicks on. It swings between two sleeping
dialog: children.
text: Two bi-racial girls are sprawled out asleep on their beds.
text: AMELIA is ten; FAITH is eight. Cam shakes them.
text: waking. He pulls their twisted covers off.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Rise and shine.
dialog: They resist
text: Finally they sit up. They blink at him, disoriented,
text: shielding their eyes from the glare of the flashlight.
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy birthday, Amelia.
text: Amelia turns on her bedside lamp.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: It’s not my birthday.
text: Cam is disheveled and dirty, still wearing the tweed riding
text: jacket, jodhpurs, riding boots and fake beard.
text: wide, wet and burning.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You look ridiculous. Why are you
dialog: wearing that beard?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Do you like it?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Then it’s history!
text: He rips off the beard and throws it to the floor.
text: eye him warily.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Where were you last night? Mommy
dialog: was worried.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You smell like mothballs.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Good nose, Faithie. This riding
dialog: outfit belonged to Great-Grandpapa.
dialog: We’re exactly the same size.
text: Cam admires the craftsmanship of the jacket.
text: His eyes are

speaker_heading: CAM

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Where’s Mommy?
speaker_heading: CAM
text: Sleeping. Shhh.
text: Faith collapses back onto her pillow, whimpering.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL. DAY
text: Cam, without the fake beard, marches up the hill as the sun
text: comes up. His daughters hurry behind him, still half-asleep.
text: They both wear sweaters over their nightgowns. He stops to
text: look at the sunrise and takes a long drag on his cigarette.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It’s going to be one hell of a hot
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm freezing.
text: She looks like she’s going to cry.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Take my jacket, Faithie. I don’t
dialog: need it. Are you cold, Amelia?
text: He puts his jacket on Faith. Teeth chattering, Amelia shakes
text: her head no. Cam pats her approvingly on the head.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Tough cookie.
text: She smiles with pride, shivering.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST. DAY
text: Cam and the girls traipse through the woods, each one of them
text: searching for something on the ground. Sunlight filters
text: through the hundred-year-old trees. The air is humming and
text: buzzing. It feels like summer.
dialog: 4.
text: Suddenly Cam kneels by a rotten tree trunk. He gives a sharp
speaker_heading: WHISTLE.
text: His daughters run to him. The ground is covered with bright
text: orange chanterelles. They are beautiful. They seem to glow
text: in the shade of the tall trees. The girls are mesmerized.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I wish I had a gown that color.
text: He holds out his hand and they each slap him five, laughing.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - KITCHEN. DAY
text: The chanterelles sizzle in a cast-iron pan. Cam stirs them
text: gently, still wearing the jodhpurs but no jacket or shirt.
text: He also wears a battered old gray fedora with a small freshly-
text: picked flower stuck in the band. A cigarette dangles from
text: his lips. His gut hangs out. An attractive African-American
text: woman in her mid-30s leans against the kitchen counter. She
text: wears a housecoat. She looks tired. This is MAGGIE.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s what education should be
text: about. Hands-on, in the field.
dialog: (calling loudly)
dialog: You girls are fierce mushroom-
dialog: hunters!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: They're in bed. Exhausted.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It’s good for them to see the
text: sunrise. They’re too stuck in
text: their cozy little routines.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They're ten and eight.
text: A long loaded silence. Then:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You haven't been taking your
dialog: lithium.
text: Cam picks up the cast iron pan and slams it down hard on the
text: burner. Maggie jumps and screams, startled. She turns and
text: hurries away.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: God damn it!
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: Toys are scattered everywhere. A coffee table lies on its
text: side. Cam holds a pack of cigarettes in each hand. His face
text: is enraged. Maggie rushes away from him. He follows her.
text: The girls watch from the upstairs landing.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: My grandfather started the Harvard

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m calling Dr. Wendell.
text: Cam steps in front of her and smashes the phone out of the

speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We live in this house --
text: He jabs his finger in her face.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You're just like my parents. You
dialog: want to keep me doped! Depressed!
dialog: Fat! Slow! You’d neuter me if you
dialog: could!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (like speaking to a child)
dialog: Your parents let us live in this

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: To hell with the house then! I’m
dialog: not going to let my goddamn parents
dialog: use it as a choke chain!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: How could you not take it?! How
dialog: could you do that to us?!
text: He suddenly drops to his knees, maudlin and melodramatic and
text: overcome with sincere emotion. He holds onto her housecoat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It kills me, Maggie. The girls and
dialog: I had a beautiful morning. It was
dialog: magical. That doesn’t happen when
dialog: I take my lithium.

speaker_heading: CAM (cont'd)
dialog: Don’t you understand? Please tell

text: He looks so desperate that she wants to say she understands.
text: But she can’t. He reacts with another 180-degree turn, back
text: to anger. He pounds the floor repeatedly.
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what? Forget it. I’m
dialog: going to find someone who gets it.
dialog: Who gets me!
text: Cam turns and rips open the front door. He marches down the
text: sloping lawn, swiftly and stiffly like a soldier.
text: Maggie runs to the open door.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That’s just an excuse to get laid!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (without looking back)
dialog: It’s a chance to be understood!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: By getting laid!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Boo hoo hoo! Poor bourgeois Maggie

scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY. LATER
text: Maggie, wearing a crochet dress and knee-high boots, throws
text: garbage bags stuffed with clothes and toys into the trunk of
text: a pale blue Saab. The two little girls watch their frantic
text: mother. Amelia holds the entire “Little House on the
text: Prairie” series; Faith hugs eight different Barbie Dolls.
text: Cam appears at the end of the long driveway, riding his
text: bicycle uphill. He is now wearing a red Speedo, thin-soled
text: canvas tennis shoes, and a red bandana tied around his neck.
text: It is a ridiculous get-up. When he sees Maggie, he starts
text: shouting.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hey! Hey! Hold it, god damnit!
dialog: Hold it!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (to her daughters)
dialog: Get in, get in!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That is my car and those are my
dialog: children! Feeble, Maggie, pretty
dialog: fucking feeble!
text: He pedals faster as Maggie pushes her daughters into the car.
text: She dives in after them, pulls the door shut and locks all
text: the doors.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB. SAME TIME
text: Cam races up and crashes his bike hard into the car. He and
text: the bike go sprawling. Maggie and the girls scream.
text: Maggie slides into the driver’s seat and fumbles for the
text: right key. She drops her key ring on the floor.
text: Cam circles the car, gesturing wildly. He sounds faraway
text: through the glass but he is roaring. The girls stare at him.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Goddamnit, Maggie! I am aman! I
dialog: am aman! Men like to screw!
dialog: That’s what we do!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Amelia, Faith. Cover your ears.
text: They don’t. They watch in disbelief as Cam pounds his chest
text: and roars unto the skies:
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s why we have balls!
text: Then he rips open the hood and reaches into the engine.
text: Maggie finds the right key, puts it in the ignition and turns
text: it. Nothing. She turns it again. Nothing.
text: Cam slams the hood down and grins through the windshield. He
text: comes around to her driver’s side window. His eyes are
text: bright and wet and insane. He holds the distributor cap.
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m never going to let you go. I
dialog: love you all too much.
text: Both girls stare at him, completely still. Cam looks back at
text: them and sees their terrified faces looking out at him and
text: his face changes. A profoundly sad expression comes over
text: him. An expression of regret.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: He staggers backwards, puts his hands in front of his face
text: and sinks to the driveway cross-legged. He doesn’t move.
scene_heading: INT. SAAB. LATER
text: Maggie sits in the backseat, between the girls. Faith is on
text: her knees, braiding her mother’s hair. Amelia looks out the
text: window. Cam hasn’t moved. His bare shoulders are beet red.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: He’s sitting on the gravel and all
text: he’s wearing is a bathing suit.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Sweetie, your father is very sick
dialog: right now. He’s not himself.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: He’s really sunburned.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Listen. Look at me.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t want you to tell your
dialog: friends or teachers about any of
dialog: this. We know your father’s a good
dialog: person and he would never hurt us,
dialog: but it’s hard for people to
dialog: understand and it’s very sad.
dialog: Okay? Okay?
text: Amelia nods.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY. DUSK
text: Two policeman lay a blanket over Cam’s shoulders and help him
text: into the back of their police car. Cam is docile and does
text: not resist. The girls watch from an upstairs bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. MCLEAN HOSPITAL VISITING ROOM. DAY
text: Maggie and the girls sit side-by-side on the couch of the
text: visiting room of McLean Hospital.
dialog: 9.
text: Amelia is engrossed in “Watership Down.” Faith is making two
text: Barbie dolls kiss passionately and whispering. The room is
text: pale green, filled with tranquil watercolors.
text: A nurse holds the door open. Cam enters. He moves slowly
text: and he is hunched over, bloated and slow. He has a shaggy
text: beard. He wears an oversized stained t-shirt with an idiotic
text: logo and sweatpants. His hands tremble.
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: Daddy!
text: They run to him and hug him around the waist. He pats their
text: heads with swollen hands. His speech is thick and slurred.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Little. Big Little. I loved your
dialog: letters. I’m feeling much better.
text: They are disturbed by his appearance.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Your stomach is really big.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That's the medication they put me
dialog: on. Doesn’t hurt. Go on, hit it.
text: He stands tall and sticks his lithium gut out. They shake
dialog: their heads.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Come on. Pound on it.
text: He slaps it again to show how hard it is. Amelia punches him
text: half-heartedly in the stomach. He tenses his muscles.
speaker_heading: CAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Harder. Let’s go.
text: Amelia complies with a flurry of little fists. Cam shuffles
text: away from her.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Okay, okay. Remember. Never do
dialog: that when Harry Houdini’s not
dialog: ready. That’s how they killed him.
text: Cam sits down across from Maggie and indicates for the girls
text: to climb into his lap. They do. He lights a cigarette with
text: unsteady hands and smiles at Maggie through the smoke.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You're a sight for sore eyes.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What happened to the clothes I
dialog: brought you?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: There were too many buttons on
dialog: shirts. And...
dialog: (searching)
text: ...latches on pants.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: I feel great.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You seemed better last week. Are

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Yeah, they're trying something new

dialog: (standing up)
dialog: I want to sit down.
text: Cam starts shuffling around the room again.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I want to sit down. I want to be
dialog: home with my family.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You will, Daddy!
text: Cam smiles at them. Then, abruptly, he starts to sing,

speaker_heading: CAM

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX. DAY
text: Two large brick apartment buildings face each other across a
text: parking lot. It is an urban environment.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. DAY
text: Maggie and the girls look around a vacant two-bedroom
text: apartment. It is clean and bright and sunny. Maggie nods at
text: the SUPERINTENDENT.
text: Amelia looks very worried. Maggie goes to the window and
text: points, trying to be upbeat.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Look, girls. There’s a swimming
dialog: pool. It’ll be open in the summer.
text: Amelia looks out. In between the two matching apartment
text: buildings is a pool enclosed by a chain link fence. Next to
text: the pool area is a concrete “park” area with metal picnic
text: tables. Across from the building they are in is the other
text: building, staring back at them.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy loves swimming.
text: Maggie doesn’t respond.
scene_heading: INT. WALDEN STREET APARTMENT - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM. DAY
text: Maggie and the girls have moved in. The apartment is clean
text: and spare. Marimekko prints cover simple Swedish furniture.
text: The sunniest corner is full of hanging plants. Maggie has
dialog: made it pleasant.
dialog: 12.
text: Maggie is in the kitchen cooking dinner.
text: The girls sit at the dining room table. Amelia is doing her
text: math homework. Faith wears an all-lavender outfit and she is
text: carving a flower design into the antique mahogany table with
text: the pointy handle of a fork.
text: They pepper Maggie with questions and complaints.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: The roof lights come in our window
dialog: at night and it’s too bright. I

speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Maybe I can make a curtain for your

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Mommy, they’re huge security

speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Amelia, I also wish we could've

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Your job here isn’t good.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m going to find a better one.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why can’t Daddy live here with us?
speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Your father is still recovering

speaker_heading: FAITH

scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN
text: Maggie sighs heavily.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Girls, let’s have a little quiet.
text: A few moments of quiet.
text: IN THE DINING ROOM
text: Amelia watches as Faith digs in to the table harder and with
dialog: more determination.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy told me they injected him
text: with Thorazine at the hospital and
text: it made him bite the insides of his

dialog: with blood.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
text: It’s still quiet time.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What’s Thorazine?
text: Maggie comes out with two bowls of pasta and sees what Faith
text: has been doing. She drops the bowls down on the table and
text: grabs Faith by the shoulders.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Faith! What are you doing? Why
dialog: would you do that? Why would you
dialog: do that?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It’s a flower. It’s pretty.
text: Maggie sinks into a dining room chair, lays her head on the
text: table and sobs. After a moment, the girls take their pasta
text: bowls and start eating in silence.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Now we're being quiet, Mommy.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah, Mommy, now we’re being quiet.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: It is raining. Faith and Amelia, both wearing backpacks,

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY. DAY
text: Amelia trudges alone down an alley.
scene_heading: EXT. DESOLATE PARK. DAY
text: Amelia cuts through a public park.
scene_heading: EXT. VINYL-SIDED HOUSE. DAY
text: Amelia approaches a three-story house. She rings the

text: answers the door. He has an unfriendly, suspicious manner
text: and bad skin.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: My father... lives here?
scene_heading: INT. SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY. DAY
text: Amelia passes a fidgety woman with a bowl haircut. She stops
text: and stares at the closed door to her father’s room. There is
text: a home-made poster taped to the door which reads:
dialog: You say INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY,
dialog: I say WE ARE NOT ALONE.
text: Also taped to the door is a National Geographic picture of a
text: gorilla. She knocks.
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: Yes?
text: She opens the door. Cam sits over the various parts of a
text: camera, unshaven with a cigarette in his mouth. He wears
text: jeans and a green sweatshirt that says “Vermont”. His room
text: is filled with moving boxes stacked floor to ceiling. He
text: stands, surprised to see his bedraggled daughter.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Darling! Poor little draggletail.
text: He tosses the cigarette into a Styrofoam coffee cup and puts
text: it on a table with many other old half-filled cups with
text: cigarette butts in them. He kneels down to hug her.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m going to make you some soup.
text: He picks her up in his arms and carries her down the stairs.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. HALFWAY HOUSE KITCHEN. DAY
text: Amelia's clothes hang over the hissing radiator, drying off.
text: Cam stirs soup on the stove. Amelia sits at the table

text: arranges them on a plate.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What’s my plan? My plan is... get
dialog: a job. That’s number one.
text: Amelia nods her approval.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I'll get out of this halfway house
dialog: and get my own apartment. Then you

dialog: I’ll make crepes for breakfast and
dialog: dinner.
text: Amelia nods her approval.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And then I’11l move back in with you
dialog: and Faith and Mommy. That is, if
dialog: Mommy will have me.
text: He holds the plate of biscuits out to her. She takes one.
speaker_heading: AMELIA

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That's the nicest thing anyone’s
dialog: ever said to me.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Mommy says you have a drinking
dialog: problem.
text: Cam bristles, offended.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Most people I know drink far more

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I think if you could stop drinking
dialog: and take your lithium then Mommy
dialog: would let you come home.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (sighing deeply)
dialog: I don’t think Mommy loves me
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But she says she loves you!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Really? Does she say it a lot?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: She always says she loves you. But
dialog: that it’s hard to live with you
dialog: when you refuse to face up to your
dialog: adult responsibilities.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: Do you think Mommy should be
dialog: confiding in you like this?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: The thing is I can see all this
dialog: from Mommy's point of view. I
dialog: certainly understand why she slept
dialog: with Jake Beal after the Walden
dialog: Pond incident. Sleeping with Will
dialog: Bronson was pushing it, but I still
dialog: forgive her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But Mommy says you slept with
text: somebody in the hall closet during
dialog: a party when I was eight months
dialog: old. She says you started it.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: I was manic. I was high as a kite
dialog: when I did that. I never had a
dialog: prolonged affair like everybody
dialog: else seems to do!
text: Amelia looks down and reaches for another biscuit. Cam
text: sighs, sorry and sad.
speaker_heading: CAM

speaker_heading: AMELIA

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Walked.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: All the way from school?

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I think we should find a therapist

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Do you think that’s something your

speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’1l ask them.

text: Maggie looks sad and tired. Cam puts his arm around her and
text: Maggie leans into his shoulder. Amelia walks into the
text: kitchen and puts her arms around both parents, joining them
text: in this sweet moment. They smile down at her. Then Maggie
text: deflates.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I forgot the laundry --
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We'll get it!
text: She pushes her parents together and runs from the room.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. MOMENTS LATER
text: The apartment door slams. Amelia and Faith walk down the
text: hall with a hamper. They look at each other hopefully.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRS NEAR LAUNDRY ROOM. NIGHT
text: Amelia and Faith walk away from the laundry room with their
text: hamper full of clothes. Three children are playing cards on
text: the stairs in the hall. KIM, 10, and ALI, 8, are Korean
text: sisters. Also with them is THURGOOD, 12, who is black and
text: very tall, friendly and fey.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I’m Kim. This is Ali. This is
dialog: Thurgood. We live on the ninth
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: (with a floppy wave)
dialog: Hey there.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I’m Amelia and this is Faith.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You guys go to Lincoln?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: No. We go to Peabody.
text: Kim squints angrily.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Peabody is the best public school
dialog: in the city. We’re not in the
dialog: Peabody School district.
dialog: 20.
text: Thurgood puts his hand to his mouth, mock afraid.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: (sing song)
dialog: Uh oh. Somebody’s telling a big
dialog: fat fib!
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: If you live here, you’re supposed
text: to go to Lincoln. A school that is
dialog: totally one hundred percent
dialog: terrible.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: Unless you like getting your ‘A’
text: kicked by Irish kids.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don’t want to get my ‘A’ kicked.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: Honey, nobody does.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Well... we go to Peabody.
text: As Amelia and Faith struggle up the stairs with their hamper:
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You don’t get it. What you’re
dialog: doing is illegal. And it’s not
dialog: fair. It’s not at all fair. You
dialog: guys are going to go to jail.
text: Amelia and Faith hurry away. Faith looks back.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Bye.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: The family sits at the table, having finished the dinner Cam
text: made. Music plays on the record player.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What if someone asks me where I
dialog: live? I don’t want to lie.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Peabody is the best public school
dialog: in the city --
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I don’t care. I don’t want to lie.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You're not lying, sweetheart. Your
text: mother is lying.
text: Maggie furrows her brow at him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don’t want to go to Lincoln!
dialog: They said we’re going to get beat
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Don’t worry, Faithie. I’11 teach
dialog: you how to fight.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What if my teacher finds out I’m
dialog: lying?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Miss Kendricks loves you. You're
dialog: her best student.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (wailing)
dialog: They said we'd get our ‘A’ kicked
dialog: by Irish kids!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You're not going to get your ‘A’
dialog: kicked --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (riled up)
dialog: -- you'll be kicking ‘A’!
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: If you want us to go to the Peabody
dialog: School so bad, why didn’t we move
dialog: into the Peabody School district?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We can’t afford the Peabody School
dialog: district. We’re lucky to have
text: gotten a rent-controlled apartment.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But Daddy’s family is so rich --
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: Yes, but we have no money! Can you
dialog: girls understand that! We have no
dialog: money! I send out my resume and I
dialog: get nothing! I just spent my last
dialog: twelve dollars! You want to be
dialog: poor and get a bad education?
text: The neighbor below bangs very angrily on the ceiling. They
text: all sit in silence. Then:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Seconds, anyone?
text: Faith holds out her plate. Cam serves.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Thank you, Cam, for this delicious
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Could be like this every night...
text: Maggie stiffens.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That would be nice, but I need a
dialog: husband, not a wife.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I'd like to be a husband but my
dialog: wife won’t let me.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Girls, go play in the lobby.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Go!
text: As they scurry out of the apartment:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m lonely, Maggie. I don’t want
dialog: to move to some shitty apartment, I
dialog: want to come home!
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: The girls listen at the door with concern as their parents
text: continue to argue.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: I'm lonely too, Cam! This, here,
dialog: is lonely, but you have to show me
dialog: that it’ll be different this time.
dialog: Bohemia is over --
text: A neighbor across the hall opens the door and looks annoyed.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Maggie lays out three Business School applications on the
text: dining room table: Harvard, Columbia, Wharton.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Cam is on a pay phone on Mass Ave. He is leaving an
text: answering machine message. He wears a green polo shirt and
text: madras shorts. He wears a Polaroid 250 around his neck.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hi, Maggie. It’s me. It’s a
text: beautiful day. I’m skulking around
dialog: Harvard Square. Anybody home?
dialog: Pick up if you’re there.
text: He waits. No answer. He continues his message.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Just wanted to see...
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH. DIFFERENT DAY
text: Cam stands at a restaurant pay phone, leaving another
text: message. He wears a battered corduroy sportcoat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: ..»-what you and the girls are up
dialog: to. Thought we could go sailing.
dialog: I think Eliot Perkins would let me
dialog: borrow his sailboat...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DIFFERENT DAY
text: Cam is at a different pay phone, leaving another message. He
text: wears a three-piece suit. He wears the Polaroid 250.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: ...Or “Bringing up Baby” is playing
dialog: at the Orson Welles and there’s
dialog: also a Buster Keaton festival --
text: A loud BEEP. The machine hangs up on him. Cam hangs up the
text: phone and walks out alone into the bustling street.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY
text: Amelia sits on a bench outside the Principal's Office,
text: hugging her backpack, trying not to cry. Maggie exits the
text: Principal's Office and sits down next to Amelia.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: He said we're not in the Peabody
dialog: School district so you and Faith
dialog: have to go to Lincoln.
text: Amelia's face crumples.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I’m sorry, Mommy.
text: Maggie hugs Amelia to her.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Don’t apologize to me. Please
dialog: don't apologize to me --
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: He asked where we lived and I
dialog: wasn’t sure what to say --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You did the right thing. I never
dialog: wanted you to lie.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: He said it was illegal what we were
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I guess I wasn’t thinking of it
dialog: that way. I just wanted you to go
dialog: to the best school.
text: Maggie sits back and wipes at Amelia’s tears.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What if Faith gets beat up and it’s
dialog: all because of me?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Don’t worry about Faith. Faith
dialog: bites.
text: Amelia laughs, then:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I love my teacher.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: And she loves you. She stopped me
dialog: in the hall and told me...
dialog: (her voice breaks)
dialog: She was so sorry. And she would
dialog: miss you very much.
text: Amelia nods and leans against her mother.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: Cam enters with two pillowcases stuffed with clothes. Two
text: sleeping bags sit on the sofa. As Cam picks up a teddy bear
text: and stuffs it in one of the pillowcases:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Sleeping bags, pajamas, stuffed
dialog: animals, books, changes of clothes,
dialog: what am I forgetting?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Toothbrushes?
text: Maggie enters from the kitchen with a tray. On it is a
text: teapot and tea cups and buttered toast on a plate. She puts
text: it on the table and pours it out, handing him a cup.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I bought toothbrushes they can keep
dialog: at my apartment. And I took two
text: big cardboard boxes and set them up
dialog: like little beds. They’re going to
dialog: flip.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They're so excited.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And during the day they can turn
dialog: them over and use them as puppet
dialog: theaters.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You're going to have fun.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Now that I have my own place,
dialog: Maggie, I’d be happy to pick them
dialog: up any day and have them stay over.
dialog: There’s room for you too...
text: Beat. Maggie doesn’t reciprocate.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Just kidding. Not until you’re
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam, I got into business school.
text: Cam reacts, impressed.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Maggie Stuart, you are some
dialog: punkins. I wish I had some of that
dialog: bourgeois midwestern can-do.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I got a scholarship. To Columbia.
text: Cam is thrown.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Wait. You can’t take the girls to
dialog: New York.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No. I can’t even afford a studio
dialog: apartment in New York. Jenny said
text: her mother has a small room she can
dialog: rent me.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So what about the girls?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Here’s my proposal. I can get my
dialog: degree in eighteen months if I do
dialog: the summer session. So I go to New
dialog: York. You move in here and take
dialog: care of the girls.
dialog: 27.
text: He looks at her for a long beat. Then:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: «--Me?
text: He takes out a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yes. You. You miss them. And
dialog: they miss you so much. It’s just
dialog: eighteen months. When I get my
dialog: MBA, I'll get a job in Boston and
dialog: move back in here.
dialog: (gripping his arm)
dialog: I know it sounds crazy, Cam, but
dialog: you can do it. I know you can.
text: Cam walks away from her, considering.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I suppose it might be good for me
dialog: to have a purpose --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: A routine. The doctor thinks
dialog: that’s exactly what you need.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Yes. A routine. Getting meals on
text: the table. Taking them to school
dialog: every morning, putting them to bed
dialog: every night, making sure they brush
dialog: their hair and their teeth... the
dialog: laundry.
text: He looks exhausted.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That sounds like a lot.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It is a lot. But we’re sinking
dialog: deeper and deeper into a hole and I
dialog: have to do something.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: The new school does feel a bit like
dialog: a reformatory.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It’s grim. You and I went to good
dialog: schools, we had piano lessons --
dialog: Cam looks
text: She nods.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I never had any lessons.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: But you learned how to fence and
dialog: ski and sail and speak French...
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: But I never took lessons. My
dialog: family taught me those things.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: The point is we both got a good
dialog: education. And I want that for our
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Well, I want that too. But
dialog: eighteen months is a lot of
dialog: routine.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You can do it.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I can?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I will come back every weekend and
dialog: help you.
text: at her.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Every weekend? And stay here with
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So it would be like we were a
dialog: family again?
text: Cam looks off into the distance, a determined look
text: on his face. He feels the importance of his mission.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I am their father, after all.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT. DAY
text: Maggie sits across from MURRAY and PAULINE STUART, Cam’s
text: parents. Murray wears a corduroy jacket with a pipe tucked
text: into the pocket. Pauline wears a red turtleneck with a
text: large, elaborate jade necklace over it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm afraid we need to intervene on
dialog: our son’s behalf and say: no. He’s
text: just not up to the task.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I know he can do it.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: And what if he can’t? It’s a
dialog: recipe for disaster.
text: Reveal that Cam is also at the table. He takes umbrage at
text: his father’s remark as he lights his mother’s cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You don’t seem to think I can do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We just don’t want you to tax
dialog: yourself, darling boy.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We met with Dr. Wendell. He said
dialog: Cam has made an excellent recovery
dialog: from his breakdown and he felt he
dialog: could do this.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: He thinks I need more
dialog: responsibility, not less.
text: Murray looks mystified.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: But you’re a man. Even if you
dialog: could do it, why would you want to?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He loves to cook. He loves to tell
dialog: stories and play games. He's a
dialog: good father. I would never ask him
dialog: if I didn’t believe he could do it.
text: Cam smiles at her gratefully. He puts his hand on hers.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We believe in him too, but what if
dialog: he has a breakdown?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He won’t. Because we’re all going
dialog: to support him and make sure he
text: takes his lithium. I/’11 check in
dialog: every day on the phone and I'll be
dialog: there on the weekends.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: That sounds exhausting.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Is this because of Feminism?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We're living at the poverty level.
text: The girls are at a terrible school.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Our children went to the best
dialog: schools and I'll tell you, it
dialog: didn’t add up to much.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (turning on him)
dialog: Our children are delightful!
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Absolutely. But not one of them is
text: self-supporting.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, Murray, lest you forget:
dialog: neither are we.
text: Annoyed, Murray pulls the pipe out of his pocket and starts
dialog: to pack it.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I think what Maggie is doing is
dialog: quite admirable.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: I agree. Very commendable.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But how did it get to this? I
dialog: thought Gaga was paying the rent on
dialog: your little apartment.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: She is.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It isn’t enough?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (to Murray)
dialog: Don’t we have some crystal or some
dialog: silver we could sell?
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: That won’t even pay for this meal.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: No no no. Maggie Stuart, you
dialog: cannot leave your family.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Pauline, I’m desperate. Utterly
dialog: and completely desperate. We have
dialog: no money.
text: Pauline looks like she just ate something terrible.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I hate talking about “money!”
text: Pauline always says the word “money” with extreme distaste.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Then let’s drop it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: I wish we could help but we're
text: barely getting by on the dollops of
dialog: cash Gaga doles out to us...
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Pauline, please!
text: Murray turns his back on the table and aggressively puffs on
text: his pipe. This is uncomfortable for him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam is a trust fund baby with no
dialog: trust fund. My parents have done
dialog: all they can. One of us is going
dialog: to have to earn a living.
dialog: 32.
text: Pauline looks very sad. She pats Maggie’s hand with genuine
dialog: emotion.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Oh, my dear, it all just sounds so
dialog: dreary!
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT. DAY
text: Cam, wearing jade swimming trunks and a bright green shirt,
text: is organizing Maggie's suitcases in the back of a small U-
text: Haul. A nervous, skinny man in his 40s looks on, biting his
text: fingernails. He is PETER.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why does he keep re-arranging
dialog: everything? It was fine before.
dialog: We need to go, Maggie. We’re
text: heading into miserable traffic.
text: Maggie nods. Peter gets into the passenger seat. Cam looks
text: toward him suspiciously.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Who is this wimp?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Carol Webber’s cousin. He’s moving
dialog: to New York to live with his
dialog: mother. I’m lucky he’s splitting
dialog: the cost of the truck.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: He’s making you drive?
text: Cam seems unconvinced. Maggie hugs Amelia and Faith and
text: tries to be upbeat.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You can call me anytime day or
dialog: night. And I’m going to come home
dialog: the weekend after next, so don’t be
dialog: too sad because you’re going to see
dialog: me before you know it.
text: They nod. Faith wipes away her tears. Amelia is stone-
dialog: faced.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Amelia, you have to brush your
dialog: hair. Faith, will you make sure
dialog: your sister brushes her hair?
dialog: 33.
text: Faith nods. Amelia shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You are going to have a lot of fun
dialog: with Daddy.
text: Peter honks the horn. Cam reacts angrily.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hey!
text: Maggie stands quickly.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (re: Peter)
dialog: You're saying goodbye to your
dialog: daughters! What kind of a cold-
text: hearted S.0O.B. honks the horn?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Please. I’m about to spend five
text: hours in very close quarters.
text: Cam sighs and nods. Then:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam, thank you. I know this is
dialog: big.
text: Cam wears a stoic expression.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I just wish I hadn’t dressed like a
text: big green bug.
text: Maggie laughs. He wraps her up in a big hug. Then the horn
text: honks again.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Go. Seriously. Or I’m going to
dialog: kick the living shit out of this
dialog: guy.
text: Maggie gets into the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I love you. I love you girls!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We love you too.
dialog: 34.
text: The truck starts up. It pulls out into the street. They all
text: stand waving.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING TRUCK. MOMENTS LATER
text: Maggie wipes a tear away. Peter is oblivious.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll have to make a lot of stops,
dialog: I have a very small bladder --
text: Suddenly Maggie is startled to see Cam running full-speed
text: alongside the truck.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Maggie! Take the Wilbur Cross
dialog: Parkway!
text: Maggie is stuck moving forward in the flow of traffic. She
dialog: doesn’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Remember, Maggie? We were going to
dialog: Tom and Linda’s wedding and we
dialog: thought we’d be late but I took the
dialog: back roads and we made it in the
dialog: nick of time? The Wilbur Cross
dialog: Parkway!
text: She's looking for a place to pull over. People behind her
text: are honking now.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I don’t know if I remember....
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (shouting)
text: At New Haven, shoot across 34 West
dialog: to the Wilbur Cross! It becomes
dialog: the Merritt Parkway!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. CONTINUOUS
text: The truck keeps moving and Cam can’t keep up. He shouts
dialog: after them.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You can avoid Bridgeport and the
dialog: trees are twice as green!
dialog: 35.
text: Cam lights a cigarette. He stares after the truck as it
text: disappears from view.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT. DAY
text: Cam walks back to his daughters who are still standing on the
text: sidewalk where he left them. Faith is crying. Amelia is not
text: letting herself. He picks Faith up and she puts her head on
text: his shoulder. As they walk toward the apartment building:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Who wants ice cream for lunch?
scene_heading: EXT. PARK. DAY
text: The girls still look really sad while they eat their ice
text: cream cones. Cam watches them with concern.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Want to see a movie?
text: They shake their heads.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We could drive out to Plum Island
dialog: and look for sea glass?
text: They shake their heads.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We could go to the Museum of Fine
dialog: Arts and look at Great Grandpapa’s
dialog: portrait.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why is his portrait hanging at the
dialog: museum?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Because a very important artist
dialog: named John Singer Sargent painted
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: “Why?” Don’t you know who we are?
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACON HILL. DAY
text: Cam and the girls are in his Fiat. The car is filled with
text: trash: food wrappers, used napkins, empty containers, orange
text: peels, mail. They are parked outside a large freestanding
text: mansion on Beacon Hill.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s where your great-grandmother
dialog: grew up.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: In that whole house?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: The whole thing. It’s the grandest
text: house on Beacon Hill. Designed by
dialog: Bulfinch, a very famous architect.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: How did they get so rich?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Railroads. Your great-great-
dialog: grandfather was once the richest
dialog: man in Boston.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: So how come we’re so poor?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: ...-Well, all that money was put
dialog: into a trust which is controlled by
dialog: your great-grandmother. And she
dialog: decides when to give who what.
dialog: And... it’s hard to explain.
text: The girls stare at the house in awe.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You want to see the inside?
text: They look excited and confused.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Are we allowed?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You can’t just walk up and knock on
text: people’s doors.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (tickled by her ignorance)
dialog: Sweetheart... this is Boston.
dialog: They're practically expecting us.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL. DAY
text: The girls look around the grand entry hall, amazed. Cam has
text: a hand on each of their shoulders. A MAID comes in.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Mr. Fabrini will be out ina
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (to girls)
text: On the second floor are the parlors
dialog: where they would have huge fancy
dialog: dress balls...they would lay thick
text: canvas down to protect the wooden
text: floors and it looked like snow...
text: A man in his mid-40s comes out of a study. This is MR.
text: FABRINI. He wears a business suit. He seems annoyed.
speaker_heading: MR. FABRINI
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hello. My name is Cam Stuart. My
dialog: great-grandmother grew up in this
dialog: house and I was wondering if I
dialog: could show it to my daughters.
dialog: It’s an important part of their
dialog: family history.
speaker_heading: MR. FABRINI
dialog: I’m sorry, Mr. Stuart. But this is
dialog: my home. I don’t give tours.
text: The girls are mortified. They both start for the door, but
text: Cam holds them in place. He is defiant.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: This house was in my family for
dialog: more than five generations. My
dialog: great-great grandfather was born in
dialog: this house on Boxing Day in 1842.
speaker_heading: MR. FABRINI
dialog: And would your great-great-
dialog: grandfather give tours to anyone
dialog: who came along?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Certainly. If they had a personal
dialog: connection going back more than
dialog: five generations.
speaker_heading: MR. FABRINI
dialog: Then he’s a better man than me.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: “Better man than I.”
text: The girls wince.
scene_heading: INT. FIAT. MOMENTS LATER
text: Cam drives much too fast down Storrow Drive, weaving in and
text: out of traffic. Everyone is shouting.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We're going back there again! I’m
dialog: going back every day till he shows
dialog: you that house!
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Slow down!

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: But it’s his house now and he

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: That was so embarrassing!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You shouldn’t be embarrassed! He
dialog: should be embarrassed!
speaker_heading: FAITH/AMELIA
dialog: No! You should be embarrassed!

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR. NIGHT
text: The family rides the elevator in silence. All three of them
text: look furious.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: The apartment is filled with boxes. Amelia is on the kitchen
text: phone. Faith is on the phone in the living room. They are
text: both unhappy, talking low, as Cam lurks about.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We want you to come home.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: I‘1l be home in twelve days...
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We want you to come home right now.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: This is a big adjustment --
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why aren’t you coming home this
dialog: Friday? You said you’d come home
dialog: every single weekend. That’s what
dialog: you said.
scene_heading: INT. MAGGIE’S NEW YORK ROOM. SAME TIME
text: Maggie stands in a grim little room with a bed and a desk and
text: a bright overhead light. Her suitcases surround her. You
text: can hear loud traffic noise.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I have registration and orientation
dialog: -- next weekend is really not that
dialog: far away...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. MORNING
text: Cam is snoring on the couch still wearing the bright green
text: shirt and jade swimming trunks. The TV is on. Faith stands
text: over him, near tears, in her nightgown.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Daddy, wake up. Daddy. We slept
dialog: too long and we’re going to be late
dialog: for school.
dialog: 40.
text: Cam opens his eyes and blinks at her, disoriented.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ELEVATOR. DAY
text: A disheveled Cam races down the hall and puts his hand on the
text: door of the elevator to keep it from closing. In his other
text: hand he has a box of cereal.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Girls! Let’s move it!
text: On the elevator is an attractive woman professionally
text: dressed. This is BECCA. She wears a turtleneck sweater and
text: big brown glasses. She smiles at Cam. He smiles back.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You're Maggie’s friend. I’m Cam.
speaker_heading: BECCA
text: Becca. Kyle’s mother.
text: Faith runs onto the elevator.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I hate being late for school.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Don’t worry, bunchkin. You won’t
dialog: be late.
text: Cam holds out the box of cereal. Faith reaches in, grabs a
text: handful, stuffs it in her mouth.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Amelia! Let’s go!
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: I just have to say: my ex-husband
dialog: would never do what you’re doing.
dialog: I think it is so evolved.
text: Cam puffs up.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You do?
text: Tousled Amelia runs onto the elevator. Cam steps on.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Absolutely. Most men would be
dialog: extremely emasculated having their
text: wife go off to be the breadwinner.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (deflates)
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
text: The elevator doors close.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Cam runs a red light at the intersection of Huron Ave and
text: Garden Street. The girls scream.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
text: He pulls up with a screech in front of the school. The girls
text: tumble out. As they sprint off:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You want me to pick you up after
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: No!
text: He watches the girls run up the deserted steps of the school.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I love you!
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT. DAY
text: Cam has the hood of his car open. The girls walk up, wearing
text: their backpacks, not talking to each other.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You girls want to learn how to
dialog: change an oil filter? It’s pretty
dialog: straightforward --
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: No./Not really.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Just don’t be helpless.
text: He shuts the hood. A woman in her mid-50s is taking many
text: grocery bags out of her car. This is RUTH-ANN MCKAY.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Ruth-Ann.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Please don’t introduce yourself.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Because you talk too much and
dialog: nobody wants to talk to you.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I'm just being friendly. Don’t you
dialog: want to know your neighbors? We
dialog: live in a world with other people.
text: He approaches Ruth-Ann. The girls follow.
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: Hello girls.
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hi, Cam Stuart --
text: Ruth-Ann shakes hands warmly.
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: Yes, Maggie told me. Welcome to
dialog: 205. Ruth-Ann McKay.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Can we help you with your bags?
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: (grateful)
dialog: Are you kidding?
text: As they pick up the bags:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: See, girls? People appreciate a
dialog: little kindness. That’s all I’m
dialog: talking about.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Cam carries three bags and the girls each struggle to carry
text: one down the hall to Ruth-Ann’s apartment. She unlocks her
text: door and starts taking the bags from them.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Do you need us to help you put them
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: No, this is fine. Just put the
text: bags down.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Are you sure? We’re happy to do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: No, this has been so helpful.
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You need anything moved? A desk or
dialog: something like that?
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: No I’m happy with where my desk
dialog: is...
text: She starts to close the door.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Sometimes mixing up an arrangement
dialog: freshens a space --
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: No, thank you. I have to start
dialog: dinner. So if you’1l excuse me.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You need anything chopped? An
dialog: onion?
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: No. I’m not using onions tonight.
text: She closes the door in his face.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What is wrong with you?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You made her slam the door in your
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (oblivious )
dialog: She had to go cook dinner.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: She had to get rid of you!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Get off my case! I’m just being a
dialog: good neighbor!
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You're an annoying neighbor.
dialog: People are going to see you and run
dialog: in the other direction!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: No, they’re going to run toward me!
dialog: Because I’m going to make sure they
dialog: know that I’m the kind of guy who’s
dialog: willing to move heavy furniture!
dialog: Or clean out a storage locker!
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Because I’m a good neighbor!
text: He storms off down the hallway. Ten strides later.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: This is bullshit!
text: He goes into the stairwell and slams the door.
scene_heading: INT. DINING AREA. NIGHT
text: They sit at the dining table, eating in angry silence. Then:
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I learned to cook this on a
text: Norwegian steamship headed down the
dialog: Amazon.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: When did you do that?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Summer after I got kicked out of
dialog: Harvard.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I thought you got kicked out of
dialog: Exeter.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I got kicked out of both. For very
dialog: different reasons...
text: The girls’ interest is piqued.
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Cam sits in the reading chair. The girls are in their beds,
text: listening intently to their father’s story. Faith has
text: curlers in her hair and a net over them.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I was on my way to my Ec 10 exam
dialog: and I hear this bag-pipe music so I
text: follow the sound into The Square
text: and a street musician is playing
dialog: Scottish ballads and he’s got his
text: hat out. People are walking by and
dialog: putting money in it and I think
dialog: that's a good idea. So I put my
dialog: hat out and sit next to him and I
dialog: start singing along in my best
dialog: Scottish brogue and he tells me to
dialog: scram.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Because he didn’t ask you to sing
dialog: and he wants to make all the money.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Exactly. Well, we exchanged a few
dialog: words and then...the bastard jumped
dialog: me! This scrawny little guy and he
dialog: jumped me! We got into a major
text: brawl on top of the bag pipes and I
dialog: got so excited I shit my pants.
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: Ew!
text: Cam laughs.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Needless to say, I didn’t make the
dialog: exam.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: And they kicked you out for missing
dialog: one exam?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Well... then the next semester I
dialog: registered for seventy-five
dialog: courses.
text: He chuckles.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s when they determined I might
dialog: not be Harvard material.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Both girls are asleep, breathing steadily. The clock ticks.
text: Cam gets up from his chair and turns out the light.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Cam walks into the living room of the apartment, which is now
text: full of all his boxes. He stares at them.
text: Cam opens a box. It is filled with magazines, pieces of
text: paper, phone books, tools, cords. It is completely
text: disorganized. He blinks at it. It fills him with despair.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
text: Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and all over the counters.
text: Cam stares at it in despair.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY
text: The laundry hamper is overflowing, dirty clothes piled
text: halfway up the wall. Cam stares at it in despair.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DOOR. NIGHT
text: Cam grabs his coat and scarf from the coat-stand.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Girls, I’m going out for a couple
dialog: of hours. You get some good rest.
dialog: I‘1l be back before midnight...
text: No answer from the sleeping girls.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: ...Or after midnight. Love you!
text: He opens the door, closes it quietly behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT. NIGHT
text: Cam steps out into the cool air. He takes a deep breath,
text: lights a cigarette, and heads out into the night.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR. NIGHT
text: A bar full of aging professors, shaggy poets and intense
dialog: poetesses.
text: Cam sits at the bar, drinking a can of beer. He has an
text: animated conversation with two friends. One wears a bow-tie,
text: horn-rimmed glasses and a tweed jacket; the other wears a
text: grimy coat and ragged hat. The homeless-looking friend
text: laughs, revealing no front teeth. Cam gestures to the
text: bartender, indicating another round.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Cam, drunk and smoking, walks down the long hall to the
text: corner apartment. He takes out his keys and opens the door.
text: But it stops; the chain-lock has been fastened.
text: All the lights in the apartment are on.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: He knocks.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Unchain the door, please.
text: Amelia comes running from the living room, crazy-haired,
text: wielding a baseball bat.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Where did you go?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Unchain the fucking door.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We woke up and you were gone.
dialog: Faith was really scared.
dialog: 48.
text: Cam grows more irritated.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Don’t use the chain. Anyone who
dialog: really wants to come in won’t be
text: stopped by this dinky chain.
dialog: 
text: As she unchains it:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: It stopped you.
text: As he enters:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I didn’t really want to come in.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Cam stumbles in and Amelia holds up the telephone receiver,
text: triumphant.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: Mommy’s on the phone.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Thank you. Thanks a lot.
text: He reluctantly takes the telephone from her. She walks down
text: the hall to her bedroom.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everything's fine, Maggie. Nobody
text: is hurt.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I told them I was going out, but
dialog: they were sleeping! Should I wake
dialog: them up every time I want to go
dialog: out?
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Amelia sits down on the bed next to Faith.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: She's going to know he’s doing a
dialog: bad job.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: He’s drunk.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Do you think it’s good for Mommy to
dialog: know that?
text: Amelia shrugs.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: She's coming home a week early.
text: Faith gasps with excitement and hugs her sister tight.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
text: Cam opens the medicine chest and takes out his enormous
text: bottle of lithium. He stares at it for a long time.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
text: The Fiat pulls up in front of the school. Children are
text: filing in. The girls jump out of the car. Before Amelia
text: slams the door:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Remember, girls. Mommy’s coming
dialog: Friday. Let’s make the apartment
dialog: nice for her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You have to unpack your boxes.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (lighting a cigarette)
dialog: I'm just saying, we all need to
dialog: pitch in --
text: Both girls look bratty and pissed-off.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But they’re your boxes...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We don’t know what to do with
dialog: them...
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We don’t ask you to clean up our
dialog: room...
text: Cam cannot handle the onslaught of attitude.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Fuck it, forget it. Have a nice
dialog: fucking day.
text: Cam puts the Fiat in gear and zooms off, way too fast. The
text: girls watch him go, stunned and self-conscious, knowing that
dialog: the other kids heard.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. DAY
text: Cam looks at all the boxes. The place is a disaster. He
text: goes to the window and looks out. It is a beautiful day.
text: Cam sighs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE RECORD PLAYER
text: Cam drops the needle on Olatunje’s Drums of Passion. A heavy
text: rhythmic beat fills the room as he opens up the first box and
text: pulls out a rusted old machete.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. LATER
text: The girls enter the apartment. They can’t believe their
text: eyes. It is spic and span. A large new bookshelf lines the
text: front hall. They jump up and down like crazy.
speaker_heading: FAITH/AMELIA
dialog: Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
text: Cam enters from his bedroom. He wears a grimy, oil-stained
text: jumpsuit. The girls throw themselves into his arms.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Pretty good, right?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It’s beautiful. We love it!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Just don’t look in my bedroom.
text: The girls hurry to his bedroom.
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. CAM'S BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER
text: Cam’s room looks like a garage. Large industrial metal
text: shelves house paint-thinner, spray paint cans, motor oil,
text: etc. Stacks of mail and magazines cover the desk and there
text: are clothes all over the bed. Amelia points at the bed.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Is that a machete?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We'll keep this door closed...
text: She closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Spirits are high. Amelia clears the dining room table.
text: Faith washes the dishes and Cam dries and puts the dishes
text: away. They sing a World War II marching song.
speaker_heading: ALL THREE
dialog: Hitler! Has only got one
dialog: ball...Goering! Has two but very
dialog: small...Himmler! Has something
dialog: sim'lar...But Josef Goebels has no
dialog: balls at all...
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION. NIGHT
text: Cam and the girls stand on the platform as the train pulls in
text: to the Station. Cam is trying to untangle some of the
text: massive snarls in Amelia's hair. Maggie gets off at the far
text: end. The girls take off, running for her.
text: Maggie drops her suitcase and drops to her knees and holds
text: them tight. Cam walks toward them, smiling. He holds a
text: bunch of orange gerberas. She accepts them and kisses him on
text: the cheek. She kisses both girls on the head.
text: He picks up her suitcase and they walk down the platform.
text: The girls skip alongside, holding their mother’s hand, happy
dialog: to be all together.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. DAY
text: The family bustles into the apartment. Maggie stops dead
text: when she sees how cozy and warm it is. She looks at them
text: with amazement. The girls are gleeful.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Who built these shelves?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy.
text: Cam looks modest but he is bursting with pride.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: They're just shelves.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK. DAY
text: Faith and Amelia play on the monkey bars. Cam and Maggie sit
text: on a bench. Maggie looks happy.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It was hard to come this weekend.
dialog: I’m so glad I did. I think this is
dialog: just what you needed, Cam! I think
dialog: this is going to be a great thing
dialog: for us.
text: He smiles at her and takes her hand. She smiles back at him.
text: They sit holding hands as they watch the girls play.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: UNDOING THE APARTMENT MONTAGE
text: Cam lays out a bunch of newspaper on the living room floor
text: and goes to work, taking apart an old phone. He walks away
text: from the tools and parts of the disassembled phone and it
dialog: never moves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The girls come in with a large hamper of laundry. They dump
text: it on the sofa and start folding it, but then they run off
dialog: and it stays where it is.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The family sits in the living room eating dinner in front of
text: the television. A large roll of paper towels that is sitting
text: on the coffee table is knocked over and rolls to the floor,
text: leaving a long trail of paper towel. Nobody picks it up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 53.
text: Cam lies on the sofa, drinking a beer and watching
text: television. His head rests on the pile of clean laundry.
text: Amelia and Faith roller skate around the room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The phone parts have been pushed under the piano bench to
text: make room for Cam’s bicycle, which stands upside down as he
text: fixes the brake mechanism. He puts his glass down on top of
text: the piano, in front of a large model ship. The top of the
text: piano is now filled with dirty glasses, beer cans and empty
text: yogurt containers with spoons sticking out of them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Cam sits down in his armchair and starts taping wide silver
text: duct tape over a large tear in the arm.
text: Pull back on the living room. Nothing has been picked up or
text: put away. It is a disaster.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Faith stares miserably at the stack of dirty dishes in the
text: kitchen sink.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Cam sits in his armchair. The TV is on. He is trying to
text: brush the snarls out of Amelia’s hair.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Ow! Daddy!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: ow!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: This is what happens when you don’t
dialog: brush your hair for two weeks.
text: Faith marches out of the kitchen, furious.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Daddy, if you’re not going to do
dialog: the dishes, then I’m doing them.
text: Cam blinks at her. It is an odd threat. He shrugs.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Okay.
text: Faith marches into the kitchen. A cupboard opens and slams
text: shut. He turns his attention back to Amelia’s hair.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You're hurting me! I’11 do it!
text: She turns and rips the brush from his hand.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Fine. You do it.
text: Amelia stomps away to the bedroom. Seconds later Faith
text: marches back to the living room with a sponge held between
text: two fingers.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Where are the sponges?
text: Cam becomes immediately stern.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What’s wrong with that sponge?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It smells!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Then don’t smell it!
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: My hands stink just from touching
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s because someone left it
dialog: soaking in the dishwater! I keep
dialog: telling you girls, it needs to be
dialog: rinsed and squeezed when you’re
dialog: through with it!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You brought it from your old
dialog: apartment! It’s probably five
dialog: years old! It’s disgusting!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We are not the kind of people who
dialog: throw perfectly useful things away!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You won’t throw anything away!
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That is a perfectly good sponge
dialog: with plenty of life left in it!
text: Faith throws the sponge at him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Fine! Then you do the dishes!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Fine! I will! With this sponge!
text: Faith runs away. The downstairs neighbor pounds on the
text: ceiling. Cam angrily pounds back.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Maggie, wearing her coat and holding her suitcase, stares
text: with dismay at the wreckage of the apartment.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We lost some momentum, but we’1ll
dialog: get it back.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I did get a new sponge.
dialog: (pointed, to the girls)
dialog: Even though I washed the old one
dialog: with soap and it smelled fine.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. DAY
text: Maggie, wearing yellow rubber gloves and her hair tied back,
text: cleans furiously. Cam and the girls make piles.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Amelia helps her mother make her bed on the sofa. Faith
text: practices her pirouettes.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Faith and I thought of the perfect
text: job for Daddy. A crepe cart in
dialog: Harvard Square. Like they have in
dialog: Paris.
text: Maggie and Cam look at each other, amused.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You do make the best crepes.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And I do love standing outside in
dialog: January, freezing my ass off for
dialog: pennies.
text: Maggie laughs.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We’re working on the menu.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I like chocolate and coconut.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We have that!
text: She does a dramatic pirouette. Her parents laugh.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: It is late. Maggie sits up in her bed on the sofa, sewing a
text: button on a little girl’s sweater. Cam sits at the other end
text: of the sofa. The girls have gone to bed. Cam is feeling
dialog: sorry for himself.
speaker_heading: CAM
text: .--and the building is packed with
dialog: single mothers who are always
dialog: checking in with each other and
dialog: getting together for coffee but do
dialog: any of them ever ask how I’m doing?
dialog: Do they ever invite me for coffee?
dialog: I’m pretty sure they all got
dialog: together for wine and cheese two
dialog: nights ago.
text: Maggie has to bite her lip to keep from laughing.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'm sorry, it’s not funny.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It is funny. It’s pathetic. I'ma
dialog: pathetic whiner. Which is probably
dialog: why they don’t invite me.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They’re leery of men, that’s all.
dialog: Especially married men with
dialog: children.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m not exactly a married man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Well. We’re a family.
text: Cam slides his hand up her leg. She shifts away.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So is this really how we’re going
dialog: to do it? You come every weekend
dialog: and take up residence on the sofa?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: For now.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Come on, Maggie. We haven’t slept
dialog: together since before my breakdown--
text: He leans forward and kisses her, but after a moment she rolls
text: off the sofa and moves away from him. He chases after her,
text: playful, flirting.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I don’t know what will happen, Cam.
dialog: I just want to get through this
dialog: period. Can’t we see how it goes?
text: As he attempts to unbutton her top:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And what happens at the end? You
dialog: move back in here and what happens
dialog: to us? Where do I go?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I want you to be the person we all
dialog: know you can be. It will take
dialog: steady, sustained effort. You can
dialog: do it, Cam. If you want to do it.
text: He puts his hand on her breast.
speaker_heading: CAM
text: Sexy, sexy answer.
text: She laughs at his unrelenting flirtation.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Honest, honest answer.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So what is this? Some big test?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Don’t think of it like that. You
dialog: hate tests --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Not if this was on the test...
text: He kisses her. This time she kisses him back.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: The girls stand outside the closed door to Cam’s bedroom,
text: listening and whispering to each other.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Are they having sex?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I think maybe.
text: The girls celebrate silently. Then they hear raised voices:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m sorry, Cam. I just can’t make
dialog: promises right now --
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: What a bunch of baloney. You must
dialog: think I’m the biggest sucker on the
dialog: planet.
text: The girls scurry into their room as Cam’s bedroom door is
text: ripped open. Cam walks out, pulling his shirt on. He grabs
text: his coat.
text: He exits.
text: Maggie runs after him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Are you taking your lithium?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Oh, shit. Lithium doesn’t stop you
dialog: from feeling lonely and
dialog: unappreciated. Enjoy your sofa.
text: The front door slams.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Maggie lies on her bed on the sofa. Amelia walks up to her.
text: Maggie lifts the covers and Amelia gets under the blankets
text: next to her mother.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: When you and Daddy met at WGBH, was
dialog: he the way he is now?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (delicately)
dialog: In some ways. He was funny.
dialog: Compassionate. He knew everything
dialog: about the outdoors. He had a job,
dialog: which was good for him. He was a
dialog: terrific lighting designer. But in
dialog: the end, it was too much
dialog: pressure... I didn’t understand
dialog: about the manic-depression.
dialog: Besides, everyone was having
dialog: nervous breakdowns in the 60s, so I
dialog: didn’t realize what a big deal it
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You're probably sorry you married
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No. Never.
text: Amelia snuggles in closer.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You know, he’s not usually so angry
text: like he just was. We yell at him
text: way more than he yells at us.
dialog: This information is not comforting to Maggie.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: A cold winter day in a run-down part of Somerville,
dialog: Massachusetts.
text: Cam leans over the engine of a dented and rusty Plymouth
text: Valiant, gunmetal gray with white patches. He wears a grimy
text: green parka with a gray three-piece suit poking out
text: underneath. He wears nice leather shoes. A cigarette hangs
text: out of his mouth. His hair is combed.
text: He shuts the hood.
dialog: 60.
text: Amelia and Faith watch apprehensively. Amelia wears a parka
text: over white tights. Her snarly hair is pulled back in two
text: barrettes. Faith wears a long wool coat and has her hair
text: neatly combed under a velvet headband.
text: Cam crosses to the driver’s side, gets in and turns the car
text: on, revs the engine. CHRIS, the unfriendly man selling the
text: car, doesn’t even try to give a spiel.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Like I said in the ad, it runs.
text: Cam looks around the interior of the car.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: There’s been some wear and tear on
dialog: the seats.
text: A large flap of vinyl hangs down revealing the foam
text: underneath. In the front and the back.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Get in, girls, see what you think.
text: Chris opens the back door and the unhappy girls start to
dialog: climb in.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: There’s no floor!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It’s a little rusted. Don’t step
text: on it.
text: Amelia and Faith look at each other, sinking. They slide
text: onto the backseat without stepping on the floor.
text: Cam leans through the back door and looks at the floor well,
text: which is a rusty hole with ragged rusted edges.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: No floor? That’s dangerous. I
dialog: have two small children. I'11 give
dialog: you three hundred and you deal with
dialog: the Fiat.
text: He points to the Fiat which now has a broken driver side
text: window that’s been taped up with plastic and duct tape.
scene_heading: INT. VALIANT. DAY
text: As the Valiant pulls away, Amelia kneels on the backseat and
text: waves out the back window.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Goodbye, Fiat! Goodbye, Fiat!
text: Cam honks the horn in rapid succession for a cheerful,
text: triumphant goodbye. They drive out into the street. Faith
text: sits down and opens a “Harper’s Bazaar” but Amelia stays
text: kneeling on the seat, looking out the back window. Her eyes
text: fill with tears.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: Daddy, Amelia's crying.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You always cry.
text: Faith looks out the window, an angry expression on her face.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Not anymore. I vowed never to cry
dialog: again.
text: Cam looks in the rear-view mirror with concern.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: My little Stoic? What’s wrong,
dialog: darling? Ma petite pamplemousse?
text: The tears roll down Amelia’s face and she can’t wipe them
dialog: away fast enough.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: It’s just... What’s going to happen
dialog: to the Fiat? Nobody’s going to
dialog: want it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I thought you were crying because
dialog: this car sucks.
text: Amelia shakes her head and says in a small voice:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: That car sucked too.
text: She watches as the Fiat gets smaller and smaller and then
text: they turn a corner and it’s gone.
scene_heading: INT. VALIANT. DAY
text: The girls lie across the backseat, leaning against either
text: door, huddled beneath an old army blanket. They wear hats.
dialog: 62.
text: Faith has the “Harper's Bazaar” magazine on her chest and
dialog: Amelia holds a book called “Turning Your Dream Into A Small
dialog: Business”.
text: They are both mesmerized at the sight of the highway rushing
text: by through the rusty holes in the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTON ESTATE. DAY
text: The Valiant turns onto a long driveway and drives past an
text: enormous lawn and a large weeping willow and an unattached
text: four car garage and parks in the circle in front of the
text: house, behind a maroon Bentley.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. DAY
text: A regal old lady sits at the head of a long mahogany table, a
text: little silver bell by her water glass. She is 92 and of
text: another era, extremely patrician. She wears a long-sleeved
text: black dress, pearls and a blonde wig that looks like hair
text: swirled into a bun. This is GAGA. Cam is at the foot and
text: the girls are in the middle. The table could sit twelve.
text: A BUTLER brings around a silver bowl of mashed potatoes.
text: Faith spoons a huge amount onto her plate next to the roast
text: beef and the peas. The butler continues around the table.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: I propose a game of crazy eights
dialog: after lunch.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: We don’t say ‘yeah,’ dear. We say
dialog: ‘yes.’
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Thank you, Gaga. Their mother
text: keeps fighting that battle.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: And how is their mother?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: She’s well. She’s been home every
dialog: weekend. But she has finals so she
dialog: stayed in New York to study. We’re
text: muddling through without her.
dialog: (to the butler)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CAM (cont'd)
dialog: Tell Betty the roast beef is
dialog: divine.
text: The butler nods silently and disappears to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: Do you girls think it’s unusual
dialog: that your mother is in New York?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: She wants to have more career
dialog: opportunities.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Mommy says women can do anything.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: She's quite a “striver,” isn’t she?
text: That hangs in the air for the moment.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We prefer the word “fighter.”
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Is that a painting of Grandma
dialog: Paulie when she was little?
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: Yes. And it’s pronounced
dialog: (very patrician)
dialog: ‘Paulie.’
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Polly.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: Paulie.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (trying hard)
dialog: Polly. Polly.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: She’s not a parrot!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Polly.
dialog: Amelia thinks she’s got it.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Polly!
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Paulie. Pauline.
text: The little girls are really trying but they are unable to
dialog: hear the distinction.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Polly.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Polline.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: What is the world coming to?
text: Faith is fiercely concentrating. She says with extreme self-
text: consciousness in a faux British accent:
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: ‘Paul-ie.’
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: Yes!
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER
text: The girls sit at a game table playing cards with Gaga. Cam
text: enters, wearing his parka, carrying two large ancient cookie
text: sheets under his arm and a large roll of duct tape.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m going out to work on the car.
text: As Gaga shuffles the cards:
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: The girls tell me it has no floor.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It had no floor.
dialog: (holding up cookie sheets)
dialog: I found these in your kitchen
dialog: vault. Betty said I could have
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Cookie sheets?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You won't be able to step on them,
dialog: but it’1ll keep out the cold air and
dialog: detritus.
dialog: 65.
text: Amelia sighs and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: Cam, I’m very proud of you for
dialog: taking care of these darling girls
dialog: all by yourself. I mostly use the
dialog: Lincoln these days. I'd like you
dialog: to have the Bentley.
text: The girls scream and leap to their feet like Lottery winners.
scene_heading: INT. BENTLEY. MOMENTS LATER
text: Amelia and Faith are scrambling all over it, touching
text: everything. They push every button. They run their hands
text: over the smooth wood. They rest their cheeks against the
text: leather and inhale. Amelia sits in the driver’s seat and
text: waves through the windshield at her father, who is outside,
text: looking at the car with apprehension, smoking a cigarette.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER
text: Gaga looks extremely displeased, both hands on her cane. Cam
text: stands across from her, hands in his pockets.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We live in a rent-controlled
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: I know that. I pay your rent.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And we’re very grateful --
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: Piffle. It’s dirt-cheap.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: The point is... I can’t afford to
dialog: take care of the Bentley. I can’t
dialog: even afford to fill up its gas
dialog: tank.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: If you’re asking me for gas money --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m not asking for gas money, Gaga.
text: Cam suddenly becomes nervous, uneasy. This is hard for him.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: The girls are both phenomenal
dialog: students... they’re not being
dialog: challenged. If you really want to
dialog: help, I think they would flourish
dialog: in private school.
text: Beat. She scowls at him.
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: I don’t think that’s teaching the
dialog: girls a very good lesson, do you?
text: Cam looks confused, then resigned:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I suppose not.
text: Gaga takes his hand in an attempt to be supportive:
speaker_heading: GAGA
dialog: We all believe in you, Cameron. We
dialog: know it’s not too late for you to
dialog: amount to something.
scene_heading: INT. VALIANT. NIGHT
text: They drive home in silence. The girls pout in the back seat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Girls, look. I’m sorry we can’t
dialog: take the Bentley. It just doesn’t
dialog: make sense. I know it’s
dialog: disappointing.
text: They don’t respond. Then, in a coldly rational voice:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You should've taken it and then
dialog: sold it and bought the crepe cart
dialog: and then you could’ve made lots of
dialog: money and we wouldn’t be so poor.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Sweetie, although crepes may be
dialog: delicious, they’re not exactly the
dialog: goldmine you think they are.
dialog: Especially during a recession.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Well, then we could’ve sold the
dialog: Bentley and just had some money.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Gaga would never let me sell that
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But she was giving it to you.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s not how it works. It’s hard
dialog: to explain.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It was our one chance to have
dialog: something that other people might
dialog: want. Nobody wants what we have.
text: They ride on in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION. DAY
text: Maggie walks out of the station, with Cam and the girls. Cam
text: carries her suitcase. The girls brim over with excitement.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We have a surprise for you.
text: They can’t contain themselves. They run to the Valiant.
text: Maggie slows as she approaches the car. Inside, a DOG is
text: barking like mad and scrambling back and forth over the
text: seats. Cam whistles and when the dog sees him, he starts
text: whining and wagging his tail, scratching at the windows.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That’s Jock! That’s our dog!
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy got him for us!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Amelia named him!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Why is he acting like that?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: He was abused by his last owner.
dialog: So any time Daddy leaves him he
text: gets really upset.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Because he loves Daddy! Because
dialog: Daddy saved him!
text: As Cam puts the suitcase in the trunk:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We're working on it.
text: Maggie looks unenthusiastic.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: And this is the new car?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It was abused by its last owner.
dialog: But Daddy saved it!
text: Cam opens the passenger side door for her, with a flourish.
text: Jock streaks out and tears down the sidewalk, going after
text: another dog who is on a leash. Cam and the girls race after
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Jock! No! Bad dog! Jock!
text: It is chaos.
scene_heading: EXT. RAYMOND PARK. DAY
text: Bundled up, the family kicks a soccer ball around. Jock runs
text: between them. Some distance away Kim and Ali watch from the
text: swings. Cam sees them.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Don’t those little girls live in
dialog: our building?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Yes. But they’re really mean.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Mean? They’re wearing identical
dialog: pink parkas. How mean can they be?
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Hey! Hey!
text: He waves at them to come over. Hesitant, they do.
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: EXT. RAYMOND PARK. LATER
text: Maggie sits on a bench with Faith in her lap. Cam plays a
text: spirited soccer game with all the little kids in the park.
text: The ball comes toward Cam, who is smoking. He throws down
text: his cigarette and dodges a kid, then passes the ball to Kim,
text: then picks up his cigarette again when the ball is gone.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: The girls both hold onto Jock’s leash as they walk toward the
text: apartment. Cam and Maggie follow behind.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: They seem like nice kids. You
dialog: should have them over sometime.
text: Both girls scowl at him over their shoulders.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'd rather die than have people
dialog: over to our shithole.
text: The girls take off running down the hall. Cam looks
text: exhausted. Maggie looks at him; he shrugs, beleaguered.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: They crush my soul.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY
text: Spring. The early crocuses are coming up.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: The apartment is a disaster. Art materials lie all over the
text: table. Amelia bangs out a song on the piano and sings at the
text: top of her lungs while Faith does a dramatic dance. They are
text: both in their nightgowns.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: “Here we come, here we come, we're
dialog: the pirates, and we're going to
dialog: make you swab the decks..."
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: (calling from the kitchen)
dialog: Faithie-bear, could you clean your
dialog: stuff off the dining room table?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (twirling)
dialog: I’m busy.
text: Cam emerges from the kitchen, a mixing bowl in his arms. He
text: is whisking something and wearing a utilitarian apron.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Dinner will be ready soon. It would
dialog: be awfully nice to have a place to
dialog: sit down and eat it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Later!
text: Cam watches, frustrated.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Now. Now.
text: She keeps dancing. Suddenly Cam explodes, HURLING THE BOWL
text: AT THE WALL.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Now!
text: Both girls are startled out of their musical reverie. Then
dialog: Faith explodes:
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You are so MEAN! I am not your
speaker_heading: SERVANT!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: No! I’m the goddamn servant! All
dialog: I do is cook for you and drive you
dialog: around and tend to your every
dialog: need...
text: He watches, furious, as she stomps by him.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: ...-you treat me like a goddamn
dialog: maid!
text: Cam turns off the stove. Grabs his overcoat and scarf.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’ve got to get out of here.
dialog: 71.
text: Amelia jumps up from the piano and gets in his way.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We don’t have a babysitter.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You don’t need a babysitter.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But it’s night-time. We get
text: scared. Faith gets scared.
text: Cam looks for his keys, wallet.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You need to toughen up. What is
dialog: there to be scared of? Wolves?
dialog: Vampires?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Rapists.
text: Cam shakes his head and puts on his coat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: If a rapist knocks, don’t let him
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What if they force their way in?
dialog: That's what rapists do!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Just kick him in the balls!
text: Amelia runs to block the door. Jock starts barking and
dialog: jumping around.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: No, Daddy. Don’t go.
text: Amelia drops to the ground and grabs Cam’s leg.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I don’t get it. You never want to
dialog: be seen with me, you won’t have
dialog: your friends over, you won’t let me
dialog: talk to people -- I can’t take it
dialog: anymore! I need to spend time with
dialog: adults, not a bunch of bossy brats!
dialog: Unhand my foot!
dialog: 72.
text: Cam leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him. The
text: dog barks constantly.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Cam steams down the hall. Punches the elevator button.
text: Waiting at the elevator, he pulls a pack of cigarettes from
text: his pocket.
text: He looks up. At the end of the hall his daughters stand in
text: their nightgowns and look at him silently, mournfully. The
text: elevator door opens. We can still hear the dog barking.
text: He gives them the finger. Charges onto the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR. NIGHT
text: Cam is agitated. He runs his hands through his hair. He
text: punches the wall.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY. NIGHT
text: Ruth-Ann waits for the elevator. The door opens to reveal
text: Cam, sitting dejected on the floor. She hesitates.
speaker_heading: RUTH-ANN
dialog: Going up?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: I guess so.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Cam walks back down the hall to the apartment. He unlocks
text: the door, but the chain is up. It stops him. He sighs with
text: frustration, then hurls his shoulder into the door, busting
text: the chain and sending the door smashing open.
text: The girls scream, alarmed, and jump to their feet. Amelia
text: holds a baseball bat, Faith holds a cricket bat. Then they
dialog: see it’s him.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
text: Cam walks in. As he lights a cigarette:
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (worn-down )
dialog: You see, girls? That chain is
dialog: worthless. The only thing it
dialog: provides is a false sense of
dialog: security, and that’s the last thing
dialog: you girls need.
text: He hugs them and they hug him back.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We'll be braver, Daddy, I promise.
dialog: Next time we'll be braver.
text: He nods and heads back toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Cam cleans up the bowl and its contents that are spilled all
text: over the wall and floor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Cam replaces the chain on the door with a deadbolt lock.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Cam lies on the sofa, watching TV, drinking a beer, smoking.
text: He flips through the channels. He finishes the beer and
text: crumples it. It joins four other crumpled cans. He reaches
text: for another. He looks depressed.
scene_heading: INT. VALIANT. DAY
text: Cam, rumpled and low-energy, sits behind the wheel. The
text: girls sit in the back seat. As Maggie gets in the car, she
text: sees that Cam has a huge bandage that covers his entire hand
text: and forearm. It looks like a giant q-tip.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam, what happened?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What? Oh. Broke up a dog fight.
dialog: Stupid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We had to give Jock away.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY
text: The swimming pool is being filled. All the kids in the
text: building stand outside the chain link fence watching with
dialog: excitement.
scene_heading: INT. VALIANT. DAY
text: Cam, still low-energy, waits in the car. Maggie opens the
text: door. The bandages on his hand are gone.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: The girls didn’t want to come?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: It got old.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. DAY
text: Maggie carries her suitcase over to the sofa in the living
text: room. She surveys the messy room, which now has a mini-
text: trampoline in the middle of the rug. She stares at the mini-
text: trampoline, incredulous. Faith runs in.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look what we found in the trash!
text: Faith happily starts jumping up and down on it, doing splits
text: in the air.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY
text: Cam stands at the open fridge, staring into it, uninspired.
text: Amelia and Faith, wearing bathing suits, charge into the
text: kitchen full of energy. Amelia grabs bread, peanut butter,
text: jam and milk. Faith hops up on the counter and pulls down
text: two glasses, two plates. Amelia slaps together two
text: sandwiches and Faith pours two glasses of milk. The girls
text: leave the kitchen, each gingerly carrying a plate and a very
text: full glass of milk. Cam still stares into the fridge.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION. DAY
text: Cam waits in the car double-parked. He is driving a red
text: Toyota station wagon with one gray door. Maggie is confused
text: as she gets into the car.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What happened to the Valiant?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Didn't I tell you? It caught on
dialog: fire.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY
text: The swimming pool is being drained. Amelia, Faith, Kim, Ali
text: and Thurgood stand outside the chain link fence with their
text: bicycles, watching sadly as a tarp is pulled over it. After
text: a few moments, they hop on their bikes and pedal away.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: September. Amelia and Faith walk to school in a large and
text: lively group of children, all wearing big backpacks.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
text: Cam sits in his red armchair, watching TV, smoking. He is
text: unshaven and unkempt. He wears tube socks, a red smoking
text: jacket and tight tennis shorts. Amelia marches in and tapes
text: a sign on the TV screen that reads “SMOKING SUCKS AND THEN
text: YOU DIE!” Faith tapes one underneath with a picture of a big
text: black lung that says: “DEAD SMOKER’S ACTUAL LUNG!”
text: Cam stares blankly at the signs taped to the television. He
dialog: does not stop smoking. Then:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m depressed.
text: Amelia sits down on the floor and starts tying her sneakers.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Of course you are. Your family
dialog: gives you just barely enough money
dialog: to live on, you can’t hold down a
dialog: job, and you annoy people.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You left out my hemorrhoids.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (to Amelia)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Out. I’m meeting Kim and Ali.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Can I come?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (half-hearted)
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Can I come?
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: No! God! We’re going to hang out
dialog: with our friends!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: How come you never invite your
dialog: friends over here?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: To this shithole?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Stop saying that.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Daddy, you can’t hang around with
dialog: kids. It’s weird.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We need to have our own lives. And
dialog: you need your own life --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: How am I supposed to have my own
dialog: life when you won’t let me do
dialog: anything --
text: They leave, slamming the door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. MOMENTS LATER
text: Amelia and Faith wait by the elevator. Cam opens the
text: apartment door and stands at the end of the hall, looking at
text: them mournfully. They are both furious. They look away.
text: They look back. He is still staring at them. They exchange
text: a look. They are pained by his misery. Finally, they
dialog: relent:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Fine. We’re hanging out at the
dialog: picnic tables.
text: The elevator doors open. The girls get on.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: EXT. CONCRETE PARK. DAY
text: Kim, Ali and Thurgood sit at the metal picnic tables. Faith
text: and Amelia are across from them. Amelia has her Tarot cards
text: and she is doing a Tarot reading. She flips a card.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: The Death card.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Does that mean I’m going to die?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Not necessarily...
text: Cam stands at the end of the table, digging stuff out of his

speaker_heading: CAM

speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (to Kim)
dialog: Can we finish this at your
dialog: apartment?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Our parents don’t want us to have
dialog: anyone over. We just got a new
dialog: sectional.
text: Amelia looks at Thurgood who shakes his head.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: My older brother is studying for
dialog: law school -- he freaks out if
dialog: there’s kid noise.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You're all welcome to come over to
dialog: our apartment...
text: Faith and Amelia look at each other, furious. They both
text: glare at him.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Cam, can we speak to you for a
dialog: minute?
text: Faith and Amelia pull him aside, away from the other kids.
text: Cam looks uneasy.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I am about to lose my shit. We
dialog: said you could come hang out with
dialog: us. We did not say you could
text: invite people into the apartment.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: But I think it could be fun --
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: No. Not fun. Humiliating.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Do we need to spell it out for you?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: But I’1l make tea for everybody.
dialog: And cinnamon toast. We’ve got lots
dialog: of board games --
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: We don’t want people to see how we
dialog: live!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Big deal how you live! It’s not
dialog: your fault! Tell them your Dad’s
dialog: manic-depressive or bi-polar or
dialog: whatever they’re calling it these
dialog: days! Don’t not have friends
dialog: because of me!
text: The girls are thrown by this outburst. Cam slumps.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Fuck it. Forget it. Never mind.
text: He turns and walks back to the building, defeated. Faith and
text: Amelia look at each other, considering.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. DAY
text: Amelia and Faith stand outside their apartment with Thurgood,
text: Kim and Ali. Amelia takes her keys from around her neck.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I’m warning you. You’ve never seen
dialog: anything like this.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: I’ve been to messy houses before.
dialog: 79.
text: Faith raises her eyebrows.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Not like this.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (whispering)
text: I’1l run and close Daddy’s door.
text: Faith nods. Amelia opens the door and darts in. Faith
text: blocks the doorway.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT —- CAM’S BEDROOM. DAY
text: Cam sits at his desk. A radio has been pulled apart and he
text: is soldering a circuit board. His room looks like a bomb
dialog: exploded.
text: Amelia pokes her head in the door.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We brought some friends over.
text: Cam blinks, surprised.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Really?
text: Amelia nods and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. DAY
text: Amelia and Faith stand in the middle of the squalor with
text: Thurgood, Kim and Ali, who seem stunned by the mess.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Why do you have so much stuff?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (with authority)
dialog: Our Dad is totally Polar-Bear.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (to Faith, correcting)
dialog: Bi-polar.
dialog: (to the rest, explaining)
text: Manic-depressive.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: I have an uncle with that. He also

dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Hey! This is cool!
text: Kim happily bounces on the mini-trampoline in the middle of
dialog: all the squalor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The children fill the living room:
text: Amelia, Faith and Ali play Roulette.
text: Thurgood sits cross-legged on the mini-trampoline, bouncing
text: gently and staring at the album cover of “Guys and Dolls.”
text: Kim examines an old wooden cane. She pulls the handle and a
text: sword comes out. She is totally amazed.
text: Cam emerges from the kitchen with a teapot and a plate of
text: cinnamon toast points. He serves them all toast and refills
text: their teacups.
dialog: Cam has never seemed happier.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Would anyone like to learn how to
dialog: make chocolate truffles from
dialog: scratch?
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: Me!
text: He leaps to his feet and follows Cam into the kitchen.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE. DAY
text: Cam comes into view, striding up the hill, whacking at the
text: tall grasses with his machete. Behind him, the children
text: begin to appear; they march behind him, fanning out on either
text: side, talking and laughing: Amelia, Faith, Kim, Ali,
text: Thurgood, and three other kids from school.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. LATER
text: The gang of children spreads out, searching the ground for
text: mushrooms and playing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 81.
text: The children sit on a fallen tree trunk, watching, as Cam
text: demonstrates on Amelia how to twist someone’s arm behind
text: their back. Amelia grabs his arm and does it to him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Cam crams the kids into the Toyota. He lays the boys down in
text: the way back like cord wood. The engine turns over twice and
text: starts. The car is weighed down and drags in the back as Cam
text: drives slowly down the dirt road.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY
text: Amelia watches as Maggie frosts a birthday cake. Maggie
text: starts to pipe “Happy Birthday Faith” in white icing on the
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I don’t think I’m black.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Of course you’re black.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: But I look white.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Sweetie, you’re black.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: Faith looks black. I look like
dialog: Daddy.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You’re a mix of both of us.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Nobody thinks I’m black. When I
dialog: tell them. Nobody thinks I look
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Amelia, I am black. Your mother is
dialog: black. So you’re black.
text: Maggie runs out of space on the cake, halfway through
dialog: “Faith.”
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Damn it.
text: She throws down the pastry bag. Amelia feels guilty.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You know, you and Daddy could go
dialog: out to dinner some time. We don’t
dialog: need a babysitter.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You don’t?
text: Amelia shakes her head.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We used to get scared, but we’re
text: not scared anymore.
text: Maggie puts her hand on Amelia’s head and looks at her.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You’ve gotten so old.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: If it makes you feel better, I’1l
dialog: tell people I’m black. Even if
dialog: they think I’m delusional.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT
text: Cam and Maggie walk to a restaurant. They are both nicely
text: dressed, wearing scarves and overcoats.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I think the last time we were at
dialog: Legal Seafood, Faith pulled shrimp
text: scampi all over my silk blouse.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You were so sad.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It was my best shirt.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That was the same dinner where she
text: trundled across the room and
dialog: punched me right in the nuts.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You were so sad.
text: He nods, laughs.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Amelia told me she doesn’t think
text: she’s black.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: What? Her mother’s black. She’s
dialog: just testing you, being feisty.
text: She smiles at him with real gratitude. She links her arm
dialog: through his.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: She also said they’re not scared
dialog: anymore. The girls seem to be ina
dialog: really good place.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: No kidding. Amelia beat up the
dialog: class bully last week. Kicked him
text: so hard in the knee she put him on
dialog: crutches.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I felt quite proud.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You seem good too, Cam.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So do you. Well whaddaya know.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'll be so happy when I get a job
dialog: and I’m back here. Thanks for
dialog: making it possible.
text: Maggie smiles at Cam. He pulls her closer.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Stop sleeping on the sofa. Let’s
text: sleep in a bed together.
text: Maggie laughs but doesn’t pull away.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam, I can’t go in your room.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: It’s beyond belief. You have three
text: bicycles in there.
text: Cam looks flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s your reason?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yes! There are cans of paint
dialog: thinner -- and the last time I went
dialog: in there I got motor oil on my
dialog: skirt. I mean it’s... it’s
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Then I’1l clean it up.
text: Maggie laughs, teasing him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That would be nice. It would make
text: it more inviting.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You never said anything about this
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m done nagging you to clean your
dialog: room, you're a grown man and it’s
dialog: your room.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And my room is not inviting to you?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: No! Not to me or anybody else.
dialog: Probably not even to you.
text: Cam laughs, good-naturedly.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Definitely not to me. I’m cleaning
dialog: it up. It’1ll take me two days
dialog: tops. You’ll see. It’ll bea
dialog: thing of beauty.
text: They walk on.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. FINANCIAL FIRM. DAY
text: Maggie sits in a waiting room, professionally dressed,
text: completely pulled together. Across from her sit three
text: handsome 24-year-old white men. Suits, ties, polished shoes.
text: They are talking, laughing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN 1
dialog: ...of course I know Jim Quincy! We
dialog: were in the Delphic together at
dialog: Harvard... I actually won this belt
dialog: off him --
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Maggie Stuart?
text: Maggie stands. The young men look at her like she’s a
dialog: curiosity.
scene_heading: INT. PLUSH OFFICE. DAY
text: Maggie sits across from three fifty-year-old versions of the
text: young men in the waiting room.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: .-.I’m graduating at the top of my
dialog: class and I’ve actually been
dialog: offered a futures job at E.F.
dialog: Hutton in New York, but Howard and
dialog: Company is where I want to be.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN 1
dialog: E.F. Hutton, that’s terrific. Why
dialog: come back to Boston?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: My children are here --
text: Beat. Their eyes glaze over. Maggie instantly regrets
dialog: mentioning her children.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN 1
dialog: (politely)
dialog: And how old are your children?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: Twelve and ten. Very independent.
dialog: Which allows me to come in early
dialog: and work late --
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN 1
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Thank you so much. We'll let you
dialog: know.
text: The men stand up, signalling the end of the meeting.
scene_heading: INT. FINANCIAL FIRM. DAY
text: As Maggie walks past three young men in their nice suits and
text: ties, she understands her prospects.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Maggie waits on a corner in downtown Boston. She looks cold
text: and unhappy. She looks up the street and sees the red Toyota
text: wildly backing down the one-way street. Irate drivers honk
text: at Cam. He stops in front of her. She gets into the car.
scene_heading: INT. TOYOTA. CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: How'd the interview go?
text: Maggie puts on an upbeat front.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Really well I think! I know a lot
dialog: of people are vying for this
dialog: position, but I think I’m very
dialog: qualified. And I’ve got some more
dialog: interviews.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Any one of these places would be
dialog: lucky to have you.
text: She smiles at him gratefully.
scene_heading: INT. CAM’'S BEDROOM. DAY
text: Cam stands in the middle of his messy bedroom, pulling excess
text: books off the shelf and putting them in a box. He comes
text: across The Collected Poems of Robert Frost. He opens the
text: book. He sits down on the edge of the bed, reading.
text: Amelia calls from the kitchen:
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: AMELIA (0.S.)
dialog: Daddy, do I add more butter for
dialog: each omelette?
text: As Cam turns the page:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Half a tablespoon and make sure you
dialog: let it get nut-brown.
text: Faith steps into the doorway. She is festooned with gold and
text: pink ribbons wrapped around her arms and upper torso.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Did you start my costume?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: ...What costume?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You know. My Flamenco dancer
text: costume for the talent show.
dialog: You're making me a skirt.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Daddy, it’s tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (lamely)
dialog: Right. I know.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I knew it! You’re not making it.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I am making it. I said I would
dialog: make it and I will.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Can you even sew?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Hey, I was in the army.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I want it to be all sparkly and
text: ruffly.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You got it, buggins.
text: Faith claps her hands and excitedly breaks into her stomping
text: Flamenco dance. The neighbor below bangs on the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Cam opens a closet door and hauls Maggie’s sewing machine off
text: the top shelf.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Dining room table. Cam sits in front of the sewing machine,
text: a cigarette dangling from his lips. He studies Faith’s
dialog: Flamenco doll.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I just have to make this skirt, two
dialog: hundred times bigger.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: He draws a pattern on the pink satin fabric. He cuts out the
text: pattern, smoking all the while. A huge amount of ash drops
text: on the fabric. He doesn’t notice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: He pushes the fabric through the sewing machine. This way.
text: That way. The table is covered with dirty coffee cups. His
text: ashtray overflows with cigarette butts. He screws up a seam.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Goddamnit! I can’t do it! I can’t
dialog: fucking do it!
text: He yanks the fabric out of the sewing machine, throws it on
text: the floor, jumps on it, picks it up, throws it at the wall,
text: it flutters to the floor. This only fuels his rage. He
text: spastically grabs it, crosses to the open window and hurls
text: out the unfinished skirt. He pushes his hair back, looks
text: around wild-eyed and crazy.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. NIGHT
text: He wades through a bush to retrieve the skirt.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: Cam has returned to working on the skirt. He sews a ruffle
text: on. He turns to the flamenco doll.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Your skirt is a joke compared to
dialog: what this skirt is going to look
dialog: like.
text: Cam downs the last of a cup of coffee, cracks open a beer and
text: takes a swig.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Cam stands at the open window, drinking a beer. He picks up
text: the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: .--hello?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Guess what I did?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH MAGGIE
text: She turns on her bedside lamp and sits up, trying to orient
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam... it’s almost four in the
dialog: morning.
text: Cam examines the skirt with pride.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I just made your daughter an
dialog: incredible skirt. Sparkles,
dialog: ruffles... It’s probably my
dialog: greatest achievement since I
dialog: rebuilt the engine to my Dad’s
dialog: Studebaker in college.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That’s terrific, Cam. You should
dialog: probably get some sleep.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I don’t want to sleep.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: But you must be tired --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: But I’m not tired.
text: Maggie sits up.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam, you know how important sleep
dialog: is to --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Come on, Maggie! Name me one other
dialog: father in America who is up right
dialog: now sewing their daughter a
dialog: flamenco skirt!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam... You are taking your
dialog: lithium... aren’t you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Actually, I haven’t taken my
dialog: lithium since you left.
text: Maggie hangs her head.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I find that if I take small, steady
dialog: sips of beer throughout the day, it
dialog: keeps me on an even keel...
text: He takes a long, loud, defiant sip of his beer.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Abhh...
text: Maggie looks stricken.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. MORNING
text: Cam sits on the floor surrounded by bits of fabric.
text: Faith manages to squeeze into the very beautiful and way too
text: tight skirt. It is so tight all the way down, she can barely
text: move her legs. She finally gets it on and stares down at it.
text: She wiggles to make the ruffle move. Then:
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I look like a flamenco mermaid!
dialog: 91.
text: She hops over to Cam, throws her arms around his neck and
dialog: says dramatically:
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It’s the most glorious skirt I’ve
dialog: ever known!
scene_heading: EXT. STATION. SAME DAY
text: Maggie walks out of the train station. Cam is double-parked.
text: He wears his battered corduroy jacket and an Oxford shirt.
text: Maggie gets in the car, closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. TOYOTA STATION WAGON. CONTINUOUS
text: They sit in silence.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m not manic.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: But you could be.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I was excited. People are allowed
dialog: to get excited when they can’t sew
dialog: worth a damn and they manage to
text: pull off a flamenco skirt that gets
dialog: their daughter the second-most
text: applause at the talent show.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT. DAY
text: A tony Boston restaurant. The lunch crowd is well-dressed.
text: Cam and Maggie cross to sit down at the bar. Cam is angry.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You promised to take your lithium.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: And you promised to love me for
dialog: better or for worse.
text: The MAITRE D’ hurries over to them.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D’
dialog: Excuse me, sir. But our dress code
dialog: requires you to wear a tie...
text: Without missing a beat, Cam pulls an untied bowtie out of his
text: jacket pocket. As he ties it without looking:
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Let me say one thing about lithium -
dialog: - no one even knows if it works.
dialog: Same goes for haldol, valproic
dialog: acid, and all their other so-called
dialog: treatments. I’m just a guinea pig.
dialog: And you never would’ve known I'd
dialog: stopped taking it if I hadn’t told
dialog: you. I’m an idiot. A fucking self-
dialog: destructive fuckhead.
text: His bowtie is perfectly tied. The Maitre D’ nods and quickly
text: retreats from this conversation.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam, you said you would take
dialog: responsibility for your condition --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: The way you’ve taken responsibility
dialog: for your children?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That’s not fair. You know how hard
dialog: this was for me.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I know, I know, it was hard to come
dialog: every weekend...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No! It wasn’t hard to come, it
dialog: wasn’t hard to come...
text: Tears suddenly roll down Maggie’s face. Cam is startled.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: ...it was hard to leave. Every
dialog: weekend. And have people think I
dialog: was the worst mother in the world
dialog: because I wanted my children to
dialog: have a better life and I didn’t see
dialog: any other way to get it. You’re
dialog: from an old blue-blood family.
dialog: When you live in squalor, it’s
dialog: “eccentric.” When black people
dialog: live in squalor, believe me, no one
text: is charmed.
text: Cam is quiet for a moment as that sinks in.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: If it’s any consolation, no one
dialog: seems charmed by my squalor either.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CAM (cont'd)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I haven’t made any headway on my
dialog: bedroom.
text: Maggie looks at him and nods, resigned. Then:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m going to take the E.F. Hutton
dialog: job. In New York. It’s my only
dialog: offer.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: New York? Maggie, I can’t keep
dialog: doing this all by myself --
text: She puts her hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m not asking you to. You've done
dialog: an amazing job. It’s time for me
dialog: to take the girls.
text: Cam reacts.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You're taking the girls to New
dialog: York? But what about me and you?
dialog: What about us?
text: Maggie looks away. She is anguished. Cam seethes.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I knew it. I knew it.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: There’s so much I love about you,
dialog: Cam. And I don’t want to give up
dialog: on you. But I just... I can’t.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So were you even trying to get a
dialog: job here? Or was this your plan
dialog: all along?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No! My plan was to come home and
dialog: maybe I’d be with you and maybe I
dialog: wouldn’t, but we’d still be a
dialog: family. But none of that matters.
dialog: These Boston firms don’t want me.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Why don’t they want you?
dialog: 94,
text: She looks at him for a beat.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Because, Cam, this is Boston. They
dialog: want people like you.
text: This hits Cam like a ton of bricks. His face hardens.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You want a job in Boston? I’1l get
dialog: you a job in Boston!
text: Cam stands and storms out of the restaurant.
scene_heading: INT. DICK’S OFFICE. DAY
text: DICK, 40, sits behind a large oak desk with a view onto the

speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You look well, Cam. Everything
dialog: good down your way?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Not really, Dickie. No.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Sorry to hear that --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: As you know, Maggie’s just gotten
dialog: her MBA.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I heard. Good for her.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I was wondering why there isn’t a
dialog: place for her here. It is a family
dialog: firm, after all.
text: Dick sighs and looks sorry.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Well, Cam, I wish there were. But
dialog: we just don’t have the position at
dialog: the moment.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: So you're telling me that when
dialog: Dickie Jr and...the other one...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CAM (cont'd)
dialog: graduate from college, they won't
dialog: land here?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Sumner. That’s my other son --
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: God damn it, Dickie! I know how it
dialog: works! You create the position!
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I have to say, Cam, this is why we
dialog: never invite you to the Christmas
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I don’t give a shit about your
dialog: Christmas party. I want you to
dialog: hire my wife. She works fifty
dialog: thousand times harder than any of
dialog: you!
text: Dick gets up from the desk.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'm afraid I have to ask you to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Do you have any idea how hard it
dialog: is? Do you have any idea what
dialog: sacrifices she’s made? She needs a
dialog: job here! In Boston!
text: Cam picks up a model sailboat and hurls it at the wall.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Cam! Stop it! Snap out of it!
text: Cam picks up a chair and throws it at the bookcase, which
text: comes down. Dick tackles him to the floor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Two SECURITY OFFICERS escort Cam out. Dick puts his hand on

speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Just so you know, I won’t tell Gaga

dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cam? Cam?
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM. NIGHT
text: Cam stands at the sink, filling a glass of water. He is
text: soaking wet from head to toe. Maggie comes to the doorway of

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Why are you wet?
text: Cam doesn’t look at her. He takes out his bottle of lithium.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Girls asleep?
text: She nods. He empties three large pills into his hand.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Faith show you her skirt?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yes. It’s beautiful.

speaker_heading: CAM

dialog: I’m just going to miss them is all.
text: Maggie nods, with great sympathy.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 97.
text: She exits, gently closing the door. Cam looks around at his
text: room, the manifestation of failure.
scene_heading: INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR. DAY
text: Amelia and Faith sit at a round table, ice cream sundaes in
text: front of them. Maggie and Cam sit across.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Isn't New York really expensive?
dialog: Where are we going to live?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'll find an apartment in a very
dialog: safe neighborhood.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Where will we go to school?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I‘1ll figure that out.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: We can’t ride bikes in New York.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You can ride your bikes when you
dialog: come here.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What about Daddy? Who’s going to
dialog: take care of him?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Daddy will take care of himself.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I'll go to dinner parties, movies,
dialog: I’ll have escapades.
text: Faith and Amelia look disapproving.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I think escapades are a bad idea.
dialog: He could end up in jail.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: If we’re not here, he’1l drink too
dialog: much and stop taking care of
dialog: himself.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: He’1ll be lonely without us.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Well, that’s true.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Taking care of you alone has been a
dialog: lot of pressure for your father.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: How? We get to school...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: .--he drives us anywhere we want to
dialog: go...
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: ...we’ve seen more r-rated movies
dialog: than any of our friends...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: ...plus he makes us french toast
dialog: for dinner.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He needs a break.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: When I had the flu, he cut up
dialog: strawberries and kiwis for me. And
text: he arranged them on the plate like
dialog: little flowers.
text: Maggie looks at Cam. He shrugs modestly.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I did do that. I did that.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Daddy will visit and you’1l visit
dialog: him. New York is an incredible
dialog: city. You'll like it. I promise.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: What a crock.
text: Maggie is speechless. Cam nods at her.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Get used to it.
scene_heading: EXT. CONCRETE PARK. DAY
text: A hibachi engulfed in flame. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
text: Cam grills shishkebabs by the metal picnic tables. Though it
text: is a chilly day, he wears denim overalls, a striped denim
text: workshirt and a denim cap. The girls play Chinese jumprope
text: with Kim and Ali at the other end of the park. Maggie sits
text: at the picnic table, near Cam, watching her daughters play
text: with their friends.
text: Thurgood runs into the park area and stops in front of Cam.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: You've been working on the
dialog: railroad.
speaker_heading: CAM
text: All the live-long day.
text: Thurgood laughs and runs off to join the other kids. Maggie
text: smiles. Cam stares into the fire.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I can’t visit you in New York.
dialog: Too much speed and noise and all
text: the people out on the streets all
dialog: night. Winds me up. Knocks me off
dialog: track.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I was just thinking about that.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I do understand why you don’t want
dialog: to live with me. I’m a much better
dialog: father than I was a husband.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You know what Faith said to me last
dialog: night? She said: “You don’t lose
dialog: your temper like Daddy and you keep
dialog: the apartment nice, but the thing
dialog: about Daddy is he’s always around.
dialog: He’s always there.”
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I thought that irritated them.
dialog: 100.
text: He reaches through the flames and turns the shishkebabs with
text: long metal tongs. Maggie stares off. Then she takes a deep
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I have a plan. I take this job and
text: earn some money. The girls stay
dialog: here with you. They keep riding
text: their bikes. They stay with their
dialog: friends. But we get them into a
dialog: good private school where they can
dialog: be challenged. I insist on that.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Maggie. Are you sure?
text: Maggie stands and walks over to Cam.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: If they come to New York they’1l be
dialog: shut up like house pets in some
dialog: dark apartment and I'1l be working
dialog: till eight o’clock at night, every
dialog: night. I don’t want that for them.
text: Maggie looks over at the girls. Her heart breaks.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They're my babies.
text: Maggie buries her face in her hands. Cam holds out his arms.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE CHINESE JUMPROPE
text: Amelia is jumping. Kim looks over Amelia’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I thought your parents were
dialog: divorced.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: No, they're married.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: But your Mom doesn’t live with you?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: No. Except on the weekends.
speaker_heading: THURGOOD
dialog: So are they married on the
dialog: weekends?
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Sort of, not really...
text: Amelia turns to look at her parents at the other end of the
text: park. Maggie has collapsed into Cam’s arms and she is
text: sobbing. Cam is sobbing too. He still holds the metal
text: tongs. Amelia watches them for a long time. Then:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: It’s hard to explain.
scene_heading: INT. TOYOTA STATION WAGON. DAY
text: Cam drives the car on the highway, smoking. A CAT is draped
text: over Cam’s shoulders while he drives. The girls are sleeping
text: in the backseat under a blanket. Amelia yawns and stirs.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy? How much longer?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (pleasantly surprised)
dialog: You’re awake. I thought you were
text: going to sleep the whole way home.
text: He quickly stabs out his cigarette. Faith squirms awake.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We just crossed into Massachusetts.
dialog: We're making great time.
text: Faith climbs into the front passenger seat.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You both conked out so quickly.
dialog: Must’ve been a fun weekend.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It was. Mommy let me do her hair.
text: Cam drives. It’s quiet for a moment. Amelia sits up and
text: stares out the window, then:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Do you know that Mommy has a
dialog: boyfriend in New York?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Of course I know.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: He’s nice. But I don’t like him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Oh boy. Poor Mommy.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why poor Mommy?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Because it’s hard to conduct a
dialog: romance when your children are
dialog: gunning for your lover.
speaker_heading: AMELIA/FAITH
dialog: Ew! Lover!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Lover, swain, beau, whatever.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: How come you always feel so sorry
dialog: for Mommy?
text: Cam sighs and looks sad.
speaker_heading: CAM
text: Because Mommy tries hard. She
dialog: wanted things to go differently.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Me too.
text: Cam smiles.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Me three.
text: The girls laugh. Then Faith looks back at her sister and
text: rolls her eyes with irritation.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: Daddy, Amelia’s about to cry.
text: Cam looks in the rearview at Amelia who is crying.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Big Little... what is it?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I just... I worry about you.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Please, darling. Don’t worry about
dialog: me. I’11 be fine.
text: They drive in silence. Then, starting in an absurdly deep
text: voice, Cam breaks into “Annie Laurie.” He sings in a full
text: Scottish brogue, his voice getting very high and squeaky and
text: forlorn on the chorus.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Maxwellton Braes are bonnie
dialog: Where early lies the dew
dialog: Twas there that Annie Laurie
dialog: Gave me her Promise True
dialog: Gave me her promise true...
dialog: And ne'er forgot shall be...
dialog: For Bonnie Annie Laurie, I'd lay me
dialog: doon and dee...
text: The girls join in. As they sing, a series of cuts:
text: -- Cam takes Amelia and Faith on a walk through Mt. Auburn
dialog: Cemetery.
text: -- Amelia runs between the shelves of books in an overstuffed
text: bookstore. She rounds the corner and nestles in next to Cam
text: who sits on the floor, with Faith on his lap.
text: -- Cam proudly leads Amelia, Faith, Thurgood, Kim and Ali on
text: a tour through the grand old mansion on Beacon Hill. The
text: children are blown away by the splendor. As they file past
text: Mr. Fabrini on their way out, thanking him, he nods curtly
text: and gives them all a very tight smile. He is clearly
text: extremely annoyed by Cam and can’t wait to get rid of him.
text: Cam grins back at him, victorious.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT/EXT. TOYOTA STATION WAGON. DAY
text: They sing together.
speaker_heading: ALL THREE
dialog: Like dew on the gowan lying
text: Is the tread of her fairy feet
text: And like winds in summer sighing
text: Her voice is low and sweet
text: Her voice is low and sweet...
dialog: (high and squeaky)
dialog: She's all the world to me...
dialog: And for bonnie Annie Laurie, I'd
dialog: lay me doon and dee...
dialog: 104.
text: They speed down the highway.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHADY HILL SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELDS. DAY
text: AMELIA, wearing the school athletic uniform, her hair pulled
text: back in a tidy french braid, stands with eight other girls at
text: lacrosse practice. They are lined up, taking turns shooting
text: on goal. A TITLE CARD READS: One year later.
text: Amelia runs forward and fires a ball into the net.
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: Nice shot, Amelia!
text: Amelia waves at Cam, who is cheering from the sidelines.
text: Another girl runs and shoots into the net.
speaker_heading: CAM (0.S.)
dialog: Nice shot, Amelia’s friend!
text: Amelia jogs back to the line of girls.
speaker_heading: SHS TEAM MATE
dialog: How come your dad always comes to
dialog: practice?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: He’s got nothing else to do.
speaker_heading: ON CAM
text: He gives Amelia a thumbs up. He drops to his knee and takes
dialog: some pictures.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Practice is over. Amelia is laughing with her friends as
text: they put the lacrosse balls in a bag and pick up the cones.
text: Faith runs up to Amelia. Faith is wearing an SHS sweatshirt
text: and eyeglasses. Together the girls run over to Cam as he
text: puts a new roll of film in his camera. The rest of the team
text: heads back to the gym.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy, Annie invited me for a
dialog: sleepover, can I go? Please?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And Fifi asked if I wanted to go
text: with her family to the movies.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: But I finally convinced Eliot
dialog: Perkins to let me borrow his boat.
dialog: I thought we could have a picnic on
dialog: the river.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
text: It’s too late to go out on a boat.
speaker_heading: CAM
text: It’s four o’clock.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I really want to go to Annie’s.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Maybe Annie wants to take a ride
dialog: down the Charles River.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy...
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m serious. She lives in Boston.
dialog: How many times has she gotten a
dialog: ride home on a boat?
text: Now they are the only ones left on the field.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: She takes the T.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: What about Fifi, do you think she’d
dialog: like to have a picnic on the water?
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: Her mom’s picking her up in twenty
dialog: minutes. Please can I go?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: You will never find a more
dialog: beautiful boat or a more perfect
dialog: day to go out on the river.
text: They are unmoved. Cam shakes his head, giving up.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Okay, well, I guess I'll tell the
dialog: Charles River to go fuck itself.
text: Both girls laugh at his ridiculous reaction.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Well, I have heard that the Charles
dialog: River is a real asshole.
text: Cam chuckles at that.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Thanks, Daddy.
text: He nods. They both hug him. He hugs them back.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Bye, Daddy.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Oh, darlings, I’m so proud of you.
dialog: So's Mommy.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: We just are.
text: They back away from him, waving, then turn and head across
text: the field. He stands, watching them go. They glance back
text: over their shoulders, smile and wave again quickly. He waves
text: mournfully. They quicken their pace. Then he calls out:
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I love you!
text: They stop dead. They whirl around and steam toward him.
text: They are completely enraged.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Don’t do that.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Watch us walk away.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m just watching you walk.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Please don’t.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You make us feel bad.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I don’t want you to feel bad.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (stamping her foot)
dialog: Yes, you do! That’s why you stand
dialog: there looking all pathetic!
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m just watching you walk across
dialog: the field, for chrissake! I think
dialog: I’m allowed!
text: The girls sigh, frustrated. Amelia steps toward him, looking
text: him dead in the eye. She is stern, deliberate.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Daddy. We are walking away now.
dialog: And we are not turning around. We
dialog: are not looking back.
speaker_heading: CAM
dialog: I’m not asking you too!
text: They shake their heads.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (angry)
dialog: We love you, Daddy.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (furious)
dialog: We love you. Goodbye.
text: The girls turn and link arms. They huddle close together and
text: walk away from him as quickly as they can. As they go, Faith
text: glances at her sister with concern. She puts her hand over
text: Amelia's and squeezes it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don’t cry. Don’t cry.
text: Tears stream down Amelia’s face.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Can’t help it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CAM
text: Hands in his pockets, he watches them walk away.
text: Pressed together, in lock-step, they cross the playing
text: fields. Autumn leaves skitter around their feet.
text: They keep walking. They do not turn around. They do not
dialog: look back.
text: Then, just before they recede from view, they stop and turn.
text: They face him from this great distance. He brightens and
text: holds up his hand. They each hold up a hand. He makes a
text: fist in the air as if to say courage, onward. The girls do
text: the same. The three of them stand like that for a moment.
text: Then Amelia and Faith turn and run in the opposite direction,
text: disappearing into the gymnasium.
text: Cam looks up at the sky. He smiles to himself. He pulls a
text: tam o’shanter with a red pompom from his pocket and puts it
text: on his head. He lights a cigarette and walks toward the
dialog: river.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
