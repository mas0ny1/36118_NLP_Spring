scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAWN
text: A DEER stands by the treeline on the edge of a field.
text: The Deer looks up, frozen, staring at something off screen,
text: then suddenly it takes off, running full speed, bounding
text: across the land out into a clearing up ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Deer is running on the neatly trimmed grass. Up ahead A
text: SCHOOL BUILDING is visible.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL
text: The rising sun reflects on the windows. They’re large,
text: practically floor to ceiling.
speaker_heading: THE DEER
text: bombing across the field, getting closer to the school. It's
text: hooves kicking up mud. It's eyes black and emotionless.
text: Eventually it connects with
speaker_heading: THE WINDOW
text: Its face smashing into the glass. We see it in slow motion.
text: The window explodes around the deer, glass shards floating
text: in the air; blood tearing off the deer's body and mixing
text: with the hovering glass.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER
text: Several static shots of the aftermath. The shattered
text: classroom window; in the hallway, blood spattered and
text: smeared across the pristine white tile; a trail showing the
text: path the wounded animal took, leading to:
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: The Deer has collapsed in the middle of the room, exhausted,
text: bleeding out. A huddled brown lump gasping for air.
text: A JANITOR enters and pauses at the sight of it. He drops the
text: mop and runs down the hallway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 6
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - MORNING
text: Faculty members crowd around the scene, whispering, shocked,
text: disgusted, sad. Two POLICE OFFICERS make their way through.
speaker_heading: THE DEER
text: Kicks and squirms with what little life it has left. The
text: Officers look down at the poor creature, then around at the
text: STUDENTS lining the walls.
text: One Officer looks at the other and silently kneels down by
text: the dying animal. He gently takes its head in his hands.
text: While he holds it still, the other Officer raises his boot,
text: bringing it down hard on the animal's neck. It takes two
text: STOMPS to do the job, but the deer stops moving, its neck
dialog: broken.
text: He gets closer, makes sure the animal has stopped breathing,
text: and stands. He gives it a gentle kick. The Students stare,
text: some even crying.
speaker_heading: TITLE CARD:
scene_heading: SUPER DARK TIMES
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: A COLORFUL PIXELATED IMAGE
text: Moving, undulating, totally abstract. Colors shifting,
text: bathed in static. Uncomfortably close to a
speaker_heading: TV SCREEN
text: Just an indecipherable mess of colors and static until
text: suddenly out of the blur and fuzz a_person can be seen, but
text: then it’s gone again, flickering back and forth like a
text: magic-eye painting. The image suddenly clears again.
speaker_heading: A TOPLESS WOMAN
text: Here then gone. The volume is raised on the TV and little
text: stabs of music cut through the white noise, funky porno bass
text: accompanied by moaning.
text: SCRAMBLED TV PORN. It goes on a bit longer. Almost like
dialog: video art.
text: From nearby, we hear the VOICES of two teenage boys
speaker_heading: ee OF
dialog: * *
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: Would you?
speaker_heading: ZACH (0.S.)
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A YEARBOOK PHOTO OF A GIRL
text: She’s probably pretty. Hard to tell with that awkward school
text: photo smile.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, I would too.
text: They flip to a photo of ANOTHER GIRL. Blonde hair. Braces.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don’t know, probably.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Meh, blonde.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I see.
text: ANOTHER GIRL, unquestionably attractive.
speaker_heading: BOTH
dialog: Yes!
text: A YEARBOOK PHOTO OF A WOMAN. A teacher. The name underneath
dialog: reads ‘Mrs. Hunt.’
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Ohh, yes. Twice. If she’d let me.
text: ONE LAST PHOTO. Cute girl, terrible picture: mouth half
text: open, clearly not ready for the camera to snap.
scene_heading: INT. TV ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: The scrambled porn plays on TV while the two boys sit on the
text: couch flipping through their 8th grade yearbook. They are
text: ZACH and JOSH. Both 14 and trying too hard: Zach with his
text: short sleeve shirt and tie. Josh with his blue hoodie and
text: Elvis Costello glasses.
text: Zach’s finger is still on the photo.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Allison Banister.
text: Josh answers instantly.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Obviously yes. Any time, anywhere.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Really? Anywhere? Like ANY where?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Son, I’d do that shit for the talent
dialog: show if that's what it took. Onstage
dialog: in front of everyone: Fuck. Yes. You
dialog: wouldn’t?
text: Zach is reluctant to answer after Josh's declaration.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: She's cool. we’ve known her since,
dialog: elementary. I mean, I like her.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: We just actually know her. She and I
dialog: hang out sometimes in English so...
dialog: Feels weird talking about her.
text: An awkward pause between them. Clearly they’re both into
text: her. Josh changes the subject.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Uh-huh. Got any drinks?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Caffeine free Coke.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Well then...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Zach and Josh are slipping on their jackets and boots.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Man, I hate the fucking winter. It's
dialog: such a schlep to do anything.
dialog: *
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah, but the snow is pretty.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: It's pretty?
text: Zach shrugs off Josh's continued laughter and calls out to
dialog: his mother.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Mom! ...MOM! We’re going out for a
dialog: few minutes!
text: They head out through the door that leads into the garage.
text: Zach's mother, KAREN, belatedly answers, shouting back from
dialog: wherever she is.
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.)
speaker_heading: WHAT?
text: But there’s no one to hear.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON 9
text: The boys peddle through the wintry landscape: trees and
text: parks and subdivisions. It’s lovely. Mythic, in a way.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON 10
text: Two pumps and a convenience store.
text: Standing outside the store are two more boys: DARYL, messy
text: in appearance; kind of a dipshit. And a younger, sharp-eyed
text: kid named CHARLIE.
text: Zach and Josh talk quietly as they approach.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh, shit. Is that Daryl?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Leave him alone.
text: Daryl and Charlie are already approaching.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: ‘Sup, cockbiters?!
dialog: *
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (already sick of him)
dialog: Great.
text: Daryl rushes them and puts up his dukes like an old timey
text: boxer. Zach responds in kind and they circle each other
text: horsing around.
text: Josh waves at Charlie, sizes him up. Awkward introductions.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hey, I’m Josh
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You don't go to our school.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nope. Callaway Middle. Go Cougars!
text: Charlie’s a master of deadpan sarcasm. Josh laughs a little.
text: Zach breaks from Daryl’s affectionate headlock and chimes
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: He’s Carol’s little brother.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh, okay! Right.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Carol Sharp.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I know who Carol is.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Everyone knows Tig!
text: He pantomimes a set of large breasts.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, man.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Tig Bitty Sharp! You love it. You
dialog: LOVE it!
text: He grabs Charlie’s head and buries it in his pantomime
text: cleavage.
dialog: 11
text: Charlie pushes him off.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You smell like cat box.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Man, if I had tits I'd play with them
dialog: constantly.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Word. What are you guys doing here?
text: Daryl shrugs hard. You’re lookin’ at it.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: Just grabbing drinks and stuff.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You want to--
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Nah, cause I’m broke as fuuuuck!
text: Zach hesitates before saying:
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I have a couple of bucks if you
dialog: guys--
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Hell yeah!
text: Daryl and Charlie head into the store. Josh gestures to
text: Zach, angry but silent. What the hell are you doing?!
text: Zach signals back, innocent. What? These guys are alright!
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - AFTERNOON 11
text: The four boys wander around, examining everything, making
dialog: their selections.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Melon soda sounds gross.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why would they make it if it was
dialog: gross?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: They make tons of gross stuff, man.
dialog: Pickles are gross.
text: Josh is drawn to the small section of foreign food: strange
text: cans of nectar, bags of dried fruit, etc. Daryl steps up
text: beside him and snatches a bag.
speaker_heading: DARYL (cont'd)
dialog: Dried squid?! Holy shit!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Somebody eats it.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Nobody eats this.
text: Zach suddenly grabs the bag from him and heroically marches
text: to the register. The others follow. They place their
text: selections down on the counter.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’1l get it.
text: The other three wait outside while the store owner rings it
text: all up. He's an amusingly odd middle aged guy named DUKE.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Hey there, my friend.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You guys just hanging out?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What are you with these losers for?
dialog: Don’t you have a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: No girlfriend? You have a job?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: There's your problem, my friend: you
dialog: need more money. You looking for a
dialog: job?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: If you ever think you want one, come
dialog: talk to me. I own the sandwich shop
text: down the street. Great sandwiches.
dialog: You want a job, you stop by.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Alright, the total is 8.87.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - AFTERNOON
text: The dudes crowd around as Zach parcels out the snacks.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Thanks, Zach.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It’s cool.
text: Charlie starts chanting, maintaining his deadpan demeanor.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Squid! Squid! Squid!
text: Zach unveils the bag of spicy dried squid.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I can’t believe you got that.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: I want to see you eat it.
text: Zach theatrically pops a piece into his mouth. Chews. The
text: others stare. He keeps his cool for several seconds... then
text: breaks.
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
dialog: 10.
text: He grabs a bottle of soda from the bag in a big ass hurry.
text: He fumbles and drops it when he tries to get it open. When
text: he finally succeeds, it explodes, soda fizz streaming out.
text: Daryl laughs his ass off. Zach takes a huge swig of the
text: soda. Josh pats him on the back.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You okay?
text: Zach nods.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Give me one.
text: He reaches for the bag of squid.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: You guys are whacked.
text: Josh chews with much less fanfare.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s not terrible.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, but it’s not Skittles, either
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s not Skittles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Skittles is fucking delicious.
text: Josh offers the bag to Daryl. He sighs and reaches for a
dialog: piece.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON 13
text: The four of them are walking through a field beside the
text: road, Josh and Zach pushing their bikes, talking, laughing,
text: goofing around. Daryl smokes a cigarette, trying to look
dialog: cool. They pass
scene_heading: DARYL’S HOUSE 14
text: A small duplex, not a dump exactly but a far cry from Zach's
dialog: house.
dialog: 11.
text: Behind the house are huge power lines, running parallel to
dialog: the street, long connections which probably power the whole
dialog: county.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You live off the pipeline, that’s
dialog: cool.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Yeah, me and Charlie go back here all
dialog: the time.
text: They walk through Daryl’s back yard and into
speaker_heading: THE PIPELINE
text: It’s a huge strip of land that’s been cleared of trees. This
dialog: is where the county’s utilities are run through: power-lines
text: overhead and water pipes buried in the ground, creating a
text: no-man’s land that stretches as far the eye can see in
dialog: either direction.
text: The guys walk out and follow along the path of the power-
text: lines overhead. Tall trees surround them.
text: The power lines cut shapes against the cloudy blue sky.
text: Daryl lags behind, coughing between drags on his cigarette.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What's up with your lung, dude?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Nothing. I'm just tired. My parents
dialog: rented True Lies last night and when
dialog: they went to sleep I watched that
text: strip tease on repeat. Jerked off two
dialog: and a half times.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That a record?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Tried for three but my dick got sore,
dialog: had to put some ice on it, but the
dialog: tray wasn't filled so I settled for a
text: piece of steak from the freezer.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: * ee eK *
dialog: *
speaker_heading: ee eK
dialog: 15
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Did you put the steak back in the
dialog: freezer?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Hell no, I cooked it up, scarfed that
text: shit and passed out on the couch.
text: The other three are stunned.
speaker_heading: DARYL (cont'd)
dialog: I'm fucking with you! Of course I put
dialog: it back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dude-
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: This is not the point of the story!
dialog: The point is: bitch be hot. Like
dialog: Charlie's sister.
text: Zach laughs.
speaker_heading: DARYL (cont'd)
dialog: Or Zach's mom.
text: Zach stops laughing. Josh grins at him.
speaker_heading: DARYL (cont'd)
dialog: Right?!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He's not wrong.
scene_heading: FURTHER DOWN THE PIPELINE 15
text: They reach one of those huge steel-grid structures where the
text: power-lines connect. The four boys stop beneath it and stare
text: up at the towering edifice.
text: METAL EXTENDS INTO THE SKY, the black cables on top 50, 75,
dialog: 100 feet up?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So if you touched the wire at the top
dialog: you’d be electrocuted?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Only if you were also touching the
dialog: metal part, that’s how birds can sit
dialog: up there.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Yeah, man if you were just swinging
dialog: from the cable you’d be fine. My
dialog: uncle did it once.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sure...
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Won a thousand bucks, but broke his
dialog: fuckin’ leg tryin to get down.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I guess that evened out then.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Hell yeah it did. Slickest shit I
dialog: ever saw.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I could do it.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Are you special forces?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Well, my uncle was, so fuck you.
text: Josh walks over and starts climbing the structure. After a
text: beat they all climb on as well.
text: Four boys attempting to scale a metal tower in the middle of
text: an open field.
text: CHARLIE gets about five feet off the ground before looking
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know what? Nope.
text: He jumps down and dusts his hands off. Shielding his eyes
text: with a hand-visor and looking back up at
scene_heading: THE OTHER THREE BOYS
text: Still slowly climbing, Josh clearly in the lead.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Be careful!
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Mom? Is that you down there?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, I wanted to tell you about me
dialog: and your friend Charlie.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Puss!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Never mind. Don’t be careful.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: That's more like her, hi mom!
text: Daryl cackles to himself. As he does, his foot slips ona
text: rung of the tower. He has to hold tight with his arms in
dialog: order not to fall.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Shit. These shoes have no grip. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just let go, you’re not that high.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Fuckin--
text: Daryl lets himself hang and drops down to the ground.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Fuckin shoes, no fuckin grip.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE *
dialog: We can’t all be special forces.
text: Zach Keeps climbing but he’s still behind Josh. *
speaker_heading: ZACH’S POV *
text: We see Josh several feet higher than him on the tower.
text: The sun is just behind his head, keeping us blind to Josh’s
text: face and creating an exquisite halo around him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Come on, you can make it.
text: Zach is getting fatigued. And scared. *
dialog: 16
dialog: 17
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don’t know, man, I think I’m going
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, come on!
text: Zach squints in the sunlight, trying to see Josh’s face.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: A little more.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sorry.
text: JOSH watches as Zach climbs down and jumps off. For a moment
text: he’s up on the tower alone.
scene_heading: THE THREE BOYS
text: Below are looking up at him, framed against the sky.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: I guess you win.
text: JOSH hears him but says nothing. Up here he has a pretty
text: wide view: trees and houses spreading out in the distance.
text: He stares out at the town. Over it. Down on it.
text: We hold on his face in the quiet for an uncomfortably long
dialog: beat.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING
text: Zach and Josh bike down a street past a "SCHOOL ZONE" sign.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Let's cut through.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - EVENING
text: It's vast and mostly empty, clearly a weekend. They take
text: their time, slow-pedaling and talking as they cross the lot.
dialog: 16
dialog: 17
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I feel bad for him. He was a friend
dialog: of mine in third grade. Not his fault
dialog: his dad’s fucking poor.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Doesn't make him not a douchebag. You
dialog: still see him at school?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah we have health together. He's
dialog: always trying to talk to Cindy
dialog: Maples.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: The one everybody says went to the
dialog: hospital because she had a frozen
dialog: hotdog stuck in her?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I guess so. Maybe she's his type.
dialog: Cold meat and all...
text: They get to the edge of the lot and continue across the
text: grass toward the football field. As they pass the building
text: Zach looks to his left and sees
scene_heading: THE BROKEN CLASSROOM WINDOW
text: Now patched over with cardboard, a temporary fix until the
dialog: school can replace the glass.
text: Josh stops suddenly. Zach looks at him, Josh nods toward
speaker_heading: THE BLEACHERS
text: Up ahead. A group of OLDER KIDS hanging around underneath,
text: smoke wafting out in waves.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Just keep going. We don't have to
dialog: stop.
text: Josh nods. They pick up the pace, trying to act casual.
text: As they pass we get a better look: these guys are seniors,
text: some of them maybe even older. Empty beer cans. Cigarettes.
dialog: Joints.
text: One of them is younger, more Josh and Zach's age, with dyed-
text: blue hair, this is JOHN WHITCOMB.
dialog: * *
speaker_heading: ee OF ee OF
dialog: * *
dialog: 17.
text: He sees them but says nothing. One of the older guys does, a
text: sneering son of a bitch named CHAD.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Hey!
text: Josh and Zach keep going, Zach muttering under his breath.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Shit. Bad idea. Just go.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Yo! I'm talking to you!
text: Chad’s buddies laugh. Josh grits his teeth and turns, throws
text: his arms out and shouts.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: You seen my cunt?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Forget it, come on.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: You seen my cunt?
text: John Whitcomb speaks up, trying to clarify.
speaker_heading: JOHN WHITCOMB
text: Dana, his girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Nah, we haven’t seen anybody. We
dialog: gotta get back.
text: Chad snaps and points at Josh in recognition.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Josh, right? How’s Danny doing?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He's fine.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: He get that "basic" training? They
dialog: broke him in yet?
dialog: 18
dialog: 18.
text: The other guys start laughing. Josh isn't amused.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Tell him I want to hang out when he's
dialog: back home. I'm sure by then he'll
dialog: suck better dick than her anyway.
dialog: (clarifying for his
dialog: friends)
dialog: Josh's brother joined the Navy.
text: Josh is trembling with anger. He mumbles to himself.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s the marines.
text: Chad gets up and steps toward them.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: What’s that?
text: Josh is consumed with rage. He won't back down, even though
text: they're clearly outweighed and outnumbered.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s the fucking marines.
text: Chad bursts out laughing. His friends do likewise.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Damn right it is.
text: He pantomimes a jackrabbit hump in the air.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: You guys want to join the ‘fucking
dialog: marines’? I’m recruiting tonight.
text: Zach pulls Josh away.
speaker_heading: CHAD (cont'd)
dialog: Aw, don't run away, Weezer!
text: Explosive, drunken laughter. Zach and Josh mount their bikes
text: and speed off.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBDIVISION - EVENING 18
text: They walk their bikes down the street. Not talking much at
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: eee OF
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I think he really wanted to screw
dialog: your brother.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Danny doesn't do that.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh, I know. I just thought it was
dialog: funny that the dude was so committed
dialog: to the idea.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Fuck John Whitcomb, too. Just sitting
text: there while his cool senior friends
dialog: act like total assholes. What kind of
dialog: dipshit puts Kool-Aid in his hair?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: John's okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He used to be. I just hate all those
dialog: guys. People like that are fucking
dialog: worthless.
text: Zach nods, listening, trying to figure out a way out of the
text: conversation. He looks both ways down the street. He has an
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah, I know but we're over it...
dialog: Here, let's go this way.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why?
text: They walk on.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: That’s her house.
text: He points to a cramped little two story.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Allison? You've been to her house?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Nah, we used to ride the same bus
dialog: back before they changed the route.
text: They both stand looking at it.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I wonder which one is her window.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Perv.
text: Josh casually extends his middle finger but keeps his eyes
text: on the house.
text: Josh laughs,
dialog: Zach listens,
dialog: to interrupt.
text: There are FLASHES as Josh speaks. Memories. Fleeting images.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: She's cool, right?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: She’s very cool. We can leave her a
dialog: note, if you want: "Dear Allison, I
dialog: have this idea for the talent
dialog: show...”
text: remembering his own joke.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You remember last year when she tried
dialog: to open that glue bottle?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: (confused)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We were working on that project. She
text: couldn't get it. It had dried shut or
dialog: whatever and she was just struggling.
dialog: I couldn't take my eyes off her. And
dialog: then all of the sudden it went, like
text: ruptured, spurted this white glue all
text: over her hands.
text: not sure where this is going, but not wanting
scene_heading: ALLISON'S HANDS COVERED IN GLUE
speaker_heading: JOSH (cont'd)
dialog: And she just giggled and said
dialog: "whoops".
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: But you couldn't stop thinking
dialog: about...
text: Zach cups his hands to his mouth and shouts.

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Shit!

speaker_heading: KAREN

speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)

scene_heading: INT. ZACH’S ROOM - NIGHT 20
text: He punches the number in on a white cordless phone. He

text: Fuck it. He presses the button.
text: As he waits for it to ring, he loosens his tie and carefully
text: puts in on a hanger with a half dozen other PRE-TIED

speaker_heading: ALLISON

speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: Get the fuck out! I’m on the phone! I *
dialog: mean it! *

speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Hey, sorry. Zach?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: ALLISON

dialog: but it’s at my friend Rebecca’s
dialog: house, Rebecca Burton, she's in our *

speaker_heading: ZACH

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I can’t remember the combination.
dialog: What are you looking at?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Put some in my locker then. Or ask in

speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Yeah, I mean like his parents have so

dialog: Check it out!
text: He brandishes the sword.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where’d you get that?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: It’s his brother’s.
text: Zach and Josh have arrived.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are you guys doing?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - AFTERNOON 31
text: A MILK JUG - soaring through the air against a blue sky in
text: ultra slow motion.
text: Whack! The sword swings in and slices it clean in two, water
text: flying everywhere. Josh's expression is one of ecstacy as
text: water cascades down on him in ultra slow motion.
text: The four boys cheer and laugh - ultra slow motion.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Let Charlie go.
text: Josh hands the sword to him.
text: DARYL is sitting a few feet away, emptying the tobacco from
text: the end of a cigarette. He pulls the BAG OF WEED from his
text: pocket, pinches off a bit and stuffs it in.
dialog: 41.
text: ZACH turns and sees what he’s up to. They lock eyes a *
text: moment, Daryl freezes.
text: But Zach looks away. He won’t rat him out. Daryl finishes *
text: and lights up. Puffs. Coughs. Laughs at his own cough.
text: Charlie and Josh are still goofing around with the sword,
text: setting another jug up on an the old fence post they’ve
dialog: found.
text: Daryl COUGHS again. Charlie looks over. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You alright over there?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZACH *
dialog: Forget it, Charlie.
text: But now Josh is paying attention, too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What is that?? *
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: A Cigarette.
text: Josh is suspicious
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah?
text: Daryl tries to ignore the whole thing.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Alright. My turn. Let me see the
dialog: sword.
text: But Josh is pissed. He storms over.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Daryl, what the fuck? *
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Give me the sword.
text: He snatches The Sword from Josh's hand.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Did you take the weed from my
dialog: brother’s room?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: It’s a cigarette! Okay? It’s a
dialog: fucking cigarette.
text: Josh looks to Zach for confirmation. None is forthcoming, so
text: he looks to Charlie. Charlie glances at Daryl.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s what it looks like.
text: Josh isn’t buying it. He can tell they’re trying to avoid a
dialog: confrontation.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Bull. Give it to me.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: My cigarette? What are you gonna do
dialog: with it?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Daryl!
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Come get it!
text: He tries to make a game out of it, waving the sword around.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m not kidding.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Daryl.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: If you took the bag just give it back
text: to him.
text: Daryl sighs, angry at Zach’s betrayal. He starts off, sword
text: in hand.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Daryl, come on.
text: Zach grabs his shoulder. Daryl SPINS around, lifting the
dialog: sword.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: Shit!
text: Angry, he bats the sword away.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell?
text: Daryl shakes his head, distraught.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Fuck you guys.
text: He flicks his joint/cigarette at Zach’s face, sticks the
text: sword into the ground and storms off. Charlie is clearly
text: uncomfortable, not wanting to take sides.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Asshole.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Just leave him alone for minute.
dialog: He'll calm down.
text: Josh calls after him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You steal anything else from my
dialog: family?
text: Daryl ignores him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: How would you like it if I went to
dialog: your house and took shit from you? Oh
dialog: that's right, you don't have anything
dialog: because you live in a fucking duplex.
dialog: 43.
text: Daryl turns around and takes a few steps toward the group.
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: Hey Zach, thanks for inviting me out.
dialog: Too bad your boyfriend's on the rag.
dialog: Make sure to slap him around a little
dialog: bit tonight, keep him in line.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, everybody just shut up.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: This is stupid, give me the bag.
text: Daryl pulls the bag of weed from his jacket and hands it
text: over. Zach stoops to pick up the samurai sword. He turns
text: them both over to Josh.
dialog: *
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Here's your stuff back.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Guess we should call it a day.
text: Zach shakes his head at Josh and they all start to head back *
text: to the road.
text: Charlie winces at Daryl, trying to cheer him up. Jeez, that *
text: was nuts. It doesn’t work. Daryl turns away from him, he's *
text: angry, embarrassed.
text: They walk in silence for a moment, heading out of the field.
text: Suddenly, Daryl takes a SWING at the back of Josh’s head.
speaker_heading: BAM!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Stop!
text: But Daryl’s on him, swinging like crazy. Pissed.
text: Charlie and Zach look at one another, each expecting the
text: other to step in and stop them.
text: Josh and Daryl wrestle in the grass. Charlie tries to laugh *
text: at the ridiculousness of the situation as he shouts at them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd) *
dialog: Okay! Stop it, guys! *
text: And then there’s a SCREAM. No. Screams. From both of them. *
text: One of pain. The other of horror.
text: Zach kneels beside the struggling pair.
speaker_heading: BLOOD *
text: In the grass (or snow). Everywhere. *
speaker_heading: THE SWORD *
text: Is embedded in Daryl’s neck. Charlie finally loses his cool. *
text: Completely. He shrieks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Oh my god, oh my god!
text: Zach is horrified.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Jesus, Josh!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I didn’t! He fell!
text: Daryl GASPS for air. Trying to speak. He can’t. It’d be so
text: much better if he didn’t try, if he didn’t GURGLE.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Oh god, what do we do?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Take it out! Take it out!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No!
text: But it’s too late. Zach’s already removed the sword and
text: tossed it aside.
text: GUSH! A spray of crimson into the dirt.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE IT IN!
text: Charlie’s lost it. His adolescent voice is cracking.
text: He lunges at Zach. Swats at him. Zach shoves him back and
text: Charlie goes sprawling on his ass.
speaker_heading: DARYL
text: Crawls away, hand over the gaping hole in his throat.
text: He gets to his feet, looks down at himself, at the blood. He
text: takes off running further into the woods.
text: Charlie stands, dumbfounded, calling after him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Daryl!
text: But Daryl is running on pure instinct. He has no idea what
dialog: to do, where to go. He’s just running
scene_heading: ACROSS THE FIELD
text: Burbling as he goes.
text: Josh and Zach race after him. Calling for him to slow down.
dialog: 32
dialog: 46.
text: He can barely hear. The BEATING of his heart and the
text: heaviness of his BREATH are the only sounds that reach him.
text: He enters the surrounding
speaker_heading: FOREST
text: His eyes are closed. A sprinter at the finish line.
text: His foot hits the ground at an odd angle. It twists
text: underneath him, sending him sprawling forward and tumbling
text: into a ditch.
text: Josh and Zach arrive, out of breath, shivering with
text: adrenaline. They look down into
speaker_heading: THE DITCH
text: It’s a six or seven foot drop to the bottom. That’s where
text: Daryl is lying, face down. His ankle is twisted gruesomely.
text: He isn’t moving.
text: The guys are completely at a loss.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Is he--
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don’t know. We need to check on
dialog: him. Do you know how to check for a
dialog: pulse?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: His neck or his wrist, right?
text: Stalemate. Neither wants to do it. Zach stares at Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I know.
text: Zach looks around and sizes up the best way to climb down.
text: He slowly makes his way to Daryl and kneels beside his head.
text: He reaches out, trying to avoid the wound. The blood.
text: He presses his fingers to Daryl’s neck. He concentrates but
text: it’s hard to tell.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Daryl?
dialog: 32
dialog: *
dialog: 47.
text: He shakes him.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: Daryl? Daryl, can you hear me? Are
dialog: you awake, man?
text: Zach bites his lip and does the thing he really doesn’t want
dialog: to do: He put his hands on either side of
scene_heading: DARYL’S HEAD
text: And lifts it up from the ground. Zach kneels lower to the
text: ground and looks at
speaker_heading: DARYL’S FACE
text: His mouth hangs open and his eyes are blank. With the head
text: lifted Zach can see the blood continuing to issue from
text: Daryl’s neck.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Is he...
text: Zach is startled to realize Josh is kneeling behind him.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don't know. I can't tell. You
dialog: check.
text: Zach gets up and moves away from the scene, after hesitating
text: a moment he vomits on the ground. Dropping to his kneels
text: with the intensity of it. When he finishes he looks up.
text: JOSH is still kneeling over Daryl.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: He’s dead.
text: The two boys stand in silence for a moment.
text: JOSH seems stunned. No clear emotion on his face. He seems
text: small, helpless.
text: ZACH looks at his friend with sympathy. This is a fucked-up
text: problem but he can at least try to help. He thinks for a
text: sustained, silent moment.
speaker_heading: JOSH (cont'd)
dialog: Zach. What do we do?
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Okay, we need to leave.
text: Zach walks over and picks up a pile of dead leaves and du
text: them on top of Daryl’s body.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Covering him up. Come on, help me.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you sure-
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don’t know, it's something.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Where’s Charlie?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Shit. I don't know.
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: He took off.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He’1l tell! We’ve gotta find him.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: How? Do you know where he lives? His
dialog: phone number? He won’t tell. He’s not
dialog: stupid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He might try and get help. ...Maybe
dialog: we should get help.
text: Zach continues burying the body with leaves.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.)
dialog: We should hide this too.
text: Zach and Josh turn to see Charlie standing at the edge of
text: teh ditch, clutching the bloody sword.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON
text: In another part of the woods, the boys walk together
text: slowly, looking for a hiding place.
dialog: 48.
dialog: Imps
dialog: 33 *
dialog: 34
dialog: 35
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Over there.
text: He’s pointing at A TREE with an empty hollow in it.
text: Zach removes his sweatshirt and wipes down the sword with
text: it. Then he wedges the sword into the hollow. It’s still
text: visible.
text: He wedges his sweatshirt in over it, then grabs a handful of
text: wet pine straw and leaves. He crams it in, camouflaging it.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - EVENING 34
text: They wander through the tall grass back to the road. And see
speaker_heading: FOUR BIKES
text: Parked at the edge of the field. Josh’s, Zach's,
text: Charlie's... and Daryl’s.
text: Charlie looks at the two boys. Without another word he gets
text: his bike and rides off.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’ll take care of it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It’s fine, I’1l move it somewhere.
dialog: It’1l be dark soon and we shouldn’t
text: both get home late.
text: Josh mounts his bike. He reaches out and touches Zach’s
text: shoulder. It doesn’t seem like enough. He grips it. Pats
text: him, hard.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Thank you.
text: They make eye contact. And then Josh is gone. Zach is alone.
text: He takes Daryl’s bike and rides it
scene_heading: UP THE ROAD 35
text: A little way until he sees a pasture with horses off to one
text: side. He goes to park the bike against the fence- then
text: thinks for a second and throws it over, obscuring it in the
text: tall grass.
dialog: 36
dialog: 37
dialog: 38
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLY ROAD - EVENING 36
text: The sun has just set and the light is disappearing fast.
text: Zach is the only thing on this road. He pumps as hard as he
text: can, climbing a hill, reaching the top of it, then beginning
text: his roller coaster-like decent.
text: Only instead of standing up or letting the bike just roll,
text: Zach pedals even harder on the incredibly steep downhill
dialog: slide.
text: He pumps faster and faster, the bike wobbling under the
text: strain of the speed. The wind is blowing on his face and he
speaker_heading: CLOSES HIS EYES
text: Squeezing tears down his face, pumping harder than ever
text: until, finally, at the bottom of the hill, he loses control
text: of the bike and tumbles down onto the asphalt.
text: He hits the ground hard and continues to roll and scrape
text: himself for several more feet. He lands on his back and lies
text: there in the fading light staring up at
speaker_heading: THE SKY
text: The stars are just beginning to be visible and the moon in
dialog: full.
scene_heading: EXT. ZACH'S HOUSE - EVENING 37
text: Zach walks his wrecked bike up to the garage.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 38
text: Zach slips in from the garage. He’s beat up from his fall,
text: exhausted from everything else. He walks straight to the tap
text: and downs a huge glass of water. He doesn’t notice...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: Is sitting behind him, watching him with nervous curiosity.
text: He fills the glass again. Halfway through it, he sees her
text: and jumps, startled. Surprise quickly turns to confusion.
dialog: What the hell is she doing here?
text: She waves, a little embarrassed.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Your mom... I just stopped by, she
dialog: said you’d be back. She went to get
text: come Cokes out of the closet.
text: He just stands there, panting.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Oh... I was on my bike.
text: She notices his bloody elbow.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Oh god, are you okay?
text: Karen walks in with a case of soda under her arm.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It’s caffeine free, I hope... Ah,
dialog: see! There he is.
text: She smirks at him knowingly. Then notices his wound.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You’re bleeding.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It’s fine.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I fell. On my bike...
text: She lifts his arms to examine it and winces, hissing through
text: her teeth.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That looks nasty. You should clean
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I will.
text: There’s an awkward beat. Allison is realizing that coming
text: here wasn’t such a great idea. Zach is still spaced out.
text: Karen has to step in.
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: Zach’s room is upstairs.
dialog: 52.
text: Zach nods in Allison’s direction and heads up. She follows,
text: uncertain. She glances at Karen for support. Karen gives her
text: a nod and wave. He’s always like this.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ZACH’S ROOM - EVENING
text: Allison starts babbling behind him.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I was just walking and I passed by...
dialog: I guess I should have called first
dialog: but I didn't realize I'd be near your
dialog: house until I saw it and said "oh
dialog: that's Zach's house, maybe I should
text: stop and yell ‘handjobs’ at the top
dialog: of my lungs.”
text: Zach glances back at her. She nods, eyebrow raised. Zach
text: takes a breath and stops by the upstairs bathroom to grab a
text: wad of toilet paper. He uses it stop the flow of blood from
text: his elbow.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: She’s right. You should clean that.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I will. Just for now.
text: She nods and follows him into his room. He sits on the bed,
text: clearly distracted. There’s no place for her to sit.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: »..You want me to go?
text: He doesn’t answer. He’s trying and failing to hold
dialog: everything in.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m sorry. I-
text: She’s suddenly, surprisingly earnest.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Don’t apologize.
text: She moves to the doorway, out of his line of sight. He
text: buries his face in his hands, rubbing the temples.
text: The door creaks shut. Click.
text: As soon as he hears it, he lets loose. A big, weird wail. A
text: gasp for air. Not tears or sobs exactly.
dialog: 40
dialog: 53.
text: Just an exhalation of emotion. He shudders as it leaves him.
text: Then he sits back. And sees...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: Is still there. She didn’t leave, only closed the door. He's
text: instantly startled and embarrassed. She doesn't say
text: anything, just sits beside him on the bed.
text: She puts her arm around him. It's a slightly awkward gesture
text: of comfort, but they stay like that and the awkwardness
text: subsides.
text: Zach rests his head on her shoulder. She runs her fingers
text: through his hair and starts to wipe his tears. He reaches up
text: and gently grabs her hand, turns to her and brings his lips
dialog: to hers.
text: It's barely a kiss at first, just an extension of intimacy,
text: but it lingers for a moment before he pulls away.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I'm sorry.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING 40
text: Karen is sitting on the sofa, eating toast and reading a
text: trashy novel. She hears them come downstairs and talk
text: quietly in the foyer. The front door opens. And closes.
text: She lays her book down, listening in. There’s nothing to
text: glean, however. Just mumbled goodbyes. Eventually Zach
text: shuffles in.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: A short visit then?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m going to bed.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It’s early.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m tired. Probably just read or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Are you hungry?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Nah.
dialog: 41
dialog: 42
dialog: 54.
text: She can tell something’s wrong but doesn't push him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Okay.
text: He goes. She tries to let him, but she can't. She's up and
dialog: following.
speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm cleaning those cuts!
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM 41
text: Zach sits on the closed lid of the toilet while Karen works
text: around him, dabbing his cuts with iodine and putting band
text: aids on them.
text: He sits motionless, allowing her to perform this motherly
dialog: task.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Ouch, you might as well play
dialog: football.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yeah... fuck football.
text: That almost gets a smile from him and she’s happy enough for
dialog: that.
scene_heading: INT. ZACH’S ROOM - NIGHT 42
text: He’s fidgeting in bed, trying to get comfortable. It’s not
text: working. He can’t sleep. He sits up and sees
speaker_heading: A FIGURE
text: Sitting on the floor in the corner of his room.
text: He reaches for his bedside lamp. But once it’s switched on
text: he can see there's nobody there.
text: Zach lays back down, but he leaves the bedside lamp on.
text: Eventually, he reaches for his walk-man, puts in a new tape
text: and hits play. We can hear the low rumble of heavy music.
dialog: 43
dialog: 44
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN ROAD - AFTERNOON 43
text: Seen from high above: a lone rider cruising down the middle
text: of the road. It's Zach on his busted bike. The chain
text: rattling against the bent gear shaft. He's got his
text: headphones on. Exhausted.
scene_heading: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 44
text: Kids streaming out of the building. Running, screaming,
text: goofing around.
text: Zach is there in the throng, searching frantically. Ah-ha!
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Charlie!
text: He flags him down. Charlie is not pleased.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: We should talk.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No we shouldn’t.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh wasn’t at school today.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So go talk to him.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I am. I’m going to, I thought we
dialog: should get our story straight-
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There’s no story.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: If someone asks-
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t remember. I don't remember
dialog: what I did last Tuesday. Why would I
dialog: remember what I did this Tuesday?
dialog: Probably, I went home after school
dialog: and stayed there alone until my
dialog: parents got home. Like I do most
dialog: weekdays.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You’re right. That’s good.
speaker_heading: ee OF
dialog: 45
dialog: 46
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So why’d you come running over here
text: to the middle school to talk to an
dialog: 8th grader you barely know? ...If
dialog: anyone asks?
text: Shit. Zach hadn’t thought of that. He gets the drift. He
text: gives Charlie a nod.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE *
dialog: We’re not friends.
scene_heading: EXT. JOSH’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 45
text: Zach rings the doorbell. Waits. Nothing. He stares at down
text: at an old doormat: faded letters that say "Welcome Y'all!" *
text: He knocks on the door a few times.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh?
text: He goes around the side of the house, peering in windows. He
text: lingers outside Josh’s bedroom.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh!
text: He pauses and turns to see a NEIGHBOR LADY hosing off her *
text: back porch. She’s stopped what she’s doing to squint
text: suspiciously at Zach.
text: He slouches and heads back to the sidewalk and his bike. He *
text: sighs and heads home. *
scene_heading: INT. ZACH’S ROOM - EVENING 46
text: Zach is pacing, staring at the white cordless phone sitting *
text: on his bed when there’s a sudden knock on his door.
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.) *
dialog: Zach?
text: He throws the phone down, equal parts startled and
text: frustrated.
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.) *
dialog: Can I come in?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 57.
text: He sits on the bed. She enters and scans the room.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Do you know a boy named Daryl Harper?
dialog: Didn’t you two used to play together?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What? Like a long time ago. Why?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: His mother called earlier. I guess he
dialog: didn’t come home last night. Hasn’t
dialog: come home yet at all. Was he at
dialog: school today?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I didn’t see him. I mean, I wasn’t
text: looking.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Sure. Do you remember the last time
dialog: you did see him?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: »No. Nope.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: She said something about him going to
dialog: Josh’s yesterday.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: He didn’t?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: No. I was with Josh.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Well, I’11 tell her.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah, sorry. Wish I was more help, I
dialog: just...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You got in late last night.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I guess so.
dialog: 47
dialog: 48
dialog: 49
dialog: 50
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Don’t do that anymore. I’m sure Daryl
dialog: will turn up, but... If something
dialog: happened, if someone... I don’t know.
dialog: Anyway. Let’s try and stick around
dialog: the house for the next few days, huh?
scene_heading: INT. ZACH'S ROOM - NIGHT 47
text: The lights are off. He's staring at
speaker_heading: THE CEILING
text: Glow in the dark STAR STICKERS. A cheerful facsimile of the
text: ones he saw outside earlier. A relic of his childhood still
text: stuck to his ceiling, out of reach.
text: He tosses the covers aside and stands.
scene_heading: INT. HALL BATHROOM - NIGHT 48
text: Zach quietly enters and makes his way over to the cupboard.
text: He finds a bottle of NYQUIL, unscrews the lid and takes a
text: large swig from it. And then another.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 49
text: Zach creeps in and turns the TV on, keeping the volume low.
text: He sets the "SLEEP TIMER" to 30 minutes and lies down on the
text: couch, flipping channels, already growing drowsy. Almost
text: drifting off.
scene_heading: INT. ZACH’S ROOM - MORNING 50
text: BANG BANG BANG! A loud rapping on the door jolts Zach up
text: from sleep. He's bleary eyed. He darts his head around to
text: look at his alarm clock but it's nowhere to be found.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah! Ok! Alright!
text: Zach reaches over and peels back the blinds on the window.
text: ZACH's POV - a field shrouded in fog; no horizon to see.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: What time is it? Mom?

scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY - MORNING 51
text: Zach exits his bedroom and walks down the hall. The silence
text: is overwhelming.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Hey mom?
text: He makes his way into the living room. Nothing, no one. He

speaker_heading: DARYL
text: Standing in his bedroom doorway.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell man?
text: Daryl points his finger to the ceiling.
text: Something hits Zach's hand. He raises it to his eye. Blood?
text: One drop of blood - but from where? He looks up.
text: A LARGE DARK RED VOID rips through the ceiling, slowly and
text: silently churning like a whirlpool.
text: Zach stares up at it. Then looks back to his hand. He tries
text: frantically tries to wipe off the blood but it's no use, it
text: just spreads. His shirt is suddenly soaked in blood, as are
text: his hands, and arms.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: No, no, no jesus-
text: Suddenly, he cant breathe, he falls to his knees and reaches
text: for his throat. A large gaping hole in his neck, gushing out
text: blood. He panics and tries to wipe it away.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: DARYL!!!
text: He spins to find him but he's gone. He scrambles and runs
text: into the bathroom, slams the door and turns to the mirror.
text: He's covered in blood, head to toe, dripping.
text: Zach SCREAMS, but there is no sound. The mirror cracks,
text: sending his reflection into a scatter shot of anguish.

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Mom! Mom!!!
text: He clenches his stomach, tears running down his face.
text: Footsteps. Lights flip on. Karen rushes in in her nightgown.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What!? Honey what is it!?
text: She runs to him, cradles him in her arms.
speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: Shhh. I'm here sweetey, I'm here.
text: Zach struggles to get words out.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It hurts! In my stomach!
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Can you describe it? Tell me what it
dialog: feels like.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It hurts!
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Is it a dull pain or a sharp one?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sharp! It's sharp!
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Okay honey, I'm going to go get some

dialog: be right back, sweetheart.

text: and a bottle of pepto bismol.
speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: Drink this.

speaker_heading: ZACH

speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: I know, I know, but this will make it
dialog: better. Now breath...Count to
dialog: eight...That's it.
text: She pours some pepto bismol into the cap and brings it to

text: tilts it back.
speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: There you go. Better?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Are you hungry?
text: Zach shakes his head "no".
speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: You haven't eaten anything, Zach...
dialog: that's probably what's wrong.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I took some nyquil.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Or it could be that. Why did you take
dialog: nyquil, do you have a cold?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I just couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Okay, well no more of that. You hear
dialog: me? You can't just take that willy
text: nilly. Especially on an empty

text: He nods. She pulls down the QUILT draped over the back of

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - HEALTH ED 57

speaker_heading: AN EMPTY DESK

text: retractable bic pen.
text: She nods at Zach and he watches as she starts to retract the
text: pen, bringing the tip up, then down, over and over, faster

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 59

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Shoes off!

text: out of it. Down the hall, Joan knocks on his door.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Honey? Zach stopped by.
text: There doesn’t seem to be a response. She shuffles back
text: toward Zach and moves past him into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JOAN (cont'd)
dialog: Give him a minute.
text: She returns with two cans of ginger ale which she hands to
dialog: Zach.
text: He hesitates. Is he supposed to go in, now? This is weird.
text: She gestures him forward.
text: He stands outside Josh’s bedroom door. There’s NOISE coming

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Mom let me stay home.
speaker_heading: ZACH

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay, Zach.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: No, I mean... Just so-
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay.
text: Zach sighs and sits in a nearby office chair, dropping the
text: pretense. He just wants to see his friend.
text: Josh remains on the floor. He starts pulling bits of fuzz
text: from the carpet and rolling it into a ball with his fingers.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sorry. How are you?
text: Josh shrugs.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: No shit. I’m barely sleeping. My
dialog: heart will just speed up sometimes.

speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: I feel like we should go back.

dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Daryl's stuff...his backpack, that

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It's here.

dialog: hidden?
text: Josh doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: Josh, do you hear me?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah. It's here. Until I decide to

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Well, don't do that. Don't do
dialog: anything without talking to me first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Whatever.
text: Zach rolls his eyes and sits back down, trying to ease the

dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What game is that?
text: Josh says nothing.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Look man, it was a fucking accident.
dialog: We didn't mean for anything to
dialog: happen.
text: Josh silently watches him border on a meltdown. Zach
text: clenches the arms of the office chair. He suddenly punches
text: himself fiercely, twice, on the head.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: Fuck!
text: He gets it under control. Somewhat. Josh waits a beat.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So did you bring my homework?
text: This catches Zach off guard. They both laugh. Like this
dialog: little shit matters now.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: No, but... Allison Bannister’s

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Maybe... You know, I haven’t slept,

text: Zach stands to leave. He takes one last look around the room
text: and is suddenly struck with the claustrophobia of this
dialog: space, too much stuff.
text: Too many action figures, and stacks of comic books, and
text: video game cartridges spilling out of drawers. The TV seems
dialog: too big for its stand.
text: And in the middle of it all Josh is sitting on the floor
text: barefoot in pajama pants. He doesn’t look up as Zach turns
text: and exits the room.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBDIVISION - AFTERNOON 64
text: The sun is close to setting. Beautiful but eerie. Zach rides
text: his bike down the street.
speaker_heading: UP AHEAD
text: He sees ANOTHER RIDER on a bike.
text: ZACH Pedals harder to catch up to him. He gets within ten or
text: fifteen feet but can’t quite close the gap. But at this
dialog: distance we can see the same thing that Zach can see. This
text: looks like Daryl.
speaker_heading: THE RIDER
text: Suddenly takes off! Hauling ass, pedaling away.
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: Narrows his eyes and follows, determined to keep up. He
text: chases him down streets and around corners. The bikes zoom.
text: They leave the subdivision and take off onto the empty
text: country roads. Eventually, the Rider turns off into a field
text: and disappears beyond a small hill.

text: This is the field outside the woods where Daryl died.
text: Zach looks toward the treeline and sees
speaker_heading: DARYL’S BIKE
text: Lying on the ground. He leans in to inspect it. Then he
text: hears something... a RUSTLING SOUND. Off in the distance. He
text: follows the SOUND into
speaker_heading: THE WOODS 66
text: Of course. It’s coming from the leaf-strewn ditch.
text: Zach approaches and peers down. Cautious now. Afraid.
text: Something’s moving down there, writhing in the dead leaves.
text: He picks up a heavy rock and hurls it. CRACK! He’s hit
text: something. The writhing stops. Dead? Shit. Now what?
text: He slinks down the ditch’s earthen wall, wanting to see what
text: it is. What it was. He digs through the leaves, tossing them
dialog: aside.
text: Wait. There’s something. A leg: pale white skin.
text: But it isn’t Daryl’s leg. It’s a girl’s leg. Bare.
text: Zach stands. In a daze. Mesmerized. He grips the leg and
text: pulls it, dragging a body into view.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: Half naked. Underwear and undershirt. Dead and floppy.
dialog: Lifeless.
text: He awkwardly drags the corpse into his lap. His breathing is
text: ragged. He’s sweaty. Afraid. Afraid of being caught. Someone
text: seeing him like this. But he’s excited too.
text: He leans in and kisses her cold lips.
text: After and long, horrible moment, she finally kisses back.
text: Her arms are suddenly thrown around him. She’s groggy, half-
text: conscious. But alive.
text: He lifts her, kissing fiercely, hungrily. Her legs wrap
text: around him as well. He slams her back into the wall of the
dialog: ditch.
dialog: 72.
text: His hips grind. His fingers tangle themselves in her hair.
text: They pull. She moans. It’s fast and violent and...
text: Someone’s watching. Zach looks up.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Is there, staring down without expression. Bathed in shadow
text: aside from a white hot reflection in his glasses.
text: Zach doesn’t stop. It doesn’t faze him at all. His pants are
text: undone. He’s writhing against her. Dead leaves rustling.
text: Josh watches coldly. Clinically.
text: Thump, thump, thump. Allison’s head against the earthen
text: wall. Her clouded, empty eyes.

scene_heading: INT. RESTROOM
text: Zach stands in front of the sink, staring down at the

text: surrounding it. Jesus, not just a weird sex dream but a wet
dialog: dream, too.
text: He sighs and rolls his eyes, embarrassed. What the fuck is
text: he supposed to do now? He runs the water, wets his hands and
text: wipes them on his pants, trying to camouflage the wet spot.
dialog: Fuck it. Who cares?
dialog: 69
dialog: 73.
text: He leans back against the wall and slumps down, breathing
text: heavily, trying to collect himself.
text: Out in the hallway, the BELL RINGS. The hustle and bustle
text: sounds of class-change pick up. Another KID walks in and
text: goes to the urinal. Zach wipes his eyes and starts to leave.
text: Over his shoulder he can hear the other KID mocking him,
text: making fake crying sounds.
text: Zach pushes open the door to the hallway and doesn’t look
text: back. He reaches out and POUNDS on a locker door. The sound
text: of it echoes through the hall.
scene_heading: INT. HIGHSCHOOL CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON 69

text: sits behind the desk ten feet away.
text: He cranes his neck, trying to see through the window of the

text: After a moment the secretary sees him.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Can I help you?

speaker_heading: ZACH

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I thought we were just gonna watch

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We were but then my grandpa got sick!

text: Allison excitedly does so to find a small baggie, containing
text: some of the weed from Josh's brother’s room.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Whoa! Oh, I know how to do this, I
dialog: think. Let me see if Becca has
dialog: papers.
text: She hurries inside.
speaker_heading: JOHN WHITCOMB
dialog: Where’d you get this shit, Josh?
dialog: 78.
text: Zach eyes Josh warily.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Guess I know a guy.
speaker_heading: JOHN WHITCOMB
dialog: Can you hook me up?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Maybe. Hit me up tomorrow.
text: Zach watches this exchange with suspicion.
text: Allison follows Rebecca back onto the porch. She’s
text: delicately holding a small piece of paper.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Okay, its a page from a bible but its
dialog: not an important one, its the
dialog: introduction or something.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: The point is it’ll work. I’ve seen my
dialog: brother do this a million times.
text: Allison sits and dumps some of the weed onto the paper and
text: makes a messy joint.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I think we have enough for two, but
dialog: Allison gets to go twice to start
dialog: because its her birthday.
text: It takes a second for Allison to get the joint lit. She
text: awkwardly takes a hit, then another. Coughs. Passes to
dialog: Rebecca.
text: Zach watches Josh, uncomfortable with all of this. He turns
text: to him.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m gonna head out.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: See ya.
text: Clearly Josh plans on sticking around awhile. Zach stands.
text: Allison glances his way. He closes the door on cheers and
dialog: laughter.
dialog: 74
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT 74
text: Zach is walking fast, emotionally strung out.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (0.S.)
dialog: Hey! You taking off?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah, I don’t know, not much of a
dialog: party guy. Just wanted to say happy
dialog: birthday.
text: Allison seems genuinely bummed.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It’s fine. I just got a lot going on
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: That’s why you smoke. To relax.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: But I’m not into that. And neither is
dialog: Josh, he just brought all that to
dialog: impress you, it’s fucking lame.
text: She doesn’t respond. She lets his words hang there. He turns
text: to her, not meeting her eyes.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m sorry, Allison. I-
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Somebody's lying.
text: Zach is startled.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What?
text: Allison tilts her head to the house and smiles, swaying with
text: Chris Isaac - "Somebody's Crying" in the background.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: The song...Chris Isaac. Best track
text: on the album.
text: She moves in for a kiss as he swings his head around and up.
text: Their heads connect with a BANG.
dialog: 75
dialog: 76
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sorry! I’m sorry.
text: She starts giggling. He reaches out to touch her head and
text: suddenly instinctively kisses it where they collided.
text: She stops giggling. He kisses her head again. Then her lips.
text: He stops. They look at one another a moment.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m sorry. Happy Birthday Allison.
text: She watches him walk off into the night. Alone, he picks up
text: speed. Jogging. Running through the dark.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK - DAY 75
text: Zach is in gym clothes running laps around the outdoor
text: track. Other students are running as well in groups of
text: threes and fours but Zach is keeping his own company, lost
text: in thought until he sees something.
speaker_heading: ZACH’S POV
text: We see the flashing red and blue lights of police cars in
text: the distance up on the road traveling toward the school.
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: Watches this with no small interest. The cars turn into the
text: school parking lot and OFFICERS walk toward the building
text: Zach continues running, going faster now, sprinting. His
text: thoughts running wild in his head.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - HIGH SCHOOL 76
text: Zach sits on the bench in front of his locker, the energy
text: around him is terrifying and unnerving. The other boys
text: excitedly talking. Zach's in a daze, barely listening. Only
text: certain words reach him and resgister. Words like
text: Dead, killed, body, cops.
speaker_heading: ee OF
dialog: 77
dialog: 78
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM 77
text: Zach slumps down at his desk, dejected. PHILIP, a kid
text: wearing a baseball cap, sits down at the desk behind him.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Dude, you hear that shit?
text: Zach turns around.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: That guy. He’s dead, they found him
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: who?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: John Whitcomb. The dude with the blue
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Wait what? He’s dead, he died?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Yeah, they found him this morning.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I know, right? I had Algebra with
dialog: him. Small fucking world.
text: Everything slows down and the sound drowns out. Zach's eyes
text: widen and his mind races. He slowly reaches his hand out
text: over his desk for something, anything.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 78
text: Zach is unchaining his bike, preparing to head home. He
text: glances over at
scene_heading: THE PARKING LOT
text: To see Eugene sitting in the back of a truck, surrounded by
text: a handful of other students. Including CHAD, the threatening
text: figure from under the bleachers.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: 79 EXT. PARKING LOT 79
text: Zach hesitantly approaches.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Eugene. Can I talk to you?
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: You can get your ass beat, faghole.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I wasn't talking to you.
text: Ooohs from the surrounding students. But Eugene deflates the
text: situation, patting Chad on the back and leaping down from
text: the bed of the truck.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: It's aight, I gotta dip, anyway.
text: He holds up a CD case.
speaker_heading: EUGENE (cont'd)
dialog: I'll get this back to you, tomorrow.
text: Eugene heads to his own car. Zach follows, dodging a plastic
text: SODA BOTTLE thrown by Chad.
speaker_heading: EUGENE (cont'd)
dialog: What's up, little man? You got my
dialog: five dollars?
text: Eugene reaches his car, tosses his backpack into the rear.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh didn't pay you? Danny's little
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Why do you think I'm asking you?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Have you seen him at all? He didn't
dialog: try to sell you weed or anything?
text: Eugene narrows his eyes, suddenly on the alert.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: What's that got to do with you?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: He's my friend.
dialog: 80
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Uh-huh. Well... It maybe came up.
dialog: That little dude Chad hanged out
text: with, with the blue hair, RIP, he had
dialog: told me was gonna get some from your
dialog: friend. Guess that's off, now, huh?
text: Zach processes this, deeply troubled by the implications.
speaker_heading: EUGENE (cont'd)
dialog: Tell you what, when you see him,
dialog: remind him that he was supposed to
dialog: come straight to me with that kind-
dialog: bud. And next time you see me, you
dialog: better have my five dollars. Or I'll
dialog: let Chad beat it out of you.
text: He grins, but not maliciously, revving his engine and
text: pulling out, leaving Zach standing on the blacktop alone.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - AFTERNOON 80
text: Zach and Allison are sitting side by side on the curb
text: outside, drinking sodas, somber.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I walked in on him once. In the
dialog: bathroom, the bus bathroom. On that
dialog: field trip to the flight museum, you
dialog: remember that?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I didn’t go.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Oh. Well, he didn’t lock the door for
dialog: some reason. I saw everything. Full
dialog: Whitcomb.
text: She makes a “meh” face. They sit for a beat in silence.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You’re friends with Tig right?
text: She opens a pack of cigarettes and lights one.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: who?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Carol. Sharp. She was at your party.
speaker_heading: HO ee OH OF * eee OF
dialog: *
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Oh yeah. Sorta.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You have her number?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Somewhere at home. I’1l1 have to look.
dialog: Here. Got a pen?
text: He digs one out of his pocket. She takes his hand and writes
text: a number on his palm.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: My new number. My own line. Mom and
dialog: dad’s birthday present. You won’t
dialog: have to deal with my brother anymore.
dialog: Call tonight and I’1l dig hers out
dialog: for you... If you tell me why you
dialog: want it.
text: She smiles, Zach dodges the question.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Did you just buy that?
text: She looks at the cigarette in her hand.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Is that okay? I don’t want to scare
dialog: you off again.
text: Zach seems uncomfortable. She playfully nudges him.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I’m messing with you, dummy. Everyone
dialog: knows this guy will sell to anybody.
dialog: Just gotta be patient sometimes.
text: He glances around nervously, gestures toward the road.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It’s fine. But we should probably...
dialog: You shouldn’t smoke it right here.
dialog: You'll get him in trouble.
text: She exhales and squints at Zach, casual. She doesn’t care.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Asshole sells cigarettes to kids.
dialog: *
dialog: 85.
text: She winks as Duke steps outside with new numbers to display
text: on the gas price sign by the road. He waves to them and
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You found a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Uh... No, we-
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: She’s a cute one, my friend.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I’m serious.
dialog: He is.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Okay...
text: Allison speaks through her teeth quietly so as not to be
dialog: overheard.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Told ya.
text: She stands.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Come on. Be a good “boyfriend” and
dialog: walk me home.
scene_heading: 81 EXT. SUBDIVISION - AFTERNOON 81
text: Zach walks his bike beside Allison.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You don’t think it’s weird?
text: She shrugs, not really buying what he’s suggesting.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: He fell. People climb those towers in
dialog: the pipeline all the time. You said
dialog: you and Josh just did it. Makes sense
dialog: that some people would fall.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What if he didn’t fall?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Zach takes a deep breath. Has she picked up on what he’s
dialog: been hinting at? Maybe he shouldn’t have said anything.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You think he jumped!
text: Zach wrestles with himself. Should he tell her what’s really
dialog: on his mind?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe. You’re right, I
dialog: guess it’s not that weird. Right?
text: She narrows her eyes.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Why do you care so much?
text: Zach doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: God, that made me sound like a dick
dialog: didn’t it? “why do you care?” A kid
dialog: in our class is dead. ...And that
text: Daryl guy's still missing.
text: They’ve reached her house. He walks her up the steps.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sorry. I just, lately, it feels like
dialog: I don’t have anyone to talk to.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: ...It’s my fault, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You and Josh. I could tell you two
dialog: were... He’s got a thing for me.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Zach, I like you. A lot sometimes.
dialog: But when are you going to stop being
dialog: surprised at the fact that I’m not
dialog: completely stupid?
dialog: 82
dialog: 83
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Probably now.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Now’s good.
text: She kisses his forehead with a smirk and goes to the door.
text: Stops. Might as well be forward.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Do you want to come inside?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah.
text: A beat. He doesn’t move from the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: But you’re not going to.
text: He tries to think of something to say. All he can do is
text: shake his head. Allison nods in response. She gives up on
text: him, goes inside and closes the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 82
text: Zach unlocks the door and walks inside, he can feel the
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Mom? !
text: He takes his shoes off and walks into the
speaker_heading: KITCHEN 83
text: And pours a huge glass of orange juice.
text: The answering machine is flashing. He presses the button to
dialog: hear his mother speaking:
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, honey! I’m gonna be home a
dialog: little late, so eat whatever you feel
dialog: like for dinner. Just don’t go
dialog: anywhere. I’11l be home as soon as I
dialog: can. I love you.
text: She makes a kissing sound. He kisses back. He stands alone
text: in the kitchen for a moment, debating. Then heads back out
text: the door.
dialog: 84
dialog: 85
dialog: 86
dialog: 87
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBDIVISION - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Zach pedals furiously out of the neighborhood and down
speaker_heading: COUNTRY ROADS
text: He’s hurrying somewhere, biking as quickly as he can. On
dialog: toward that familiar
speaker_heading: FIELD
text: He parks his bike and walks through the tall grass into
speaker_heading: THE FOREST
text: A grim retracing of his steps. He walks carefully, almost
text: respectfully. This is, after all, a graveyard of sorts.
text: For a few moments he seems lost, looking around in every
text: direction, trying to determine where they had been. They
text: were running after him, but which way... Then he spots the
dialog: drop off up ahead
speaker_heading: THE DITCH
text: Where Daryl took his last spill.
text: Zach approaches slowly and as he reaches the edge of the
text: drop, he can see the scene from above. But it’s wrong.
text: Something is out of place here. Zach can see
text: THE PILE OF LEAVES
text: That he and Josh had covered Daryl’s body with, but it’s
text: thinner and more scattered now.
dialog: Someone’s been here.
scene_heading: DARYL’S BODY
text: Is slightly uncovered. An arm exposed. A hand.
text: Zach works up the nerve to climb down and get a closer look.
text: He steps with caution, not wanting to leave any sign of his
dialog: presence and needing to keep a certain distance from the
text: body. He squints at the exposed
dialog: 84
dialog: 85
dialog: 86
dialog: 87
dialog: 88
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: HAND
text: The fingers are missing. Sliced clean off. He leans in. What
text: the fuck? He kicks a few of the leaves off, trying to see
dialog: more. There are
speaker_heading: STAB WOUNDS
text: In Daryl’s back. Half a dozen. He kicks off more leaves and
text: finally gets a good look at
scene_heading: DARYL’S HEAD
text: Zach can’t look at it for long, maybe only a glimpse, but...
text: The skull’s been crushed.
text: He stumbles, weak in the knees for a moment before realizing
text: that whatever happens, he can’t stay. He gathers himself and
text: turns to go. He stops on his way to check
scene_heading: THE HOLLOW TREE
text: But both the sword and Zach's sweatshirt are gone.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Shit.
text: He paces, worked up, frustrated, tense beyond belief.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - EVENING 88
text: Zach grabs the phone and glances at his hand to dial
text: Allison’s private number. She answers quickly, a smile in
text: her voice.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Hey... do you have that number?
text: She is suddenly cold and businesslike.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah, hang on.
text: Zach listens as she puts the phone down, angry at himself,
text: scared out of his mind.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: 89 INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - EVENING 89
text: Charlie’s working on an enormous desktop computer. The phone
text: rings behind him. He answers.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sharp residence.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Charlie? It’s Zach.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...How’d you get my number?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Don't worry about it. Listen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Shit... Okay I’1l just say it... it’s
dialog: Josh.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What’s Josh?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: The killer. I think he Killed John
dialog: Whitcomb.
scene_heading: 90 INT. KAREN’S CAR - EVENING 90
text: Karen is driving down the road, listening to the radio. Her
text: headlights fall on a kid on a bike in front of her. A blue
text: hoodie. She pulls up beside him and rolls her window down.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Josh?
text: He stops and turns.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Mrs. Taylor.
scene_heading: 91 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 91
text: Zach clutches the phone, pacing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Killer? Zach what the
dialog: hell...
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I’m still figuring it all out but I
dialog: had to talk to somebody who knew and
dialog: you’re the only who does, so... I’ve
dialog: tried talking to Josh but there’s
dialog: something wrong with him. He was so
text: pissed at Daryl for ganking his
dialog: brother’s pot but the other night he
dialog: just gave it away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah, to this girl we know as a gift
dialog: and he said he'd sell some to John
dialog: Whitcomb.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: He hated John Whitcomb. Him and those
dialog: guys he hung out with.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What guys? Zach-
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Forget it, doesn’t matter. I’m saying
dialog: like a week ago Josh was talking
dialog: about how much he hated John Whitcomb
text: and now John whitcomb turns up dead
dialog: in the pipeline where we hung out
dialog: with Daryl that day? He was gonna
dialog: sell him the pot! Like that story
dialog: Daryl told us. He said he would sell
dialog: to him, lured him out there and got
dialog: him alone so he could kill him!
scene_heading: 92 EXT. KAREN'S CAR - ROADSIDE 92
text: Josh is standing on the side of the road. She’s pulled over
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You shouldn’t be out here like this
dialog: at night. Not with everything that's
dialog: been going on. Where are you headed?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I was actually on my way to see Zach.
dialog: 93
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: We haven’t seen you around lately.
dialog: Everything alright?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We had a fight the other day-
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Well, that’s between you two. I’11
dialog: keep my nose out but you shouldn’t be
dialog: out here alone. Get in. You can put
text: the bike in the back.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - EVENING 93
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Alright, he’s acting weird. So are
dialog: you! So am I, probably.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I know, but I couldn’t stop thinking
dialog: about it. I went back out to the
dialog: woods where Daryl was but it was
dialog: different, someone else had been
text: there before me, he was moved around
dialog: and-
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You went out there? What did-
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Look, the sword was gone. The tree
text: was uncovered and the sword was gone,
dialog: along with my sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But - -
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Three people knew about the sword.
dialog: You, me and Josh. And I don’t think
dialog: you went back out there alone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ee eK
dialog: * ee OF
dialog: *
speaker_heading: ee OF
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I think Josh did and I think he took
text: the sword and messed with Daryl then
dialog: he pushed John Whitcomb off of that
dialog: tower and I don’t know what he’s
dialog: doing now. I called but there’s no
dialog: answer.
text: Charlie sits with the phone against his ear, emotionless.
text: His blank expression becomes one of disgust
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's so fucked up.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I know, I still can't bel--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why would you add all this nonsense
dialog: onto the situation? Isn't it bad
dialog: enough as it is? Daryl's dead, isn't
dialog: that enough drama for you?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: We don’t know he was dead.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He looked pretty dead. Did you check
dialog: for a pulse?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I'm not fucking Doogie Howser! Yeah,
dialog: I thought he was dead. But either way
dialog: someone went back there. And if they
dialog: found him alive then they finished
dialog: him off. And if he was dead then they
dialog: were just fucking around with the
dialog: body. And that’s even worse!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: It wasn’t me. And it wasn’t you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So it was Josh? He’s your friend,
dialog: isn’t he?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HO ee OH OF
dialog: 94
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So why go out of your way to put this
dialog: on him? I think we're all to blame
dialog: for what happened to Daryl, all three
dialog: of us. Don't just blame him to avoid
text: feeling guilty about it.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Then where’s the sword?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Leave it alone, Zach!
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Did you take it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No! Did you? How do I know you didn’t
dialog: take it? How do I know it’s even
dialog: gone? Want to take me out and show
dialog: me? Lure me back out there? You, me,
dialog: no witnesses? No thank you.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Listen to me!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Listen to yourself. You’re losing it.
dialog: Don’t call again.
text: Charlie hangs up. Zach sits in the empty living room.
speaker_heading: LATER 94
text: Zach idly eats leftovers, while half paying attention to
text: whatever horrific movie is on TV. There are periodic
text: SCREAMS, but they don't faze him.
text: Eventually, Karen bursts in, her arms full of stuff (purse,
text: mail, briefcase, fast food bags).
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Look who I found!
text: Zach turns to see Josh standing right behind her.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 95.
text: Karen can sense the tension. Tries to break it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I got chicken.
text: Zach looks at his empty bowl.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You told me to eat whatever.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Did I say that? Bah. It’1l reheat.
dialog: Josh, you want some?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nah, I shouldn’t stay long.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: We’1ll be outside a minute.
text: Karen watches them step out through the garage.
scene_heading: 95 EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE 95
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I don't know. I wanted to say hi. And
dialog: I guess apologize for ditching you at
dialog: the party.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You didn’t, I ditched you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I guess so. It would've been cool to
dialog: hang out. It was a fun party.
text: Josh seems sincere, almost vulnerable. But Zach is too
text: focused to see it.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Look, someone went out there. They
dialog: took the sword and-
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Can't we just talk-
dialog: 96
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: That doesn't surprise you? That
dialog: someone took the sword? Did you go
dialog: back out to see him?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why the fuck did you go back out
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Just to look.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Is this all we can do now?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: You want to hang out? John Whitcomb
dialog: is dead too, now. What the fuck is
dialog: that all about?
text: Josh turns and walks away. Leaving Zach to stand and wonder
dialog: how this could've gone better.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 96
text: The horror movie still playing on the television. Karen

speaker_heading: KAREN (cont'd)
dialog: Come here.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Come here. Fucking hug me! Jesus.
text: He obeys, scooting over to her awkwardly. She embraces him.

text: On screen someone is SCREAMING and SCREAMING. Karen doesn’t

scene_heading: INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 97
text: Zach sits at his desk as the teacher talks about Wuthering
text: Heights or some other classic. His attention is elsewhere.
text: He’s hypnotized by
text: THE CARDBOARDED WINDOW
text: This must be the room that the deer ran into. The duct tape
text: holding the cardboard in place has come loose. The wind is
text: picking up outside. It whistles. The cardboard flaps.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: Looks over at him. He doesn’t even notice. She leans over

scene_heading: INT. ZACH’S ROOM - AFTERNOON 99
text: Zach sits on his bed sipping beer. The familiar YEARBOOK is
text: in his lap, but now instead of looking at girls, Zach looks
text: at a photo of
speaker_heading: HIMSELF
text: It wasn’t long ago, but he seems so much younger.
text: After a moment he flips a few pages and scans the names
text: intently until he finds
speaker_heading: JOHN WHITCOMB
dialog: And finally
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: He closes the book, lays his head back.
text: Suddenly, he's startled by a KNOCK at the door.
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.)

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: who is it?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Ralphie.

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KAREN (0.S.)
text: It’s locked.

speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Why is it locked?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Sorry. I didn't know you were home.

speaker_heading: THE TV
text: The news is on. Karen walks in with a cup of yogurt.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: The gas station.
text: The convenience store they go to after school. The news
text: camera zooms in on a shot of
speaker_heading: DUKE
text: Being taken out in handcuffs by county police officers. The

speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I guess so.

scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON 101
text: Zach grimly pedals his bike down the street toward Josh's
dialog: house.
scene_heading: EXT. JOSH'S FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 102
text: Zach knocks, but there’s no answer.
text: He checks to make sure he’s not being watched before
text: reaching down to retrieve a spare key from under the welcome
text: mat, and slips inside.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH’S HOUSE 103
text: The place is silent. Eerie. Zach breathes heavily as he
text: creeps down the hall. His voice cracks when he calls out.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh?
text: He lingers outside Josh’s bedroom. He kneels down and tries
text: to peer under the door: nothing to see.
dialog: 104
dialog: 105
dialog: 106
dialog: 107
dialog: 101.
text: He knocks. Then knocks louder... At last he turns the knob.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH'S ROOM 104
text: Immediately Zach sees a lump on the bed. It startles him,
text: but it’s just bedding. Dirty clothes. He’s alone in the
text: room. He starts to tear the place apart, searching. There’s
text: got to be some clue... At last he finds
scene_heading: A CORDLESS PHONE RECEIVER
text: Lying at the foot of the bed. He picks it up and examines
dialog: it. Who’s Josh been calling?
text: A NOISE! A creak! Someone in the hallway?
text: He slips around the corner...
scene_heading: AN UGLY OLD DOG
text: Shambles up to him, panting and coughing.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Jesus, Maggie.
text: He gives her a pet and shoos her away.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH’S HOUSE - HALLWAY 105
text: He starts toward the kitchen with the phone receiver still
text: in his hand but stops.
scene_heading: INT. DANNY’S ROOM 106
text: Zach slips inside and makes his way to the closet. He opens
dialog: the door...
text: No samurai sword. An empty spot where it used to hang.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN 107
text: Zach finds the base for the cordless phone. There’s a caller
text: ID digital readout that shows recent numbers.
text: He pushes the button to cycle through them. There’s one that
dialog: shows up a couple times. Once just 15 minutes ago. And once
dialog: before that. The day before...
dialog: 108
dialog: 109
dialog: 110
dialog: 102.
text: He runs his hand through his hair... then looks at his open
dialog: palm.
scene_heading: THE PHONE NUMBER
text: That Allison wrote on his hand. It's smudged and barely
text: visible. It’s the same number. Josh has been calling
dialog: Allison? Where is he now?
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 108
text: A doorbell rings. Josh stands outside on the step. He has a
text: duffle bag over his shoulder. After a beat the door opens
text: and we see Allison and Rebecca.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Hey, Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hi, Allison.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You should come in.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'd love to.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN 109
text: Zach stands thinking. The pieces are coming together... he's
text: interrupted by the SLAM of a car door from outside. He looks
dialog: and sees
speaker_heading: JOSH'S FAMILY
text: Joan, Josh's Dad and younger brother, all walking up to the
text: house. No Josh. That's all Zach needed to see. He runs and
text: bursts out the front door, just as Joan is opening it.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Zach? Where did you--
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 110
text: Josh leans against the wall, silently drinking an entire
text: glass of milk. Allison and Rebecca sit opposite him, waiting
dialog: patiently.
text: Techno MUSIC plays from a room somewhere deeper in the
dialog: house.

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So, so.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So you went to that “guy” you know?
dialog: How much and how much?
text: Josh removes the baggie of weed from his hoodie pocket and
text: hands it to her.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: This much and on the house.
text: Rebecca grabs him and kisses him on the lips playfully.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: This guy’s awesome.
text: They both turn to
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: Standing by a little nervously.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Zach’s not coming, is he?
text: She doesn’t do a very good job hiding her disappointment.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, he said he couldn’t make it.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBDIVISION - AFTERNOON 111
text: Zach is racing, panting, making his way to Allison’s house.
text: He drops his bike and bounds up the stairs to her front
text: door. He frantically knocks and rings the bell.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 112
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: More for us! Come on.
text: She leads the way down the hall, toward the music. Josh and

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Ladies first.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: 113 EXT. ALLISON’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 113
text: At long last, the door opens, revealing Allison’s brother
text: DENNIS, 24, shaved head, blue work shirt, smoking a
text: cigarette with a cordless phone pressed to his ear.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Shit yeah, uh huh, hold on...
dialog: (to Zach)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Uh, is... I’m Zach.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Is Allison home?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Who wants to know?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Zach.
text: Dennis smirks a condescending smirk.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I’m messing with you.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I know. Don’t. Don’t do that. Is she
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: She’s not.
text: Dennis shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I think she's with that bitch from
dialog: down the street...
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: What bitch?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Rebecca whatever.
dialog: 114
dialog: 115
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Her house I guess.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Was there a guy with them?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Man, fuck off.
text: He waves goodbye and shuts the door. Zach stands silently
text: panicking for a moment, every second might count here and he
dialog: doesn’t know what to do.
text: He rings the bell again. And again. And again. Dennis opens
text: the door.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: If Allison doesn’t call you in twenty
dialog: minutes, call the police. Tell them
dialog: to get to that bitch Rebecca’s house
text: down the street.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Listen-
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Twenty minutes, I’m not fucking
dialog: kidding.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBDIVISION - CONTINUOUS 114
text: Zach runs. Trying to remember which house was Rebecca’s. He
text: takes a wrong turn and ends up in a cul-de-sac. He panics
dialog: and doubles back.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Shit shit shit! Where was it?
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA’S ROOM 115
text: Allison and Rebecca are goofing off and dancing to the music
text: on the CD player. Trading swigs from a bottle of white wine
text: and hits off a joint.

dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JOSH *
text: Just sits, watching, smiling. Allison offers him the joint,

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m good. *
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You sure? I thought we were hanging
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We are!
text: She grabs the joint from Allison and puffs... exhaling the
text: smoke in Josh’s face and laughing before looking down to see
text: his open duffle bag and... *
speaker_heading: THE SWORD *
text: She takes it out and holds it up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Whoa, what the fuck is this?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: That is a fucking sword.
dialog: (to Josh)
dialog: Can we see it?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You're doing it.
text: The two girls play with it some more, miming like they're
text: fighting. Precariously swinging the sword all around, making
dialog: sound effects.
text: JOSH continues watching calmly. Eventually he gets up and *
text: approaches them.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay, my turn. *
scene_heading: EXT. SUBDIVISION - AFTERNOON 116
text: Zach hurries up the street. He spots the house. And sure *
text: enough Josh's bike is parked outside. *
text: He walks to the front door. He tries the knob and it’s *
text: unlocked. He turns it and steps inside.
dialog: 117
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 117
text: None of the downstairs lights are on. The sun is setting
text: outside, the house growing dim and eerie.
text: Zach darts his eyes around the room, looking for anything to
text: indicate what he might be stepping into here.
text: He sees nothing. But he hears...
text: THE MUSIC playing from somewhere down the hall. And above
text: that... A WHIMPER... He freezes, stock still. His eyes go
text: wide. What did he just hear? Muffled VOICES.
text: He moves to the fireplace and digs through the fireplace
text: tools. No poker? He settles for the shovel and starts down
scene_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: With a few doors on either side, bathrooms or closets but at
text: the end of the hall, straight ahead...
speaker_heading: A DOOR
text: Open just a crack. Pink light spills out from inside, across
text: the carpet. The MUSIC is more present now.
text: THE WHIMPER is louder and more resonant. It’s not yelps or
text: coos, it’s one long sustained, but muffled MOAN that has
text: peaks of high squealing which are louder in volume.
text: Zach moves slowly.
text: THE MOANING is louder and louder. It’s a painful, awful
text: sound. The MUSIC underscores it all.
text: Zach walks all the way up to the door and peers in
text: THROUGH THE CRACK
text: Just a sliver of the scene is enough. He can see ALLISON at
text: least. Her head hanging down so that her long hair obscures
text: her face. She’s the one moaning. Whatever’s happening can’t
dialog: be good...
text: He pushes the door open slightly. Now he can see that she
text: has her shirt off. Barefoot in a white bra and shorts. Her
text: hands are bound and she is gagged, sitting on the floor.
text: He can see that she is trembling and that there is blood on
text: and around her feet.
text: Rebecca is lying on the bed. She’s not moving.
dialog: 118
dialog: 108.
text: Josh comes into view. His back is to the door. Zach can’t
text: see his face but it’s clearly him.
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: Is panicked. Devestated. He stands there a moment, trying to
dialog: decide what to do.
text: Allison Notices him. Her eyes widen.
text: Josh turns. The boys make eye contact. Zach is tearing up.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh.
text: Josh SLAMS the door shut. Allison SCREAMS through the gag.
text: Zach throws his shoulder against the door. No good. He kicks
text: and stomps.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: Josh!! You fucking fuck!!!
text: There’s a clatter and a CRASH from the other side of the
text: door. Then more screams. Suddenly not just frightened but
text: terrified. Pleading.
text: Then a THUD. And SCREAMS of pain.
text: The door won’t give at all. Something’s blocking it. Zach
text: gives up on it and charges back outside.
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA’S HOUSE - EVENING 118
text: Zach runs around the side of the house, shouting at the top
text: of his lungs.
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: HELP! HELP ME! SOMEBODY! HE’S KILLING
dialog: THEM! HELP ME! HELP ME!
text: He finds the window that must lead into Rebecca's room. He
text: bashes at it with his shovel. Worthless.
text: There’s a DECK CHAIR. He grabs that and starts pounding.
text: Muffled SCREAMS emanate from inside.
text: Zach hoists that chair, swings for all he’s worth.
text: The window breaks. He forces the screen out of his way and
text: climbs in, taking his little fireplace shovel with him.
dialog: 119
dialog: 120
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 119
text: The place is a wreck. Pink walls. Red floors.
text: Clothes strewn about. And a sizable BOOKSHELF on the floor
text: in front of the door. That must be what had been keeping him
text: out... but it’s pulled aside now. And the door is open.
text: Josh is gone.
text: ALLISON is writhing weakly in the corner. Zach races to her
text: side. Her head hangs forward.
text: THE BACK HER NECK
text: Is horrific. There are bruises and lacerations. Deep ones.
text: Josh tried to use the sword on her neck, to cut off her
text: head. Not quite bamboo grade. Sharp enough to cut through
dialog: milk cartons. This is what it does to a human neck. To
text: Allison’s neck. These horrible, ragged hacks.
text: She’s barely moving. Losing consciousness. Zach cries out.
text: He screams for help again.
text: The house CREAKS.
text: He realizes for the first time that Josh might still be
text: here. Allison has gone limp in his arms. He sets her down
text: and stands, watching the doorway.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Josh?
text: He stoops to collect his shovel and steps toward the
text: doorway. He takes a deep breath, pulls the door open and
text: steps out into
scene_heading: THE HALLWAY 120
text: He swings his shovel, but connects with nothing.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Jo-
text: But then Josh rounds the corner, sword in hand.
text: Zach goes low and tackles him. The two boys grapple with
dialog: each other. It’s not unlike the earlier confrontation
text: between Zach and Daryl.
text: Eventually, Zach manages to get free. He scurries back and
dialog: stands.
dialog: 110.
text: They face one another.
speaker_heading: ZACH (cont'd)
dialog: What the fuck? Josh, what the fuck?!
text: Josh just stares at him, shaking. Zach is terrified.
text: Adrenaline surging through him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Is she dead?
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Fuck you. Her brother called the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I don’t care.
text: There's an emptiness in Josh's voice. He continues to stand
text: there. Shaking. Zach’s shaking now, too.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Please please please don’t. Okay?
dialog: Josh?
text: Josh starts breathing heavier. Huffing. Puffing. Working
dialog: himself up.
text: There’s nothing behind Zach but a bathroom. He has to get by
dialog: Josh if he wants to get out.
text: He makes a break for it, dashing forward and to the side,
text: trying to dodge around Josh and his sword.
text: He makes it but Josh is right behind him. He swings the
text: sword, hitting Zach in the shoulder.
text: Not sharp enough to slice deeply into him, but sharp enough
text: to cut. And fucking hurt. Zach SCREAMS.
text: Josh brings the sword down hard, to Zach's head. CRACK!
text: Right on the top of Zach’s skull, splitting the skin. CRACK!
dialog: 
text: Blood streams down Zach’s face. He collapses.
text: Josh is on top of him, stabbing frantically with the sword.
text: Zach squirms around and manages to kick Josh back.
text: He gets to his feet and stumbles out the front door, into
dialog: the yard.
dialog: 111.
scene_heading: 121 EXT. REBECCA’S HOUSE - EVENING 124
text: Zach races out as fast as he can go. Josh comes bounding
text: after him. Josh bellows and takes another swing.
speaker_heading: A LITTLE GIRL
text: Stands in the doorway of one of the nearby houses. She
text: watches silently.
text: Josh catches up with Zach. He swings again.
text: Zach’s ankle twists beneath him and he falls into the
dialog: street.
text: Josh straddles him again. This time when he stabs he makes
text: contact. He pierces Zach’s thigh.
text: Zach grabs the blade and shifts to the side, pulling it out,
text: forcing it away from him.
speaker_heading: A CAR
text: Drives past. Slows. Then speeds the fuck up and peels out.
text: Dogs start barking in the distance. And beyond that...
speaker_heading: SIRENS.
text: Zach swings blindly up at Josh, trying to fend him off. Josh
text: doesn’t give a shit. With his free hand, he swings back.
text: But suddenly A MAN rushes up behind Josh and catches him
text: under the arms, pulling him away from Zach.
text: The Man holds tight against Josh's struggles.
text: In a rage Zach stands and rushes at Josh. Takes a good,
dialog: cheap swing.
text: The Man tries to pull Josh away. He’s shouting at Zach,
text: trying to calm him down.
speaker_heading: PEOPLE
text: Are out now. All standing in their yards. Staring. Nervous.
dialog: The Man’s actions have made others braver, though. More come
text: to help restrain the kids.
text: Josh manages to wriggle free and collapse on the blacktop.
text: Before anyone can seize him, Zach rushes over. He KICKS Josh
text: in the face.
text: The people stand watching.
dialog: 122
dialog: 123
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
text: Comes running over from his house, surprised at the sudden
dialog: activity.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Is through fighting back. He just lies there.
speaker_heading: ZACH
text: Kicks again. And STOMPS and SCREAMS.
text: The Man is able to subdue Zach just as the red and blue
text: lights of the police cars arrive. The sirens drown out
dialog: everything.
text: Others are helping Josh to his feet, holding him up.
text: The Man holds Zach back. It’s not necessary, however. The
text: fury is gone. He’s spent. He’s done.
text: He and Josh make eye contact with one another.
speaker_heading: ZACH’S FACE
text: Still shows emotion.
speaker_heading: JOSH’S FACE
dialog: Holds none.
text: The two boys are stuck there. They stare at each other until
text: police come and handcuff each of them and put them in
dialog: separate cars.
speaker_heading: IN ONE CAR 122
text: Josh sits staring off.
scene_heading: THE SEAT-BACK
text: In front of him is black vinyl, cracked in a few places with

dialog: There is nothing more interesting.
scene_heading: IN THE OTHER CAR 123
text: Zach leans back and looks

dialog: 126
dialog: 127
dialog: 128
dialog: 113.
text: OUT THE WINDOW
text: He sees all of the activity of police taping off the area
text: and holding the onlookers back. Rebecca's parents pull up in
text: their car, totally confounded.
text: He sees paramedics wheel out two gurneys. Dennis runs up and
text: alongside the one that clearly carries Allison. She reaches
text: up to take his hand. He gets into the back of the ambulance
text: with her before it speeds away.
text: Zach smiles slightly. She’s alive. He looks down at his
text: handcuffed HANDS, moving them a bit despite the restraint.
text: Finally he settles with them in his lap.

scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAWN
text: Breaking across the soccer field, it b-lines towards
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAWN
