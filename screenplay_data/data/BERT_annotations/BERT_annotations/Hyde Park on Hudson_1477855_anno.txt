scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE BATHROOM. DAY. 1938.
text: A young woman in a white nightgown, Daisy, stands in front of
text: the mirror over the sink, tooth brush stuck in her mouth; she
text: has stopped brushing and looks at her reflection.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Back then, this is years ago, I
dialog: couldn't afford secrets. I just had
dialog: chores.
text: With toothbrush in mouth she moves her hair around, trying it
dialog: one way, then another.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE AUNT’S BEDROOM. DAY
text: Daisy, dressed, on her knees, helps her elderly Aunt pull her
text: stockings up over her thick legs.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: As a child, growing up, we had been
dialog: rich. And then -- well, we weren’t.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH. DAY.
text: Daisy comes out onto the porch followed by two Scottie dogs;
text: the screen door slams shut behind her. The dogs start barking
text: at the noise; she ignores them.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And like most people during the
dialog: Depression, I now lived each day as
dialog: it came, no longer expecting
dialog: anything.
text: She carries an empty milk bottle; with her foot -- she’s done
text: this so many times before - she flips open the top lid of a
text: white wooden box on the porch. She takes out full milk
text: bottle from the box, replacing it with the empty one.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE KITCHEN. DAY.
text: Daisy stirs a pot of hot cereal on the stove, as she stares
text: at the coffee percolating in the little glass bubble on the
text: top of the coffee pot.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Waiting -- for nothing.
text: The Aunt, at the table, turns a page of a tired-looking, well-
text: thumbed and old magazine.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY. DAY.
text: The telephone in the hallway begins to ring; and two Scottie
text: dogs suddenly start barking.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And then...
text: The Aunt looks at Daisy, wondering who that could be?
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY. DAY.
text: Daisy answers the telephone.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hello? Yes. What??
dialog: (to the yapping dogs)
dialog: Sh-sh!! Be quiet.
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Sinus?
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE KITCHEN. DAY.
text: Daisy takes the pot off the stove and begins to serve them,
text: her mind far away. The dogs are yapping.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (to the dogs)
dialog: Sh-sh...
speaker_heading: AUNT
dialog: (seeing her face)
dialog: Did someone die?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No. No one died...
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S BEDROOM. DAY
text: DAISY rifles through clothes on hangers in her closet; she
text: takes out a dress on a hanger, holds it up, looks it over,
text: puts it back, and takes out another.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: I wasn’t the first relative his
dialog: Mother called that day. Maybe not
dialog: even the tenth.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE, STAIRCASE/ LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: Daisy descends the stairs.
text: She peeks around the corner, and smiles nervously at her
text: Aunt, sitting in the living room.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I won’t be long.
text: As Daisy disappears, the Aunt struggles to get herself up and
text: out of her chair.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH. DAY.
text: A large car is parked in front of the house; an Aide stands
text: by the passenger door, and doffs his hat to Daisy.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE, CAR. DAY.
text: Once in, Daisy turns back toward the house, sees her Aunt
text: peeking out around the lace curtain in the window.
text: The Aunt nervously ‘waves.’ Daisy smiles nervously, and gives
text: a very faint wave back.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: But I was around.
text: The car begins to drive off.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY.
text: The car drives down a long tree-lined driveway.
text: Daisy sits in the backseat, her hands nicely folded on her
text: lap. She stares straight ahead.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: His Mother said he needed someone
dialog: to take his mind off his work. Why
dialog: she thought I could do that, I had
dialog: no idea.
speaker_heading: DAISY
text: (after a nervous sigh, to
dialog: the driver)
dialog: We're fifth -- or sixth cousins.
dialog: Depends on how you count...
speaker_heading: DRIVER/AIDE
dialog: I suppose he’s related to half of
dialog: everybody up here.
text: (looks at her through the
text: mirror, reaches into his
dialog: pocket)
dialog: Cigarette?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No. No, I don’t. Thanks.
text: Aide puts his cigarettes away. She looks out the window.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: I figured I’d spend the afternoon
dialog: there, and after having thoroughly
dialog: bored him to death, go quietly back
dialog: to my quiet life.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY. CONTINUOUS.
text: The car pulls up in front of a mansion, Springwood. Other
text: cars and a few military vehicles are parked along the drive.
text: A few cars drive off, others are arriving - this seems to be
text: a busy place.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: AN AIDE leads Daisy down the hallway which is full of people
text: working, sitting at make-shift desks, speaking in hushed and
text: important-sounding voices. Others are typing ... Aide 3 is
text: speaking on the telephone in French. Daisy has to step over the
text: phone cables that run across the floor. No one pays any
text: attention to her.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: But that’s not what happened.
text: A door opens down the hall and a man comes out with a piece
text: of paper and practically runs down the hall. Daisy has to
text: get out of his way. The Aide leads her by the arm now.
speaker_heading: AIDE
text: He's not been feeling well. Sinuses.
text: Daisy nods, she knows this.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Seems to happen every time, the
text: second he comes home.
text: They reach an imposing door, and the Aide knocks, waits, then
text: opens the door.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Mr. President?
text: The Aide guides Daisy into the study. DAISY is hesitant.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY.
text: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT sits behind his desk, turned away, lost in
text: deep even profound thought. DAISY enters, and the door is closed
text: behind her. All the bustle of the hallway is gone. All we can
text: hear is the tic of the clock on the mantelpiece.
text: She stands, self-conscious.
text: He continues to concentrate. The warm glow of the desk isolates
text: him. Lost in some other world, he takes off his glasses, rubs
text: his eyes, a lonely sigh -- unaware that anyone is watching this
text: rare peek into the toll his office takes.
text: She nervously waits for him to notice her. Then she 'coughs.'
text: Franklin swivels his chair around and sees her; at first he
text: doesn’t recognize her.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Daisy. What a rare treat. I hope my
dialog: mother didn't force this on you.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: She said everyone else was away.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Did she? She shouldn’t have said
dialog: that. How nice to see you. How long
dialog: has it been?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Oh, years. The Dows’ wedding, sir.
dialog: In Rhinebeck?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Oh, were you there?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Where would you like me to sit?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: There’s tea... I think there’s
dialog: still tea. Will you..?
text: She goes and pours tea for herself.
text: Franklin opens a desk drawer, takes out a flask. Before he
text: can pour, he touches his forehead, closes his eyes, reaches
text: for his handkerchief and blows his nose -- painfully. Daisy
text: watches all of this with interest. He then pours liquor into
dialog: his tea.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I can do this because my mother's not
dialog: here.
text: He laughs.
dialog: She doesn’t believe in sinus
dialog: medicine...
text: He looks at her, then decides not to offer, and puts the
text: flask back in the drawer.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (sips his tea)
dialog: That’s better. Do you collect stamps,
dialog: Daisy?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I - don't.
text: He reaches across his desk and picks up a large stamp album
text: and a magnifying glass.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Come and look at these...
text: She politely goes to the desk, looks for a chair, finds one,
text: and brings it to in front of the desk, where Franklin,
text: magnifying glass in hand, has begun looking over his stamps.
text: He hands her the magnifying glass.
text: Daisy ‘studies’ the stamps through the magnifying glass --
text: there are stamps of rich colors and exotic and distant places
dialog: and peoples.
text: She turns the page -- and the stamps on this page are of
dialog: people of today --General Franco; Josef Stalin; Haile
dialog: Selassie of Ethiopia; Mussolini of Italy and so forth.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I suppose you’ve met pretty much
dialog: everyone of these...
text: She looks closely at a stamp of Hitler through the magnifying
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
text: Not every one. Not yet.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: They're -- fascinating.
text: The door opens and a secretary, MISSY, enters without
text: knocking. She carries a file. On seeing Daisy:
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Excuse me, I should have knocked.
text: She sets a paper in front of him. As he signs, Missy briefly
text: looks over Daisy who is pretending to look at the stamps.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
text: (As he skims the letter,
dialog: to Missy, incredulous)
dialog: I actually wrote this?
dialog: (Missy just waits, then to
dialog: Daisy)
dialog: My cross, Daisy, is that I am too
dialog: nice.
dialog: (To Missy)
dialog: But -- we need the Senator’s vote.
dialog: Don’t we? Why can’t politicians
dialog: just be honest?
text: (He smiles at Daisy, then
text: as he signs, explaining
dialog: Daisy to Missy)
dialog: My cousin.
text: Missy ‘smiles’ at her, and Daisy smiles back.
text: As she continues to 'study' the stamps, she hears the door
text: close and Missy leave. Then she notices Franklin looking at
text: her. She turns to a page of the album. Franklin leans over
dialog: and looks.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Those are from Africa.
text: She slowly turns the pages.
dialog: They say that's the highest
dialog: waterfall in the world.
text: She turns another page and stops--.
text: Daisy looks at the stamps, then looks at him, smiles. She
text: turns the page and looks at a stamp.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (seriously and proper)
dialog: I understand Africa can get very
dialog: hot.
text: She looks at him. She makes him smile.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Very hot, Daisy.
text: When sees him smiling, she likes this -- she’s doing what
text: she’s supposed to be doing. She turns the page.
text: Franklin once again presses his fingers to his forehead --
dialog: relieving the sinuses.
text: She watches him, concerned.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Would you like me to go?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: No. Please. I wouldn’t.
text: Franklin sips his spiked tea, lights a cigarette -- both of
text: which make him feel better for a moment, and so he turns his
text: attention back to enjoying watching Daisy look at the stamp
dialog: album.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (pointing out a stamp)
dialog: This one’s pretty. I'd like to go
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Where is that?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well. To be honest, I’d like to go
dialog: almost anywhere.
text: This makes him laugh.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: The President spent a lot of time
dialog: that spring in Hyde Park-on-Hudson.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY / FRONT OF HOUSE . DAY.
text: President Roosevelt's motorcade is arriving. A flurry of
text: excitement, as aides hurry out of their cars before they have
text: even stopped, and rush to go and set up.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: In Europe there would certainly be
dialog: another war, one we would be
dialog: dragged into, whether we liked it
dialog: or not.
text: Franklin smiles in the passenger seat of a limousine, as his
text: Mother and servants come out to greet him.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Here at home, he said, everyone was
text: just shouting at each other.
text: Daisy stands under a tree, at a distance, watching all the
text: excitement of his arrival.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: So the President spent an awful lot
dialog: of time that spring in Hyde Park On
dialog: Hudson. He said -- I helped him
dialog: forget --.
text: Daisy waves to Franklin.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: -- ‘the weight of world’.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY
text: A microphone is being set up on Franklin's desk by
text: technicians as he looks over a speech. Franklin’s Mother
text: straightens her son’s tie, smooths his hair, fusses with his
text: collar -- still taking care of her boy.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a joke to the
dialog: technicians)
dialog: Will someone please tell her --
dialog: it’s radio?
text: The technicians laugh. Mother keeps fussing.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: His Mother said he’d run the whole
dialog: country from here if he could.
text: A crowd has formed in the open doorway to listen to his
dialog: speech.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: But he couldn’t. Not with how
dialog: things were -- so many people out
dialog: of work.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Quiet please...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I think that means you, Mother.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: A radio is on in the kitchen:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: (on the radio)
dialog: But I know many of you have lost
dialog: your jobs or have seen your friends
dialog: or members of your families lose
dialog: their jobs.
text: In the kitchen five or six servants stand, paying rapt
text: attention to the radio broadcast.
speaker_heading: DAISY’S VO.
dialog: Everyone scared. No one knowing
dialog: what was going to happen.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: We move out of the kitchen and through the living room where
text: military men sit listening to a large radio.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: (on the radio)
dialog: and I do not propose that the
dialog: Government shall pretend not to see
dialog: these things.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM / STUDY. DAY.
text: We move down the hallway and Franklin’s voice on the radio
text: gets fainter and fainter until we reach a group of staff and
text: servants in the study’s doorway and through these craning
text: necks and bobbing heads we see Franklin giving the chat into
dialog: the microphone:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: But I conceive the first duty of
dialog: government is to protect the
dialog: economic welfare of all the people
dialog: in all sections and in all
dialog: groups...
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
text: And everyone looking to him.
text: Daisy sits in a corner arm chair, magnifying glass in hand,
text: looking at stamps, while listening to Franklin make his
dialog: broadcast.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN. DAY
text: In front of the house, the President sits in a chair on the
dialog: steps as a local German-American brass band (lederhosen,
text: etc.) under a banner ("Hyde Park German-American Friendship
text: Society”) plays for him.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And even here he couldn’t get
dialog: completely away. They all wanted
dialog: something from him. The local labor
dialog: union, the Hyde Park Chamber of
dialog: Commerce, the German-American
dialog: Friendship Band.
text: He catches sight of Daisy in the crowd of servants and staff
text: watching the band from the driveway.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And all he wanted -- was to relax.
text: He smiles, and winks at her.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN'S CAR. DAY.
text: Franklin drives. He pushes a button on a small contraption
text: and a lit cigarette appears as if by magic.
text: Daisy is with him in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: That spring I learned to smoke.
text: Daisy takes the lit cigarette out of the contraption; starts
text: to hand it to Franklin, but impulsively takes a puff first
text: herself, then smiling, she gives the cigarette to him.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY
text: Another day. They drive down a country road through a wood,
text: where trees are being lumbered. Following behind them is a
text: State Trooper car.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Each time he came home, he’d
dialog: telephone and ask: Daisy where
dialog: would you like to go today? And I
dialog: would always answer -- ‘anywhere.’
scene_heading: EXT. HILLY ROAD. DAY
text: Another day. The car climbs the hill with the police car
text: right behind.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: His wife, he said, didn’t like to
dialog: take drives. I learned the names
dialog: of birds and trees I’d seen my
dialog: whole life. We drove along country
text: roads, up hills, through woods,
dialog: through fields.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD. DAY
text: The two cars drive through a field.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: He'd had the car built so it could
dialog: be driven with just the hands.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN'S CAR. DAY
text: Franklin brakes with his hands, then, using only his hands --
text: accelerates. Daisy in the front seat watches his hands
text: closely. Then she turns and looks back at the police car
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: A Police Car always followed just
dialog: behind.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY
text: A Police Car follows Franklin's car.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: That is, until one day...
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN'S CAR. DAY
text: Franklin drives the car up a very bumpy road. Franklin has
text: his left arm out the window, and with his left hand he is
text: gesturing behind him -- waving the police escort away. Daisy
dialog: doesn’t see this.
text: Daisy turns and looks back, where she sees the police car
text: pulling off the road and turning around.
text: She turns back to Franklin as he drives.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Where’s the police car going?
scene_heading: EXT. BUMPY PATH. DAY.
text: Franklin maneuvers the car up a steep dirt road in the woods.
text: The car shakes from the bumps.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Oh, they don't follow all the time.
dialog: Sometimes they have to go and catch
dialog: a crook or something, I suppose.
text: He laughs. Daisy laughs.
text: The car continues up through the woods and comes to a slow
text: stop on the hillside overlooking the valley.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN'S CAR. DAY
text: Franklin turns off the engine. For a moment there is only the
text: sound of the birds and the wind.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What a lovely spot. We've not been
dialog: here before.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: No. I've been saving this.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What a beautiful view.
text: As she looks off, he leans over and turns on the car radio.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I like this song.
dialog: 14.
text: As the song plays, Franklin smiles one of his big smiles at
text: Daisy, then dispenses a lit cigarette from the little
text: machine. He puffs. The cigarette smoke curls out of the car
text: as they listen.
text: Daisy is lost in the song, in the view, in the swirling smoke,
text: she hums along with the song. Then she notices that Franklin is
text: looking at her; he takes her hand in his. He her puts her hand
text: on his thigh. And leaves it there.
text: Daisy looks down at her hand on Franklin’s thigh. She looks at
text: him, looking out the window, smoking.
text: He takes her hand, and puts it on his groin.
text: She hesitates, then begins to unbutton his trousers; checking to
dialog: see if he objects or if this is what he wants.
text: He just looks off, smoking. Then without looking, he helps by
text: unbuckling his belt.
text: From the perspective of the backseat, it soon becomes clear that
text: she is rubbing him, masturbating him.
text: He closes his eyes, bites his lip, as he looks off into the
dialog: woods.
text: And after a moment of this, it is clear that he comes. Pause.
text: Daisy doesn’t know what to do. She looks at him; he begins to
text: button up his trousers, buckle his belt.
text: She looks away into the woods, not sure whether to be
dialog: embarrassed or not.
text: Franklin finishes buttoning and tries to hand her his pocket
text: handkerchief. She doesn’t notice at first; her mind racing.
text: He touches her knee, which startles her; she sees the offered
text: handkerchief, and takes it.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m--
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I’m the one who should
dialog: apologize...
text: With his handkerchief, she begins to wipe her dress and her
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Should we go back?
dialog: 15.
text: Daisy nods, as she wipes.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: I knew, even without him saying
dialog: anything that we were now -- not
dialog: just fifth cousins -- but very good
dialog: friends.
text: He turns off the car radio and a telephone rings.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S HOUSE HALLWAY/ KITCHEN. DAY.
text: Daisy is on the telephone, giggling like a schoolgirl,
text: unconsciously playing her hair, smiling, transfixed by the phone
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: As soon as I can get away.
dialog: (She laughs.)
text: She hangs up and as she fixes her hair she goes into the
dialog: kitchen.
text: The moment she enters the kitchen, she stops preening. Here
text: her Aunt sits at the table; a good-sized lunch finished in
text: front of her. Daisy starts to pick up her Aunt’s dishes and
dialog: take them to the sink.
speaker_heading: AUNT
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: The President wishes to see me.
dialog: (and this answers
dialog: everything)
dialog: And he’s the President.
text: Aunt looks at her. Daisy begins to wash the dishes.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He wishes to show me a new -- stamp.
text: Daisy washes a pot.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH. DAY.
text: DAISY runs out of the door, the screen door slamming behind her,
text: and she hurries into her own car and begins to drive off.
dialog: 19
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And so time passed. Time measured now
text: in Franklin’s visits home.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKLIN'S CAR. DAY.
text: Franklin's car as he drives it back up a very narrow, steep and
text: bumpy road. Daisy is at his side. She looks back. They are
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Look at that -- the police have left
dialog: us alone yet again.
scene_heading: EXT. A HILLSIDE. DAY.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: They seem to have a sixth sense
dialog: about that.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: They do, don't they?
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD. DAY.
text: The car comes up a steep incline, it is shaking and bouncing
text: through ruts, and over rocks.
text: Daisy looks at Franklin, smiles, as she bounces, holding on.
text: He reaches down and puts the car into first gear and drives a
text: little farther up. The road gets even narrower, trees limbs
text: bang against the windshield.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Where are we going?
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
text: And there, suddenly revealed, hidden from the road is a_ 19
text: stone cottage. She looks at him, confused: what is this?
text: He stops the car, and turns off the engine.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: It’s lovely.
text: They sit in the car looking at the cottage.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I had it built. It's where I’1l
dialog: retire. I’1ll write those detective
dialog: books I'm always talking about.
text: She looks at him and nods.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Go look around.
text: She gets out of the car, and goes toward the house; she can’t
dialog: believe her eyes.
text: Franklin's car door opens and first one and then the second
text: leg are lifted out, held tight by leg braces.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
text: Daisy runs excitedly through the cottage, opens the sliding
text: glass doors and bursts out onto the porch.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: It’s heaven!!
text: Franklin has made it to the porch. He looks off across the
dialog: valley:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I have been thinking, Daisy...
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: What have you been thinking?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: That I.. I’d like to--. To share
dialog: with you -- this.
text: She stands across the porch from him, watching him.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: When I have to be away...You know I
dialog: have to be away.
text: He turns to her, she nods.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Should you ever miss me...?
text: She looks at him.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You think you might miss me?
text: She smiles -- of course she will.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (teasing her)
dialog: Well, if you ever do --
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Do you ever miss me?
text: He looks at her, then:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I always do.
dialog: (about the house)
dialog: A place to come. And be alone.
dialog: (he smiles at her)
dialog: And miss me...
text: She looks at him lovingly. Franklin just smiles.
text: She clumsily hugs him, which nearly knocks him over; she
text: grabs him as he totters; he just keeps smiling at her.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: CAPTION: ONE YEAR LATER
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS STEADICAM.INT. STUDY/ HALLWAY/ LIVING ROOM /
scene_heading: HALLWAY/ KITCHEN. DAY
text: Daisy, in Franklin’s study, pulls out a drawer of the desk,
text: fumbles through some papers, and takes out a small bottle of
dialog: aspirin.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: By now everyone was used to me. I
dialog: was the cousin who’s always
dialog: visiting. No one ever even asked me
dialog: why that was.
text: She opens the door to the Living Room where she finds
text: Franklin's Mother, with Tommy QUALTERS, a copy of Scribners
text: magazine in her hand. Around them, staff are cleaning and
text: moving furniture, flowers, etc.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Has he read this?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: I believe he has.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (reading from the

dialog: "If one could choose, from all
dialog: possible British personalities, the

dialog: upon Americans -- King George and
dialog: Queen Elizabeth would not even make
dialog: the short list."
text: (She looks up, outraged)

speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: No King of England had ever visited

text: almost collides with Maid 1 who is rushing towards the Dining
text: Room. We follow Maid 1 who nervously approaches Mother, who
text: by now has reached the Dining Room.
speaker_heading: MAID 1
dialog: Mrs Roosevelt, we appear not to have
dialog: enough plates.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Franklin warned us, today, stay out
dialog: of Mother’s way.
speaker_heading: MAID 1
dialog: We don't have enough plates. Someone
dialog: miscounted.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You tell me this now?
text: Mother's English Butler now hurries in.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Mrs Astor has called again.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Mrs Astor. She'll have plates. We'll
dialog: borrow hers.
dialog: (Mother starts to head off
dialog: towards the Kitchen)
dialog: On second thought -- we’ll ask her
dialog: cook. Mrs Astor is so rich, she
dialog: doesn’t know what she has.
text: The Butler hesitates -- this is all too much for him -- then
text: he straightens his coat and we follow him as he heads off
text: into the Hallway, where two black servants, Nelson and
text: Thomas, have entered from outside, carrying their bags, and
text: dressed in their travel clothes.
text: The Butler stops and stares at them.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (to the Butler)
dialog: Good morning.
text: The Butler looks them up and down.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Could you tell us which way’s the
dialog: kitchen?
text: The Butler ignores their question and heads off at speed
text: towards the Kitchen to protest their presence.
text: We follow the Butler into the Kitchen where there is a
text: chaotic scene of preparation for that evening’s dinner.
text: Dishes being prepared, vegetables cut, pots boiling, with
text: cooks and cooks’ helpers working at double-speed.
text: Mother is inspecting a vast and ornate dessert. A female cook
text: stands next to her, waiting for the verdict.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Good. Good. But is ‘good’ the best
dialog: we can do? They are royalty.
text: Maid 1 is holding the kitchen telephone. With her hand over
text: the receiver, she calls to Mother:
speaker_heading: MAID 1
dialog: We can borrow the plates, ma’am!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Thank God for rich neighbors.
dialog: 21.
text: Maid 2 appears out of breath.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (to Maid 2)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MAID 2
dialog: Their rooms are ready, ma’am.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: (she heads off to check on
dialog: their rooms) )
dialog: The poor dears are going to be
text: exhausted.
text: Daisy stands at the sink, she takes a water glass off of a
text: shelf, and turns on the tap.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: (wiping the perspiration
text: from her brow, to a
dialog: Scullery Maid)
dialog: ‘Poor dears.’
speaker_heading: MAID 2
dialog: Exhausted my arse.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: I'd watch what I said, if I were
dialog: you.
text: The Butler follows Mother out of the Kitchen.
text: Maid 2 sticks her tongue out at the departed Butler.
text: The Cook then clears her throat and gestures to Maid 2, that
text: Daisy is standing right there.
text: Maid 2 then turns to Daisy, and smiles. Daisy, filling the
text: glass at the sink, ‘smiles’ back and then leaves via the back
text: door towards the Lawn.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: The only quiet place left to work
dialog: was outside.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN. DAY.
text: Daisy, water glass and pill bottle in hand, heads across the
text: lawn toward Franklin and Missy who sit together at a healthy
text: distance from all of the chaos of the house.
dialog: 22.
text: Piles of papers and files surround Franklin who is just
text: finishing the article in the magazine as Daisy reaches the
text: phone on a very long lead is on the ground next to him.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Missy, have you seen this?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Scribner's? Not this month.
text: He hands her the magazine to read.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (seeing the glass and
dialog: pills)
dialog: What are those for?
speaker_heading: DAISY
text: He has a headache.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (to Franklin)
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: DAISY
text: His sinuses again. Happens this
dialog: time every year.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I know that.
text: Daisy hands Franklin the glass and a couple of aspirin.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (to Franklin)
dialog: You didn’t say anything about a
dialog: headache.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He's not going to trouble you with
dialog: everything, Missy. You have enough
dialog: on your plate.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: What does that mean?
text: Aide 2 has brought Franklin a few messages, which he opens
dialog: and reads as:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: It means -- you take very good care
dialog: of me, Missy.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean you both do.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: mM.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (cont'd)
dialog: (to the Aide, about the
dialog: message)
dialog: I‘1ll call in the morning. They --
dialog: can wait. Can’t they?
speaker_heading: AIDE 2
dialog: They can, sir.
text: Aide 2 heads back as Qualters now reaches them, having
text: crossed the lawn from the house.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: They have left New York. Estimated
dialog: time of arrival: 6pm.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Good.
text: Both Daisy and Missy are listening now.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: The State Police are predicting crowds
dialog: of up to three hundred thousand along
dialog: their route here.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (to Franklin)
dialog: You're smiling.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I am. It means a lot -- that
dialog: they’re welcomed. It says
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: I thought you'd appreciate that, sir.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (to Franklin)
dialog: And what does it say?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: That maybe, Daisy, their visit will
dialog: be a success. And that is very
dialog: important.
text: He suddenly looks at her and smiles.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: To show the whole world that we are
dialog: the best of friends.
text: Qualters has started to head back, stops.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: And in each town, as the Royals
dialog: drive through, we're ringing church
dialog: bells.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Excellent.
text: (then shouts to him as he
dialog: goes)
text: Set up the drinks tray in the library.
text: Qualters hearing this looks pained.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Is this something you've addressed
dialog: with your mother?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I'm trying not to address it with
dialog: my mother, which is why I'm asking
dialog: him to do it.
scene_heading: INT. AN UPSTAIRS BATHROOM. DAY
text: A PLUMBER is on his knees installing a new toilet seat.
text: Franklin's MOTHER stands over him watching everything he
text: does. He finishes the last screw, looks to Mother:
speaker_heading: PLUMBER
dialog: Real rosewood. Still got the
dialog: smell.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Is that why it cost so much?
text: He smells the toilet seat. Rubs his hand around it -- showing
text: off its smoothness.
text: A couple of Maids stand in the doorway watching, as Mother
text: hesitates then leans down and opens and closes the seat a few
dialog: times to test it out.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY
text: Qualters is setting up a drinks tray.
text: The door is open and a severe looking woman, Eleanor, stops
text: in the doorway. She just looks at what is being set up.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: I’m just doing what I’m told.
dialog: 25.
text: We notice MAID 1 in the corner cleaning the curtains. They
text: look at her, and she hurries out.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (about the Maid leaving
dialog: and the drinks tray)
dialog: So much for your little secret...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: Eleanor comes out of the study and heads down the hallway,
text: only to pass Franklin’s Mother, who is furious, on her way to
text: the study, MAID 1 right behind her.
text: Mother and Eleanor look at each other:
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Good morning, Mother.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Good morning.
text: Mother reaches the study door, and goes in without knocking.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: We are not going to serve the King
dialog: of England - a cocktail!!
text: The Maid, seeing Eleanor listening, closes the door to the
dialog: study.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN. DAY
text: Missy continues to read the magazine. Franklin is finishing
text: correcting a speech.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Aide 1)
dialog: Mike, read this over the phone to
dialog: Harry. If he thinks it sounds all
dialog: right have him hand it personally
dialog: to the Speaker.
speaker_heading: AIDE 1
dialog: I will, sir.
text: He hands him the speech.
text: Missy looks to Daisy who is lost in thought, and just staring
dialog: at Franklin.
text: Eleanor joins them with a tray of coffee.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Who'd like coffee?
text: (to Franklin, as she pours
dialog: coffee)
dialog: Your Mother has now told me for the
dialog: tenth time -- not to call her Royal
dialog: Highness -- Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: She’s told me that too.
dialog: (turns to Daisy)
dialog: Daisy? Daisy? Hello? Anyone home in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (coming to)
dialog: What?? Oh yes. She told me that
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (to Franklin)
dialog: I told her who did she think I was?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Eleanor)
dialog: I think she knows.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (to Daisy)
dialog: You're just staring at the
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I’m not. I wasn’t.
dialog: (to Missy)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Eleanor’s just brought out fresh
dialog: coffee. She was asking if you'd
text: like any. She’s staring again.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What?? I’m not.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
text: She's blushing. Leave her alone,
dialog: Missy. My husband lives for the
dialog: adoring eyes of young women. We all
dialog: know this.
text: She smiles.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (‘joking’)
dialog: Let’s change the subject, shall we?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Don’t tell me you’re embarrassed.
dialog: That day, I would like to see.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I didn’t say I was embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MISSY
text: Daisy’s blushing again.
text: Daisy is very lost now, and as she looks from one to the
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What is she thinking? What’s going
dialog: on in that mind?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What are they doing?
text: He has looked off and we see what he is seeing: three large
text: tractors with mowers attached are idling in a row across the
dialog: lawn.
speaker_heading: AIDE 2
dialog: They've been told to mow. They’re
dialog: waiting for you to move.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Why didn’t someone tell me this?
dialog: Were they just going to sit there?
text: They start picking things up. Daisy stands and starts to push
text: Franklin. As they head off:
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (new subject, to Franklin)
dialog: Hick called. For this morning's
dialog: Royal visit to the World's Fair --
dialog: you won't believe this -- she'd
dialog: been ordered to produce five
dialog: thousand children overnight.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: As buffers for holding back the
dialog: crowds.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Children. She couldn't believe it.
dialog: Police said that's what they'd done
dialog: in Washington and Canada. Put the
dialog: kids between the King and Queen and
dialog: the crowds. The Girl Scouts refused
dialog: outright--.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Good for them.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: They said their girls had taken an
dialog: awful beating in DC!
text: Laughter from the group as they get set to head off.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: So she finally got some Boy Scouts!
text: More laughter.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: But when they were pushed, they
dialog: pushed back! Started something like
dialog: ten fist fights!
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Poor Hick.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
text: When she finally got back to her
text: office, she kicked off her shoes,
text: opened her window and shouted out:
dialog: ‘God damn the King and Queen!”
text: All laughing hard.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Maybe we'll be saying the same
dialog: thing tomorrow!
text: More laughing. Daisy, 'laughing', watches Eleanor laugh with
dialog: abandon.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: ‘Hick’ was short for Lorena
dialog: Hickock. One of those friends of
dialog: Eleanor’s Franklin called -
dialog: -- ‘she men.’
dialog: 29.
text: Eleanor pushes Franklin in his wheelchair across the lawn. As
text: Daisy follows, watching Eleanor:
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: People said their marriage was
dialog: troubled and unhappy. That they lived
dialog: mostly separate lives.
text: Daisy watches Franklin reach and pat Eleanor’s hand as she
text: pushes him.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: But I never saw that. That’s now how
dialog: they seemed when they were together.
dialog: Eleanor has said something that has made Franklin laugh
text: again. They clearly know how to make each other laugh.
scene_heading: INT. STABLE. DAY.
text: Missy and Eleanor now sit together, and drink the coffee that
text: Eleanor brought. It's dark inside, with shafts of light
text: through the cracks in the wood. Daisy is with the women, but
text: she keeps looking over at Franklin who sits alone, a single
text: light bulb on overhead as he continues to work on papers. An
text: Aide stands with him.
text: Missy is still reading the magazine:
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (reads from article)
dialog: "A large part of the country still
dialog: believes that Edward, Duke of
dialog: Windsor, is the rightful owner of
dialog: the British throne --
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: “Thrones?’ ‘Kings and Dukes.’ It
dialog: all sounds like the Middle Ages.
text: There is a knock on the door. They women look at each other --
dialog: is it Mrs. Roosevelt looking for them?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Is it my mother?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: See who it is, Daisy.
text: Daisy goes and peeks through the crack.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (back to Franklin)
dialog: Tommy .
text: Franklin nods, and Daisy opens the door and Qualters sneaks
text: in, Daisy closing the door behind him.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (still reading the
dialog: article, having looked
dialog: up)
text: A very chastened-looking Tommy.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
text: As he should be. He was on his way
text: to set up a drinks tray in the
dialog: library.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (to Franklin)
dialog: Did you tell him to do that?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I did not and Missy is my witness.
text: Qualters stands next to Franklin.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Mind if I sit in here with you?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Gotten a little warm inside?
text: He sits on a nearby bench.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Your mother -- well, she’s very
text: much in control.
dialog: The women listen to this.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (as he works)
dialog: What’s all this I hear about a
dialog: drinks tray?
text: Qualters looks to Eleanor, then:
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: I’ve been told that my idea of
dialog: setting one out was not a very
dialog: considered one...
scene_heading: EXT. STABLE. DAY.
text: Aide 1 is running a phone line from the house to the stables.
text: Other Aides now come in and out of the door.
scene_heading: INT. STABLE. DAY.
text: Inside the stables, it’s become almost an office; there are
text: the papers and files that had been with Franklin on the lawn.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (as he works)
dialog: I was told this King didn’t even
dialog: want the job.
text: Franklin's engagement gets the women’s attention.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I’m told he’s -- quiet. Even a
dialog: little -- shy.
text: Franklin rubs his eyes.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: We must remind ourselves that these
dialog: kings and queens or whatever-- are
dialog: no better than us. They’re just
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I read that in your column,
dialog: Eleanor.
text: He is rubbing his eyes again.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Are you all right? You look in
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (to Eleanor, explaining,
text: as she continues to
dialog: ‘read’ the magazine)
text: He has a sinus infection.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He gets them -- this time of year.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: He often gets them around this time
dialog: of year.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (with irony which Daisy
dialog: doesn’t catch)
dialog: Oh does he? I didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I took an aspirin.
text: Aide 1 running the phone line enters.
speaker_heading: AIDE 1
dialog: They just left Beacon.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: So it won’t be too long.
text: He looks at the women.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (continuing with Eleanor)
dialog: And -- Eleanor, we must also remind
dialog: ourselves that they are also our
dialog: guests; and deserve to be treated
dialog: with the utmost dignity and
dialog: respect.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE. DAY
text: Outside the car, through closed windows, the sounds of church
text: bells tolling and cheering crowds.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And all the while the King and
dialog: Queen were getting closer.
text: BERTIE, THE KING OF ENGLAND, is bent over in the backseat,
text: hiding from the crowds and starving; he is trying to
text: unobtrusively look through a bag on the car floor.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It appears there is also potato
dialog: salad.
text: Bertie continues to rummage in the bags on the floor looking
text: to see what food has been packed for him.
dialog: 33.
text: ELIZABETH, THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND, is sitting next to her
text: husband in the backseat. Elizabeth is just finishing reading
dialog: the Scribner's magazine article.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Will you sit up. What are you
dialog: doing down there?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm starving. There’s only a rather
dialog: odd cheese. The bread has funny
dialog: little seeds. I’m still picking
dialog: them out.
text: He takes another bite of potato salad and then, mouth full
text: and chewing, he turns and looks out the window and smiles,
text: with mouth closed, as he waves to the crowds.
text: The cheering and the bell tolling continues.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Who re-re-reads this magazine anyway?
dialog: And where did we get it?
text: He leans forward and speaks to an Embassy Official CAMERON,
text: who is in the front passenger seat.
dialog: Who gave it to me?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I don't know, sir. Someone at the
dialog: University, I suspect.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It is you-your job--!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Listen to this.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Elizabeth--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (she reads from
dialog: Scribner's)
dialog: "Queen Elizabeth... too plump of
dialog: figure..."
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh god.
text: Elizabeth is close to tears.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't cry, dear. Please don't.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I wouldn't give them the
dialog: satisfaction.
text: They wave royally.
scene_heading: INT. STABLE. DAY.
text: Eleanor is reading the article and trying not to laugh.
text: An Aide has entered with a tray of sandwiches and a pitcher
text: of lemonade. As Missy and Eleanor choose sandwiches. Daisy
text: still soothes the horse, and feeds it straw.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Franklin, why don’t we just come
dialog: out and say it?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Say what, Eleanor?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: They're here with their hand out.
text: The room is still.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I mean, please -- what century is
dialog: this?
dialog: (to everyone in the
dialog: stables) )
dialog: Why do we care what a ‘king’ or
dialog: ‘queen’ thinks about us?
text: Daisy has watched closely; still patting the horse.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Hick says I should get a month of
dialog: columns out of this weekend.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (without looking up) )
dialog: Eleanor...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Hick says this King hates his
dialog: brother. There’s a column there.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR (cont'd)
dialog: One of those medieval rivalries --
dialog: who wears the crown? I tell you,
dialog: they're living in the middle ages!
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: His brother’s met with Hitler.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: There’s a column there too. And
dialog: this is the family we’re having to
dialog: our home for the weekend.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Eleanor, you don’t even live here.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I am staying the night. I told your
dialog: mother I would do that.
text: Daisy is petting a horse and listening. She chimes in:
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I thought the brother gave up being
dialog: king so he could marry the woman he
dialog: loved.
text: Franklin looks up to take a peek at this conversation.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Daisy, have you ever met a man who
dialog: would do that?
text: Franklin goes back to his work.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR CONT'D
dialog: (continues, to Missy)
dialog: Hick says she thinks the brother
dialog: might be positioning himself to be
dialog: the savior of the monarchy, once
dialog: England has been defeated and the
text: fascists have taken over.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: He’s young, Eleanor
text: This gets the women’s attention.
dialog: (as he works)
text: So is she. They’re both young.
text: The horse Daisy is petting whinnies; Missy turns to Daisy
text: and puts her finger to her mouth. Daisy then does the same to
dialog: the horse.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN CONT’D
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Now let's give them a break. Can
dialog: we?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (‘innocently’)
dialog: Are you saying that to me?
text: Daisy and Missy closely watch this husband and wife exchange.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I'm saying it to all of us.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE. DAY.
text: Elizabeth is looking at her arm.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: How’s the sunburn?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don’t have sunburn.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It was terribly hot. And there
dialog: wasn’t any shade.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I am not sunburned.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (to Cameron)
dialog: Why doesn’t she have any ointment?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don’t need any ointment.
text: Cameron turns around from the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Should we talk through the
dialog: itinerary, sir?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're not going to get ill?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Leaning backwards like that, in the
dialog: car.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: Bertie gets ill when he looks back in
text: a moving car.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I haven't for a long time--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That's because you're now always in
dialog: the backseat. Still I make sure he
dialog: keeps looking forward. I taught him to
dialog: do that.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I f-feel fine.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Because you're looking forward.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Perhaps we should stop and meet some
dialog: people. Wouldn't that be a good idea?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But... We've just left... We're almost
dialog: there. I don't think there are any
dialog: more towns until...
text: He looks to the driver who shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: It's just a country road now.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Still...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He wants a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: We don’t want to be e-e-e-arly.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No. No we don’t. Oh God no.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And I'd like to meet some Americans.
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE. DAY.
text: The entourage of limousines and police cars have pulled over.
text: The roadside is deserted. There is a stone wall and a field
text: behind that. The King and Queen are out of the car. He smokes,
text: looks around. Others mill around not knowing what to do.
text: A farmer on a tractor drives by harvesting wheat. The King
text: smiles and waves. The farmer stares at him and drives past.
text: The Queen looks out at the empty field and the tractor.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (about the Farmer)
dialog: Doesn't he want to meet you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: He's busy.
text: The King smokes. Queen watches him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (quietly, under her
dialog: breath)
dialog: I know how important this is.
dialog: You're not going to let the side
dialog: down. Don’t worry.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That is what I’ve been telling
dialog: myself too.
text: Bertie turns to Cameron.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You started to say about the weekend's
dialog: itinerary.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (takes out his notebook)
dialog: You will be staying in the Roosevelt
text: house. Adjoining rooms. In fact, it
text: is the President's mother's house, and
dialog: she will officially be your hostess.
text: A car goes by. Bertie waves.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Where is the President's house?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: This is where he lives. When he's not
dialog: in Washington.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: With his m-m-mother? He doesn't have a
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: He has a room.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And his wife?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: She lives in another house. Hers.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And he doesn't--?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Which she shares with other -- women.
dialog: Who make furniture.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm sorry?
text: Bertie has finished his cigarette, he lights another one.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Furniture. They make it. Build it.
dialog: They're couples. They're the sort who
dialog: like each other.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And the President's wife lives with
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes.
text: The farmer on the tractor drives by again, a little closer
text: this time. Bertie smiles and waves. The farmer just stares
text: at him and drives past, plowing.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Where is this furniture factory-house?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: About a mile away from the mother's
dialog: house.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I see. I think it was a good thing we
dialog: changed our minds and did not bring
dialog: Lilibet with us, Bertie. It does not
dialog: sound like the type of weekend where
dialog: you bring the children.
text: Four or five curious cows, in the field across the road, come
text: to the fence and watch. Bertie watches them and smiles and
text: then waves.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (to Elizabeth)
dialog: Cows. We have cows.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: The Ambassador's wife, after having
dialog: visited Hyde Park...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why do they call it that?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hyde Park? That’s in London. It's
dialog: confusing to me.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I don't know. Our Ambassador's
dialog: wife wrote - and I think you need
dialog: to hear this. She wrote after
dialog: staying a night with the Roosevelts
dialog: in their home
dialog: (he reads)
dialog: "It is a dismal house, extremely badly
dialog: run, and most uncomfortable."
text: Bertie watches the farmer on the tractor drive by one more
text: time, unsmiling.
text: The cows stare and moo at him.
scene_heading: EXT. GATE-HOUSE. DAY.
text: The King and Queen's motorcade turns into the drive on the
dialog: Roosevelt home.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVE. DAY.
text: The motorcade drives down the tree-lined drive.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Half of his cabinet had been
dialog: against the visit. The country,
dialog: they said, was in no position to
dialog: take sides in another European War.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. DAY.
text: The motorcade approaches the house. Franklin is on the front
text: steps, sitting in a chair.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: So Franklin invited them here to
dialog: the country, where, out of the
dialog: spotlight, we could all relax and
dialog: just be ourselves.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. DAY.
text: The cars stop and the King and Queen are helped out of their car
text: and walk up the steps and greet the smiling President, then his
text: Mother, Eleanor, and others who are around him.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE / INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: The King and Queen are shown into the house. All go in except
text: for Franklin. As soon as the King and Queen are in, Qualters
text: lifts up Franklin and quickly carries him in his arms around the
text: side of the house.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. DAY.
text: DAISY is at distance watching.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Looking back, I now see how
dialog: important this day was, to them, to
dialog: us, to the world. And of course --
dialog: as it turned out, to me.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE / INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: King and Queen are looking around, obviously commenting on how
dialog: nice the house is, although we hear none of this. They notice
text: through the side window, Franklin being carried by. They
text: pretend to ignore it.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE. DAY.
text: Franklin is carried through a back door into the living room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: In the hallway, the Royals are waiting.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh, what lovely ships.
text: A shelf of model ships in the corner.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: My son built them when he was a
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How very clever. (to Bertie) Wasn't
dialog: that clever?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: T-t-terribly clever.
dialog: As Eleanor points out some stuff birds:
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: He also did the birds... as a boy.
text: They all try and look ‘interested’ at the birds.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Until the taxidermy smells made him
dialog: ill. He’ll tell you about it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I shall look forward to that.
text: The door to the living room opens and they are shown in to greet
text: an already seated and smiling Franklin.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH’S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: A Bedroom done in chintz where Eleanor is showing Elizabeth
text: where she will be staying. Awkward pause. Their hollow
text: footsteps on the hard wood floor.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Charming.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Hopefully not too small.
dialog: 43.
text: Elizabeth just 'smiles.' She goes to the window and looks
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Look at that view. You must tell me
dialog: about everything.
text: Eleanor follows her to the window. They both look out at the
dialog: field.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That's -- the field.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: We have fields just like that.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (pointing)
text: Those hills -- lead down to the river.
text: The awkwardness has gotten painful. They have nothing to say
dialog: to each other.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So that's where they go.
text: A creak of the floor makes Eleanor turn around. Daisy is in
text: the doorway.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Daisy? What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You're just standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I came to see if I could be any...
text: They just look at her. Daisy turns to Eleanor expecting an
text: introduction, but Eleanor just looks at her, so Daisy very
text: self-consciously tries a curtsey which she doesn’t quite pull
text: off and then she hurries out of the room.
text: Eleanor turns back to Elizabeth who is looking over the beds
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Do you mind if I call you --
dialog: Elizabeth?
text: Elizabeth is stunned, but tries not to show it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No. No.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So these are the beds -- you
dialog: mentioned.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Yes. Those are them.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How clever of these women to decide to
dialog: be carpenters.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING. DAY.
dialog: 44,
text: Daisy clearly is the only person not busy, with nothing to do.
text: Qualters and Cameron, carrying his briefcase, are heading up the
text: stairs toward her. As they meet:
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: What are you doing skulking around up
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You know me, I'm always skulking.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Mr. Cameron’s with the embassy -- this
dialog: is Daisy.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (as he shakes her hand)
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Showing the gentleman his room?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Daisy--?
dialog: (to Qualters) )
dialog: I don't recall a 'Daisy' on tonight's
dialog: dinner list.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Oh Daisy's not a guest. She's--. What
dialog: are you, Daisy?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I'm part of the furniture.
text: The men laugh at the joke, and continue down the hall; she
text: smiles and starts down the hallway as Mother comes out of the
text: King’s bedroom; Daisy steps out of her way.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Is there anything I can help with,
dialog: Mrs Roosevelt?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (holding her chest)
dialog: Oh, Daisy. You startled me.
text: She hurries along. Daisy, with nothing to do, slowly walks
text: down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY.
text: Daisy knocks on a door, doesn't wait for a 'come in' and opens
text: the door to Franklin's study. Franklin is at his desk, a drinks
text: tray in front of him, which he is carefully arranging.
text: Daisy closes the door -- she is obviously very comfortable
text: coming in and out of Franklin's study.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Is my wife behaving herself?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Has my mother calmed down?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: She’s fine!
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: It’s like a madhouse.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Don’t worry. All quiet on the upstairs
dialog: front.
text: She throws herself into a big soft chair and puts her feet
text: up. She is very relaxed here. She watches him as he begins to
text: mix and then shake the drinks.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He's definitely younger than I'd
dialog: imagined. For a King, you know....
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Is he...
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And they both seem nervous. That
dialog: surprised me.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (shaking the drinks) Without some
dialog: help from us, Daisy -- there soon
dialog: might not be an England -- to be
dialog: King of. So I'd be nervous too.
text: She watches him shake the cocktails.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: So many of our countrymen seem to
dialog: dislike England now. But who
dialog: better than two such fine young
dialog: people to maybe change all that.
dialog: Anyway, that’s why they’re here.
text: Thinking about this, he shakes a little too long. He now
text: notices what he has been doing, stops, opens the shaker, and
text: the drink spills.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Damn it.
text: Daisy is surprised by this show of temper and nerves.
text: Franklin starts to clean up. Daisy gets up and helps him.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Let me do it.
text: He sits back and lights a cigarette as she cleans up the tray
text: in front of him.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (as she cleans up) They seem very
dialog: nice people.
text: Franklin smiles and lets her clean up the rest; she is very
text: near him; as he watches her:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Later tonight, after the dinner and
dialog: all that is over, what do you say,
dialog: you and I get out of here? Go
dialog: someplace quiet. I think I’1l need
dialog: that.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (as she cleans)
dialog: Well -- I think I’m free. (smiles)
text: She is very close to him; she looks up, kisses him sweetly on
text: the cheek, pats his head gently.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: It’s going to be a big, big
dialog: success.
text: And she continues to clean up the spill.
scene_heading: INT. PINK BEDROOM. DAY.
text: A bedroom done in Pink where Bertie has just opened a small
text: traveling liquor cabinet and is beginning to make himself a
text: drink, though his attention is on a series of pictures on the
text: wall. He turns when he hears a creak. It is Elizabeth. They
text: are both already dressed for the dinner.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh -- it's you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We share a bath.
dialog: (She has come through
dialog: their shared bathroom. )
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: So I was t-t-told.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So we don't have to go through the...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Yes.
text: He takes a sip of his drink.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What were you looking at when I came
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: These prints.
text: (He gets closer to them.)
dialog: I just told the President's mother how
dialog: humorous I found them.
text: Elizabeth is looking closely at them.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What are they of--?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: British soldiers. The 1812 War.
dialog: Cartoons actually. Mocking them. Us.
text: He takes a bigger sip.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They put you in a room with--?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The mother tried to apologize. I told
dialog: her I found them funny.
dialog: (he finishes his drink)
dialog: She said she tried to remove them, but
dialog: her son insisted.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why would he do that? What was he
dialog: trying to say?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don't know.
text: He bends over the cabinet and begins to pour himself another.
dialog: I don't know. He knows this is
dialog: important. He knows why we’re here.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: May I have a drink too?
text: She looks at the pictures on the wall, as he pours her a
dialog: drink.
dialog: How many have you had?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: The mother just left.
text: He hands her the drink.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: Cheers. She apologized for everything.
dialog: For Eleanor m-m-mostly. And for the
dialog: hot dogs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hot dogs? What are you talking about,
dialog: Bertie?
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It appears that at the picnic tomorrow-
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There's a picnic tomorrow?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: In our honour.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You hate picnics.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: At the picnic, the President's wife
dialog: has organized that hot dogs be served
dialog: as our main dish. I gather she's even
dialog: publicized this in the column she
dialog: writes.
text: They sip their drinks, lost in thought, then:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are they trying to make fun of us?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I d-d-don't kn-kn-know. What do you
dialog: think?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM / STUDY. DAY.
text: Light knock on the door, then Qualters peeks his head in.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: His Majesty will be down shortly.
text: Franklin nods and sips his drink.
dialog: Is that a drinks tray, sir?
text: Franklin doesn't answer. Qualters and Daisy share a look of
dialog: ‘what's going to happen?’
scene_heading: INT. PINK BEDROOM. DAY.
text: The King and Queen, with drinks in their hands. Elizabeth is
text: once again staring at the pictures/cartoons on the wall.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: These are revolting. They make our
text: seamen look like monkeys.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (cont'd)
dialog: I can't believe he thought these would
dialog: make you laugh, Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I 'laughed'.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They're trying to make us seem --
dialog: common. Your brother would never have
dialog: stood for this. I'm sorry, but he
dialog: wouldn't.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I th-th-think if we j-j-just ignore
dialog: the-the-these--.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Please, stop stuttering!
dialog: (Pause. They both sip
dialog: then)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I didn't
dialog: mean it, Bertie. I think I have a
text: headache. My face feels hot. I'm
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It's the sunburn.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I shouldn't have said.. I didn't
dialog: mean...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I am not my brother.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Thank God for that.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And you are not the D-d-duchess of
dialog: Windsor. You are better than that.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I just hate to see you...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: See me...?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: Laughed at.
text: She looks back at the pictures, and sips, then:
dialog: 51.
dialog: How do you eat a hot dog?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I believe with your hands.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM / STUDY. DAY.
text: Door opens and Maid 1 (Mary) enters with a full tea tray. She
text: carries the tray to Franklin's desk -- stops when she sees the
text: drinks tray already there. She hesitates, then sets her tray
text: beside the other.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You're not going to tell anyone,
dialog: are you, Mary?
speaker_heading: MAID 1
dialog: Not a soul, sir.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Mary, we all knew, was Mother's
dialog: spy. Mother had them too.
dialog: The Maid goes.
scene_heading: INT. PINK BEDROOM. DAY
text: Bertie and Elizabeth sitting on his bed, drinking.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There was in my room -- left there --
dialog: I'm sure so I couldn't help but see it
dialog: -- a copy of that magazine with the
dialog: article.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Who would have left it?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Maybe a m-m-maid. They look Irish.
text: Except for the one who looks Jewish.
dialog: We're not home.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I-I-I'd leave it untouched. Another
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why not?
text: The drinks cabinet is now on the bed with them.
dialog: make another drink.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The President seemed...?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That was a question. I'm asking you.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I can't tell yet.
text: He hands her the drink.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It was peculiar -- being greeted on
dialog: the s-s-teps. Then ushered in -- and,
dialog: di-di-did you see through the window?
dialog: Did you follow that?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We were told he could walk with a
dialog: cane.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: He has two canes.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They seem to be mostly for show.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: Now it is MOTHER coming through the living room,
dialog: 52.
dialog: He starts to
dialog: and she
text: opens the door to Franklin’s study without even knocking.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: Mother, who had a sixth sense for
dialog: sniffing out alcohol, was on the
dialog: warpath. Mother’s father had been a
dialog: nasty drunk.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY
text: MOTHER enters and Daisy suddenly stands up. Franklin just
text: ‘smiles’.
text: Mother is looking at the drinks tray.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Is he coming down?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What is that doing in here?
text: She goes and picks up the drinks tray -- glasses rattle.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Leave it, Mother.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I thought we agreed.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'm not going to let the King and
dialog: Queen of England see us--
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Dammit, I said -- leave it!! Daisy,
text: close the door.
text: Daisy turns to close the door as Eleanor hurries in:
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What's happening? Why are you
dialog: shouting?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Close the door, Daisy!
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Should I stay?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Just close it.
text: Daisy closes the door and stays.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: He's brought out the drinks tray,
dialog: Eleanor.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Franklin, you promised.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: As I said to Mother, that's not true.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Maybe after dinner!!
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Don’t shout, Mother. We have
dialog: guests.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: Servants listening the hallway to the argument in the Study.
speaker_heading: MOTHER'S VOICE
dialog: I know we have guests! And I know
dialog: who they are! And my son is not

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN'S VOICE
dialog: They’re my guests!!
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It’s my house!!
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Give me the tray.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

dialog: Isn’t it true?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It’s been printed. Here.
text: He tries to show her, she doesn't take it.
text: She sips.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: This is for the hot dog picnic?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: There will be entertainment as well.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Perhaps I should be surprised.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (looking at the program)
dialog: Indians.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Indians.
dialog: (reads )
dialog: "Ish-Ti-Opi."
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What???
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He's called here "The Indian
dialog: Baritone." So he's going to sing.
dialog: There's "Princess Te Ata." She is
dialog: going to show us "The Indian Corn
dialog: Ceremony."
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh god.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "Accompanied by Kurkus Pahitu on the
dialog: tom-tom."
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There's our incentive not to be hung-
dialog: over. Perhaps our only incentive. The
dialog: ‘tom-tom.' 'Hot dogs.' ‘Cartoons of
dialog: British naval officers as monkeys.'
text: Knock on the door.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Come in.
text: Cameron is at the door.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: The President is waiting for you in

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (explains)
dialog: Drinks.

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And the Queen?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: She's been allowed more time to relax.
text: Elizabeth smiles at Bertie and sips her drink.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: (leans over and kisses her
text: on the cheek, then sighs)
dialog: Here we go...
text: He gets up.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. DAY.
text: The room is icy. Franklin sits behind his desk. Daisy stands in
text: a corner. Mother sits, a frozen expression on her face.
text: Eleanor sits to one side, obviously unhappy.
text: A knock on the door. The door opens. Qualters announces:
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: His Majesty.
dialog: 57.
text: Bertie comes into the room. Mother immediately stands and
text: curtsies. Daisy copies her. She looks to Eleanor who just
text: ‘politely nods' to Bertie.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a big smile)
dialog: Come in. Come in, my friend. Forgive
dialog: me for not getting up.
text: Franklin holds out his hand. Bertie goes to the desk and
text: shakes hands.
text: On the desk now are the drinks tray and a tray for tea.
text: Bertie looks at the competing trays.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Sir, my Mother does not approve of
dialog: cocktails.
text: Mother's face is very stern.
dialog: And thinks you might rather have a cup
dialog: of tea.
text: Bertie looks around the room, then at the competing trays:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: M-m-my m-m-mother would have said the
dialog: s-s-s-same thing. Actually I-I-I-I-I
dialog: prefer a-a-a-a...
text: The suspense builds. Daisy holds her breath. The others look
text: at each other, then finally
dialog: ++. cocktail.
text: Franklin laughs, the others follow and then Bertie laughs
text: pleased with his joke. As we watch Daisy who exhales,
text: relieved that the King finally got it out.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN VOICE
dialog: (as he begins to pour)
dialog: A man after my own heart...
text: Daisy starts to sip her drink, then stops, when she sees
dialog: Mother watching.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. EVENING.
text: The kitchen crowded with servants, cooks, getting the dinner
dialog: ready.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING.
text: The guests for dinner having cocktails. Bertie and the

dialog: tells a joke:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: So she said: ‘I’m so pleased to
dialog: meet you, Mr. President, I’ve only
dialog: met three Americans. Joe Kennedy,
dialog: J.P. Morgan, and Fred Astaire.’
text: He pauses for the punch line:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (continues) ‘Thank God,’ I said,
dialog: ‘you met Mr. Astaire, or what would
dialog: you think of the rest of us?’
text: The guests laugh.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM. EVENING.
text: Elizabeth comes down the hallway; just before she enters the
text: living room, she takes a deep breath, puts on her public face,
text: and as she walks in there is a 'buzz.' She and Bertie share a
text: look, she is nervous but acting confident. Guests curtsey, she
text: shakes their hands. Mother introduces her. Eleanor greets the
text: Queen, and is obliged to curtsey, which she does as
text: perfunctorily as she can. Bertie watches his wife; Franklin gets
text: his attention back.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. EVENING.
text: In the study doorway, peeking into the living room are a few
dialog: Maids -- and Daisy.
text: The Butler comes up behind them and is telling them they
text: shouldn't be there. The Maids hurry off to work; Daisy is
text: suddenly alone.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM / HALLWAY / DINING ROOM. EVENING.
text: Mother stands ringing a little bell -- for dinner. The

text: stand, Mother is beaming. Right behind is Franklin who moves
text: painfully on his braces and sticks. Elizabeth is 'pretending'
text: to hold onto his arm. On his other arm is Qualters,
text: unobtrusively, letting Franklin hold on.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Elizabeth, a joke)
dialog: We could have sold tickets to this
dialog: dinner, and made ourselves a pile
dialog: of money.
text: She doesn’t know what to make of this; he winks at her, as
text: they continue toward the dining room.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. EVENING.
text: Up in the sky is a gorgeous full moon.
text: Even the chauffeurs outside are divided by class tonight; in
text: one group, the permanent employees of the wealthy, and in
dialog: another, five or six drivers hired for this night. These
text: drivers talk and smoke among themselves under a tree by the
text: driveway. The cars are parked along the drive.
text: One of them notices the moon, and taps another on the
text: shoulder. The conversation stops as they look at the moon.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: (he’s Irish-American)
dialog: You think it’s full?
speaker_heading: SECOND DRIVER
dialog: I think it’s got another day.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: I think it’s full. Let’s see what
dialog: Daisy thinks.
text: For the first time we see Daisy sitting on the front steps of
text: the house. . Behind her the house is lit up. From the open
text: porch, a small military band is heard playing "You For Me."
text: She too is looking up at the moon.
text: The FIRST DRIVER leaves the group and goes up to her.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: Daisy?
text: She is startled, having been lost in her thoughts.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Oh hello, Dick.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: You think it’s full tonight?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What? Oh -- yes. That moon
dialog: certainly is full.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: (shouts back)
dialog: She says I’m right!
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (suddenly worried)
dialog: Oh, I didn’t know you--. I could be
dialog: wrong. I don’t know for--.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: Do you need a ride home?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Me? No. No thank you. I have my
dialog: car. I just.... Such an important
dialog: night.
text: She stands up, notices the other drivers from this group
text: looking at her.
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: Is it? I don’t know. What’s one
dialog: king more or less? He still has to
text: put his pants on one leg at a time.
speaker_heading: 2ND DRIVER
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Did you curtsey for the Queen,
dialog: Daisy?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (calls back)
dialog: I certainly did, Tommy! And I think
dialog: I did it right.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I didn’t fall down!
dialog: 61.
text: They laugh. The other group of official Chauffeurs ignore
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: THIRD DRIVER
dialog: How come you’re not inside there,
dialog: Daisy?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Me? Oh I don’t belong in there. I’m
dialog: glad to see you working, Frank.
speaker_heading: THIRD DRIVER
dialog: It’s just for the one night...
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well it’s something...
text: A MAID comes from around the house with food for the drivers.
text: The official chauffeurs ignore this.
text: The others line up to eat. Daisy watches this from a
dialog: distance:
speaker_heading: FIRST DRIVER
dialog: (to Maid, joking)
dialog: Can I take some home for my dog?
speaker_heading: FOURTH DRIVER
dialog: He doesn’t have a dog.
text: Laughter at their situation. As Daisy wanders off into the
dialog: dark:
speaker_heading: MAID 2
dialog: (to one of the younger
dialog: chauffeurs)
dialog: Touch me there again, you'll be
dialog: wearing it and not eating it...
text: Laughter.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT/SIDE OF HOUSE. EVENING.
text: We follow Daisy as she turns the corner of the house to the
text: porch where the military band is finishing playing a song
text: under strings of festive lights.
text: A Maid with a tray of snacks has come out and waits.
speaker_heading: BAND LEADER
dialog: Fifteen minutes, gentlemen.
dialog: 62.
text: And the band members stand, and circle the Maid with the tray
dialog: of food.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING
text: Franklin sits next to the Queen; he taps a spoon against his
text: glass to get the table’s attention.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (whispers to the Queen)
dialog: You'll forgive me for not getting
dialog: up.
text: (raises his glass, to the
dialog: Table)
dialog: To His Majesty, the King.
text: Suddenly all the guests stand -- chairs pushed back. Only
text: Franklin and the Royals remain seated. The Guests all raise
dialog: glasses and repeat:
speaker_heading: GUESTS
dialog: To His Majesty, the King.
dialog: Everyone drinks.
text: As the guests begin to sit, Franklin has an afterthought:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (toasts)
dialog: And to Her Majesty, the Queen!
text: The guests hesitate, some stand again immediately, some
text: hesitate, and look among themselves -- what to do; they all
text: finally stand.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: (to Eleanor, next to him,
dialog: as he stands)
dialog: Actually, normally, we wouldn't
dialog: toast the Queen.
text: And they drink. Some repeating “To Her Majesty, the Queen.”
dialog: Some just saying to “The Queen.” Some saying nothing or just
dialog: ‘Welcome.”
text: During this confusion, the Queen, taken aback by this
text: afterthought, and what actually is being toasted, drinks as
dialog: well.
text: Her drinking to her own toast gets the attention of Mrs
text: Astor, one of the guests. She turns to her neighbor.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MRS. ASTOR
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: She drank to herself.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN. EVENING.
text: Daisy still stands at a short distance from the house,
text: looking back. The house is lit up and looking magnificent,
text: romantic, festive. The band again is playing on the porch.
text: She stands lost in her thoughts. She smokes a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MISSY'S VOICE
dialog: Shoot!
text: Daisy turns, there is Missy leaning over looking at her
text: shoes; she has stepped in something.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (wiping her shoes)
dialog: Those damn horses. And these are
dialog: my best shoes.
text: Daisy approaches her, looks down at her black and white
dialog: shoes.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: It’s not the horses’ fault--.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (trying to clean her shoe)
dialog: I know. I know. You like them. I’ve
dialog: been looking for you.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Do you need a handkerchief?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Come here.
text: Daisy comes to Missy who puts her hand on Daisy’s shoulder to
text: keep her balance as she cleans the horse shit off her shoes.
text: The band music continues from the porch.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: We saw you out here--.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: We??
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Franklin’s asked me to tell you
dialog: that you could go home.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MISSY (cont'd)
dialog: He thinks he’s going to be occupied
dialog: with the King all evening now.
text: Daisy turns back toward the house, try to hide her
dialog: disappointment.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Of course he is...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY / DINING ROOM. EVENING.
text: The soup course is about to be served. A waiter holds a
text: stopwatch at his side. A Maid whispers:
speaker_heading: MAID 2
dialog: What are you doing with that?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: We've been told the Queen is served
text: exactly 30 seconds after the King.
text: The King is served his soup, and the Waiter starts the
text: stopwatch ticking.
text: Suddenly we hear an enormous crash.
text: A serving tray with a pile of plates has collapsed, startling
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MAID 1
dialog: (holding the King’s soup)
dialog: I don't know. No one touched it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I su-su-suppose an angel just passed -
dialog: a ve-ve-ry clumsy one.
text: He smiles at his joke. Franklin leads the laughter, and gives
text: Bertie a big nodding smile. The King is very pleased with
text: himself. Mother is embarrassed but trying not to show it.
text: Franklin looks to Eleanor who smiles, and then nods her head;
text: she has appreciated the King’s sense of humor and grace.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (to Cameron, about the
dialog: King’s joke) )
dialog: That was very good...
dialog: 65.
text: Maids 1 & 2 have quickly started to clean up.
speaker_heading: MAID 2
dialog: (to the other, explaining
dialog: the crash)
text: It’s the full moon.
text: The Maid 1 nods.
speaker_heading: MRS. ASTOR
dialog: (to a neighbor)
dialog: I hope those weren't mine.
dialog: (to Cameron, another
dialog: neighbor, explaining)
dialog: She didn't have enough plates.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN. EVENING.
text: Missy and Daisy sit on a bench, under a tree; the house aglow in
text: front of them, and the music. Both look at the moon. Both smoke.
speaker_heading: DAISY
text: She doesn’t leave him alone. She
text: doesn’t let him relax.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Is that what he tells you?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Does he talk about her with you,
dialog: Daisy?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: With me? Why would he talk about
dialog: his wife with me?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I don’t know how he stands it.
text: Missy has finished her cigarette and tosses it on the ground
dialog: and stands.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Stands what?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Eleanor's always off to places.
dialog: Meetings. How he must miss it.
text: Daisy tosses her cigarette down and stands.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Miss what?
text: Missy starts to head back to the house, Daisy right behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Having a happy married life
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I don’t think that is the
dialog: President’s fault --.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I wasn’t saying--. I think it pains
dialog: him more than we can know -- not
text: having a wife to care for him.
text: As they head toward the brightly lit house, we hear only
dialog: their voices:
speaker_heading: DAISY VOICE
dialog: This morning she didn’t even know
text: about his sinuses.
speaker_heading: MISSY VOICE
dialog: Didn’t she?
speaker_heading: DAISY VOICE
dialog: She said she didn’t. It’s sort of
dialog: like they’ve become just --
dialog: friends. Just good friends.
speaker_heading: MISSY VOICE
dialog: She is a_ busy woman.
speaker_heading: DAISY VOICE
dialog: She's his wife...
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING.
text: Franklin is telling the table the story of Bertie being given
dialog: the choice of tea or a highball.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: “My mother treats me in the exactly
dialog: same way, Mr. President... But I
dialog: too prefer a cocktail. Who
dialog: wouldn't?”
text: Great laughter; Bertie enjoys the attention and is smiling,
dialog: soaking it in.
dialog: 67.
dialog: Mother is not too keen about telling this story; and
text: Elizabeth is a bit surprised. But the table finds it very
text: funny. Eleanor especially is now laughing.
text: Maid 1 is whispering in Mother's ear.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. EVENING.
text: In the kitchen, Mr Johnson, Mother's English butler, stands in
text: his coat, holding his hat. An Aide is with him.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: I apologize, Madam. For the timing.
speaker_heading: AIDE 3
dialog: I've tried to talk to him.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (very stiff, very proper,
dialog: very English)
dialog: Madam, I simply cannot stand by and
dialog: watch the King of my country being
dialog: served by....Negroes.
dialog: For the first time we see the problem -- the two Negro
text: waiters, Nelson and Thomas, stand in the corner listening to
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Mr. Johnson, you are the best
dialog: butler we have. I understand the
dialog: situation.
dialog: (to Aide)
dialog: Isn't there something we can do?
speaker_heading: AIDE 3
dialog: They came with--.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Me.
text: Eleanor, sensing the problem, has followed them into the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Mr Thomas and Mr. Nelson are part
dialog: of the White House staff.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I realize that, Eleanor. What if we
dialog: kept them in the kitchen?
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Mother, we’re not going to hide
text: them in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Eleanor, why are you even involved
dialog: in this?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You knew we were bringing help. You
dialog: agreed.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I didn’t know they were -- them.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Either they go, or I go, Ma‘’am.
text: Mother turns to Eleanor.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: They are not going anywhere. As
dialog: long as I am here.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDOW. CONTINUOUS
text: Daisy and Missy now at the window to the dining room, peeking
dialog: in.
text: Through the window -- The Negro servants enter, Mother and
text: Eleanor behind them; Eleanor smiling to herself,
text: triumphantly. We look around the table, Franklin laughing,
text: Bertie listening to someone on his right, etc.
text: Missy touches Daisy's shoulder to move her along:
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Do you need a ride home--?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (still staring into the
dialog: window)
dialog: No.
text: Along the house, the English Butler, Johnson, bag in hand, is
text: walking toward the front of the house and the road.
text: Daisy stares into the window.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Look at him.
dialog: 69.
text: We see what she is looking at: Franklin is now leaning over
text: the table telling a story -- everyone is enthralled, then all
text: burst into laughter, including Eleanor. He is obviously in
dialog: his element.
speaker_heading: DAISY’S VOICE
dialog: They love him.
speaker_heading: MISSY’S VOICE
dialog: Who doesn’t.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I suppose I better go.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I’1l walk you to your car.
text: The two women head around the house.
speaker_heading: DAISY’S VOICE
dialog: I can’t help but keep thinking
dialog: about the King’s brother giving up
dialog: his crown. For love. A real life
dialog: Romeo and Juliet. Franklin and I
dialog: talked about it.
speaker_heading: MISSY’S VOICE
dialog: Did you? And what did he say,
dialog: Daisy?
speaker_heading: DAISY’S VOICE
dialog: He said that sort of thing was very
dialog: English.
speaker_heading: MISSY’S VOICE
dialog: Where’s your car?
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING
text: A maid carries in a tray of food, as she approaches the King,
text: she trips and the plates are flung right past the King.
text: Mother immediately looks at one of the Negro waiters, Thomas,
text: who gestures that he didn’t do anything.
text: The Maid is horrified. Silence. Then:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Nu-nu-number 2!
text: Laughter Eleanor enjoying this, as Maids go to clean up the
text: mess. 2nd Maid whispers to the lst, as if explaining it all:
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MAID 2
dialog: I told you -- it’s the moon.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. EVENING
text: The full moon. The guests are all leaving, coming out of the
text: house, saying their good-byes to Mother. Chauffeurs and drivers
text: are lined up with their cars. One by one their owners get in,
text: and are driven off down the tree-lined lane.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN. EVENING.
text: The military band are packing up their things.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/ LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Franklin starts to wheel his chair from the hallway into the
text: living room. In the background, the final guests are leaving.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Let's go to my study. We'll be
dialog: left alone in there. Unless you
dialog: need to--.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No. No.
text: Franklin stops.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Would you mind pushing?
text: Bertie gets behind Franklin and pushes him into the living
dialog: room.
dialog: Her Majesty has gone to bed?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: She has. And -- your wife?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Who knows?
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: I'm sure.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. NIGHT.
text: Bertie pushes Franklin in, Franklin gestures that he should
text: close the door.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Night cap? Mother's gone to bed.
text: Still sitting in his wheelchair, he begins to make them
dialog: drinks.
dialog: I was worried for her....if one
dialog: more thing went wrong...
text: Smiles, hands Bertie a drink.
dialog: (about the drink) )
dialog: They worry about me. My Mother and
dialog: Eleanor. Both their fathers were
text: nasty drunks. Cheers.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Cheers.
text: They drink, Bertie is looking around the room.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Do you collect stamps?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I did. I have. I understand you are
dialog: a serious stamp collector. Perhaps,
dialog: you would show me some of your
dialog: stamps.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You can’t be interested.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: But I am --.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Don’t -- protest. Thank you for the
dialog: thought, though.
text: Toasts him.
dialog: When I was a young man -- before my
dialog: marriage of course -- I found that
dialog: showing one’s stamps was a very
dialog: helpful way to get a young woman’s
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Was it.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: They have to sit close to you.
dialog: Share the magnifying glass.
dialog: 72.
text: He ‘winks’ at Bertie. And smiles.
dialog: But I suppose if your father’s the
dialog: king... Who needs stamps?
text: Bertie sips his drink.
dialog: The Queen is certainly a lovely
dialog: woman.
text: Bertie looks up at him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: As is the first lady.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: She’s a --
dialog: (choosing his words
dialog: carefully)
dialog: strong -- person
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Some days you feel like you don’t
dialog: even want to get out of bed -- but
dialog: then these women, they won’t let
dialog: you do that, will they?
text: He looks at Bertie, who sips his drink and says:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What do you do -- to be alone?
text: Bertie looks confused.
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: I have my stamps... You need to
dialog: give them
dialog: (gestures to those outside
dialog: -- wherever)
dialog: a reason not to bother you. You can
text: figure things out in the quiet of
dialog: your own head. I open up my stamp
dialog: books and that tells everyone not
dialog: to bother me.
text: Bertie nods.
dialog: You were wonderful tonight, young
dialog: man.
text: Bertie is taken aback by this.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Just what I said. You were
dialog: graceful. You were confident.
dialog: You're going to be a very fine
dialog: king. I'm sure of it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Your father would be very proud.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (‘smiling’)
dialog: I’m not so certain about that.
text: Franklin sips his drink, looking right into Bertie’s eyes:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: If I were your father, I’d be
dialog: proud.
text: They sip their drinks, Bertie looks around, thinking about
dialog: what to say.
text: He smiles;
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN CONT’D
dialog: I know -- some men have an entire
dialog: home as their castle, I only get a
dialog: study.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But then you must have many many
dialog: castles.
text: Bertie looks at him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The Queen -- she’s... She worries
dialog: so much. It’s been hard for her.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (a fact)
dialog: Women worry.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I just stop listening to her
dialog: sometimes. Forget I said that.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Forgotten.
dialog: 74.
text: Bertie takes a folded up piece of paper out of his inside
text: jacket pocket, and looks at it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: I’ve been asked to say things...
text: He looks up and begins:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Such a war as we now co-co-
dialog: contemplate --. The carnage, look
scene_heading: at S-S-S-Spain. Ch-children -- b-b-
dialog: bombed. Tha-tha-that’s what we can
dialog: expect. It will b-b-be horrific.
dialog: Beyond anything m-m-man has seen.
text: Bertie takes a sip, then looks up at Franklin.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (he tries again)
dialog: And yet we know some of your
dialog: countrymen wi-wi-wi-sh my country i-
dialog: i-i-i-ill... And w-w-want us to
dialog: fail. And want me to fail wi-th-th-
dialog: th you...
dialog: (he looks away)
dialog: This god damn st-st-stutter...
text: He looks back into his drink.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What stutter?
text: Bertie is surprised by this, looks closely at Franklin, then:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This god damn polio.
text: They look closely at each other.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes I think -- they des-
dialog: deserve better than me. My --
dialog: ‘subjects.’ I’m sorry. I don’t know
dialog: why-why I’m saying this to you. I’m
dialog: s-s-supposed to be trying to
dialog: convince you to help us.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Let me confess something now to
dialog: you.
text: Bertie looks at him.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: As you have been so -- honest with
dialog: me. No one -- ever mentions to me
dialog: that I can’t move my legs. It’s
dialog: never referred to.
text: Bertie is very intrigued by this.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Not by anyone. I used to think it
dialog: was because they were embarrassed
dialog: about it.
text: Franklin starts to stand up out of his wheelchair; Bertie
text: stands to help, Franklin waves him off. As he heads to his
text: desk, moving slowly on his braces, holding on to the backs of
dialog: chairs.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
dialog: But now I think it’s because that’s
dialog: not what they want to see.
text: He sits at his desk, takes a cigarette (his reason for coming
text: to the desk), offers one to Bertie as he talks.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course we
dialog: (gestures he and Bertie)
dialog: think they
dialog: (gestures everyone out
dialog: there)
dialog: see everything that we are. All our
dialog: flaws. Or transgressions. Or
dialog: failures. But that is not what
dialog: they're looking to find when they
dialog: look to us. And God help us if that
dialog: ever changes.
text: They look at each other.
dialog: Think of the disappointment... when
dialog: they find out what we really are.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Sometimes it might make one feel an
dialog: imposter...
text: He is lighting Bertie’s cigarette now so their faces are
text: close. This last comment strikes home for Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: (unable to look up as he
dialog: speaks)
dialog: They didn’t want me as their King.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I didn’t know they voted for that
dialog: in England.
text: Bertie smiles. Franklin relaxes behind his desk.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Pretending at times to be someone
dialog: we know we aren’t. Young man,
dialog: that’s what I’ve learned it takes
dialog: to be a President. And I’m going to
dialog: hazard a guess that it takes the
dialog: same damn thing to be a king.
text: He smiles that big smile, smoking his cigarette.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I’m thinking -- another drink?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM / HALLWAY. NIGHT.
text: The living room is empty; laughter is heard coming from the
dialog: Study.
text: Missy enters from the hallway, on her way to the study,
dialog: having obviously been called.
text: She stops when she sees Bertie, come out of the study,
text: smiling to himself.
text: He quietly closes the door behind him; he appears to be a
text: somewhat changed man, at least for the moment -- a new spring
text: in his step; a satisfied smile.
text: At first he doesn’t notice Missy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: (after nearly bumping into
dialog: her)
dialog: Pardon me...
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Sir.
dialog: (corrects herself)
dialog: I mean, Your Highness.
dialog: (corrects herself again)
dialog: Your Majesty...
text: She curtseys. He smiles at her and she watches him head up
text: the steps, two at a time.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: Bertie goes through the bathroom, and gently pushes the door
text: open to Elizabeth's bedroom.
text: Elizabeth asleep in bed. Bertie stands for a moment, then
text: ‘coughs.’
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You're still awake?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mmmmmmm .
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I think I'll go to sleep. It's late.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why are you smiling? Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No. He's a very funny man. Has some
dialog: wonderful jokes.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Like what?
text: She sits up in bed.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (hesitates, then)
dialog: I couldn't tell them to you. They're
dialog: not meant for women.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They sound very 'funny.'
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He liked my stories too.
text: Concerned, she turns on bedside lamp.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What stories?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I-I-I told him about the coronation.
dialog: About how they p-p-put the crown wrong
dialog: way around.
text: He laughs, she doesn't.
dialog: And the stepping on my robe so I
dialog: couldn't move.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You shouldn't have told him that.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Why? He laughed.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We don't make fun of ourselves.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Not here. Of course he liked those
dialog: stories, they make us look like fools.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They make us look like people!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Don't be naive, Bertie.
text: Bertie goes and looks out the window and again there is the
text: full moon.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He made fun of himself too. He said at
dialog: the picnic tomorrow--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh god that picnic.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: (sitting on the bed,
dialog: smiling)
dialog: He said that the Indians -- they were
dialog: Eleanor's ideas. "One of my-my-my
dialog: wife's crazy ideas." His Mother is
dialog: furious about it. Franklin's just
text: trying to keep it short.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He talks about his wife like that to
dialog: you? I hope you didn't talk about me
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I didn't. I wouldn't do that. We
dialog: didn't talk about you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I asked him -- without mentioning
dialog: you -- about these hot dogs?
dialog: What's that about? You want to
dialog: know what he said?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (cont'd)
dialog: (she stares at him)
dialog: He said he doesn't get the fuss.
dialog: They're just a good thing to eat ata
dialog: picnic. There's no 'meaning.' Nothing
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You didn't say I was concerned?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm not sure I believe you--.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That's not fair.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Three different women tonight asked me
dialog: if I thought there could ever be an
dialog: American queen. If we'd ever ‘allow'
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That was rude.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Do you have a cigarette? I have
dialog: smoked all of mine.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That won't help you sleep.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I know.
text: He gives her a cigarette.
dialog: Thank you. A light?
text: He lights her cigarette.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I never wanted this life.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It’s hard.
dialog: 80.
dialog: Go to bed. I'll be fine.
text: She smokes.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If there's a war -- and we know there
dialog: will be -- he believes America could
dialog: be persuaded to help.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Did you see some of the people here
dialog: tonight? Hear their names? They're
dialog: from Germany. Italy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Their ancestors--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They're Irish. They're Jews. They hate
dialog: us, Bertie!! They want to see us fall
dialog: on our face!! They want to laugh at
dialog: us!!
text: She starts to cry.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I think you're wrong. I th-th- think
dialog: we just need to be a little more
dialog: confident.
text: He gets up off the bed and heads back to his bedroom.
text: Elizabeth is amazed, stunned by this new attitude; she has
dialog: never heard him talk like this before.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Goodnight. I'm not sure I can even
dialog: sleep.
dialog: (turns back to her)
dialog: Finally, he patted me on the knee and
dialog: said, ‘young ma-ma-man, it's time for
dialog: you to go to bed." Like a father, I
dialog: suppose. He's very happy that I am
dialog: king.
dialog: (Then one more thing)
dialog: When he retires, he's going to write
dialog: detective stories. I told him I love
dialog: detective stories.
text: She just looked at him.
dialog: He’s built a cottage. He told me I
dialog: could come and stay anytime. I
dialog: love detective stories.
dialog: 81.
text: He closes the bathroom door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. PINK BEDROOM. / EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Bertie, in his pajamas now, sits in a chair in the corner and
text: smokes in the dark. He gets up and goes to look at the War of
text: 1812, anti-British prints on the wall, which are lit only by
text: the moonlight, one more time. He strikes a match to take a
text: closer look.
text: When noises outside distract him and he shakes out the match.
text: He goes to the window, pulls back the curtain and looks down
dialog: below.
text: From his perspective, we see an idling car -- having just
text: been brought from the garage. A uniformed officer waits.
text: Qualters and then Missy come out of the house.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: (to Missy)
dialog: Do you want to drive?
text: Without answering she goes around to the driver's seat;
text: Qualters is telling the officer something. Bertie watches
text: this officer then hurry off. Qualters gets in and drives
dialog: Missy off.
text: Bertie watches the car go down the long drive; he looks up at
text: the moon. He is about to leave the window when a second car
text: is driven up by the Officer, this car is Franklin's.
text: Suddenly the light in the room is turned on, startling
dialog: Bertie.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I thought you were asleep.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Then why did you turn the light on?
text: Outside a car is driving off. Bertie looks out the window.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Who’s that?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It’s Franklin.
text: Bertie goes to the wall switch and turns the light off.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Can we call home? I want to speak
dialog: with Lilibet.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What?? It's--.
text: Looks at the clock.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It's morning there. She's up. We know
dialog: she's up.
text: They hear another car pull up outside. They look at each
text: other, then both go to the window, pull back the curtains,
dialog: and peek out:
text: THREE WOMEN sit in an idling covertible, as Eleanor hurries
text: from the house and gets into the back seat; there is muffled
text: laughter/giggling from the women. The King and Queen watch as
dialog: they drive off:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Who are they? With Eleanor.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’m just guessing now -- but: the
dialog: ones who made your bed?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (totally confused)
dialog: Maids?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The furniture makers.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh. Where do you think they’re
dialog: going, Bertie?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: Back to the furniture factory where
dialog: they all live? I’m just guessing.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I want to call home.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Daisy, in a white nightgown, lies in her bed, her bedsheets
text: twisted, unable to sleep, staring off toward the window and
text: the full moon. She is restless, tries to lie on a different
text: side, then reaches and turns on a little bedside lamp, and
text: picks up a book to read.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: No one could sleep that night.
text: She impetuously jumps out of bed, grabs a sweater from a hook
text: on the back of her bedroom door, and goes out, quietly
text: closing the door behind her.
text: We see for the first time, on the back of the door, visible
text: only when closed is a framed official portrait of President
text: Roosevelt -- the kind they hang in post offices.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE PORCH. NIGHT.
text: Daisy swings gently in the porch swing, pushing with her bare
text: feet; smoking, staring out into the night. The full moon
text: looking down upon her.
text: Suddenly she gets up, quickly stubbing out her cigarette in
text: the ashtray. She rushes inside, then quickly stops and grabs
text: the screen door to keep it from slamming shut and making
dialog: noise.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE / INT. DAISY’S CAR. NIGHT.
text: IN HER CAR, dressed now, she sits in the dark; only the
text: reflection of the moon on the hood of the car; she sighs a
text: big sigh and releases the brake and the car rolls a little.
text: Only when it has rolled a comfortable distance from the house
text: does she turn on the engine and then the headlights. And she
text: heads off, the moon in front of her, it’s as if she is being
text: pulled by the moon.
scene_heading: EXT. PINK BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: Elizabeth sits on the bed waiting. Bertie comes in from the
text: hallway in his robe.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They're putting us through.
text: Phone in the room rings. Elizabeth answers it.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes. Yes, put her on.
dialog: (short pause, then)
dialog: Darling! It's Mummy! How are you?
dialog: I'm sure it is. Is Margaret with
dialog: you? Tell her -- it's still night
dialog: here.
text: She smiles at Bertie -- Margaret will get a kick out of
text: hearing that, she thinks.
dialog: But Margaret clearly doesn't understand this concept of time
dialog: differences.
dialog: Tell her -- it's night. It's dark.
dialog: The sun isn't.... What is she saying?
dialog: Yes I know, it's morning there. But
dialog: it's... I'm not trying to scare her,
dialog: dear. Why is what I'm saying scary?
dialog: The sun will come up, tell her that,
dialog: just not--.
text: Holding her hand over the phone, to Bertie:
dialog: She's upset. She's thinks.... I
dialog: don't know what she thinks.
dialog: Listens.
text: Now Lilibet’s crying too.
text: He takes the phone.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, my Lilibet! Tell your sister
dialog: it's because the world is round. It
dialog: goes around the sun so--. It--.
dialog: (to Elizabeth)
text: They're crying.
dialog: (what to do? Then into
dialog: phone)
dialog: Oh look, the sun has just come out.
text: It was behind a cloud all this time.
dialog: Tell Margaret that we’re sorry to have
dialog: confused her. That's right. We're
dialog: fine. We just wanted to say hello.
dialog: Lilibet? Lilibet?
dialog: (to Elizabeth)
text: She's gone.
dialog: (then)
text: She rung off.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY’S CAR / EXT. THE ROAD NEAR TOP COTTAGE. NIGHT.
text: Daisy drives along the main road; she pulls the car onto a
text: patch of grass on the side of the road, and cuts the engine.
text: She gets out and starts to head into the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Daisy climbs, lit only by the moon. She seems to be in no
dialog: rush to get anywhere -- rather enjoying the night, the
text: magical moonlight, the mystery of the woods, the cries of
text: owls, the barking and howling of distant dogs.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: If ever I missed him, there was a
dialog: place he’d built for me to come,
dialog: and be alone, and miss him.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. NIGHT.
text: She reaches the top, her destination -- and there is Top
text: Cottage, dark and bathed by the moon.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. TOP COTTAGE. NIGHT.
text: Daisy sits on the porch where she has sat so often before
text: with Franklin, and where she now sits looking off at the
text: distant hills. She lights a cigarette and baths in the beauty
dialog: of the evening.
text: Behind her, the house is dark; lit only, as is everything
dialog: else, by the moon.
text: Suddenly through the glass door, we see a shadowy naked
text: female figure scurry, then stop, seem to pick up something --
text: and for a instant we see her lit, then the lighter is closed
text: and all we see is the glow of her cigarette. Daisy stares
text: off, utterly oblivious to all of this.
text: All of a sudden a flashlight shines in Daisy's face,
text: startling her, and making her jump up.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
text: Daisy, trying to calm herself from the shock, shades her eyes
dialog: and sees:
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Tommy? What the hell are you doing
dialog: here?
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: You shouldn’t be up here now.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Why? Why not?
text: Daisy, still covers her eyes.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Can you get that out of my face,
dialog: please?
text: He lowers the flashlight and she sees, lit now by the
text: flashlight, a pair of shoes on the ground -- women’s black
text: and white shoes -- Missy’s.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: You really shouldn’t be up here,
dialog: Daisy.
text: Daisy stares at the shoes.
text: Two bare feet appear beside the shoes in the light of the
dialog: flashlight.
dialog: It is Missy.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (very friendly)
dialog: Daisy! How nice to see you up
dialog: here. '
text: Daisy looks at Missy, who is finishing a last button; then at
text: her bare feet, then at the shoes.
text: A door closes in the house. She turns and looks there, then,
text: it all suddenly dawns on her.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Oh my god... Oh my god...
text: She bolts for the woods.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Stop her!
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: (going after Daisy)
dialog: Daisy, stop! Don’t go in--.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Daisy hurries through the forest.
dialog: 87.
text: Qualters runs after her, and immediately gets caught in the
text: brambles and trips, falls down.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Fuck. Fuck...
text: Missy follows, still barefoot.
speaker_heading: MISSY
text: (as she heads into the
dialog: woods )
dialog: Daisy! Ouch. Daisy!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Daisy madly fights her way through a brush, then falls and
text: begins sliding, then rolling down a steep hill.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Missy fights her way through the underbrush.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Come on, Daisy! What the hell are
dialog: you doing? Daisy!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Qualters is now sliding down the same hill, holding onto
text: limbs and bushes and he hurries down.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Daisy lies on the ground; she hears Missy’s voice.
speaker_heading: MISSY’S VOICE
dialog: Daisy! Come on, Daisy!
text: The voice is getting closer. Daisy starts to stand up, when
text: out of the dark a hand grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS VOICE
dialog: I have her!
text: Daisy suddenly bites the arm, pushes away Qualters and
text: plunges into the dark, only to fall again. Qualters
text: flashlight falls onto the trapped Daisy.
text: Missy charges through the brush and hurries to the voice.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Get up. Get up, Daisy. You fucking
dialog: bit me. What is wrong with you?
text: Daisy is crying, very upset, nearly hysterical.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: I said get up.
text: He pulls her up, as Missy appears.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (to Daisy)
dialog: It’s all right. It’s all right. I
dialog: understand. Just calm down now.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: She fucking bit me.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: You'll live.
dialog: (to Daisy)
dialog: Take a deep breath.
dialog: (to Qualters)
dialog: Let go of her. Let go...
text: Qualters lets go of Daisy.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Now, that’s better isn’t it?
dialog: Now why are you so upset?
text: Missy tries to touch Daisy’s cheek.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Don’t touch me.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: What do you think happened?
text: Missy is breathing heavily. She looks at Qualters then:
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Do you want to see the President?
text: For the first time Daisy looks at her.
dialog: He’s just up there. I think he’d
dialog: very much like to see you.
text: Missy picks some leaves and pine needles out of her hair.
dialog: Look at you. We don’t want him to
dialog: see you like this, do we?
dialog: 89.
text: Daisy stares at her.
dialog: Tommy, could I have your
dialog: handkerchief?
text: He gives her his handkerchief. She licks it and begins to
text: clean Daisy’s face. As she cleans, and as Daisy stares at
text: her, no longer crying:
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: This is a very important weekend
dialog: for everyone. I wouldn’t want any
dialog: of us to forget that. So we all
dialog: need to be on our best behavior.
dialog: Don’t we?
text: Missy continues to fuss, pulling out a leaf from Daisy's
dialog: tangled hair...
text: Suddenly, Daisy pushes Missy hard; Missy falls, and Daisy
text: bolts again and again charges into the woods.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (on the ground)
dialog: Daisy!! Get a hold of yourself!
dialog: Stop this! God damn it!
text: Missy looks at Qualters. Winded, she notices her nose is
dialog: bleeding.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Don’t look at me. I didn’t do
dialog: anything.
text: He starts to head back toward the house.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Fuck this, I’m going to stay with
dialog: the President.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
text: Daisy is running, desperate, crying; she fights her way
text: through the bushes. She slips and falls, struggles and
text: hurries to get up and throws herself, down the hill. Anything
dialog: to get away.
text: She is a mess; twigs, leaves in her hair; she’s cut her leg,
dialog: ripped her dress.
text: She runs recklessly down the hill, tripping, grabbing onto
text: branches to steady herself until she pushes herself out of a
text: bush and literally falls onto a road.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD NEAR TOP COTTAGE. NIGHT.
text: She looks first one way, and then the other down the road --
text: and no more than fifty yards away is her car. Just where she
dialog: left it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD NEAR TOP COTTAGE. NIGHT.
text: She reaches her car, opens the door, gets in, and discovers
text: her keys are gone. In a panic, she starts to look on the
dialog: floor, on the seat when:
speaker_heading: MISSY'S VOICE
dialog: Here.
text: Missy is in the backseat, dried blood on her face from her
text: bloody nose. She shows her the keys.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No. Get out of here.
text: Missy reaches and touches Daisy's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (shaking her off)
dialog: Get out of here--
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Listen to me, Daisy.
text: No one says anything for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: He wants to talk to you.
speaker_heading: DAISY'S
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: I don't want to talk to him!!
text: Daisy sits very still.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: You're being ... silly.
text: They both notice lights and the noise of a car engine coming
text: down the dirt driveway. Daisy doesn’t know what to do; and
text: Missy doesn’t know what Daisy is going to do.
text: As the headlights get closer, Daisy reaches for the door
text: handle, but Missy grabs her arm and holds her.
speaker_heading: MISSY
text: He’s going home. He’s headed home.
dialog: gl.
text: Franklin is being driven by Qualters; the car passes right by
text: Daisy's car, inches away. Franklin in shadow and silhouette
text: is in the backseat; he doesn’t look out. Daisy covers her
dialog: face.
text: As Franklin’s car drives off, Missy lets go of Daisy’s arm.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: You want a cigarette?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I want you to listen to me. And I
dialog: want you to listen very very
dialog: carefully. Understand? Look at me.
dialog: Understand?
text: Daisy looks at her.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What can you say?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I read all your letters, Daisy.
dialog: And his -- to you. He knows this.
dialog: Probably wants this... I read the
dialog: letter where he asks you to live
dialog: with him. I know you are --
dialog: (searches the for the
dialog: word)
dialog: intimate. I've known since the day
dialog: it happened.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Those things he wrote? He meant them.
dialog: I know that. That hurt. Cigarette? I
dialog: need one.
text: She lights a cigarette.
dialog: But I accepted. Like you will.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I am a part of his life, and I accept
dialog: that you are too.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I don't accept you.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: What about Dorothy Schiff? Do you
dialog: accept her?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Why do you think she has built that
dialog: place next to Top Cottage?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: There are other cottages on that hill--
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: He asked her to. He asked her to build
dialog: a cottage, so they could live close
dialog: together when he retired, while he
dialog: wrote those goddamn detective books
dialog: he's always talking about writing.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I don't believe--.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I read the letter.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: This year.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Why don't you leave him?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: For the same reason you won't.
text: Daisy looks out -- into the dawn.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: It wasn’t Eleanor who ‘abandoned’
text: him. She caught him too.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: With you?
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: No. This was -- long ago. Years and
dialog: years ago. Someone else. He
dialog: promised never to see her again.
text: Swore on his knees.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Did he? See her again?
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: She’s been to the White House.
dialog: Maybe you've met her. Mrs.
dialog: Rutherford.
text: Daisy looks back out the window.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I’m sorry that I... I
dialog: misunderstood her.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don't think I can 'share'-
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Oh I think you can. You can.
text: She lights both cigarettes and hands one to Daisy.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Thank you.
text: They smoke in silence. Then: She hands Daisy her car keys.
text: And she opens the car door.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: You decide.
dialog: Pause.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. NIGHT.
text: Franklin alone; a half-played game of solitaire on his desk
text: in front of him. He fiddles with the cards in his hand, his
text: mind elsewhere; he looks at the played cards, begins to scoop
text: them up to start another game.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: A dishevelled Daisy walks down the hallway at Springwood.
text: Franklin’s Mother sits outside of Franklin's study, as if
text: guarding it. She sees Daisy and watches her approach.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (standing)
text: He won't go to bed. He’s waiting for
dialog: you.
text: Daisy goes into the study without knocking.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY. NIGHT.
text: Daisy has sat down.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Would you like a drink?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No.
text: He starts to pour himself one, then decides not to.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Missy and my Mother have both severely
dialog: criticized me for not having invited
dialog: you to the dinner tonight. I want to
dialog: apologize. They both said I should not
dialog: treat you that way. In the future --
dialog: it will be different.
text: She musters all of her strength:
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Yes.
text: Uncomfortable, Franklin picks up his magnifying glass.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I think I showed you these when you
dialog: first came to visit me, Daisy. But
dialog: you probably don't remember.
text: Daisy says nothing. Then:
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I remember.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: From Africa. Aren't they beautiful?
dialog: Can you see from there?
text: Daisy is standing at a distance.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I can.
dialog: 95.
dialog: She can’t.
text: He turns the pages of the stamp album.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: The highest waterfall in the world.
dialog: That's on this stamp.
text: He is pointing out a stamp in his stamp book.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I really don't think you can see from
dialog: way over there, Daisy. I really
dialog: don't. And that -- would be terrible.
dialog: Not to. That, Daisy, I believe would
dialog: be an awful mistake. From which
dialog: neither of us would recover...
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Do you really think that?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Yes, I do. I do.
text: He looks at her. No longer smiling, but beseeching.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: How do you see me?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Am I -- to you -- just stupid?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: No. No, Daisy. But I can understand
dialog: how you can feel that way.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Am I -- like a whore?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (almost laughs)
dialog: No, no you are not ‘like a whore.'
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Am I just 'comfortable' for you?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I don't know what you mean.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Am I -- a pet?
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: It isn't.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Good. Now come and sit next to me.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: No, you're not getting off that easy,
dialog: you son of a bitch!!
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: But that’s not what I said.
dialog: Instead:
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No. I need to go.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Daisy...
text: This stops her at the door.
dialog: She looks
scene_heading: INT. PINK
dialog: Elizabeth
dialog: listening
dialog: Daisy... Mother’s -- quite --
dialog: worried. I told her there was
dialog: nothing to be worried about -- with
dialog: Daisy. That you'd understand. And
dialog: you'd never do anything... or cause
dialog: any... Because you --. We
dialog: understand each other, don’t we,
dialog: Daisy? And you know that
dialog: everything I’ve ever said to you
dialog: was true.
text: at him, then nods and starts to leave the study.
dialog: I’d say I’m sorry -- but that
dialog: wouldn’t do any good right now,

text: He hurries to the window.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Which one is she?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: The one you think looks like a
dialog: governess.
text: From Elizabeth and Bertie’s perspective we see Daisy having
text: just come out of the house, she now heads for her car.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I thought she was the governess. Has
dialog: she stopped crying? Can you tell?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (as they watch)
dialog: By the way, I understand that's a very
dialog: common thing -- men and their
dialog: children's governesses.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Is it? How do you know?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: So I'm told.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She's not the governess. But she's
text: obviously his mistress.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: She dresses like a--.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She's not the governess, Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Men find -- some men find-- I think
dialog: because they're around children,
dialog: there's something quite attractive
dialog: about--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: (as she continues to look
dialog: out the window) )
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (cont'd)
dialog: Why do you keep talking about
dialog: governesses? Is there something
dialog: you want to tell me?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No. Nothing. Why?
text: Daisy is driving away.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well, she’s gone.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Look over there.
text: From Elizabeth and Bertie’s perspective, we see Missy in the
text: distance on a bench.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The secretary?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I hadn’t seen her before. You can just
dialog: make her out now. It's going to be
dialog: light soon. See her?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And she's his mistress too. According
dialog: to Cameron.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We don't need Cameron to--.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Cameron says there's another one.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Another--?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Who's married. But she's built a
dialog: cottage by his? Or something.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Another mistress?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (after another look toward
dialog: Missy)
dialog: Good thing we changed our minds about
dialog: bringing Lilibet with us.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You changed your mind. I never wanted
dialog: to bring Lilibet to America.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Only be-be-because you don't like
dialog: Americans.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I like Americans. That’s not fair.
dialog: I don’t like a lot of Americans. I
dialog: like some.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Are you going to eat a hot dog?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What???
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: At the picnic. Tomorrow. Today. Are
dialog: you? I mean, isn't it like having say

dialog: and mash?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He probably would like--.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: To a guest! If we did that he'd know
dialog: we were trying to tell him something.
dialog: He'd understand.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What would he understand?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How we felt about him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The PM knows how we feel about him. We
text: like him. As if that matters.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (over this)
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I wish I did.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Bertie, I don't think your brother
dialog: would eat a hot dog.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (upset now)
dialog: How would you know that?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Because he'd know what was meant!!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It doesn't mean anything!!!
text: A light knock on the door, which is still open a bit; Cameron

speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: We know.
speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (to Elizabeth)
dialog: But to answer your question,
dialog: Elizabeth, I am going to eat a hot
dialog: dog, no five hot dogs, ten! I'm going
dialog: to shove them into my mouth, stick two
text: up my nostrils, two more in my ears,
dialog: then walk around so people can take
dialog: pictures of the King of England with
dialog: hot dogs hanging out of his orifices!!
text: Elizabeth suddenly looks out the window.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (as they watch)
dialog: Don't ever compare me to my brother
dialog: again.
text: Elizabeth doesn't know what to say. Cameron steps in:
speaker_heading: CAMERON

scene_heading: EXT. GATE-HOUSE. DAY.
text: Franklin, in his bathing suit, at the wheel of his car.

text: He slows door to banter with the reporters:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (driving)
dialog: I made them all agree -- no
dialog: pictures in our bathing suits.
text: (looks down at Bertie’s

dialog: Though you don’t look so bad. Maybe

scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
text: The picnic. Crowds of people milling around -- locals,

text: Daisy has brought her Aunt lemonade and a drink for herself.
text: They are at a table on the periphery.
speaker_heading: AUNT
dialog: What are you drinking?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (hesitates, then)
dialog: It’s a beer, Aunt Sophie. I like
dialog: it.
text: Daisy sits. As she looks off across the crowd, she

text: to light it. The Aunt is amazed.
speaker_heading: AUNT
dialog: When did you start to do that?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Do what?
text: Suddenly some word starts to spread through the crowd, and

scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
text: Bertie has a small movie camera, and he takes a panoramic

text: so as not to obstruct his view. The King gestures for the
text: guests to wave to him. They wave. He films.
text: He finishes the shot; winds the camera; and then with
text: Elizabeth at his side, he sees the grill -- and the cooking
dialog: hot dogs.
text: After a look at Elizabeth, he begins to film the hot dogs.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.

dialog: 107.
text: The Aunt, because of the crowds and the distance, is having a
dialog: hard time seeing.

text: Missy works her way through the crowd.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Mind if I join you?

dialog: I’m so pleased you came.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I promised my Aunt.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.

scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE DAY.
text: With the photographers’ flash bulbs going off behind him, and

speaker_heading: AUNT
dialog: Daisy, please. Where are your

dialog: Let’s sit up with the President.
speaker_heading: QUALTERS
dialog: Just Daisy, ma’am. He just wants

dialog: (to Daisy)
dialog: Please.
text: Daisy looks to Missy. Who nods.
text: The photos are over and there is a big cheer.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
text: Daisy is led to the head table -- nearly everyone is now
text: curious and watching.
text: Franklin and Bertie are laughing together. As Daisy
text: approaches -- there’s that big Franklin smile:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What were you doing way over there,
dialog: Daisy? The special guests are here
dialog: on the porch. You should be here.
text: He turns to the King.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You've met Miss Daisy Suckley,
dialog: haven't you, your Majesty?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’m not sure I’ve had the pleasure.
text: Daisy does a faint curtsey. Bertie and Elizabeth share a

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

text: Eleanor -- understanding -- scoots over to make room for
text: Daisy’s chair.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Daisy, please, sit down.
text: She hesitates. He looks at her.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Please, Daisy.
text: She just stares at him.
text: Daisy looks to Eleanor, then at Franklin.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Would you like some beer?
text: Daisy hesitates, nods. And sits.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Franklin, pour Daisy some beer.
text: Franklin smiles, gives Eleanor a look of ‘thank you’ and
text: pours beer into Daisy’s glass. As the Royals try not to
dialog: watch.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
dialog: A medley of the entertainment:
text: Ish-Ti-Opi, the Indian Baritone sings The Zuni Blanket Wooing
text: Song. The King and Queen are attentive.
text: He sings The Traditional Potato Song. Franklin looks to
text: Daisy, and smiles at her; she attempts to ignore this and
text: him, and watch the Indian performer instead.
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE. DAY.
text: Bertie stands and with his movie camera films Princess Te Ata
text: performing the Indian Corn Ceremony. As he films with one

scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE DAY.

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (Half whisper)
dialog: How much more of this is there?
text: Ish-Ti-Opi finishes to polite applause. He turns to the tom-
text: tom player and begins The Canoe Song. Franklin notices the

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (applauds and shouts out)
dialog: Thank you, Indian Baritone! Thank you
dialog: so much.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (applauding, under her
dialog: breath, across Daisy)
dialog: He wasn't finished.
text: Daisy, still expressionless, looks Eleanor, then to Franklin
dialog: for his response.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh. I thought he was.
text: Then Daisy looks to Eleanor for her response; she is right in
text: the middle of the Husband/Wife spat.
text: The Queen is startled awake by the applause. Elizabeth and
text: Bertie applaud.
dialog: 111.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP COTTAGE DAY.
text: At the head table, Thomas whispers in Franklin's ear, he
text: nods. Franklin leans over and touches Bertie on the arm to
dialog: gets his attention:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Your Majesty...
text: Thomas brings over a platter of hot dogs in buns. He holds
text: the tray out for the King.
text: Word of this spreads fast through the crowd, and suddenly
text: everyone watching this, some people get up and stand so they
dialog: can see better.
text: Missy helps the Aunt get up and watch.
text: Daisy has the best view, right next to Franklin. She watches,
text: though still without showing any enthusiasm.
dialog: Silence.
text: Franklin takes the platter from Thomas and holds it out to
dialog: the King.
dialog: Would you like -- a hot dog?
text: The Queen looks away. Everyone else is looking at the King.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mr. President, I very much would like
text: a hot dog.
text: What he has just said is passed along through the crowd.
text: The King takes a hot dog in his hands.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Do you take mustard?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I take whatever you think I should
dialog: take with my hot dog.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Allow us then to put a bit of
dialog: mustard on for you.
text: Smiling, Franklin nods to Daisy to pick up the mustard pot
text: that is already on the table. Daisy doesn’t know what to do;
text: Eleanor starts to pick it up, but Franklin shakes his head.
dialog: He wants Daisy to do this.
dialog: 112.
text: Eleanor hands Daisy the mustard pot.
text: Suddenly with all eyes watching, a nervous Daisy carefully
text: takes the mustard and holds it out, as if it were a crown.
text: Then Franklin hands her a knife.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Show him how we put it on, Daisy.
text: Daisy nervously takes the knife and gently and very very
text: carefully spreads mustard on the King’s hot dog.
text: Every one in the crowd watches her every move.
text: The Aunt stands now, looking so proud, Missy stands
text: watching at her side, keenly interested.
text: When Daisy has finished putting on the mustard, she carefully
text: sets down the knife.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (to Daisy)
dialog: You are too kind.
text: Daisy is embarrassed by the attention.
text: Then Bertie raises the hot dog to his mouth -- and bites into
text: it. Suddenly the crowd of guests burst into cheers and
text: applause. Bertie is confused.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (over this, to Franklin)
dialog: Why are they applauding? What's
dialog: this about?
text: Franklin is smiling, patting the King on the back; Daisy is
text: caught in the middle of all this cheering. She’s embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: And like that -- we felt America
dialog: and England were back on the road
dialog: to being very good friends. At
dialog: least, I’m told that’s how some
dialog: people took it.
text: A very happy crowd of Americans still applauding.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: It made me wonder -- maybe the hot
dialog: dogs hadn’t been Eleanor’s idea
dialog: after all.
dialog: 129
dialog: 113.
text: Franklin watches Bertie bask in the applause.
speaker_heading: DAISY VO
dialog: When he left for England later that

dialog: in which he wrote that our two
dialog: nations had now ‘forged’ -- and
dialog: these are his words: ‘a special

speaker_heading: DAISY’S VOICE
