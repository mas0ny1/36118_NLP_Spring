text: A plate of BACON & EGGS is set on a BREAKFAST TRAY. Then...a
text: glass of WHITE WINE is poured by WINSTON’s VALET, SAWYERS,
text: and set beside the plate. A glass of SCOTCH and SODA is also
dialog: prepared and set beside these on the tray. For Breakfast?
text: SAWYERS carries the TRAY through servants quarters towards
text: the ENTRANCE HALL of the house, where -—
text: - the TRAY passes by - WINSTON’s PRIVATE SECRETARY, JOHN
text: EVANS (35), as he schools the NEW YOUNG SECRETARY, ELIZABETH
text: LAYTON. Evans, an immaculately-groomed rake, snobbishly
dialog: thinks himself infinitely superior to the Elizabeth Laytons
dialog: of the world.
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
speaker_heading: (to ELIZABETH)
dialog: -..and if he stretches out his hand
dialog: and says, “Gimme”, you need to
dialog: anticipate what he wants - black
dialog: pen, red pen, paper, or “Clop”,
dialog: that’s his hole punch.
text: EVANS and LAYTON walk past -
text: - SAWYERS-with-TRAY, as he waits for the COOK to iron a

text: “CHAMBERLAIN TO RESIGN”
speaker_heading: SAWYERS
dialog: Don’t smudge the ink.
speaker_heading: MAID

speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: D’you think they’11l take me to

speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS

dialog: impossible to catch everything.
dialog: And be prepared to type fast -
dialog: short bursts - and double-spaced,

dialog: Good luck.
text: EVANS knocks on the door, opens it and then pushes the now-
text: quaking ELIZABETH LAYTON inside, closing the door again.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM/ CHARTWELL - DAY
text: Her POV of the dimly-lit room. And then, a MATCH is struck, a
text: CIGAR lit. We can just make out a MAN in bed, as -—
text: SAWYERS tugs open the CURTAINS, revealing -
scene_heading: - WINSTON CHURCHILL (65), in BED, with the BREAKFAST TRAY on
text: his lap, in a pink silk dressing-gown (naked beneath). His
text: dispatch box, piled high with telegrams, stands open by his
text: bed . His marmalade cat, TANGO, sits at the end of the bed,
text: as WINSTON reads a dispatch and dictates...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: To the French Ambassador. Come on -—
text: WINSTON looks up at ELIZABETH, to see if she is writing this
dialog: down. She’s not -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: - telegram!
text: ELIZABETH realises, to her horror, that the dictation has
text: already begun, and she hurries to the TYPE-WRITER, which has
text: already been loaded with a sheet...She begins to type FAST,
dialog: in short bursts -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: (dictating)
dialog: With German forces crossing into
dialog: Holland...Holland alone...request
dialog: reassurance...that French forces
dialog: will now move--move at once--to

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: “To--to the French Ambassador.
dialog: With German forces crossing
dialog: into Holland...Holland alone...
dialog: request reassurance that -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: - immediate reassurance -
text: ELIZABETH adjusts the typewriter’s carriage and paten and
text: types the word “IMMEDIATE” above the previous text...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: “— immediate - reassurance - “
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: “ — that -" Go on - “- that ”
text: SAWYERS enters, as ELIZABETH struggles to re-set the

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

text: The BEDROOM TELEPHONE rings -—-
speaker_heading: SAWYERS
dialog: French Ambassador sir -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Monsieur Ambassador!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Ah. They’ve already invaded
dialog: Belgium.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I will convey your plea to the
dialog: Prime Minister at once. Yes, the
text: situation is still very confused.
dialog: Goodbye.

speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Holland and Belgium.
text: ELIZABETH types this - tap,tap,tap,tap -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: No, no, no.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Scrap that. New telegram.
dialog: 7.
text: In a fluster, she pulls out the old PAGE from the TYPEWRITER
text: CARRIAGE and quickly inserts a new page, as -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: To General Ismay...
text: WINSTON grabs his WHISKEY and SODA, as - the PHONE rings
text: again. SAWYERS re-appears.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit Sawyers! What is it now?!
speaker_heading: SAWYERS
dialog: Your son.
text: WINSTON, his concentration broken, goes to the PHONE.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (into Phone)
dialog: Randolph, quickly -
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Last night they said I may be made
dialog: Prime Minister today. But that was
dialog: yesterday. Let’s see what Neville
dialog: does today. Thank--thank you my
dialog: boy. Keep buggering on!
text: Puts down the phone. Turns to look at ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Now...
text: Sips his SCOTCH. This calms him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH LAYTON
dialog: General Ismay...
text: Moving to the end of the bed -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Ah, General Ismay.
dialog: (to Sawyers)
dialog: Sawyers - get rid of this will you?
text: Winston gestures to Sawyers to move his tray away and then
text: swings his legs - indecorously! - out of bed. ELIZABETH
text: quickly turns her face away! WINSTON then begins to pace -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: In the light of today’s events, the
dialog: time is ripe for many preparations
dialog: to be made...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you striking those typewriter
dialog: keys in a normal fashion? It’s
dialog: awfully loud, I can’t think!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Read it back.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Ahh--To General Ismay. In the light
dialog: of today’s events, the time is
dialog: right for many prep -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: RIPE! Not RIGHT! God's teeth girl!
dialog: I said ripe, ripe, ripe - P-P-P!
dialog: The last sentence...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH LAYTON
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: The--the time is ripe...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: For! FOR!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH LAYTON
dialog: (her nerve broken)
dialog: ..-Many...Many...many...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: How many “many”s did you write?!
dialog: One many!
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: “For...for MANY preparations-—-
dialog: to be made...”
text: He walks up to her and looks over her chair, and is horrified
dialog: to see -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Single-spaced? What are you doing?!
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Someone set it on single-spaced
dialog: and before I realised -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Then why did you persist?!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I-
text: As she starts to rush out -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Tell Evans to send me someone who
dialog: can do it right the first time!
scene_heading: RIGHT! T-T-T-T!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/ CHARTWELL - DAY
text: ELIZABETH comes down the stairs, and stops, her face tear-
dialog: stained.
scene_heading: CLEMENTINE CHURCHILL - WINSTON’s WIFE, 55 YEARS OLD -
text: beautiful, elegant, highly-strung, is at that moment crossing
text: the hall, with a HANDFUL of BROWN ENVELOPES. She sees
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Ah. He shouted at you. Did he shout
dialog: at you?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes, but I....
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: He can be an awful brute.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No! I made too many mistakes.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: I think you were nervous. And he
dialog: has a knack for drawing out the
dialog: very worst in those trying to
dialog: help him the most.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh it’s not him. It’s me. He’s -
dialog: he’s -
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: He’s just a man, like any other.
dialog: Wait here.
text: CLEMMIE climbs the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM/ CHARTWELL - DAY
text: CLEMMIE enters - WINSTON (on his knees) is looking for Tango
text: the cat under his bed.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: My Darling?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: The War Cabinet has been called.
text: The bloody cat is under the bed
dialog: again.
text: CLEMMIE indicates that SAWYERS should go and moves around
text: WINSTON tucking his shirt in.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Can I tell you something that I
dialog: feel you ought to know?
text: He looks at her -
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve noticed a recent deterioration
dialog: in your manner. You're not so kind
dialog: as you used to be. You’ve become
text: rough, sarcastic, over-bearing and
dialog: rude.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Is this about the new girl?
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: If the King asks you to become
dialog: Prime Minister -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: We don’t know that -
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: I don’t want you to be disliked.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: More than I already am?
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Darling, you may be on the brink,
dialog: the brink--of having tremendous
text: power, surpassed only by the King.
dialog: With such power you really must try
dialog: to be more kind and, if possible,
dialog: calm. I want others to love and
dialog: respect you as I do.
text: Clemmie falls back in the bed, shortly joined by Winston-
text: they share a moment of fondness.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARTWELL - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT of Chartwell bathed in sunshine. ELIZABETH LAYTON,
text: with hat and coat now on, is attempting to make a discreet
text: escape from the house but is stopped by a MOTORCYCLE COURIER
text: with a telegram to deliver. We do not hear what is said.
text: CLOSE-UP on the telegram turning in ELIZABETH’S hands as the
text: COURIER rides away. ELIZABETH looks back to the house, makes
text: her decision and re-enters the lair.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS / CHARTWELL - DAY
text: ELIZABETH climbs the stairs holding a telegram, braced to
text: once more enter the Lion’s Den. She enters -
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM/ CHARTWELL - DAY
text: - and finds WINSTON, CLEMMIE, JOHN EVANS, SAWYERS and a MAID -
text: all listening with rapt attention to a RADIO BROADCAST.
speaker_heading: BBC RADIO ANNOUNCER

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It's from the Palace.
text: All eyes turn to look at her, as if an elephant has entered

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Thank you, Miss...?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Layton.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY/HALLWAY, CHARTWELL - DAY
text: CLEMMIE hands WINSTON his watch, glasses, cigar case, matches

speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: You’re shaking.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: So are you!
dialog: It’s true CLEMMIE is just as nervous -
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: You from excitement--I from terror.
dialog: You have been wanting this your
dialog: entire adult life.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: No--since the nursery.
text: CLEMMIE laughs.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: But do the public want me?
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: It’s your own Party to whom you’1l
dialog: have to prove yourself.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I’m getting the job only because
text: the ship is sinking. It’s not a
dialog: gift, it’s revenge.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Let them see your true qualities.
dialog: Your courage...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: ---My poor judgement.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: .-.-Your lack of vanity.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: ...-My iron will.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Be?
text: She touches his face tenderly -
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Yourself.
speaker_heading: WINSTON

text: with plume, aviator helmet with goggles, riding hat, pith
dialog: helmet, French WWl helmet, fez, Homburg, top hat, etc ) all
text: on display like HUNTING TROPHIES.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Which self should I be today?
text: WINSTON surveys the collection, then plucks the TOP HAT from
dialog: its hook -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: One should have had power when a
dialog: young man. When wits were sharp,
dialog: sinews strong. Oh well.
text: He returns to her -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Lead on Macduff--
dialog: When youth departs--
dialog: may wisdom prove enough.
text: They kiss, and she gives him a silver BOX OF MATCHES,
text: embossed with loving message from his children.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. PRINCES STREET/ WINSTON’S CAR - DAY
text: WINSTON, in the back seat, (with JOHN EVANS in front) looks
text: out the window at the human traffic - seems like he’s ina
text: gold-fish bowl, disconnected. He watches as - MEN IN BOWLER
text: HATS and YOUNG WOMEN in SUMMER DRESSES walk to work.
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
dialog: Hardly seems like there’s a war
dialog: on at all.
text: THREE DELIVERY BOYS ride by on bicycles, notice him and wave
dialog: excitedly.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: How odd it is.
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
dialog: Sir?
text: They stop, waiting behind a BUS.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: You know--I have never ridden a
dialog: bus. Never queued for bread. I
dialog: believe I can boil an egg but only
dialog: because I saw it done once.
scene_heading: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
text: WINSTON’s car approaches the Palace gates, which are open.
text: The CAR drives up to the PALACE. WINSTON gets out and he and

scene_heading: INT. PALACE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: A grand hall.
text: Winston removing his hat and coat, hands his cane and gloves,
text: then hat to a LIVERIED DOORMAN whilst a LIVERIED STAFF MEMBER
text: waits nearby.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: The only time I tried to ride the
dialog: Underground was during the General
dialog: Strike. Clemmie dropped me at South
dialog: Kensington station. I went down--
dialog: but I got lost and came straight
dialog: back up. Awful!
dialog: (girding himself)

speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: I wanted Halifax. The Lords wanted
dialog: Halifax. Halifax wanted Halifax.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Then--then why have I been forced
dialog: to send for Churchill?
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Because he’s the only member of our
dialog: party who has the support of the
dialog: Opposition.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: His record is a litany of
dialog: catastrophe. Gallipoli, 25,000
dialog: dead. The India Policy. Russian

text: kisses it. WINSTON rises.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI (CONT'D)
dialog: That was--quite easy.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Yes.
text: They stare at each other in uneasy silence.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: EDEN
dialog: I only wish the position had come

speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: My darling husband--Something you
dialog: all might not know is that on the

text: LAUGHTER. WINSTON smiles.
speaker_heading: RANDOLPH
dialog: Hear hear.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Lucky for Daddy.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: But the real reason for my wintry
dialog: feet was because I knew, even then,
dialog: that his priority would be public
dialog: life. It worried a young girl
dialog: greatly--this wretched thought of
text: coming second, eternally. But so it
dialog: has proven to be. And in due course
dialog: (Mary takes Winstons hand)
dialog: our children would also have to
dialog: make their own peace with this same
dialog: fact.
dialog: (directly to Winston)
dialog: We all did, you see, in our own

speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: Right. (beat) As of 2200 hours last

dialog: divisions. On our part all our

dialog: We must counter-attack. Anyone?

dialog: Fifty miles! Good God!
speaker_heading: GREENWOOD
dialog: For a German tank, two days.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: They must not reach the sea! Not

text: Everyone looks at ISMAY.
speaker_heading: ISMAY
dialog: As it stands--I cannot see that

dialog: of our forces out in time.
text: A gasp in the cabinet. WINSTON takes this news badly.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Not a man? We cannot be so totally

speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: General. What is our next step?
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: I’m not sure, sir, that we have one.

dialog: Well why didn’t you say so?! How
dialog: Many men do we have there?
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
text: 4,000. More or less.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Then have them go east--engage with
text: the German columns moving on
dialog: Dunkirk. Buy us some time. Draw the
text: Nazi focus away from Dunkirk whilst
dialog: we execute a maritime evacuation of
dialog: our forces. Ironside--is that
dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: It would mean a huge sacrifice.
speaker_heading: ATTLEE
dialog: Four thousand young men!

dialog: Prime Minister! I have

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Who is free of reservations?
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: -..-about such a fateful course when
dialog: we have the option of a peace offer.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: What peace offer?!
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: The Italians have offered to
dialog: mediate between ourselves and
dialog: Germany. And I indicated that
dialog: provided our liberty and
dialog: independence were assured, we would
dialog: consider any proposal.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
text: With Hitler holding the whip hand
dialog: do you really think he would honour
dialog: our liberty and independence?
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: It would be in his interest to do
dialog: so. He -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: The only thing to do is to show
dialog: that maniac that he cannot conquer
dialog: this country, and for that we need
dialog: an army. General, tell Brigadier
dialog: Nicholson, “The Germans must not
dialog: reach the sea! Not before we get
dialog: our boys off that bloody beach!"
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I take full responsibility.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (temper exploding)
dialog: REALLY! YES! It is the reason I sit

speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Surely--before we send 4,000 men to

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: What is this?!
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX

dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you will not permit any talk

text: CHAMBERLAIN steps in, to stop Halifax from resigning.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Might we not allow Edward simply to

dialog: Bastianini--discuss their possible
dialog: role as mediators between us and
dialog: Germany, and find out their price?
text: WINSTON is calmed by CHAMBERLAIN’s manner -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Bastianini? Ha! A man about whom
dialog: we might say there is less to him
text: than meets the eye.
text: WINSTON looks at HALIFAX, and sighs -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: I remain opposed to any
dialog: negotiations -
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: - of course -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: - which might lead to a derogation
dialog: of our rights and power.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: AS DO WE ALL! There is no question

dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Winston?
text: With nowhere left to turn - WINSTON gives a slow inclination

speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Good. Thank you.

text: CLOSE ON: The door’s lock, which slides from “VACANT” to
text: “ENGAGED”.
scene_heading: INT. TRANS-ATLANTIC TELEPHONE ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
text: Inside, it’s no LAVATORY. It is actually - a secret PRIVATE
text: TELEPHONE SYSTEM, linking WINSTON with the ROOSEVELT WHITE
speaker_heading: HOUSE.
text: WINSTON, seated, holding the receiver, takes a few moments
text: before he lifts the phone to his ear -—
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Mr President?
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: Winston!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: How are you Franklin?
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: Fine. Fine. How are you Prime
dialog: Minister?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I am phoning about--about your Navy
dialog: ships. If you were to loan us just
dialog: 50 of your older Destroyers I feel
dialog: sure —
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: Ah! Yes!
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: WINSTON ROOSEVELT (CONT'D)
dialog: - even 40 would - Well I -
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
dialog: - I did ask around, but just not
dialog: possible I’m afraid. The Neutrality
dialog: Act we signed last year has tied my
dialog: hands. Just can’t swing it. I
dialog: tried.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Then--can I--do I have your
dialog: permission to send an aircraft
dialog: carrier to pick up the P-40 fighter
dialog: planes we purchased? Mr President.
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: (wincing, hating not being
dialog: able to help)
dialog: You got me there again. New law--
dialog: preventing trans-shipment of
dialog: military equipment.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: But we’ve paid for them--with the
dialog: money we borrowed from you!
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: So sorry, Winston.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I need not impress upon you the
dialog: trouble faced by the Western
dialog: Hemisphere. Without your support,
dialog: in some fashion...
text: Silence. A tense moment...
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: I know. I know. You are on my
dialog: mind day and night.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Look. We could--possibly...
text: But words fail the hampered ROOSEVELT and his voice trails
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Mr President--we are facing the
dialog: gravest odds!
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: .-.-we could take your planes to
dialog: about a mile from the Canadian
dialog: border--and then if you send across
dialog: a team of horses from Canada--
dialog: nothing motorized--then you could
dialog: pull ‘em over the border yourself.
dialog: How does that sound?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Horses? You said “a team of
dialog: horses"?
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: I guess you could push ‘em
dialog: yourself. The damn things have
dialog: wheels. Up to you.
text: WINSTON is speechless -
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
dialog: We could do that.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Prime Minister?
dialog: 
text: WINSTON covers the PHONE, bunches his fist, swallows his
text: RAGE, and then speaks again, as calmly as he can-
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Anything you can do at this time
dialog: would be welcome.
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: Goodnight to you Winston.
dialog: (feeling WINSTON's pain)
dialog: It must be late there?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: In more ways than you could
dialog: possibly know.
text: He puts down the phone and sits back in his chair - stunned,

dialog: idea, a new IDEA!
scene_heading: INT. MAP ROOM / WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
text: WINSTON enters and strides past the staff, making for the
text: LARGE MAP of EUROPE. He puts his finger on the FRENCH COAST,

text: He turns, sees the DOZEN colorful TELEPHONES and addresses a

scene_heading: INT. MAP ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
text: WINSTON, on a PHONE, studies the COAST of ENGLAND.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Exodus?

dialog: with one cruiser and six
dialog: destroyers, and with the Luftwaffe
dialog: controlling the skies above, we'll
dialog: be lucky to get 10% out. I want you

speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Boats?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Yes. Civilian boats, as many as

speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: (sceptical)
dialog: Rrrr-ight.
speaker_heading: WINSTON

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Help me stage this thing, Bertie.

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Oh-- Bertie--still there?
speaker_heading: RAMSAY

speaker_heading: WINSTON

scene_heading: CAPTION: SUNDAY, MAY 26 1940
text: WINSTON walks with EDEN, but then they pass an OFFICER’s

text: his fury, the sound of a RADIO playing a SPEECH BY HITLER!
text: WINSTON PULLS THE DOOR SHUT, silencing the dictator.
dialog: 58.
text: WINSTON and EDEN look at each other, then walk on, and stop
text: before entering the WAR CABINET ROOM, (as if before taking
text: the stage). WINSTON takes a deep breath and tries to shake
text: off his worries. Only then does he enter, followed by EDEN -
scene_heading: INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
text: WAR CABINET MEETING 2.
scene_heading: PRESENT: 17 PERSONS. The Main War Cabinet (CHURCHILL,
scene_heading: CHAMBERLAIN, HALIFAX, GREENWOOD, ATLEE) and the FOLLOWING
scene_heading: (EDEN, ALEXANDER, SINCLAIR, CADOGAN, ANDERSON, POUND,
scene_heading: DOWDING, IRONSIDE, BRIDGES, ISMAY, NICHOLL, WILKINSON)
text: A tense atmosphere - faces riven with doubt. The CABINET is
text: standing, conferring anxiously with each other...... but then
text: fall silent when WINSTON and ANTHONY EDEN enter.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Good day. I’ve asked the Minister
dialog: for War to join us.
text: HALIFAX and CHAMBERLAIN share a look - this doesn’t bode
dialog: well.
text: All sit. WINSTON looks around the table - sees the fear and
text: doubt and nervousness in his CABINET right away.
text: WINSTON starts to tap his SIGNET RING on his right hand on
text: the wooden arm of his chair, until -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Obviously--we are in a dangerous
dialog: situation. But - I am assured by
dialog: the French Premiere that while some
text: German tank units have reached the
dialog: sea, the situation generally seems
dialog: to be well in hand.
dialog: No-one looks at all convinced by this -
text: CLOSE ON: the wooden arm of WINSTON’s chair - the varnish has
text: worn away from three weeks of such anxious tapping.
speaker_heading: GREENWOOD
dialog: Prime Minister. You don’t believe
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ATTLEE
dialog: France will fall.
speaker_heading: GREENWOOD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ATTLEE
dialog: And invasion of this island will
dialog: follow.
dialog: 59.
dialog: WINSTON changes the subject -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: What news from Calais?
speaker_heading: ATTLEE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: The Garrison attacked, but was
text: forced back and is now surrounded
dialog: on all sides. They are being
text: shelled and bombed mercilessly.
text: Casualties are at sixty percent.
text: The CABINET all shake their heads - all look to have lost
text: FAITH in WINSTON.
text: CHAMBERLAIN nods at HALIFAX -
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: On the question of peace talks -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: - We must hold our nerve. Signal
dialog: only that we are going to fight
text: it out to the end. A peace offer
dialog: telegraphs our weakness.
text: CHURCHILL looks to EDEN for support -
speaker_heading: EDEN
dialog: Agreed.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: And even if we were beaten--we
dialog: should be no worse off than we
dialog: should be if we were now to
dialog: abandon the struggle.
dialog: Let us therefore avoid being
text: dragged down the slippery slope
text: with talk of a negotiated peace.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Slippery slope? The only -
speaker_heading: WINSTON HALIFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: -I suspect Germany and Italy - -the only slippery slope -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: -want to get us so deeply involved
dialog: in negotiations that we should be
dialog: unable to turn back!
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Oh nonsense! Bastianini informed me-
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: The approach -
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: - The only slippery slope -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: WILL YOU STOP INTERRUPTING ME
dialog: WHILE I AM INTERRUPTING YOU!?
dialog: When I chose my War Cabinet I took
dialog: great care to surround myself with
dialog: old rivals. I may have overdone it.
text: Only GREENWOOD and ATTLEE and EDEN smile. HALIFAX and
text: CHAMBERLAIN look exasperated.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Viscount Halifax--the approach you
dialog: proposed is not only futile, but
dialog: involves us in a deadly danger.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
text: THE DEADLY DANGER HERE IS THIS
text: ROMANTIC FANTASY OF FIGHTING TO THE
dialog: END!!! What is “the end” if not
dialog: the destruction of all?
dialog: There is nothing heroic in going
dialog: down fighting if it can be avoided.
dialog: Nothing even remotely patriotic in
dialog: death or glory if the odds are on
dialog: the former; nothing inglorious in
dialog: trying to shorten a war that we are
text: clearly losing.
dialog: WINSTON cannot bear this talk -
speaker_heading: WINSTON HALIFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Europe is still - Europe is lost!
speaker_heading: HALIFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: And before our forces are wiped out
dialog: completely this is the time to
dialog: negotiate, in order to obtain the
dialog: best conditions possible. It would
dialog: not be in Hitler’s interests to
dialog: insist on outrageous terms. He will
dialog: know his own weaknesses. He will be
dialog: reasonable.
dialog: WINSTON cannot bear this talk -
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: When will the lesson be learned?
dialog: How many more dictators must be
dialog: wooed, appeased--Good God, given
dialog: immense privileges, before we
dialog: learn!--that you can’t reason
dialog: with a tiger when your head is in
dialog: its mouth!
text: WINSTON rises and walks out. HALIFAX, escaping CHAMBERLAIN’s

dialog: -ploration - - theoretical?! -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: - of what price Italy would ask. No
dialog: more. I did not sanction-
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: If you will not allow any further
dialog: exploration of a peace agreement,
dialog: then--you will have my resignation.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Don’t be absurd. I need you
dialog: Edward. You know I do!
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: I will not stand by to watch
dialog: another generation of young men die
dialog: at the bloody altar of your hubris!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: And you would have us die as lambs!
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Was Gallipoli not enough for you?!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: How dare you?! Our troops were
dialog: chewing barbed wire in Flanders! I
dialog: saw it! Opening a second front,
dialog: outflanking the Turks, was a
dialog: serious military idea - and it
dialog: could've damn-well worked if - the
dialog: Admirals and First Sea Lord hadn’‘t
dialog: dithered away our element of
dialog: surprise!
text: Silence. WINSTON realises he’s gone too far. Totally lost his
text: poise. He calms himself. But too late. HALIFAX, undaunted,
text: fixes WINSTON with a cold judicial eye -
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: The choice is yours. You have 24
dialog: hours to enter into peace talks, or
dialog: I resign.

speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: I told him. It shook him.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Imagine it did.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Gave him 24 hours--I don’t expect
dialog: him to agree, so I will resign
dialog: first. You then join me. That’s
dialog: critical if we are to trigger a
dialog: revolt in the chamber. I’1l
dialog: announce it. The King will back us.
text: HALIFAX nods. CHAMBERLAIN now mentors him, paternally -
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Be sure of your motives, Edward.
dialog: Country first! Country First
dialog: always. Career third, fourth--

dialog: and I--to Canada. I wish to know
dialog: the opinion of our prime minister.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: My opinion? My opinion would be
dialog: that you must do what you feel is
dialog: right for yourself, your family,
dialog: and for the country. Your survival
dialog: is paramount. Prime Ministers--we
text: seem to come and go at an
dialog: astonishing rate.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Your--p-position in parliament,
dialog: I hear, is not strong.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: My party resents how Chamberlain
dialog: was pushed aside. And many others
dialog: doubt me. I was not a popular
dialog: choice.
text: The KING nods - he himself resented WINSTON - and he turns
text: away briefly, in embarrassment.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: They want Halifax still. But why
dialog: get rid of the organ grinder and
text: replace him with the monkey.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Lord Halifax is a close personal
dialog: friend of mine!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I am unwanted. I’ve never been
dialog: trusted since the Gallipoli
dialog: campaign. Unwanted.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Perhaps--it is because--you scare
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Who?!
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: You scare me.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (scarily)
dialog: What?! What nonsense!
dialog: What could be scary about me?
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: One never knows what is going to
dialog: come out of your mouth next.
dialog: Something that w-will flatter--
dialog: or wound.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: My emotions are unbridled.
text: WINSTON drops some meat into the mouth of a CORGIE waiting at
text: WINSTON’s feet for food.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: A wildness. In the blood. I share
dialog: it with my father.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mother also. We lack the gift of--
dialog: temperance.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Were you close--to your parents?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: My mother was glamorous--but
dialog: perhaps too widely loved.
text: This draws an eye-brow rise from the King.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: My father--to me was like God--
text: busy elsewhere.
text: The KING smiles. He cannot help but like this man.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
text: WINSTON walks through the MEN and WOMEN en route to his OFFICE.
text: He stops before ELIZABETH LAYTON - looks into her eyes. She can
text: see the DOUBT, the SADNESS, the PAIN.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Miss Layton.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH LAYTON
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Reach--I need to reach--speak to...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH LAYTON
dialog: To?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: 3pm.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH LAYTON
dialog: 3pm, sir?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Ask Bridges to summon the--the uh--
dialog: the War Cabinet for 3pm. Thank you.
text: She watches him walk away -
text: - only for WINSTON to be stopped by JOHN EVANS with a
speaker_heading: COMMUNIQUE.
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
dialog: Sir!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
dialog: Sir-from Lord Gort, in France.
dialog: 71.
text: WINSTON reads the message -- his EYES WIDEN.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Belgium has fallen. They will
dialog: surrender at midnight. France
dialog: will soon follow suit.
scene_heading: REACTION WINSTON: Shock.
scene_heading: INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
text: WAR CABINET MEETING 3.
scene_heading: PRESENT: 9 PERSONS. The Main War Cabinet (CHURCHILL,
scene_heading: CHAMBERLAIN, HALIFAX, GREENWOOD, ATLEE) and the FOLLOWING
scene_heading: (EDEN, CADOGAN, IRONSIDE, BRIDGES. )
text: A FILM REEL is projected onto a SCREEN. We see images of
text: GERMAN SPEEDBOATS. We see the NAZI leadership, holding maps,
text: pointing out to sea toward Britain...We see a giant LONG-
text: RANGE SUPER CANNON being revealed by GERMAN soldiers. Over
dialog: this, we hear -
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: We have received reports that the
dialog: most probable method of attack,
dialog: which Germany might employ against
dialog: this country, is a large fleet of
dialog: fast motor boats, possibly up to
text: 200, carrying 100 men apiece to
text: carry out a seaborne raid on a
dialog: large scale. By this means a
dialog: considerable force of the enemy
dialog: could be landed at many points on
dialog: the coast simultaneously with air-
dialog: borne raids inland. We do not feel
dialog: that by naval or air action we
dialog: could prevent such a landing.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Could you repeat that?
text: HALIFAX turns to look hard at WINSTON.
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: We must prepare for the imminent
dialog: invasion of our island.
text: The shock registers on all the faces. Hold on ANTHONY EDEN, as
text: he lowers his HEAD.
text: BRIDGES opens a BOTTLE of WHISKEY and starts to pour into
dialog: tumblers for the non-military personnel.
text: Silence, as IRONSIDE sits.
dialog: 72.
text: Silence. Lost looks. General state of high anxiety. They look
text: to WINSTON for leadership - and he appears to be about to say
text: something in response to this black news - BUT NO WORDS COME.
text: After this awkward silence - HALIFAX looks directly at
speaker_heading: WINSTON —
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Let the record state--that I have
dialog: received word from the Italian
dialog: Embassy in London that Italy is
dialog: prepared to mediate a resolution
dialog: between Britain, its Allies, and
dialog: Germany.
text: The CABINET SECRETARY, records this statement for history.
text: WINSTON fumes that this has been put on the record and stares
text: with anger at HALIFAX.
text: WINSTON has been totally put on the spot!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (sunk by the news)
dialog: Perhaps--then--
text: The CABINET waits on the final INEVITABLE words -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: --the time for such an offer from
dialog: us is -
text: HALIFAX nods at CHAMBERLAIN - success, surely! But WINSTON still
dialog: can’t speak the words they ache to hear.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: - is when Germany has made an
dialog: unsuccessful attempt to invade this
dialog: country.
text: HALIFAX throws his GLASSES on the table in DISBELIEF!
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Unsuccessful?!
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Then you leave me no other option -
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: Winston--you are refusing to grasp
dialog: the realities of how precarious our
dialog: position is! Our entire army is
dialog: about to be wiped out! Terms!
dialog: Must! Be struck!
text: Silence. WINSTON has no room left in which to move. ALL FACES
dialog: examine his.
dialog: 73.
text: WINSTON looks finally to ANTHONY EDEN - his staunchest
dialog: supporter.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Anthony?
text: EDEN’s face is pained - as he retains a MEANINGFUL SILENCE.
text: CHURCHILL looks to each MAN around the room, and their faces
text: proclaim their support of HALIFAX’s view.
scene_heading: UTTERLY ISOLATED - WINSTON has no choice now.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Then...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Then it seems...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ...we have no choice but to at least
dialog: consider the path of negotiation.
text: CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX share an astonished look!
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: If Hitler’s peace terms are--
dialog: overlordship of Central Europe and
dialog: return of certain German colonies -
dialog: (pause)
dialog: - and if he will leave us our
dialog: independence, then - then I would
dialog: be thankful to get out of our
dialog: present difficulties. It’s quite
dialog: unlikely that he will make any such
dialog: offer, but...
text: WINSTON looks at the CABINET SECRETARY who records for
dialog: posterity his every word -—
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: ...if I were told what the German
dialog: terms were, then--I would be--
dialog: prepared---to--to consider them.
text: The SECRETARY notes down this historic concession, and
text: WINSTON observes this.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: Thank you. Prime Minister.
text: CHAMBERLAIN nods at HALIFAX. They have prevailed.
speaker_heading: HALIFAX (CONT'D)
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: I shall prepare a draft memorandum
dialog: at once.
text: Finally, WINSTON nods. CHAMBERLAIN and HALIFAX look at each
dialog: other again - victory!
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: EXT. TREASURY DRUM - DAY
text: HIGH WIDE-SHOT as WINSTON walks through the TREASURY DRUM
text: toward DOWNING STREET.
text: MILES ALDRIDGE, a lone photographer calls out -
speaker_heading: MILES ALDRIDGE
dialog: Mr. Churchill! One picture, one
dialog: picture, come on sir, one picture!
dialog: How about a smile, Prime Minister?
text: WINSTON steps toward him, and then DELIBERATELY gives the
scene_heading: RUDE VERSION of the V-FOR-VICTORY sign (PALM-INWARD). Winston
text: walks on.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM/ TREASURY - DAY
text: CHAMBERLAIN, alone, steadies himself against a wall - his
text: health is fading. He takes out his bottle of MORPHINE and
dialog: drinks.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT
text: KING GEORGE walks out on to a BALCONY and looks down the MALL
text: in BLACKOUT, as his EQUERRY joins him...
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: I was--ju--just imagining never
dialog: standing--here again. Perhaps
dialog: because I am no longer alive, or--
dialog: or because the palace itself-- is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: EQUERRY
dialog: Canada. You must decide, sir. You
dialog: could rule in exile.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Truly? Is that my fate?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know what? I feel angry. In
dialog: this moment I’m aware of feeling--
dialog: bloody angry.
text: The EQUERRY studies him, as he studies the MALL.
scene_heading: INT. ELIZABETH'’S “SHOE-BOX” ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - NIGHT
text: ELIZABETH LAYTON waits, her fingers at the ready. She sneaks
text: a glance at the CLOCK on her DESK - it is 1.30!
text: WINSTON is in a BLACK MOOD. He struggles to DICTATE a
text: SPEECH...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I have...come to...to
dialog: wonder...in... recent
dialog: days...whether it was...my duty...
text: ECU of: the TYPEWRITER hammers typing “duty” -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: - to consider...
text: EVANS enters, carrying a TRAY holding a glass and a bottle.
text: Elizabeth yawns.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: ...consider...entering...
text: EVANS is standing there staring at WINSTON, waiting to knock
text: off for the night. WINSTON notices -
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
dialog: Will that be all for tonight, sir?
text: WINSTON ignores him.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: -..entering into negotiations
dialog: with...
dialog: (unable to speak the
dialog: dreaded name)
dialog: .-.-that...corporal...no...
text: EVANS departs without an answer, as - WINSTON pours himself a
text: SCOTCH and mumbles to himself -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: ---gangster--no--tyrant...
dialog: ..-monster of wickedness, no...
text: WINSTON, wanting more inspiration, turns over a NEWSPAPER and
text: on the COVER is - a LARGE PHOTO of ADOLPH HITLER. WINSTON
text: looks at HITLER'S FACE with LOATHING -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: ..-butcher--no good--monstrous
dialog: savage?--bloodthirsty guttersnipe!--
dialog: housepainter...
dialog: (throws newspaper on the
dialog: ground)
speaker_heading: HOUSEPAINTER!
dialog: (his head clears)
dialog: Where were we? Where - ?
dialog: 
text: WINSTON, hearing no sound of typing, turns - and sees
text: ELIZABETH LAYTON staring at her TYPEWRITER, frozen -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Well?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I didn’t understand you, sir.
text: He doesn’t reply. She finally adds -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You were —
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Were?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You were - mumbling.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Mumbling.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes sir.
text: WINSTON, crosses to the other side of her and sits down -he
text: picks up a FRAMED PHOTO of A HANDSOME YOUNG SOLDIER from her
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Your beau?
text: ELIZABETH maintains her composure with true grit during the
dialog: following exchange -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My brother.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: He was falling back on Dunkirk but
dialog: he never made it.
text: This rocks WINSTON to the core. He studies ELIZABETH, stirred
text: by the beauty of her sad face.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: His eyes moisten - at all she represents, innocence and loss
dialog: and courage and purity.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I’m just looking at you.
text: She turns back to her TYPE-WRITER and sits there waiting,
text: until - feeling awkward - she offers -—
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Shall I read back what we have?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: “I have come to wonder in recent
dialog: days whether it was my duty to
dialog: consider entering into negotiations-—
dialog: -with...”
text: WINSTON ponders his next line - but again, NO WORDS COME.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: With...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF TOP/ DEFENCE MINISTRY - NIGHT
text: WINSTON emerges on to the ROOFTOP of the building, and
text: proceeds to LIGHT UP a CIGAR as he takes in the CLEAR NIGHT
text: SKY above him.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (0.S.)
dialog: -.-with...
text: He then hears a DRONE... it is a SINGLE SPITFIRE on NIGHT
text: PATROL. It comes into view, slowly crossing the sky.
text: WINSTON watches this GHOSTLY SIGHT come and go. The little
text: plane looks very small in such a big expanse of sky...
text: His eyes are WET with TEARS, as he ANGRILY GRINDS OUT his
speaker_heading: CIGAR.
text: The CAMERA rises up - up - into an AERIAL SHOT of -
text: - WINSTON on the ROOF until - WINSTON is no bigger than a TOY
scene_heading: LEAD SOLDIER.
scene_heading: INT. SPARE ROOM/ 10 DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
text: CLEMMIE enters and sees - WINSTON, sitting on a large boat-
text: shaped bed in the dark staring into space, amid UNPACKED
text: BOXES. He’s at a very low ebb.
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Darling, Winston, Darling?
text: No answer. She goes to him. He’s clearly in trouble -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Shhh. Shhh. You’ve the full weight
dialog: of the world on your shoulders. But
dialog: these inner battles, darling -
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I can’t -
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: - I know, I know - but they have
dialog: actually trained you for this
dialog: moment. You are strong because you
dialog: are imperfect. You are wise because
dialog: you have doubts. From this
dialog: uncertainty the wisest words will
dialog: come. Now. I will let him in.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: The King.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Which King? Our King?
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: Well if it isn’t him, it’s a
dialog: wonderful impersonation.
text: CLEMMIE closes the door. WINSTON looks DISHEVELLED, his suit
text: RUMPLED. A Mess. He makes a small effort to tuck in a shirt
text: and buttons his waistcoat.
text: KING GEORGE VI enters - the most ‘proper’ man in Europe. The
text: height of manners and decorum. Wears an IMPECCABLE SUIT.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE VI
dialog: Mr Churchill--I hope you can for--
dialog: give the late hour but your wife
dialog: thought tonight would be a good
dialog: time.
text: Winston is standing by the bed.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE VI (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we sit?
text: The KING sits in an ARMCHAIR. Winston sits on the bed.
text: WINSTON makes a futile effort to put on his public face...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Something to drink? Er -
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE VI
dialog: No, thank you.
text: WINSTON remains seated on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE VI (CONT'D)
dialog: I received a visit...
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: From?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE VI
dialog: Viscount Halifax.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It appears--the prospect of a peace
dialog: deal with Hitler--has increased
dialog: dramatically.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Later today I will address The
dialog: House. The war cabinet is drafting
dialog: a letter to Mussolini, asking him
dialog: to broker talks with Herr Hitler.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Then Halifax was correct.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I should like to know your mind.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: It would be helpful to know yours
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Mine? I should like to know it
dialog: myself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nations which go down fighting rise
dialog: again, but those which surrender
dialog: tamely are finished.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Belgium?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
text: Collapsed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Norway -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Holland. France any hour.
dialog: After a hard silence -
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: And the mood of parliament?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Fear. Panic.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: And are you not afraid? At all?
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I am most terribly.
text: scrutinizes him closely -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Our defeat in France is the most
dialog: crushing in the history of the
dialog: Empire. Support among my party for
dialog: a campaign of resistance has
dialog: collapsed.
text: Finally - GEORGE has heard what he has wanted to hear, and so
dialog: makes his
text: pledge - He moves to sit next to Winston on the bed
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: You have my support.
text: WINSTON cannot believe his ears.
speaker_heading: WINSTON —
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Your Majesty?
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: You have my support.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I must confess, I had some
dialog: reservations about you at-at first.
dialog: And while some in this country
dialog: might have dreaded your
dialog: appointment, none dreaded it like-
dialog: like Adolph Hitler.
text: speechless.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI (CONT'D)
dialog: Whomever can strike fear into that
dialog: brute heart is worthy of all our
dialog: trust. We shall work together. You
dialog: shall have my support. At any hour.
dialog: (passionate)
dialog: Beat the buggers.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I fear I may be defeated.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: You--you once gave me some advice.
dialog: Perhaps I can give you some. Go to
dialog: the people. Let them instruct you.
dialog: Quite silently, they usually do.
dialog: But tell them the truth.
dialog: Unvarnished.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I shall speak to parliament, but
dialog: without support in my own party, I
dialog: must sue for peace.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: You warned us this day was coming.
dialog: We failed to listen to you. Lift us
dialog: up, Mr Churchill.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: On certain matters I have few
dialog: people with whom I can talk
dialog: frankly.
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Perhaps now we have each other?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I no longer scare you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE VI
dialog: Only a little. I can cope.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Yes you can. Your majesty.
text: They remain sitting there, side by side on the boat-shaped
dialog: bed, friends hereafter.

scene_heading: EXT/INT. PRINCES STREET/ WINSTON’S CAR - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT of - WINSTON’s CAR, moving slowly through the rainy
text: street. WINSTON, in the back seat, looks out the window at
text: the human traffic - seems like he’s in a gold-fish bowl,
text: disconnected. He watches as - MEN IN BOWLER HATS and YOUNG
text: WOMEN in SUMMER DRESSES walk to work. As they rush through
text: the rain shielding themselves with umbrellas and newspapers.
text: WINSTON, with an UNLIT CIGAR in his mouth, searches his
text: pockets for a MATCH. But he can’t find his matches.
text: When the CAR stops at a RED LIGHT -
text: - TOM LEONARD hears the car door slam. He turns, looks back,

text: WINSTON tips his HAT to them.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: What are you all staring at? Have
dialog: you never seen a Prime Minister

text: EVERYBODY is doing their best to be well mannered and not stare,
text: but all are failing! They immediately avert their eyes from
text: WINSTON. WINSTON remembers his unlit CIGAR -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Does anyone have a match?
text: Down the CARRIAGE an OLD MAN shakes a box of matches. WINSTON

speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT'D)
dialog: And how are you all bearing up?

speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Now let me ask you all something--
dialog: which has been weighing on my mind.
dialog: Perhaps you can provide me with an
dialog: answer.
text: A hushed SILENCE again - they wait. He studies their faces,
dialog: reading their minute expressions -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: The British people. What is their
dialog: mood? Is it confident?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Some people say it’s a lost cause.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Lost causes are the only ones worth
dialog: fighting for. Now let me ask you
dialog: this--if the worst came to pass,
dialog: and the enemy were to appear on
dialog: these streets, what would you do?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Fight.
speaker_heading: MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
dialog: Fight the fascists!
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Fight them with whatever we can lay
dialog: our hands on!
speaker_heading: IRISH WOMAN

speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Street by street!
speaker_heading: WEST-INDIAN MAN
dialog: They'll never take Picadilly!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Ha!Ha! Never Picadilly indeed!
text: The public laugh. WINSTON SMILES, proud of these people -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT'D)
dialog: And what--what if I put it to you
dialog: all--that we might - if we ask
dialog: hicely - receive very favourable
dialog: terms from Mr. Hitler if we enter
dialog: into a peace deal with him right
dialog: now? What would you say to that?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: NEVER! NEVER!
dialog: A pause, and then -
speaker_heading: ALL (CONT'D)
dialog: NEVER! NEVER!
text: When SILENCE returns, one (young) voice chimes in, late -
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: Never!
text: WINSTON turns to look for the source of the voice and he
text: sees, and moves toward, one YOUNG GIRL...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Will you never give up?
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: Never.
text: Touched, he crosses and sits down opposite the child -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (to YOUNG GIRL)
dialog: “Then out spake brave Horatius,
dialog: The Captain of the gate:
dialog: To every man upon this earth
dialog: Death cometh soon or late.
dialog: And how can man die better
dialog: Than facing fearful odds - “
speaker_heading: WEST INDIAN MAN
dialog: “—- for the ashes of his fathers

text: Everyone is moved. WINSTON, himself, has tears in his eyes.
text: He wipes his eyes with a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: Are you crying?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I blub a lot. You’1l have
dialog: to get used to it.
text: The TRAIN stops.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: What stop is this?
speaker_heading: MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
dialog: Westminster.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: That’s my stop.
dialog: 88.

dialog: discuss, with the desire to find

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS - WESTMINISTER HALL - DAY
text: Deep in anxious thought, WINSTON stalks in to the House of
text: Commons and walks down a long hallway....
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CADOGAN ((0.S.)
dialog: .."We understand that he desires
dialog: the solution of certain
dialog: Mediterranean questions: and if he
dialog: will state in secrecy what these

text: To the first floor and is met by a relieved JOHN EVANS -
speaker_heading: JOHN EVANS
dialog: Sir! The War Cabinet is waiting!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I am due to address the Outer
dialog: Cabinet. I haven’t spoken to them
dialog: since the formation of the new
dialog: government.
text: Moving up the HALLWAY, WINSTON and EVANS pass huddled groups
dialog: of YOUNGER MP’s -
text: WINSTON STOPS, thinks, and then turns back to them.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Good day.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I am--about to speak to my Outer
dialog: Cabinet in my rooms and--I extend
dialog: the invitation to any of you who
dialog: would care to join them.
text: WINSTON forces a SMILE, then departs.
text: After a moment, the MP’s rise, look at each other, murmur,
text: rise and follow him.
scene_heading: INT. COMMITTEE ROOM/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
text: The ROOM is now FULL with 40 MEN - CABINET MEMBERS and YOUNG
scene_heading: BACK-BENCHERS.
text: WINSTON enters, with JOHN EVANS - shakes the hand of YOUNG
speaker_heading: CONSERVATIVE MP (ERNLE HASTINGS) .
speaker_heading: The DOORS are CLOSED.
text: WINSTON stands in front of the GATHERING.
text: They wait for him to speak.
text: At first no words come from WINSTON, and then -
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Later today--I will address the
dialog: House on the matter of our nation’s
dialog: security.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: At this very moment the War Cabinet
dialog: is drafting papers that lay out our
dialog: willingness to enter into peace
dialog: talks with Herr Hitler, via his
dialog: lacky, Signor Mussolini.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I have thought carefully in these
dialog: last days--whether -
dialog: (pause)
dialog: -whether it was part of my duty--
dialog: to consider entering into
dialog: negotiations with -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: - that Man.
text: He puts on his GLASSES and takes out a MATCH-BOOK - on which
text: is written the names of the people he met in the Underground.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: But then I spoke--with Oliver
dialog: Wilson -
dialog: (starts to read names from
dialog: his matchbook)
dialog: - Mrs Jessie Sutton, Mrs Abigail
dialog: Walker...
text: ANGLE ON: the CARD. The names of the TUBE COMMUTERS are all
dialog: written there...
text: REACTION: MP’s, slight confusion as they try to remember who
dialog: these people are...
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: ...-Marcus Peters, Agnes Dillon,
dialog: Maurice Baker, Alice Simpson, and
dialog: Miss Margaret Jerome--brave, good,
dialog: true citizens of this kingdom--and
dialog: they argued, strongly, that it was
dialog: idle to think that, if we tried to
dialog: make peace now, we should get
dialog: better terms than if we fought it
dialog: out. The Germans, Mr Baker felt,
dialog: would demand - in the name of
dialog: disarmament - our naval bases, and
dialog: much else. And I think he’s right.
dialog: Jessie Sutton, speaking for many,
dialog: believes we should then become a
dialog: slave state, though a British
dialog: Government - which would be
dialog: Hitler's puppet - would be set up -
dialog: under Mosley or some such person.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ERNLE HASTINGS
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: And I join with them in asking a
dialog: further question, a question I put
dialog: to you: where should we be at the
dialog: end of all that?
text: He SURVEYS their silent UNCERTAIN FACES.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Perhaps some might benefit--the
dialog: powerful might be able to parlay
dialog: good terms--preserved in their
text: country redoubts, out of sight of
text: the Swastika flying on Buckingham
text: Palace, over Windsor, draped on
dialog: these very buildings -
scene_heading: BACK-BENCHER 1
dialog: Never!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: So I come to you--to learn your
dialog: minds in this grave hour.
text: The FACES of the MP’s are RESOLUTE, MOVED, READY TO FIGHT.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: You see, we do still have immense
dialog: reserves and advantages...
text: A NOISE begins to build in the room, mumbling, turning into
text: shouts, over which WINSTON must shout -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: -..and it was pointed out to me -
dialog: (holding up list of names
dialog: from Underground)
dialog: - by my new friends--that you might
dialog: even rise up and tear me down were
dialog: I for one moment to contemplate
dialog: parley or surrender.
text: A spontaneous round of emotional applause. It surprises
text: WINSTON. It surprises even those who are applauding.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Were they wrong?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: NO! NO!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Then...then...then -
dialog: 92.
text: The DIN dies down. When silence returns...
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: - then--it appears to be your will
dialog: also, that if this long island
dialog: story of ours is to end at last,
dialog: then it should only be -
dialog: (pause, then powerfully -)
dialog: - when each one of us lies choking
dialog: in his own blood upon the ground!
text: A GIANT HOORAY goes up and the YOUNG MPs RUSH UP to WINSTON,
text: who is soon SWAMPED by MPs shaking his HAND, PATTING HIM on
text: the back - a MASSIVE SIGN OF SUPPORT.
scene_heading: INT. WAR CABINET ROOM/ WAR ROOMS - DAY
text: WINSTON somberly addresses the WAR CABINET (plus ANTHONY EDEN).
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: And when I asked to know their
dialog: minds there occurred a
dialog: demonstration which, considering
dialog: the character of the gathering,
dialog: quite surprised me. There is no
dialog: doubt that if we falter at all in
dialog: the leading of the nation we
dialog: should all be hurled out of office.
dialog: I am sure now that every Minister on
text: both sides of the house is ready to
dialog: be killed quite soon, and have all
dialog: his family and possessions
text: destroyed, rather than give in. In
dialog: this they represent almost all the
dialog: people. It falls to me in these
dialog: coming days and months to express
dialog: their sentiments. There shall be no
dialog: negotiated peace...
speaker_heading: (to HALIFAX)
dialog: --and you must each do now as you
dialog: see fit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I must now address parliament, and
dialog: I’m yet to write a word of my
dialog: speech.

dialog: the shoulder.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: “Tiny”.
dialog: 93.
text: GENERAL IRONSIDE - having his war at last - smiles.
speaker_heading: IRONSIDE
dialog: Sir.
text: EDEN happily follows his LEADER now.
scene_heading: REACTION: HALIFAX. BETRAYAL.
text: CHAMBERLAIN avoids HALIFAX’s eyes.
text: ATTLEE and GREENWOOD smile.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - WAR ROOMS / ELIZABETH’S ROOM - DAY
text: WINSTON walks toward ELIZABETH LAYTON’s “Shoe-Box” room,
text: knocks, opens the door, remains in the doorway -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Miss Layton?
text: ELIZABETH looks up from her work -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I’m in need of you.
scene_heading: INT. WAR CABINET ROOM - DAY
text: HALIFAX detains CHAMBERLAIN as the CABINET leaves the meeting -
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: We must both now resign. Force a
dialog: vote of no confidence. I have your
dialog: word?
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Let us--let us go to the Commons
dialog: first. Join our colleagues. And
dialog: speak after the Prime Minister's
dialog: address.
text: CHAMBERLAIN takes his coat and leaves HALIFAX worried.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM/ 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY

text: - that she is in UNIFORM (Red Cross).
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CLEMMIE
dialog: (to her reflection)
dialog: Here lies a woman, who is always
dialog: tired--for she lived in a world
dialog: where too much was required.
scene_heading: EXT. PARLIAMENT - DAY
text: CAMERA moves in on WINSTON’S PARKED CAR, and we gradually
text: hear the sound of - TYPING.
text: Through the WINDOW of the CAR we finally see -
text: WINSTON, dictating to ELIZABETH LAYTON, her TYPE-WRITER on
text: her knee going clack, clack, clack. (WINSTON gesticulates as
dialog: he composes the crucial words.)
scene_heading: INT. COMMONS/ PARLIAMENT - DAY
text: WINSTON addresses a PACKED HOUSE of COMMONS. A CROWD of some
text: FIVE HUNDRED listen, with more in the GALLERY. Among the
text: GALLERY crowd, JOHN EVANS.
text: ELIZABETH LAYTON arrives late, and learns over the hand-rail,
text: looking down anxiously at -
text: WINSTON, as he launches his final assault -
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Turning once again--to the question
dialog: of invasion--I would observe that
dialog: there has never been a period in
dialog: all these long centuries of which
dialog: we boast, when an absolute
dialog: guarantee against invasion could
dialog: have been given to our people.
text: ANGLE ON: HALIFAX, in the GALLERY, keenly watching.
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: I have, myself--full confidence
dialog: that if all do their duty, if
dialog: nothing is neglected, and if the
dialog: best arrangements are made, as they
dialog: are being made, we shall prove
dialog: ourselves once more able to defend
dialog: our island home, to ride out the
dialog: storm of war, and to outlive the
dialog: menace of tyranny -
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM/ DOWNING STREET - DAY
text: CLEMMIE, in her UNIFORM, listens to WINSTON’s broadcast on
text: the RADIO, as she has her portrait photographed by CECIL
text: BEATON. She is awkward in front of the camera.
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
text: The KING smokes as he listens to the same broadcast.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER - DAY
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
dialog: which she
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: - if necessary for years, if
dialog: necessary alone. At any rate, that
dialog: is what we are going to try to do.
dialog: That is the resolve of His
dialog: Majesty's Government - every man of
dialog: them. That is the will of
dialog: Parliament and the nation.
dialog: The British Empire and the French
dialog: Republic, linked together in their
dialog: cause and in their need, will
dialog: defend to the death their native
dialog: soil, aiding each other like good
dialog: comrades to the utmost of their
dialog: strength.
text: ELIZABETH, who is “mouthing” these words, some of
dialog: already knows by heart -
speaker_heading: WINSTON (CONT’D)
dialog: Even though large tracts of Europe
dialog: and many old and famous States have
dialog: fallen or may fall into the grip of
dialog: the Gestapo and all the odious
dialog: apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall
dialog: not flag or fail.
dialog: We shall go on to the end.
dialog: We shall fight in France--we shall
dialog: fight on the seas and oceans, we
dialog: shall fight with growing confidence
dialog: and growing strength in the air, we
dialog: shall defend our island - whatever
dialog: the cost may be. We shall fight on
dialog: the beaches, we shall fight on the
dialog: landing grounds, we shall fight in
dialog: the fields and in the streets, we
dialog: shall fight in the hills; We shall
dialog: never surrender, and if, which I do
dialog: not for a moment believe, this
dialog: island or a large part of it were
dialog: subjugated and starving, then our
text: Empire beyond the seas, armed and
dialog: guarded by the British Fleet, would
dialog: carry on the struggle, until, in
dialog: God's good time, the New World,
dialog: with all its power and might, steps
dialog: forth to the rescue and the
dialog: liberation of the old!
dialog: 96.
text: The LABOUR BENCHES begin to wave their papers in the air and
dialog: call their approval, (it is against Parliamentary etiquette
dialog: to ever clap in the House of Commons).
text: WINSTON’S children bang their hands on the woodwork.
text: WINSTON’s CONSERVATIVE colleagues all look to CHAMBERLAIN.
text: CLOSE ON: HALIFAX, looking down from the GALLERY at
text: CHAMBERLAIN, closes his eyes, knowing what is coming next -
text: - CHAMBERLAIN TAKES OUT HIS WHITE HANDKERCHIEF, and tamps
text: his forehead with it. It’s enough. The CONSERVATIVE
text: FACTION, ignited, rises to their feet in THUNDEROUS SUPPORT
text: of WINSTON.
scene_heading: REACTION HALIFAX: Defeat.
text: WINSTON turns to ANTHONY EDEN, registering surprise at the
dialog: strength of support, and winks -
text: EDEN grins and SHAKES his FRIEND’s HAND.
speaker_heading: EDEN
dialog: Changed your mind?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Those who never change their mind
dialog: never change anything.
text: The UPROAR in the HOUSE continues, those in the gallery begin
text: to throw their parliamentary papers into the air which then
text: rain down into the chamber.
speaker_heading: STANHOPE
dialog: What just happened?
speaker_heading: HALIFAX
dialog: He just mobilized the English
dialog: language--and sent it into battle.
text: Every man is on his feet waving their parliamentary papers
text: and throwing them into the air, shouting and stamping.
text: Smiling with due deference WINSTON takes up his things and
text: walks down the central aisle of the house as papers continue
text: to rain down from the gallery like ticker tape or confetti.
text: As the GREAT DOORS of the COMMONS close behind him - the
text: screen becomes BLACK.
scene_heading: Up with END CAPTIONS:
