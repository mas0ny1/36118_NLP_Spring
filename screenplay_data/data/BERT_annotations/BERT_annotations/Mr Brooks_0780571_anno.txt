speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
dialog: (tortured)
dialog: God grant me the Serenity to accept
dialog: the things I cannot change...
text: Our view travels sensuously down the Woman's naked torso to
text: find the Man's head buried between her legs.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (V.O.)
dialog: Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
dialog: Courage to change the things I
dialog: can...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (V.O.)
dialog: Come on, you've been a good boy for
dialog: a long time, you deserve a little
dialog: fun.
text: Our view moves back up to the Woman's breasts.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE THROUGH
speaker_heading: THIS TO:
text: EARL BROOKS' reflection in a mirror. Earl, in his 40's, has
text: on a tuxedo. He's in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and
text: he's whispering to his image.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: ... and Wisdom to know the
dialog: difference.
text: Picking up speed against the hunger in his head:
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)
text: Living one day at a time, Enjoying
text: one moment at a time, Accepting
dialog: hardship as a pathway to peace...
text: From far away comes the sound of applause.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: MEN in tuxedos and WOMEN in gowns.
text: Mr. Brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his
dialog: wife, EMMA, also 40's.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The audience's hands are coming together for what a MAN at
dialog: the microphone has just said.
text: Mr. Brooks is smiling but not clapping; and although his lips
dialog: don't move we can hear:
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
dialog: (even faster now)
dialog: ... Taking, as He did, this sinful
dialog: world as it is, not as I would have
dialog: it. Trusting that He will make all
dialog: things right if I surrender to His
dialog: will. That I may be reasonably
dialog: happy in this life, And supremely
dialog: happy with Him forever in the next.
dialog: Amen.
text: The Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the
dialog: Audience.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I could go on and on about what a
dialog: great guy Earl is, how he cuts his
dialog: toe nails...
text: Everyone laughs.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ... how he gives freely of his time
dialog: and money, but let's get Earl up
dialog: here to speak for himself. Ladies
dialog: and Gentlemen, I give you a
dialog: businessman, a philanthropist, a
dialog: great friend and the Evanston
dialog: Chamber of Commerce Man of the
dialog: Year... Mr. Earl Brooks.
text: Mr. Brooks kisses Emma, stands and after accepting
text: congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Thank you all very much. The first
dialog: thing I would like to say is... I
dialog: don't even know how I cut my toe
dialog: nails.
text: Applause and laughter from the Audience.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Twenty years ago when I started the
dialog: Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed
dialog: I would one day be standing here.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: A silver Lexus LS 430 glides past us.
speaker_heading: EMMA (V.O.)
dialog: Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?
scene_heading: INT. LEXUS Ñ NIGHT
text: Mr. Brooks is driving. Emma is in the passenger seat. They're
text: holding hands.
speaker_heading: EMMA
text: You could see her nipples. At her
dialog: age she should keep those things
text: hidden.
text: Mr. Brooks is only listening to his Wife with one ear and
text: underneath what she is saying we can barely hear:
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
dialog: God grant me the Serenity to
dialog: accept...
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: The only thing that would have made
dialog: this evening more perfect is if
dialog: Jane had been here.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: She called. She has mid terms
text: coming up.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: She's dropping out, you know.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Nothing she does is wrong to you,
dialog: is it?...
text: Mr. Brooks doesn't rise to the bait.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Well she missed a good party...
text: As she continues, we look at Mr. Brooks and Emma's voice
text: fades to a murmur.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: In the back seat, a Man leans out from behind Mr. Brooks's
dialog: head. This is MARSHALL. He's 50 plus.
text: Emma can neither see nor hear him. Marshall exists only in
text: Mr. Brooks's mind.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Come on, Earl, give yourself a
dialog: break, you know you want to do
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You're the fucking 'man of the
dialog: year', you deserve it. It's not
dialog: like it's not set up. You already
dialog: know how to by-pass the alarm, you
dialog: know how to pick the locks.
dialog: Tonight's the perfect night.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: No, Marshall, I said 'no'!
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I heard you, Earl, but you don't
dialog: mean 'no'.
text: Emma feels Mr. Brooks's distance.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: What's the matter?
text: Mr. Brooks pulls himself back into the moment.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: You were frowning.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: I was thinking of what I didn't say
text: in the speech.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: They laughed, they were touched, I
dialog: don't think anyone felt left out.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (from the back seat)
dialog: They have their dance class
dialog: tonight. What if we go by and just
dialog: look at them. There's no harm in
text: just having a look.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: No means 'no', Marshall.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Please... pretty please.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (to Emma)
dialog: The food tonight was very good, but
dialog: I wasn't crazy about the dessert.
dialog: Would you like to stop somewhere
dialog: and get something sweet?
scene_heading: INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR Ñ NIGHT
text: In a booth, Mr. Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae. Mr.
text: Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is
text: taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the
text: second floor of the Building across the street.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: ... Labradors are supposed to be
dialog: nice, or maybe a rescue mutt...
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: The Pound's a pretty sad place; if
dialog: you want me to, I'll go with you.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: There's an Irish Lab I read about,
dialog: and I think the breeder is...
text: Mr. Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again
text: Emma's voice fades to a murmur.
text: Both Mr. Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side
text: of Emma are focused on one particular COUPLE.
dialog: The Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they
text: especially attractive, but Mr. Brooks and Marshall are
text: fascinated with them.
text: Marshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr.
dialog: Brooks:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I bet your dick's getting hard,
dialog: isn't it, just imagining what they
dialog: would look like dead?
text: Savoring the ice-cream, Mr. Brooks nods.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
text: Two story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the
dialog: line and the grounds say there's big money here.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Through the door of the DRESSING AREA, Emma can be seen
text: taking off her evening clothes.
text: Hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr.
text: Brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands.
text: His bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo. In
text: obvious torment, he is whispering to himself.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: ... I can't do this, I can't do
dialog: this, I can't do this, please don't
dialog: let me do this, God grant me the
dialog: Serenity to accept the things I
dialog: cannot change...
scene_heading: In the DRESSING AREA
text: Emma is putting on her sleep-wear. Mr. Brooks steps into the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: I'm going to stay up a while, maybe
dialog: go to the studio and play with some
text: glazes.
speaker_heading: EMMA
dialog: Okay, I'm going to read. If I'm not
dialog: awake, wake me when you come back.
text: Mr. Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs
text: her, then easing back, kisses her.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: I thought you were wonderful
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 7.
text: EXT. THE BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
text: Mr. Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Don't do this, don't do this,
dialog: please don't do this, don't do
dialog: this, don't do, please don't do
dialog: this...
text: He passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small
text: beautiful industrial-looking Building.
text: No windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just
text: under the edge of the roof.
text: Mr. Brooks lets himself in with a key.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING Ñ NIGHT
text: Exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups,
text: plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around
dialog: the room.
text: This is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO.
text: Mr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the
text: temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of
text: his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a
text: dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a
dialog: closet.
text: Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical
text: leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a
text: dozen identical windbreakers.
text: He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which
text: opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non-
text: descript Toyota.
scene_heading: EXT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT
text: The Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door
text: closing behind it, pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT
text: Marshall is up front with Mr. Brooks.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed
dialog: this! We are going to have so much
dialog: fun!
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: This is the last time, Marshall.
dialog: Understand me?! The very last time!
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET Ñ NIGHT
text: A mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr.
text: Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree.
text: We rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the
text: other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks
text: working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW.
text: He has on surgical gloves.
text: The pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens.
text: There's a chain.
text: Mr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from
text: a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives
text: the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward.
text: The chain has been released.
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT
text: Mr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath
text: stands very still and listens.
text: There's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of
dialog: the house.
text: Mr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming
text: slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark
dialog: slacks.
text: Move up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall.
text: In the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable.
text: It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks,
text: he hesitates.
text: Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Don't you dare quit on me, you
dialog: piece of shit. I want to see what
dialog: they're doing.
text: Mr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again.
text: Entering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand
text: reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the
text: butt of a silenced pistol.
text: He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the
text: Ziplock against his wrist.
text: The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it
text: the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense.
text: Mr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for
text: he and Marshall to see the Couple inside.
text: The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are
text: naked on the bed.
text: As much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching.
text: He can now hear his heart beating in his ears.
text: He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his
text: expression is distant almost clinical.
text: When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face
text: goes blank.
text: On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of
text: them lie there basking in the afterglow.
text: Behind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips
text: into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Hello.
text: Both the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman
text: screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What the fuck?!
text: Then he sees the gun.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey, man, don't...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (to the Woman)
dialog: Be quiet and sit up.
text: In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back
text: against the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and
text: she can't stop screaming.
text: POP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr.
text: Brooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the
text: wall. The screaming stops.
text: The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet
text: through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples
text: onto the Girl.
text: Mr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the
text: scent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his
text: way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (O.S.)
dialog: (barks)
dialog: Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is
dialog: this?!!
text: Mr. Brooks snaps a look.
text: The curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of
text: the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of
text: an alley can see into this room.
text: Most of their windows are dark. And there's no one looking
text: out of the windows that are lit.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: These pigs liked to fuck with the
dialog: blinds open, you should have known
dialog: that, Earl. This is a big mistake
dialog: for you, Earl.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (going to the window)
dialog: Almost like I want to get caught,
dialog: huh, Marshall?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Well, don't fucking do that. I
dialog: don't think either of us would
dialog: enjoy spending the rest of our
dialog: lives in jail or a lethal
dialog: injection.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: He grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the
dialog: curtains closed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose. The
text: attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the
text: ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with.
scene_heading: INT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT
text: Mr. Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his
text: murder clothes are being reduced to ash.
text: Arranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in
dialog: sexual positions.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Please forgive me... Please forgive
dialog: me...
text: As we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of
text: blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that
text: these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed.
text: One by one, Mr. Brooks picks up his souvenirs. He lingers
text: over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge
dialog: of a table:
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Don't even think about it. You know
dialog: the rules.
text: Reluctantly Mr. Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of
dialog: the kiln.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Now go up and make love to your
dialog: beautiful wife.
text: He leaves. In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame.
scene_heading: EXT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ AFTERNOON
text: The sunlight exposes its charm.
text: If it weren't for the Police tape, the UNIFORMED OFFICERS,
text: and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES, it looks like it would be a
dialog: cool place to live.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: An OLDER DETECTIVE, an African-American, comes out on the
text: porch and calls to two other DETECTIVES who are drinking
dialog: coffee on the lawn:
speaker_heading: OLDER DETECTIVE
dialog: Where the fuck is Atwood?!
speaker_heading: YOUNG DETECTIVE
dialog: I called ten minutes ago, they said
text: she was on her way.
speaker_heading: OLDER DETECTIVE
dialog: She doesn't get here soon, these
dialog: bodies won't even be dead anymore?
text: A Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape:
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: You looking for the lady Cop?
speaker_heading: OLDER DETECTIVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: COP
text: She's here. She's been sitting in
dialog: her car right over there for the
dialog: last half hour.
speaker_heading: OLDER DETECTIVE
dialog: Oh, Christ.
scene_heading: EXT. ATWOOD'S CAR Ñ AFTERNOON
text: Special Detective TRACY ATWOOD, somewhere in her 30's, is
text: behind the wheel. The door is open.
dialog: By the expression on her face we might guess that Detective
text: Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car.
text: On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune. The
text: headline of a middle article on the first page reads: THE
speaker_heading: HANGMAN ESCAPES.
text: Move up to Atwood's face. The Older Detective followed by the
text: Younger Detective approaches.
speaker_heading: OLDER DETECTIVE
dialog: You thinking of joining us anytime
dialog: soon, Atwood?
text: Atwood doesn't look at the Detectives for a long beat and
text: when she does her expression is not friendly.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: I really hated yesterday, Snyder,
dialog: and then today came along.
text: As she gets out of the car, the Men notice the bandages on
text: her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: SNYDER (OLDER DETECTIVE)
dialog: What happened to your wrists?
text: Atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the
text: bandages.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: I tried to commit suicide.
text: The Young Detective laughs. Atwood whirls on him.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DETECTIVE
dialog: Eh... I... I don't know, I heard it
dialog: was because you were drunk and got
text: into a fight with a fish tank.
text: Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Who are you gonna believe? Me or
dialog: the fucking fish?!
speaker_heading: YOUNG DETECTIVE
dialog: Eh... you.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Good.
text: Atwood turns and leaves the Men.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DETECTIVE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: She's nuts!
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: And rich.

text: lock on the front door.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SNYDER
text: There are some scratches in the
dialog: side door cylinder. Other than that
text: no signs of forced entry. The alarm
dialog: was armed and we even had to cut
text: the security chains to get in.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (straightens up)
dialog: This guy hasn't been active for
dialog: over two years...
text: She enters the house.
scene_heading: INT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ AFTERNOON
text: From the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses
dialog: the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: ... we think he's either dead or in
dialog: jail on some other charge. This is
text: probably a copycat.
text: Detective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom
text: and follows.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: That's why we called you. You're
dialog: the God that tells us peons if we
dialog: have a simple murder here or
dialog: something we can dump on you.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Bite yourself.
text: Atwood arrives in the doorway of the BEDROOM where the
dialog: murders took place and stops.
text: The Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor. The Man
text: is propped up against the bed in a sitting position. The
text: Woman has her head in the Man's crotch.
text: Almost like Mr. Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in
text: Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her
text: but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey.
text: In a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM Ñ AFTERNOON
text: The Crime Scene TECHNICIANS shift to accommodate Atwood's
dialog: inspection.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (indicating the Victims)
text: He always rearranges the bodies,
dialog: but this is out of character. He
dialog: has never left them in such a crude
dialog: position. Usually it's more
text: romantic with their arms around
text: each other, kissing, their mouths
text: open, their tongues touching.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: So we have a copycat?
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Where are the thumbprints?
text: Snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed. Atwood
text: leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by
dialog: side.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: One his one hers?
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: That's what it looks like.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: What's that?
text: There are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
text: The bullets went completely through
text: the victims. The killer recovered
text: the slugs.
text: Atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to
text: the window and cracks the curtains.
text: There's the four story Apartment Building across the alley,
text: its windows staring down at her.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Were these open or closed when you
dialog: got here?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SNYDER
text: Closed.

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Hmm...
text: She returns her attention to the murder scene.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: It has never been revealed to the
dialog: public that the Thumbprint Killer
text: retrieves the slugs.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: So this one's yours.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: I don't fucking need this.
text: She doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at
text: the four story Apartment Building.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Have you checked the tenants of
dialog: that building?
speaker_heading: SNYDER
text: Only a few of them are home, they
dialog: say they didn't see anything. We
dialog: checked the whole neighborhood, so
dialog: far nobody saw a thing.
text: Atwood nods and turns back to the bodies.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Leaving them like this, he must
dialog: have been angry at them for some
dialog: reason.
text: She reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Where would they keep their vacuum
dialog: cleaner.
text: A puzzled Snyder follows her out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. PANTRY Ñ AFTERNOON
text: Atwood opens a service closet. There's the Vacuum Cleaner.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: I have no idea what you're looking
dialog: for.
text: Atwood unzips the cover. There is no bag inside.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: He vacuumed the house and took the

speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Oh, shit. That is scary smart.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY Ñ AFTERNOON
text: Detective Atwood is standing on an empty capped plastic
text: gallon milk carton looking over the fence into the back yard

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Okay.
text: He releases her. She hops down and directs her attention at
text: the four story Apartment Building.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Our best hope is if someone in

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Did you choose them because of

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: It's darker tonight than it was on

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Once again, how did you know where

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: And when did you bag the gun?

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

scene_heading: EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT

text: As it slowly drops, the PEOPLE on the dance floor, Couple by
text: Couple, disappear until there are only three Couples left,
text: one of them is Atwood and Larry. Her head is on his shoulder.
text: It's a slow dance.
text: Larry is very good and wherever he leads, Atwood easily
text: follows. The lights begin to dim and we move in.
text: Larry touches his lips to Atwood's neck. She arches back and
text: he kisses her neck again and again.

text: His lips move up and find hers, and we are now close on the
text: kiss. Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat.
text: Looking into her eyes, Larry traces her lips with a finger,
text: then replaces that finger with his tongue.
text: His lips brush a cheek, down her neck to where it meets her
text: shoulder, his teeth close softly on the muscle, by now we are
text: far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no
dialog: clothes on and we are:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM Ñ NIGHT
text: What light there is, is coming from a room we can't see.
text: Larry nibbles at Atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes
text: his hands down her sides. She shivers. He brushes his lips
text: back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the
text: flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair.
text: She's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall.
text: Then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her
text: legs. From low in her throat, Atwood moans. We lose sight of
text: the Couple as we move around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM Ñ DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LARRY

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

speaker_heading: LARRY

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MARSHALL (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: .... Huh... her father's Gerald
dialog: Atwood, why does that ring a bell?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Someone you did business with,
dialog: someone we killed?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Not someone we killed... MBA...
dialog: College of William and Mary...
dialog: she's been a cop for eleven
dialog: years... Married Doctor Carlson,
dialog: divorced Dr. Carlson, married Jesse
dialog: Vialo... restaurateur... separated
dialog: from Jesse Vialo, sued for support
text: by Jesse Vialo, seeing a shrink

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Excellent fitness report though.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Oooh... She's caught a lot of

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

speaker_heading: MARSHALL

dialog: (snorts)
text: She married him on the rebound from
dialog: the doctor and I'll bet he married
dialog: her for her money and her
dialog: connections.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: The old man being rich doesn't mean
dialog: she's rich. Maybe he's one of those
dialog: guys who would rather give it to
dialog: the Opera than to his kids.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Wouldn't she have to declare any
dialog: outside income and holdings to the
dialog: Police?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Hmmm...
text: He restores Atwood's file. Tap, tap, tap, tap. Stop. The Men
text: study the screen then look at each other.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: The Opera didn't get much.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Why would a woman with her

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: I like that about her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You're such a fucking snob, Earl.
dialog: You like her because she's rich.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: No, I like her because she found
dialog: something that's hers. It's not the
dialog: family business. And she's good at
dialog: it. I'd like Jane to find something
dialog: that's hers and that she could be
dialog: good at.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: That's exactly why Atwood scares
dialog: the shit out of me. She's a cop who
dialog: doesn't need the money and she's
dialog: looking for us. That's one fucking
dialog: dangerous human being.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: The fact that you're not wrong

speaker_heading: ASIAN ATTORNEY

scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK Ñ MORNING
text: Atwood strides toward her car. The PEDESTRIAN traffic is
text: light. It's too early for the stores to be open.
text: Up ahead a BROWN VAN is idling at the curb, the sliding side
text: door is open. Atwood can see inside. Empty except for some
text: furniture blankets.
text: The Person in the Driver's seat turns to look into the back.
text: It's the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder
text: House. Her hands are unseen in leather gloves.
text: She looks up and their eyes meet. Two strangers. The contact
text: is instantly broken.
text: Atwood takes a deep breath and smiles. After the rain, the
text: air is brisk and clean. It's good to be alive.
text: SLAM!!! Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of
text: the recess of a doorway. His arms wrap around her, she's
text: lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into
dialog: the Van.
scene_heading: INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
text: Oooff!! The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left
text: shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the Man on top of
dialog: her.
text: The Man is Thorton Meeks, the Hangman, six feet, a solid two
text: hundred pounds. He's also wearing tight leather gloves.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
text: The Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb.
scene_heading: INT. BROWN VAN Ñ MORNING
text: His body crushing hers, Meeks kisses Atwood's cheek.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told
dialog: you I was coming back to get you.

speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: I already know where I'm gonna hang
dialog: you. But first I'm gonna watch
dialog: her...
dialog: (indicates the Driver)
dialog: ... have some fun with you, then
dialog: she's gonna watch me have some fun
dialog: with you.
text: He kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwood's head.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: Now, don't move.
text: He raises up and straddles her.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
dialog: You know the drill, I'm gonna put
text: the cuffs on.
text: With his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back
text: pocket and snaps them on Atwood's right wrist.
speaker_heading: MEEKS
text: Now the left.
text: He rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the
text: handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left.
text: All Meeks' talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and
text: suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at
text: the top of her lungs.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: SHOOT ME!!!
text: At the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her
text: right wrist. A startled Meeks is thrown off balance. The gun
text: comes away from Atwood's head.
text: Her left arm now free, Atwood swings her palm with all of her
text: might into Meeks' right ear. POP!! His eardrum breaks.
text: Aaaggh!! He instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear
text: with his gun hand.
text: The Driver doubles around to see what's happening. From
text: outside, HOONNNKK!! The Driver's attention returns to the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Atwood swings again. This time she snags the barrel of the
text: gun and using it as a lever bends Meeks' hand back on the
dialog: wrist.
text: BLAM! The gun goes off. Neither one of them is hit.
text: At the same time Atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that Meeks
text: is holding in his left hand and twists into him. This
text: dislodges Meeks and he's off of her.
text: Snarling like animals they fight for the gun.
text: CRACK! Atwood's leverage breaks Meeks' trigger finger. His
text: grip loosens on the weapon. She pulls it out of his hand.
text: A quick push skitters it across the floor. It drops through
text: the open side door into the street.
text: Atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. Now it's
text: Meeks' turn. A sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls
dialog: her motion.
text: He flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into
text: his right hand. Snap!! The blade comes out. Atwood is
text: reaching again for her ankle gun. She sees the flash of metal
text: and flings her head back.
text: Luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye.
text: Blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow.
text: Meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to
text: pull Atwood into the range of his knife.
text: With one foot Atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes
text: off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the
text: Driver's hair.
text: Atwood's weight hinges the Driver's head back until she's
text: looking at the ceiling. Her scream is equal parts pain and
dialog: surprise.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
text: The Brown Van veers into the on-coming traffic. The Driver of
text: the car dead ahead swerves. The Van solidly clips the rear of
dialog: that car.
scene_heading: INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
text: The sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots Atwood and
text: Meeks forward. She hits the back of the Driver's seat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: hip.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
text: Careening across its lane, the Van sideswipes a parked car.
scene_heading: INT. BROWN VAN Ñ MORNING
text: That impact rips Atwood's hand out of the Driver's hair and
text: sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door.
text: On her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her
text: holster when Meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger
text: seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest.
text: Atwood is launched backward out the side door.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
text: In slow motion Atwood flies through the air while at normal
text: speed the Van is leaving her behind.
text: SMASH! Butt first, Atwood hammers into the back window of a
text: parked car. The shattering glass breaks her fall.
text: Groggily she rolls out of the indentation. Gun still in hand

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

speaker_heading: MR. SMITH

speaker_heading: MR. SMITH

scene_heading: EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ DAY

scene_heading: HEAVYSET LAWYER

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: She did it, didn't she?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Yeah. It'll take the Cops a week to

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: Mr. Brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs, then wiping

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: I've been afraid of this since the
dialog: day she was born. She has what I
dialog: have.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Yes, she does. But you've always
dialog: been smart about it. She was
dialog: stupid. She did it because she got
dialog: off on it, she did it for fun. Why
dialog: didn't she think it through? A
dialog: hatchet! And she left it there!!
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

dialog: across country by a friend and now
text: right in front of me, she tells the
dialog: Cops it was stolen.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You've always cleaned up after her,
dialog: whatever she did, all her life.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: If the BMW has anything
dialog: incriminating in it, I hope it was
dialog: stolen or she dropped it at the
text: bottom of a very deep lake.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Do you think she knows what kind of
dialog: trouble she's in?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: I think she thought she had gotten
text: away with it until the Cops showed
dialog: up. I should have listened to her,
dialog: it was there. She was telling me.
dialog: 'I didn't quit school because I was
dialog: pregnant'. I should have dug
dialog: deeper.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: And where would you be but at the
dialog: exact same place you are now. It is
dialog: not your fault, Earl. Part of your
dialog: problem with her is that you always
dialog: think it is.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: She has what I have, Marshall. So
dialog: on a very basic level, it is my
dialog: fault.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Maybe the best thing for her would
dialog: be to let her go to jail.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

speaker_heading: MARSHALL

dialog: stopped, she's going to do it
dialog: again. And if she wants to take
dialog: over the box business, the next
dialog: victim could be you.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

dialog: We're thinking it was the killer.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: It could have been tracked in by a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: SIGY
dialog: That's the thing, you see, the
dialog: friend would have had to have been
dialog: there almost at the same time the
dialog: killer was. Otherwise the samples
dialog: would have been dry and the killer
dialog: would have vacuumed them up.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Is the clay rare, is it difficult
dialog: to get?
speaker_heading: SIGY
dialog: You can buy it almost anywhere.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: That's not much help, Sigy.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: And this is the only incongruity
dialog: you were able to find in the whole

speaker_heading: SIGY
dialog: We've done everything we know how
dialog: to do. It sure doesn't break the

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

speaker_heading: MARSHALL

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: The thing that bothers me about

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

dialog: have to tell me?
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: What do you mean? I don't have
dialog: anything to tell you.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Really? Because I was driving
dialog: around and I got this sudden
dialog: feeling that you had something to
dialog: tell me about the murders.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: No. Nothing.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: That's disappointing. Because when
dialog: I left you the last time we talked,

speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I don't know why you would feel

dialog: said to me that you worked with
dialog: clay, that you made pots.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: No. I said my hobby was
dialog: photography, not pottery.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Maybe that was it. The Stewardess
dialog: upstairs said the victims kept
text: their curtains open when they made
dialog: love. Could I see some of the
dialog: pictures you took of that Couple?
text: Mr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's

dialog: or shouldn't he?
text: Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn
text: of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at

speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You are harassing me, Detective

scene_heading: INT. HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT

text: From outside we hear the muffled sound of a Black &amp; Decker

speaker_heading: UNIFORMED POLICEMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Alvin Griffin, this is the

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT
text: From the protection of the doorjamb, a very young UNIFORMED
text: POLICEMAN is the person shining the flashlight into the
dialog: house.
text: He's flanked on either side of the door by Detective Atwood
dialog: and Detective Snyder.
text: The Officer's flashlight illuminates a short ENTRYWAY with a
text: HALL immediately off to the left and the LIVING ROOM fading
text: into darkness, straight ahead.
scene_heading: UNIFORMED POLICEMAN
dialog: (continues)
dialog: We have a warrant to search your
dialog: home and premises. We're coming in.
text: Flashlight in her left hand and the Glock in her right,

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She continues to the Hall. The darkness is so oppressive

dialog: pierce it.
text: The Room at the end is the KITCHEN.
text: With Snyder hanging in the Entryway to protect her back,
text: Atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner.
text: The dishwasher, the sink, the cabinets gleam dully back at
text: her. She steps inside.
text: A debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails
text: away from the Refrigerator.
text: Her flashlight sweeps the rest of the Room. Beyond an open
text: countertop in the DINING AREA, the light blurs past an oval
text: of white, and then comes back.
dialog: It's the face of a WOMAN!!
text: Careful of the litter, Atwood moves forward until she can see
text: that the Woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the
text: dining table.
text: Her throat has been cut. Her head is being held upright by
text: her hair which is taped to the back of the chair.
text: She has a pen taped between her fingers, but the Appointment
text: Book in front of her is drenched in blood.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (calls to the darkness in
dialog: back of her)
dialog: We have a dead woman in here.

speaker_heading: SNYDER

speaker_heading: SNYDER

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Snyder, meet Mona.
text: The Uniformed Policeman comes up beside Atwood.
scene_heading: UNIFORMED POLICEMAN
dialog: I called it in.
text: The smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much
text: for him. His gorge rises and he gags.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Do that outside.
text: The Officer doesn't have to be told twice.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (to Snyder, re: the body)
dialog: Meeks did this.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: I thought Meeks hung people.
text: Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Meeks is a steroid freak. This
dialog: Refrigerator was always full of
dialog: steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin's
dialog: niece, receptionist, lover and
dialog: keeper of the keys.
text: She focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a
text: steel band that runs around the Refrigerator. With the barrel
text: of the Glock she opens the door.
text: The only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a
text: package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a KFC box.
text: The rest of the space is vacant.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Atwood and her flashlight pass us. Three feet to her right
text: and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight.
text: The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering
text: the HALL toward the bedrooms. The ceiling is low here and it
text: feels very claustrophobic.
text: Ahead is a Door painted red.
text: But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right.
text: Snyder shines his light in.
text: It's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the
dialog: tub.
text: The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the
text: right. Snyder shines his light in.
text: This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves
text: of oils and unguents.
dialog: They've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one.
text: She turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and
text: Snyder exchange a look.
text: Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against
text: the wall. He shuts off his flashlight.
text: Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the
text: door and pushes.
text: There's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The
text: beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a
dialog: bed, a dresser, a...
text: CREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters.
text: Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction.
text: For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in
text: the reflected light in the Hall. The shape is a naked Man.
text: WHACK!! The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder. BANG! Her gun
text: goes off. She bounces into the wall and onto her ass.
text: Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc. His feet
text: and knees slam into the ceiling. Plaster dust rains.
text: The Man swings back, past Snyder. He's lost in the darkness
text: again. Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop
text: just inside the bedroom Door.
text: The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck. He's dead.
text: His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare
dialog: flesh.
text: In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's
text: chest. Printed on the paper in big black letters are the

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Number one, Mr. Smith is not smart

scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: The weird thing is that they closed
dialog: their curtains, at first they were
dialog: open like they always were and they
dialog: were making love, which they always
dialog: did, and then when I looked again
text: the curtains were closed, and there
dialog: were what looked like camera

dialog: curtains.
text: INTERCUT with Detective Atwood.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Camera flashes?
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: That's what it looked like.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (almost to herself)
dialog: That's why he poses them.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: I'm sorry?
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: I wish I could be more helpful, I
dialog: didn't see the killer or anything
dialog: like that, but since it was weird I
dialog: thought I should call.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: You've been very helpful. This
dialog: answers a lot of questions for me.
dialog: Thank you very much, Mr. Struber.
text: She's about to hang up when Struber speaks again.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: eh, I can't remember his name, but

dialog: some great pictures of that Couple
dialog: making love, he's the one you
dialog: should speak to.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Would that be, Mr. Baffert?
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Yeah, I think Jim or James...
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Snyder, meet me at Baffert's

text: Coming up the back STAIRS we arrive at a LANDING and make a

text: the deadbolt in the Service door.
speaker_heading: CLICK!
text: Mr. Brooks straightens up, twists the handle and pushes the
text: door inward. It's caught by a chain. He takes the bent rubber-
text: tipped forceps from one pocket, from another he hands Mr.
text: Smith a pair of latex gloves.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Put these on.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT
text: In the middle of the large darkened KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks
text: pauses to listen to the sounds of the Apartment.
text: The gun with the silencer is already in his right hand. Both
text: are encased in a Ziplock bag.
text: Beside him, Mr. Smith is wide eyed with fear and
text: anticipation. His teeth are even chattering.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Try a couple deep breaths through

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I have to take a crap so bad.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: This won't take long.
text: Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith come out of the Kitchen. The LIVING
text: ROOM is quite well appointed. There's a fire going in the
dialog: Fireplace.
text: The sound of a T.V. is coming from a ROOM off a HALL up
text: ahead. That is where Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith are headed.
text: They're more than half way across the LIVING ROOM when DING!
text: DONG!, the doorbell rings.
text: Mr. Smith gasps and looks beseechingly at Mr. Brooks. Without
text: an ounce of hurry, Mr. Brooks maneuvers him back into the
text: shadows of the KITCHEN.
text: The doorbell rings again.
text: A wet spot appears in Mr. Smith's crotch and runs down his
text: pant leg. Pee drips onto the linoleum.
text: A Man comes out of the Hallway. The Living Room light goes
dialog: on.
text: The Man is Jesse, Detective Atwood's estranged husband.
text: He opens the Front Door.
text: The Woman who comes in is Sheila, his divorce lawyer.
text: They kiss, tongues. His hands brush over her breasts. He
text: begins to unbutton her blouse. The kiss breaks. As he
text: continues unbuttoning.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: I called your wife's lawyer.
dialog: They're thinking about the five
dialog: million dollars.
text: Jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the
dialog: bra.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Realistically how much do you think
dialog: we can get?
text: Sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the LIVING
text: ROOM where she drops her briefcase on the couch.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: If we go to court, best case, two,
dialog: if she wants to settle, best case,
dialog: three, but I would be happy with
dialog: two seven.
text: Backlit by the Fireplace, Jesse kisses her again.
text: From the KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch Jesse unzip
text: Sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her
dialog: legs.
text: She steps out of them. He kisses the inside of her thighs,
text: her crotch, then standing up:
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: On his way out of the LIVING ROOM:
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I think we should hold firm for
dialog: three.
text: He shuts off the light. In the glow of the Fireplace, Sheila
text: removes her jacket.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Let's not be piggish, two five, two
dialog: seven, would be a good deal.
text: The T.V. goes silent. Jesse returns with a partially full
text: glass of Champagne.
text: He hands Sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out
text: of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass:
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: You've already had half a bottle.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You're late; if we want it, there's
dialog: more.
text: They clink glasses.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: To us.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: To three million dollars.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: (after a sip)
dialog: We have to do this fast because
dialog: remember, Marie is meeting us here.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We could ask her to join us.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Not funny.
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: (undoing the front of her
dialog: bra)
dialog: I wasn't trying to be.
text: She bops him playfully. He bends and slips a nipple into his
text: mouth. Sheila bites her lip and moans.
text: In the KITCHEN, Mr. Smith shifts around for a better view.
text: The floor under him CRREEEKKS!
text: In the LIVING ROOM, both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Are we alone?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Mr. Brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened
text: Kitchen with his gun raised. He's followed by Mr. Smith.
text: Sheila opens her mouth to scream.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Don't do that.
scene_heading: INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT
text: Detective Atwood hurries down the HALL and out of breath,
text: stops in front of Mr. Smith's door. She raps sharply. Waits a
text: bare three seconds and raps again.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Mr. Baffert?... Mr. Baffert?
text: The door of the Apartment behind her opens and an OLDER WOMAN
text: sticks her head out.
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
text: He's gone.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Atwood shows her badge.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD

speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
text: He skipped out. I heard him leave
dialog: this evening and a few minutes
dialog: later there were Movers here. Musta
dialog: been behind on the rent. He didn't
dialog: even say good-bye.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Thank you.
text: As the Old Lady watches, Atwood tries the knob. It's
text: unlocked. She pushes the door open.
text: The HALLWAY and LIVING ROOM she can see are completely empty.
text: Furniture, T.V., camera equipment, art, gone.
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: I told you.
scene_heading: INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT
text: On her way in, Atwood draws her gun.
text: Keeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN. All the
text: Cabinet doors are open. Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone.
text: She moves on to the BATHROOM. Soap, shampoo, toilet paper,
text: toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of
text: the Medicine Cabinet, gone.
text: She moves on to the BEDROOM. Bed, night table, lamps, T.V.,
text: computer, gone. Clothes closets, empty of everything.
text: She looks around. Mr. Smith's entire Apartment has been
dialog: stripped absolutely clean, except...
text: ... there's a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of
dialog: the Bedroom.
text: Atwood goes over and gets down on one knee. With her fingers
text: pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper
text: enough to make out that it's a work order from a Moving
dialog: company.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and
text: forefinger of her left hand, Atwood rises. There's the
text: silhouette of a Man in the doorway behind her.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Obviously Baffert's gone...
text: Atwood whirls, gun up. She sees that it's Snyder.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Goddamit, Snyder. Knock.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: I wasn't able to get the search
dialog: warrant.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: We may have gotten lucky.
dialog: (holding up the paper)
dialog: This is the Moving Company's work
dialog: order and...
dialog: (points))

dialog: address where they're taking
dialog: Baffert's stuff.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Where were you when you called me?
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
text: At home in bed.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Can you prove that?
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: I was home in bed, why should I
dialog: have to prove that?
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Your husband Jesse and his lawyer
dialog: were killed tonight...
text: Atwood slowly lowers her head and fixes her eyes on the floor
text: in stunned silence.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
text: It looks like the Thumbprint
dialog: Killer, I've been ordered to bring
dialog: you in for questioning.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Why, I didn't want Jesse dead, I
dialog: loved him, I hated what he was
dialog: doing to me...
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: It's on record you said you'd like
dialog: him dead and who better to fake a
dialog: Thumbprint killing than you.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: You can't actually believe I would
dialog: do that.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: If our jobs have taught us
dialog: anything, Tracy, is that people do
dialog: strange things. They just want to
dialog: ask you some questions.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: I will be happy to answer any
dialog: questions after we check out this
dialog: address.
text: Atwood goes to leave the room. Snyder blocks her way.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: I have to take you in, Tracy.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (waves the paper)
dialog: This is the answer to the
dialog: Thumbprint Killer, Snyder, and this
dialog: is where I'm going and you're not
dialog: going to stop me.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Don't make me cuff you, Tracy,
dialog: because I will if I have to.
text: Atwood smiles winningly.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: I believe you would.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: (smiles back)
dialog: You can count on it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Snyder never sees it coming. WHACK! Atwood's right cross
text: nails him exactly where the jaw meets the neck and down he
text: goes on his ass.
scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: (standing over him)
dialog: It would be nice if you could come
dialog: with me, but if you do and it goes
dialog: bad, they'll burn your ass. So this
dialog: never happened.

scene_heading: INT. MR. BROOKS' CAR Ñ NIGHT
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: That was great! It was fantastic!
dialog: It was everything I hoped it would

speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: You're welcome.
text: In the back seat:
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Here comes the gun.
text: Without taking his eyes off the road.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Yup.
text: Mr. Smith slides a pistol from under his jacket and points it
dialog: at Mr. Brooks.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (feigns surprise)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: You're smart enough to figure that
dialog: out, Mr. Brooks.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Well we're going sixty five miles
dialog: an hour, Mr. Smith, if you shoot me
dialog: now, there's a good chance we'll

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
text: Not now. Take the next off ramp.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: That wouldn't be very smart of me
dialog: would it?
text: He accelerates around a truck into the Fastlane. Mr. Smith
text: can see the Exit coming up, it's quickly left behind.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: Think about this. You pissed
dialog: yourself back there, you left your
text: DNA at the scene of a double
dialog: homicide, and there's nothing to
dialog: indicate that I was ever there. If
dialog: the Cops do an analysis of that
dialog: urine, and they will, you're the
dialog: Thumbprint Killer.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: (smug)
dialog: No. I still have pictures of you
dialog: doing the first murder.
text: Mr. Brooks smiles a knowing smile. Beyond him on the other
text: side of the Divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Yes. But what were you doing at the
dialog: second murder?
text: Mr. Smith doesn't have an answer for that.
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Let me help you with a thought. You
dialog: say I forced you to come along and
dialog: if I'm not here or more
dialog: specifically my body is not here to
dialog: say different, you might have a
dialog: chance to beat the rap. Now you're
dialog: probably asking yourself why I
dialog: would help you. I'm tired, Mr.
dialog: Smith, I'm tired of killing. But
dialog: I'm an addict, I can't quit. I've
dialog: tried. I can't do it on my own. So
dialog: I'll let you kill me but I want you
dialog: to do it smart, in a way that I
dialog: disappear and my family never knows
dialog: what I was.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: How do I do that?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: There's a cemetery I know about. We
dialog: find an open grave, you shoot me, I
dialog: fall in the grave, you shovel in
dialog: just enough earth to cover me,
text: tomorrow a casket is lowered onto
dialog: me and I've disappeared. It's a
dialog: good plan. What do you say?...
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Why should I trust you?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: You don't have to trust me. You're
dialog: the man holding the gun, you saw me
dialog: put mine in the trunk.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: I don't know. You really want me to
dialog: kill you?
speaker_heading: MR. BROOKS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Okay... But any sudden moves and
dialog: you're dead on the spot and I'll

speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Uh uh, take your hand out real

speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: What are you doing with a key to a

text: Atwood steps into an area of light.
text: The reflection off her face catches the attention of the Man
text: who is wearing a wide brimmed hat. He lifts his head.
text: It's Thorton Meeks. The Woman with him was the Driver of the
text: Van. She's wearing a watchcap.
text: Meeks gently takes his Companion's arm. They stop. Her eyes
text: go to where he's looking and then back to his. At some
text: unspoken signal they both draw their guns.
text: Intent on finding 517 and Baffert, the Couple hasn't
text: registered on Atwood's radar.
text: BANG! TWOCK! A chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to
text: her head. Startled, Atwood winces away. BANG! The Woman
text: fires. The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of

text: A hole appears in Atwood's sleeve. Atwood pulls the trigger
dialog: again.
text: SMACK! The Woman screams and falls back into Meeks, a bullet

scene_heading: DETECTIVE ATWOOD
dialog: Meeks?!!
text: Dragging the Woman in the direction of the stairs, BANG!

speaker_heading: EMMA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm here, go back to sleep, I'm
dialog: here.
text: Taking his hand, she lies back down. After a moment Mr.
text: Brooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us. His
text: lips begin to move but we can't hear what he's saying, so we
