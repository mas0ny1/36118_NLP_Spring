scene_heading: INT. OLD HALL - DAY
text: As if in a dream, childrens faces turn to look at camera in soundless

dialog: POV. Over this we fade up.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Lets hear it for our next young contestant, David Helfgott.
text: DAVID, nine, makes his way down the aisle clutching a score. His hair is

text: DAVID walks up some steps onto the stage.
dialog: Announcer
dialog: Davids going to play the piano for us, arent you David?
dialog: David
dialog: Yes.
text: Hes stage-struck by all those faces looking at him, including three judges -

dialog: Announcer
dialog: What are you going to play?
text: DAVIDs attention is taken by a fan nearby, blades whirring.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER

text: DAVID snaps out of it, when from the audience
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (stands)
dialog: Chopin! The Polonaise!
text: PETER smiles full of charm, and a little embarrassed at all eyes on him; he
text: applauds encouragingly then sits.
text: DAVIDs hells click on the bare boards as he crosses to the old upright piano
text: centre-stage. HE adjusts his music. His bony legs barely reac the pedals. HE
text: difgets, looks into the spotlight. He takes a deep breath, then launches into
text: Chopins Polonaise in A Flat, the first few bars ring out with unusual power,
text: surprising everyone - BEN ROSEN in particular.
text: DAVID attacks the keys with such gusto that the piano inches forward. HE hooks
text: his foot around the leg of the stool and drit in. He plays on. The piano moves
text: again. He blurs some notes. Again he readjusts the stool without missing a beat;
text: pages of his score flutter to the ground but DAVID plays on, undaunted, to the
text: end. ROSEN watches the courageous performance with wry amazement. PETER arrives
text: backstage flustered. To the ANNOUNCER :
speaker_heading: PETER
text: The piano, it is disgraceful.
text: The piano slews forward. DAVID stands and plays the final few bars with awesome
dialog: intensity.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER

scene_heading: INT. HELfgOTT HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: PETER.
text: RACHEL HELFGOTT, PETERs wife, lights the woodstove. Her face, once beautiful,

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ITs your turn, Daddy.
text: PETER flicks a look at the board a moves a piece.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know, David, when I was your age, I bought a violin, I saved for that

dialog: Peter
dialog: You are very lucky.
dialog: David
dialog: Yes Daddy.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
speaker_heading: (to DAVID)
dialog: I bet I couldve won.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in Yiddish)
dialog: Quiet.
text: DAVID pokes a face at MARGARET. She does the same to him, careful for PETER not

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Margaret!
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I told you, tell your friends not to come.

scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE. SIDEWAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT/EXT. HELFOYY HOUSE. BACKYARD - DAY

speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I hope I'm not interupting
text: PETER stands in the doorway looking down at him, resenting the intrusion.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Ben Rosen. I was one of the judges.
text: PETER doesn't accept the proffered handshae. He motions SUZIE in.
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (to ROSEN)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: Rosen
dialog: You left before all the prizes were announced.
text: DAVID appears behind PETER.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: You were very good this afternoon, David.
dialog: David
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Peter
dialog: He can play better.
dialog: Rosen
dialog: Maybe he was a little too good. Some people don't like that. We gave him a
dialog: special prize for his courage.
text: PETER takes the envelope from ROSEN and peels it open. MARGARET starts playing
text: the piano in the background.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: It was a very difficult piece you chose, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Daddy chose it.
text: ROSEN notices RACHEL sneak a look out the window at him.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
text: Even great pianists think twice before tackling the Polonbaise.
text: DAVID's eyes light up as PETER takes a pound note from the envelope.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A prize for losing!
text: He pockets the money.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: I wouldn't call him a loser.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in Yiddish, to MARGARET)
dialog: Stop, that is enough!
text: She stops playing.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: (in Yiddish)
dialog: She plays well too.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (disdainful)
dialog: They all play.
dialog: Rosen
dialog: I'm quite sure David could win lots of competitions with the right tuition.
text: He offers a business card showing his qualifications.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I teach him.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: You've obviously done well.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes - and no one taught me; no music teachers Mr. Rosen.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Of course, it's just that a few bad habits can sometimes mean the difference
dialog: between winning or losing.
dialog: He knows which strings to pull.
dialog: If you'd like to think about it.
text: He hands PETER the card. PETER holds his look and closes the door on him.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The house is in darkness
scene_heading: INT. HELFOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: In the bedroom PETER wakes to the sound of the piano filtering through from the
dialog: living area.
text: He walks down the hallway, drawn by the sparse, haunting music which is
text: familiar: Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto. Entering the living area he sees
text: DAVID playing the piano in near darkness. DAVID struggles to get his small
text: fingers across the keys, faltering to a stop
dialog: Peter
dialog: Rachmaninov?
dialog: David
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: PETER sits beside his son.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You taught yourself?
dialog: David
dialog: From the record.
dialog: Peter
dialog: The record?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You always play it.
text: PETER smiles.
dialog: Peter
dialog: It is very difficult, the hardest piece in the world, David.
dialog: David
dialog: Will you teach me?
text: Pause. PETER deflects.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: One day you will play it, you will make me very proud.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Next time, what are we going to do?

dialog: WE're going to win.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We're going to win!
dialog: (Kisses him.)
dialog: Now go to bed.
dialog: David
dialog: Goodnight, Daddy.
text: Moments later PETER takes a score from a battered suitcase full of music:
text: Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto. IT's awesome in its complexity, page after
text: page. PETER positions it on the piano, then contemplates the keys with his own
text: thickset, clumsy hands. The framed photo of the rabbi looks down at him. PETER
text: clenches his fists in frusturation.
scene_heading: EXT. BEN ROSEN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: DAVID and PETER walk along a cobbled path. DAVID stops to look at some goldfish
text: in a large pond. PETER bustles him along to the frontdoor of the house. RAIN
text: threatens. PETER rings the bell. DAVID smiles and goes to do the same but PETER
text: stops him with a look.
text: The door is opened by ROSEN.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I have decided I would like you to teach David.
dialog: (Hands him some music.)
dialog: This!
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Rachmaninov? Don't be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He can play it already.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: He's just a boy. How can he express that sort of passion?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You are a passionate man, Mr. Rosen. You will teach him, no?
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: No. I'll teach him what I think is best.
text: DAVID is entranced by some chimes hanging over his head.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Rachmaninov is best.
dialog: (No response.)
dialog: But you are his teacher; I let you decide.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Thank you. We'll start with Mozart.
text: He lets DAVID in and PETER goes to follow but the door is already closing on
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can't afford to pay.
text: The door shuts, leaving PETER stranded. It starts to rain. The sound of scales
text: issues from inside.
scene_heading: INT. ROSEN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: DAVID plays the scales. ROSEN spots PETER at the side window, peering in. ROSEN

scene_heading: EXT. ROSEN'S SIDEWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: Is this your room, David?

dialog: Sylvia
dialog: You can play?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Kind of, kind of play kind of sweet kind Sylvia.
dialog: (Picks up sheet music.)
dialog: Chopin, Sylvia, Chopinzee! The Pole-popolski. Like Daddy and his family before
dialog: they were concentrated.
text: He brushes a Rachmaninov score aside.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: How long have you been here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Golly, I don't know. Aeons I think, a few years, a few. And Schubert, nothing
dialog: wrong with Schubert except syphilis, was it syphilis? I think it was. Then he
dialog: got typhoid on top of it and that was the end of him wasn't it? We lost him -

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It is for his father to decide.
dialog: Rosen
dialog: David will be well looked after, I assure you.
text: RACHEL nods politely, unconvinced.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: (Perplexed, steps closer)
dialog: Rachel, David could well be one of the truly great pianists.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: He is just a boy, Mr. Rosen. He still wets the bed.
text: ROSEN absorbs this. MARGARET fumes past.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: A rickety pram wheel wobbles along. Widen to reveal PETER pushing the
text: dilapidated old pram down the ordinary suburban street, flanked by DAVID and
text: SUZIE wearing grubby school uniforms.
text: Several kids playing hopscotch stop as they see them approaching, then clear a
text: path for the odd trio to pass. SUZIE looks down her nose at them. DAVID performs
text: the hopscotch without missing a beat as the trio continues on its way. The kids
text: watch after them, like they were from another planet.
text: Wide shot. DAVID and SUZIE collect several bottles which have been left on the
text: sidewalk, put them in the pram and walk on with PETER.
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE. BACKYARD - DAY
text: PETER straddles a large piece of scrap metal - the head of a truck engine - and
text: heaves it off the pram with a great sense of satisfaction. It joins a pile of
text: metal and a stack of empty bottles in the corner of the yard.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You see how fit I am, you see how strong?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Show me Daddy, show me where the lion scratched you when you worked at the
dialog: circus.
text: PETER extends his hand with a sense of theatricality to reveal a long, jagged
dialog: scar.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's what happens when you get too close to the bars.
text: He stands in a body-builder pose, barrel-chested.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come on David, hit me.
dialog: Suzie
dialog: Me!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: David, as hard as you can.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay. Here comes. Ready.
text: DAVID's punch bounces off PETER's stomach.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: My turn Daddy.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Harder. Come on!
dialog: (DAVID punches again.)
dialog: You see. A man of steel.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Steel alright.
text: (Rubbing his fist.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No one can hurt me! Because in this world only the fit survive.
text: RACHEL watches from the laundry, sweating over the hot copper; she sees another
dialog: side to the fun and games.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The weak get crushed like insects. Believe me, if you want to survive in America
dialog: you have to be fit and strong, like me.
scene_heading: INT. SYNAGOGUE. OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: An elderly receptionist types with one finger on an antiquated typewriter. PETER
text: sits in the narrow corridor, arms folded tightly. He would rather be somewhere
text: else. On the wall opposite him a long line of faces - the portraits of past
text: rabbis of the synagogue stare down.
text: PETER glances at the folded newspaper on the seat next to him: The Maccabean. On
text: the front page - a photo of DAVID seated at the piano with a smiling PETER,
text: pointing at a score as if taking DAVID through a lesson.
text: The elderly typist removes the sheet from the typewriter and smiles at PETER. He
text: nods politely, then resumes his steely composure. The door to the RABBI's office
text: opens. PETER stands.
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: (exits the office with David)
dialog: See you next week David, and don't forget to study.
dialog: (He hands him the 'soncino chumash'.)
dialog: We'll see you in Schul, Elias.
text: PETER feigns a polite smile.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you Rabbi.
text: They walk off. DAVID takes The Maccabean from him, noting tstand displaying more
text: copies of this latest issue. PETER puts his arm on DAVID's shoulder, draws him
text: in, as if protecting him from an invisible foe. The RABBI considers it, then
text: goes back into his office.
scene_heading: EXT. BEN ROSEN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The POSTMAN rides along the street, past DAVID waiting expectantly at his front
dialog: gate. No mail today.
text: DAVID watches after him, sighs.
scene_heading: INT. BOKSER MANSION - NIGHT
text: A chandelier glistens above the entry. DAVID and PETER enter tentatively. The
text: foyer is dripping with dignity and provincial social elite. DAVID and PETER are
text: immediately set on by the hostess, MRS. BOKSER, a busy socialite.
speaker_heading: MRS. BOKSER
dialog: Mr. Helfott, it's exciting isn't it? David, the Lord Mayor's dying to meet you.
text: She takes DAVID by the hand, dragging him away. A WAITER offers PETER a drink
text: from a try but PETER's attention is on DAVID being whisked away.
text: Cut to a short while later. Faces glowing with appreciation and sparkling
text: jewellery surround DAVID.
dialog: MRS. Bokser
dialog: And I would like to thank our wonderful Lord Mayor for establishing this fund
dialog: for David to go to America.
dialog: (Applause.)
dialog: And now to play for us, our very own David Helfgott.
text: ROSEN notes PETER's embittered look around the room as the gathering smothers
text: DAVID with affection on his way to the piano - a shake of the hand, a kiss, etc.
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: PETER's voice can be heard raging inside.
speaker_heading: PETER - (V.o)
dialog: These people are a disgrace!
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE. GIRL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: SUZIE nestles up to MARGARET and baby LOUISE, frightened by the yelling.
speaker_heading: PETER - (V.O.)
text: A disgrace.
dialog: (A loud thump.)
dialog: They think they are so important.
dialog: (Curses in Yiddish.)
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE. LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Peter paces, like a caged lion, bursting with anger.
dialog: Peter
dialog: What do they know with their furs and their diamonds? It makes me sick to the
dialog: stomach.
text: RACHEL is on the receiving end.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And Rosen. Pah!
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT - NIGHT
text: DAVID lies in bed listening.
speaker_heading: PETER - (V.O.)
dialog: What kind of man is he? He has no children. He's not married, I know! Don't talk
dialog: to me about Rosen.
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE. LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: PETER curses again in Yiddish.
dialog: Rachel
dialog: He only wants for David the same as you have always wanted.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't ever compare me to him. What has he suffered? Not a day in his life! What
dialog: does he know about families? Do you forget how your sisters died?
text: He thumps the wall by he photograph o RACHEL and her sisters.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And my mother and father.
dialog: (Yiddish.)
dialog: Stupid woman. Stupid!
text: Cut to later. PETER sits in near darkness, just staring it seems. We realize he
text: is looking at a scrapbook, articles and photos of DAVID throughout his brief but
text: stunning career, including a photo with Isaac Stern.
text: PETER stares, his mind turning the same thing over and over
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: DAVID is asleep. A shadow falls across him. It's PETER. He comes over and stands
text: there, burdened, watching over his sleeping son. He kisses DAVID lovingly on the
dialog: forehead.
scene_heading: INT. AUSTRALIA-SOVIET SOCIETY. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
text: DAVID bows to warm applause.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Thank you Comrade Helfgott; your son is a credit to you.
text: PETER proudly puts his hand on DAVID's shoulder. On the wall there's a communist
text: flag and a Stalin portrait.
text: The gathering consists of 25 people, members of the society. One woman, in her
text: mid-seventies, warmly applauds her appreciation of DAVID's talent.
text: Cut to later. Cocktails are being served. PETER is involved in a discussion. He
text: looks around for DAVID. No sign.
scene_heading: INT. THE SOCIETY READING ROOM - NIGHT
text: DAVID takes a book from the shelf - it's on Russia. A GIRL, about 17, stares at
text: him through the shelves.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You play beautifully.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: My name is Sonia.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: SONIA

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So do you.
text: She smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: SONIA
dialog: You're going to America?

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Excuse us. Ther eis someone important who wants to meet you, David.
scene_heading: INT. THE SOCIETY READING ROOM - NIGHT
text: We recognize the woman from above - KATHERINE SUSANNAH PRICHARD. Her face
text: reflects a sharp intelligence and strong humanity.
dialog: Katherine
dialog: I've never met anyone who plays the piano as beautifully as you, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And I've never met a writer before, Mrs. Prichard.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You must be very proud of him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: As proud as a father can be.
text: KATHERINE smiles.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I have a long-suffering old piano at home.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A suffering piano?
dialog: Katherine
dialog: From neglect. Perhaps you'd come and play it for me, David?
text: PETER goes to speak, but DAVID interrupts.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh yes, anything to help.
dialog: klatherine
dialog: I'd like that very much.
dialog: david
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY - (O/S)

text: As KATHERINE joins the SECRETARY up front, she smiles at DAVID.
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (Nudges DAVID)
dialog: Smile. Look happy.
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - DAY
text: DAVID hurries out the front door excitedy at the sound of the POSTMAN's whistle.
text: The POSTMAN finds a letter for DAVID in his satchel and holds it away before
text: playfully dropping it into the letter box. DAVID grabs it and registers where
dialog: it's come from.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: America!
scene_heading: INT. HELFgOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: David excitedly reads a letter from 'The Michleburg family - New Jersey'.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 'we have been informed of your exceptional talent and can only say how
dialog: privileged we feel to have you come and stay with us'.
text: PETER listens as he chops vegetables on a board, alongside several marrow bones.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 'You will be pleased to know that we are having the Bosendorfer tuned especially
dialog: for you.'
text: PETER scoops the vegetables into a steaming pot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 'We eagerly await your innement -'
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Imminent, fool.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: I wonder if they've got a cadillac?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 'Imminent arrival And look forward to hearing you play for us. Kindest wishes,
dialog: Simon and Basha Mickleburg.'
text: PETER chops more vegetables - the simple words are like daggers. RACHEL is
text: mindful of his brooding silence.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Read it again.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Not again!
text: She turns the radio up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're just jealous.
text: PETER simmers
speaker_heading: SUZIE
text: Just the bit about the parakeet and the dog and the two cats.
text: MARGARET puts her hands over her ears.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ' you'll enjoy the company of our parakeet and our poodle called Margaret'.
speaker_heading: MArgaret
dialog: Pig! It is not!
text: She grabs the letter and DAVID tries to get it; all yelling, playing 'keepings
text: off' around the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jealous, jealous, give it!
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Pig! Pig!
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: ENOUGH!
text: He sweeps a bottle of milk off the bench; it explods at SUZIE's feet.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Enough of this nonsense!
text: DAVID pales as PETER tears the letter up. SUZIE cries.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Daddy?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Forget it! You are not going. David is not going anywhere.
dialog: (Silence.)
dialog: What are you looking at, you fools? He is not going to America! I won't let
dialog: anyone destroy this family!
dialog: David
dialog: Daddy, but Daddy please -
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know what is best, David. I know because I am your father and this is your
dialog: family.
text: Stunned silence. DAVID runs out of the house.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: David! David come back -
text: The door slams.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (in Yiddish)Why now!? Why!?
text: PETER slaps her.
scene_heading: EXT. BEN ROSEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The house is in darkness. DAVID knocks. He's been running, in a sweat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mr. Rosen?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mr. Rosen. It's David.
text: (He bangs at the door.)
dialog: Please Mr. Rosen. Please
text: There's nobody home. DAVID slides down the door, clutching his knees,
text: bewildered.
text: Cut to water rippling in the moonlight. DAVID's reflection appears in the pond.
text: He watches the distortion of his face in the water, then slaps the surface and
text: after a moment the image settles again. He puts his head under, right up to his
dialog: shoulders.
text: Cut to underwater, DAVID's face, as bubbles escape from his mouth. In fact we
dialog: are :
scene_heading: INT. HELFOTT BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: We realize DAVID's face is underwater in the bath. He surfaces, for air and
text: just stares, breathing awkwardly.
text: PETER enters in a dressing gown.
speaker_heading: PEter
dialog: Come on David, you have been long enough. Are you feeling better now? Silly boy,
dialog: all this nonsense. This is your home, this is where you belong
text: DAVID's POV: PETER peeling off his dressing gown singlet, talking but there is
text: no sound - it's like a dream. PETER goes to get in but stops as he sees
text: something in the bath that horrifies him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: David!
text: (He slaps David's head.)
dialog: You animal. You disgusting animal.
text: He slashes at DAVID with a white singlet, splashing water everywhere.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: To shit in the bath. To do this to me. You callous boy. To shit like an animal.
text: DAVID barely reacts as the attack with the wet singlet continues, across his
text: bare back, his head water arcs across the small bathroom with each blow.
text: Just as suddenly as it started, it's over. PETER is gone. Water runs down the
text: walls like blood. A drop forms on the flickering light globe, then falls. DAVID
text: just stares in shock. Silence.
scene_heading: INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY
text: RACHEL is huddled with SUZIE, MARGARET and LOUISE in the upper balcony. The
text: Jewish community watches as DAVID sings from the Torah, taking his bar mitzvah,
text: head bowed, almost cowering.
text: ROSEN senses something is wrong. He looks across at PETER whose stern unwavering
text: expression gives nothing away.
text: Close-up: PETER, a man of steel.
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Wide shot. The house is in near darkness. ROSEN walks up purposefully and
text: scrapes the front gate open. He knocks at the door. No answer.
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: In the hallway - ROSEN's silhouette through the opawue glass. He knocks again.
text: Reveal PETER, in the shadowy darkness, the outside world completely shut out.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOUNGEROOM - NIGHT
text: The air is thick with tension. RACHEL amuses little LOUISE. SUZIE flips through
text: the scrapbook. MARGARET fingers the same note on the piano. All stop as the
text: knocking echoes again through the solemn quiet, like a knell. Silence.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: This house is like a concentration camp.
text: She lets the piano lid drop shut. In the hallway ROSEN's shadow waits at the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: ROSEN - (V.O.)
dialog: Peter? I know you can hear me. Don't do this to David. You mustn't.
text: PETER's eyes glow with anger in the darkness.
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Peter!
text: ROSEN give up, turns to go, but then as an afterthought:
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Whatever you do, don't inflict bloddy Rachmaninov on him. He's not ready!
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: In the hallway - ROSEN's shadow disappears. The gate is heard scraping open as
text: he leaves.
text: PETER just stands there. The sound ofROSEN's car is heard driving away, the
text: headlights flicker across PETER's face.
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: PETER stands over the bed where DAVID lies, facing away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: David
dialog: (No reply.)
dialog: David. My boy? Still you don't speak to me?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's a terrible thing to hate, to hate your fatehr.
text: Silence. He sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Life is cruel, but music, it will always be your friend. Everything else will
dialog: let you down in the end. Everything. Believe me.
dialog: (Pause.)
dialog: Please don't hate me David.
text: He begins to cry. He sobs
text: DAVID looks at his father crying, full of confusion. Their eyes meet and PETER
text: pulls DAVID up and hugs him. DAVID throws his arms around his neck.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in Yiddish)
dialog: Don't hate me.
text: PETER kisses DAVID repeatedly on the side of the face, all the while stuttering:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's tough, life can be tough but you have to survive, say it. You have to -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Survive, Daddy
dialog: Peter
dialog: That's right, David. No one will love you like me. You can't trust anyone but I
dialog: will always be there always be with you, forever. Do you understand?
dialog: David
dialog: Yes, Daddy, forever
text: They hug as we begin to pull back looking down on them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Forever and ever
speaker_heading: PETER AND DAVID
dialog: Forever and ever
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S ROOM. EDEN LODGE - NIGHT
text: ADULT DAVID sits on the floor in the middle of the room, scrounging for a match
text: amidst the mess of paper and music spread around him. He picks up something.
text: It's a crumpled old letter with distinctive letterhead: Royal College of Music.
text: DAVID peers myopically at it - we only glimpse a few words: 'Dear Mr. Helfgott,
dialog: we are pleased to inform you'
text: Fade up - music, from the past - 'Sospiro' by Liszt. It continues over:
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TUNNEL. DAY. THE PAST.
text: The train exits a tunnel into bright strobing light.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERGROWN DRIVEWAY OF KATHERINE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Bright light pours through a jungle of trees and exotic plants. DAVID makes his
text: way down the long overgrown drive. Finally, a small weatherboard cottage comes
text: into view, its verandah wreathed in wisteria, jasmine and honeysuckle.
scene_heading: EXT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE. VERANDAH - NIGHT
text: A photograph of DAVID is removed from a paper bag. It's DAVID at his best,
text: supremely confident.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Perfect; I'll treasure it until the day I die.
text: DAVID has finished eating dinner.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Are you full?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Full as a goog, Katherine; full as a goog.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: David plays the final bars of the Appassionata. When he finishes, he looks to
text: KATHERINE in front of several photos on the mantel, lost in the past, moved by
text: his palying.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Each time you play 'Sospiro' it expresses so completely the inexpressible.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (sits next to him)
dialog: It's divine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Inexpressibly divine.
dialog: Katherine
dialog: Quite!
text: He starts playing again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tell me a story, Katherine. What story is it today?
text: DAVID watches her - eyes closed, head swaying.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
text: A new story - drops of water.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Raindrops?
speaker_heading: KaTHERINE
dialog: Yes, raindrops.
text: DAVID's head sways as he plays the passage.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Listen. It's the wind.
text: Cut to the verandah. Moonlight filters through.
speaker_heading: DAVID - (V.O.)
dialog: The wind!
text: Leaves flutter across the ground Branches sway
speaker_heading: DAVID - (V.0.)
dialog: The stream
dialog: Katherine - (V.O.)
dialog: The river
speaker_heading: DAVID - (V.O.)
dialog: The ocean, Katherine!
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The photograph of DAVID, now framed, is on the mantel.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE's VOICE
dialog: You are Krishna, Christ and Dionysus. In your beauty, tenderness and strength
dialog: 
text: The camera moves towards the piano, where DAVID is stooped over. We just see the
text: top of his head until he lokos up and, we realize, years have passed.
text: DAVID is now a young adult. He scribbles the words of the poem onto a score,
text: awed by their beauty as she continues to read.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: 'To you, all these wild weeds and wind flowers of my life. I bring my lord and
dialog: lay them at your feet.'
scene_heading: EXT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Wide shot. Lights burn warmly in the windows of the old home.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: the front door opens and KATHERINE sees DAVID out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good night, Katherine.
text: She kisses him warmly. He ambles off, awkward as a puppy, into the night.
dialog: Katherine
dialog: Good luck, David.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
text: Stagehands carefully position the grand piano onstage. Lights and curtains are
text: being set for a performance. Cut to backstage, hands soak in a steaming bowl of
text: water, next to it is a score of Rachmaninov's Third. DAVID warms his hands in
text: the water, the poise and confidence of his younger years gone, replaced by a
text: shambling insecurity. He throws a nervous look around at the other contestants:
text: A CELLIST warms up, a VIOLINIST paces, a CONTESTANT goes over her score while
text: another pianist, ROGER, 25, warms up on an old upright piano in the corner.
text: Cut to the foyer. The audience assembles, waiting to go in. A poster tells us
text: the occasion is the 'ABC - NATIONAL CONCERTO COMPETITION'.
text: Arriving amidst the furs and jewellery, PETER is just another face in the crowd.
text: Something draws his attention: BEN ROSEN on the stair. He catches PETER looking.
text: Neither hids their contempt. ROSEN comments to his companion:
speaker_heading: ROSEN
dialog: Poor man's Leopold Mozart.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Onstage. A piano cover is removed revealing gold letters : 'BOSENDORFER'. DAVID
text: is drawn towards the grand piano, mesmerized by its magnificence. He circles it,

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's a tough game isn't it, Roger?
speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What was he like, Katherine?
text: She looks up from her book.
dialog: david
dialog: Your father.
text: She puts the book aside.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: He was forever busy in his study. 'Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,' he'd always
dialog: say. One day, I was very young, I got so annoyed I emptied the inkpots all over
text: his desk and I scrawled on his work, pages of it. When he saw it he stood there
text: seething with anger; I could feel it.
text: David fills with dread.
dialog: katherine
dialog: 'What are you doing?' he shouted.
text: It startles DAVID, feeding his own fears.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: There was this terrible silence. I just stared at him and said, 'Go away, daddy,
dialog: I'm writing.'
text: David is suspended.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
text: He ran at me and picked me up, and cuddled me breathless. My first literary
dialog: effort he always called it.
text: Silence. KATHERINE sees there's something troubling DAVID.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: What is it?
dialog: (No reply.)
dialog: David?
text: He extracts a letter from his pocket. She takes it and reads it.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: The Royal College of Music. A scholarship. David that's marvelous!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Won't cuddle me Katherine, oh no.
text: He wrings his hands full of anxiety.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: He can't stop you, David.
dialog: David
dialog: Such an angry lion.
dialog: Katherine
dialog: Nonsense, he's a pussycat.
text: She holds him comfortingly and looks into his uncertain eyes to give him
dialog: strength.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I'll miss you.
scene_heading: INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Close-up - a small box which KATHERINE takes from the sideboard.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: These were for my son but he left home before I could give them to him.
text: DAVID opens it and takes out an exquisite pair of red fur-lined kid gloves.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: You'll need them. It gets very, very cold in London.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
text: A fiery red sky. DAVID walks along, churning with anxiety. He stops and takes
text: the gloves out of the gladstone bag he's carrying. He draws them on, then walks
text: off leaving the bag behind.
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: DAVID enters quietly, makes his way through the darkness.
speaker_heading: PETER's VOICE
dialog: Where have you been?
text: A table lam is switched on to reveal PETER sitting there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I missed the train.
text: PETER's eyes glow with hostility.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That Prichard woman!
text: DAVID goes to move away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What is this?
text: The gloves DAVID's wearing. He takes a backward step.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
dialog: (Stands.)
dialog: Look at me. Look at me!
text: DAVID has no choice. PETER's eyes burn through him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: David?
text: DAVID slowly extracts the letter, backs away as PETER reads.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You think you can just do as you please? Huh?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I I want to go; I'm going. You can't stop me.
text: A terrible silence. Then PETER comes at DAVID like a lumbering bear.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I am your father. Your father! Who has done everything for you; you cruel,
dialog: callous boy!
text: DAVID tries uselessly to fend him off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Daddy -
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I am your father!
text: He slaps DAVID around the head, kocking his glasses off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please Daddy -
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Stupid boy!
text: SUZIE runs in and tries to pull PETER away.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: No -
text: PETER gives SUZIE a backhand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's not Suzie's fault.
text: DAVID charges forward, crashing PETER into the wall.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (racing in)
dialog: Stop it! Stop it!
text: PETER throws DAVID across the room. MARGARET intervenes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Get out of the way!
text: He picks up a chair and throws it against the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: RACHEL - (V.O.)
dialog: (screams)
dialog: No!
text: Dogs bark. Neighbours' lights go on.
scene_heading: INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: You want to go? Go! Go on!
text: He has DAVID in a headlock, choking him. They bang into the walls, locked
text: together in a fierce struggle. The photo of the rabbi crashes to the ground.
text: Furniture is skittled - chess pieces scattered.
dialog: Rachel
dialog: (screams, in Yiddish)
dialog: No! Stop! Stop!
text: She bashes his arms with her fists trying to get him to let go of DAVID who
text: can't breathe. MARGARET tries to pull PETER away.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'll get the police!
text: Finally, PETER lets go of DAVID who slumps to the floor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's alright, leave him.
text: Catching his breath, he sees his terrified family, only now registering the
dialog: horror of what has happened.
text: Silence. DAVID fumbles for his glasses. He picks up the crumpled letter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: David, are you alright? Are you?
text: PETER approaches, with remorse.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come on, David.
dialog: David
dialog: I'm old enough to make up my own mind.
text: He backs away, into the corridor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (laughs)
text: He thinks he's going to London.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've been accepted by the Royal College of Music.
text: DAVID is full of confusion.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What do you think is going to happen to you in London?
text: DAVID wipes his bloody nose, edges down the corridor.
dialog: Peter
dialog: David, listen to me. If you go, you will never be anybody;s son, the girls will
dialog: lose a brother. Is that what you want? You want to destroy this family.
dialog: david
dialog: I'm sorry, sorry -
text: He opens the door. RACHEL holds the girls, all crying.
dialog: Peter
dialog: If you love me you will stop this nonsense; you will not step outside that door.
dialog: Don't make me do it!
dialog: david
dialog: Sorry
dialog: peter
dialog: David!
text: DAVID steps over the threshold.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You will be punished for the rest of your life!!
speaker_heading: SUZIE
speaker_heading: DAVID!
text: The door slams shut.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: DAVID runs, in a sweat, on the road to KATHERINE's. The headlights of a car bear
text: straight down on him. It blasts its horn as it swerves around him.
text: Cut to a blazing fire in:
scene_heading: EXT. HELFGOTT BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Music scores burn, school books, David's clothes PETER throws another pile on,
text: stokes the flames.
text: Burning in the fire is the scrapbook - images of YOUNG DAVID surrender to the
text: flames.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - DAY
text: 'The Royal College of Music' - gold letters carved in stone above the entrance.
text: ADULT DAVID looks up: we are back in the present. He absorbs the imposing
text: building as he shuffles up the steps. Behind him, the magnificent dome of the
dialog: Albert Hall.
text: On the curb, GILLIAN is getting out of a taxi. When she looks around, there's no
text: sign of DAVID.
scene_heading: INT. RCOM CORRIDOR. DAY - The present
text: DAVID shuffles along, past the practice rooms from where different instruments
text: sound, merging into one another as DAVID continues on his hourney, his face full
text: of childish wonder. He hears something distinct a piano. He goes to the source,
text: a practice room at the enf of the corridor. He peers through the narrow glass
dialog: panel, into:
scene_heading: INT. PRACTICE ROOM. DAY - the present
text: There's a female student practicing with her teacher. She notices the face at
text: the door a moment before it ducks out of sight.
text: DAVID sneaks another impish look in the quickly retreats. Again, his face
text: slides into frame and retreats.
text: As if by magic, when the face appears again, it's no longer ADULT DAVID, but the
text: YOUNGER DAVID, longer hair falling in ringlets around his face.
scene_heading: INT. PRACTICE ROOM - DAY
text: We are back in the past and there's an elderly teacher in the practice room who
text: looks at his watch impatiently to make a point.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Bravo, David. Now remind me why I'm here.
speaker_heading: DAVId
dialog: (enters)
dialog: Sorry, Mr. Parkes, sorry.
text: PROFESSOR CECIL PARKES is in his sixties. His left arm hangs limply by his side,
text: crippled by a stroke.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: It's fortunate I'm a deeply forgiving human being.
speaker_heading: DAVID's VOICE
dialog: Liszt was like that, wasn't he, a great humanitarian - not that I ever met him,
dialog: knew him personallor anything but he had a respect for every living breathing
dialog: creature; so that was nice of him, wasn't it? Or so I read.
dialog: (Plonks a book down.)
dialog: Very improvisatorial, very sensual, Mr. Parkes. Virtuosic.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Bacchanalian! Boldness of attack!
text: He bashes out chords with his one good arm.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Diablerie! The Devil, David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whooaah, mustn't break the piano.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Liszt broke plenty!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right!
text: Swept up, DAVID bashes out some chords - PARKES stops him.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: But you must play what's on the page; you're not Liszt, remember.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Not even slightly Mozart.
text: PARKES plays (with his good hand) to demonstrate.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Come on, fill in for this useless arm of mine.
text: David plays the 'other hand'.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: The notes first, your interpretation comes on top of them.
speaker_heading: DAVId
dialog: On top, yes.
text: PARKES enjoys their playing together. He likes DAVID.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: You agree, do you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh yes, I always agree.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Is that wise?
speaker_heading: DAVId
dialog: I don't know. Is it?
text: They play on. DAVID works the pedals; he's wearing odd shoes, a black one and a
dialog: brown one.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Don't forget, it's on the page.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well yes, the notes are, but not the feeling, the emotions which is what I feel.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: You mustn't sacrifice everything to emotion. It's a question of balance.
speaker_heading: DAVId
dialog: Is that the question, Professor?
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Precisely.
speaker_heading: DAVId
dialog: I thought so.
scene_heading: INT. RCOM FOYER - DAY
text: A throng of students is going up the stairs. DAVID is coming down the other way,
text: bumping into everyone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry sorry, oops, beg pardon. You look lovely today, Sarah, simply beautiful.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thank you, David.
dialog: david
dialog: You too, Muriel.
dialog: Male student
dialog: Ease up, Helfgott.
text: Laughter; DAVID's popular with them.
speaker_heading: REGISTRAR
dialog: Mr. Helfgott. Your allowance cheque.
text: Two students - ASHLEY and ROBERT - look on.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
speaker_heading: (to ASHLEY)
dialog: Pay day. David!
text: They flank DAVID as he heads through the foyer.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You missed the bank. Pity! You'll have to wait until tomorrow.
dialog: david
dialog: Can't bank on the bank.
dialog: ashley
dialog: We know someone who'll cash it, David.
dialog: david
dialog: Do we Ashley? Do we really?
dialog: robert
dialog: What are friends for?
dialog: As they exit to:
scene_heading: EXT. RCOM - DAY
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 'All you need is friends', whoahhh. It's what the Beatles say.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: 'Love' dear David
dialog: David
dialog: Yes, Ashley darling?
dialog: robert
dialog: Taxi!
scene_heading: INT. SOHO STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
text: DAVID crosses to ASHLEY and ROBERT with a tray full of drinks, while a stripper
text: bums and grinds. They drink at DAVID's expense and puff on cigars, including
speaker_heading: DAVID.
scene_heading: EXT. SOHO - NIGHT
text: DAVID walks along stuffing his mouth with choclate and Coke, taking in the
text: sights. A transvestite with bright red-dyed hair and make-up steps out of a
dialog: dorrway - RAY.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Got a cigarette, love?
dialog: david
dialog: A cigarette love - love a cigarette.
text: He offers the packet.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm Ray.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ray? Ray! Raylene! Whooah, pleased to meet you. I'm David, David Helfgott.
dialog: Ridiculous!
text: RAY lights up the cigarette, then puts an arm around DAVID.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're very friendly, aren't you David?
dialog: David
dialog: Friendly? Do you think so? That's very important isn't it?
dialog: ray
dialog: If you say so, sweetheart.
text: He steers innocent DAVID into an alleyway.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE - SUNRISE
text: Close-up: the bobbing face of a pigeon. It coos. DAVID's eyes blink open. He
text: sees the pigeon and coos back. His face has traces of make-up on it. Under his
text: jacket he's now wearing the lurex vest we say o on RAY.
text: New angle. DAVID is curled up under a massive statue of a lion (which guards
text: Nelson's column). Nearby a MAN hoses away bird shit.
text: Wide shot. DAVID shuffles off in the early morning light, across the empty
dialog: square.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. UPPER WINDOW. RCOM - DAY
text: PARKES and another teacher, GORDON VINEY, 50, sip tea as they look out the
text: window onto the street below.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: He has the most fantastic hands.
dialog: viney
dialog: Not connected to anything above the sholders.
dialog: Their POV.
text: David hurrying up some steps in the College grounds. He drops music everywhere.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: He's a little fragile.
dialog: viney
dialog: A chopinzee!
text: PARKES isn't amused.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: I've seen enough to suggest he can make the finals of the concerto trials.
speaker_heading: VINEY
dialog: And what have you seen, Cecil?
text: A gleam in PARKES' eye.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Moments of genius.
dialog: Viney
dialog: (laugh, bemused)
dialog: Genius. Oh really!
text: POV below - DAVID scrambles chaotically after his music.
scene_heading: INT. RCOM - DAY
text: DAVID hurries down the corridor.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: David!
text: He spins around to be met by GILLIAN walking towards him - we are back in the
text: present. ADULT DAVID looks completely baffled.
speaker_heading: ADULT DAVID
dialog: Gillian, what are you doing here?
scene_heading: INT. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY - Present
text: RONALD IRWIN - the Director of the College - is a distinguished-looking forty.
text: He pours tea for GILLIAN while DAVID looks at framed photos and various
text: certificates on the wall, shuffling from one frame to another.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Is he aware of what happened? Does he remember?
dialog: gillian
dialog: Ask him.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Do you remember much from your student days, David?
dialog: david
dialog: Oh yes, yes absolutely. Everything. Well kind of, kind of; or is it a bit of a
text: blank, a bit of a scrabble, the pieces missing - is that it?
dialog: gillian
dialog: You're the only one that knows that.
dialog: david
dialog: That's right darling, the only one -
dialog: gillian
dialog: You were here.
dialog: david
dialog: I was, I was here, that's right I was; it seems to be true. Is it true? Or is
dialog: that just the way it is?
dialog: Gillian
dialog: The way what is, David?
dialog: david
dialog: Scrabble, darling.
dialog: (To Irwin.)
dialog: It's a tough game, isn't it? A bloodsport.
dialog: gillian
dialog: Not quite.
text: He mumbles on as he turns back to the photos.
dialog: Gillian
dialog: Filling in the blanks is what it's all about, as you can see.
text: IRWIN takes in the mumbling, stooping figure of DAVID, finding it hard to
dialog: believe.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: That performance he gave for the concerto finals, Rachmaninov's Third. I'll
dialog: never forget it; I doubt anyone could.
dialog: David
dialog: Whooaahh Professor!
text: It's a photo of PARKES - now Sir Cecil Parkes.
scene_heading: INT. RCOM CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Doors burst open and YOUNG DAVID tears down the corridor. We are back in the
text: past. He slides to a stop in front of a notice: 'CONCERTO MEDAL FINALISTS
dialog: (Patron: H.M. The Queen Mother)'.
text: 'David Helfgott' is on the list of six pinned on the notice board.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: How on earth did we manage to make the finals, dear David?
text: DAVID - out of breath - can't believe it.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You're a conductor's nightmare.
text: DAVID pulls a 'nightmare' face as he registers his name on the list.
speaker_heading: DAVId
dialog: It's true, it's true.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: What are we going to do?
dialog: david
dialog: We're going to win, Ashley-Robert. We're going to win!
scene_heading: INT. PRACTICE ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: Are you sure?
text: He takes the Rachmaninov Concerto score from DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm never sure about anything, Mr. Parkes.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: The Rach' 3? It's monumental.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A mountain! The hardest piece you could everest play.
text: A moment. PARKES dares to even consider it.
speaker_heading: PARKES
dialog: No one's ever been mad enough to attempt the Rach' 3.
speaker_heading: DAvid
dialog: Am I mad enough Professor? Am I?
scene_heading: INT. RCOM CORRIDOR. DAY - The present
text: STUDENTS mill past ADULT DAVID, GILLIAN and the College DIRECTOR walking in the

scene_heading: INT. RCOM. SAME CORRIDOR. DAY - The past
text: STUDENTS clear a path for YOUNG DAVID, bumping past them, in a flap.
speaker_heading: DAVID's voice
dialog: 'Got to practice, Katherine; there's three important things Mr. Parkes says:
dialog: "Work, work, work"'
text: DAVID hurries from one door to the next, looking into the practice rooms which
text: are all occupied by students practicing on the pianos room after room.
speaker_heading: DAVID's voice
dialog: 'You see, I am to play in a very special competition and the winner gets to play
dialog: ath the Albert Hall before her Highest Royalness the Queen Mum'
text: He arrives at a practice room door, the glass obscured by a jacket hanging on
text: the inside. He opens the door and is back by the sight of TWO STUDENTS in an
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whooahh, a duet! Sorry.
text: He shuts the door, sits in the corridor and proceeds to practice in his head.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PIANO STORE - DAY
text: David's voice
dialog: 'So I bought a piano, how's that Katherine? '
text: DAVID presses his face against the window, looking in at the exquisite range of
