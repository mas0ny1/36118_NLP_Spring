dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEVON, ENGLAND. A SUMMER'S DAY, 1912.
dialog: 
text: The bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside. We fly
text: low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of
text: years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor,
text: ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a
dialog: typical Devonshire dale.
dialog: 
text: We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant
text: mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth.
text: The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with
dialog: assurance and authority.
dialog: 
text: We pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy,
text: watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl.
dialog: Easy.
dialog: 
text: The men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult
dialog: birth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARMER 2
dialog: This is a stubborn one, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARMER 3
dialog: There we go. Who's a clever girl?
dialog: 
text: Moments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky
text: hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a
text: distinctive white cross on its forehead.
dialog: 
text: Soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is
dialog: both awesome and comical to see the new born creature
text: struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds.
speaker_heading: Title: WAR HORSE
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS.
dialog: 
text: We follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year.
text: His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the
dialog: intimacy of their relationship.
dialog: 
text: As Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in
text: the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him
text: at the fence and they share a moment of connection.
dialog: 
text: Spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our
text: boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his
text: pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert
text: with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
text: His mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and
text: runs over the field at her beck and call.
dialog: 
text: Albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe
text: as Joey races away with his mother.
dialog: 
text: He is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat
text: gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He
text: runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and
dialog: strength.
dialog: 
text: Later - the three farmers open the gate and come into the
text: field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to
text: the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the
text: horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of
text: a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is
text: shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening
text: the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his
text: neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to
text: see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and
text: struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer.
text: With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm
dialog: him down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARMER 2
dialog: Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on,
dialog: steady does it.
dialog: 
text: Unused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the
text: farmers are solid and firm. They gently lead Joey and his
text: mother across the field to the gate and out into the road.
dialog: 
text: The whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their
text: way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of
dialog: Market Day.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARKET. THE SAME.
text: The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the
text: market and into an auction pen. They find themselves amongst
text: a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these
dialog: creatures and all this life he had no idea existed.
dialog: 
text: The farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the
text: auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed
text: against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in
dialog: this tight space.
dialog: 
text: An AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTION MAN 1
dialog: Mornin', pop. Put your mark here.
dialog: Good luck.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JOEY'S PEN. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Two men approach the pen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTION MAN 2
dialog: Get the colt...
dialog: 
text: One man grabs Joey and pulls him out of the pen. Suddenly
text: there is a look of horror on his face. His terrified mother
text: realises they are being separated. Joey panics and
text: desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up
text: throwing the man who is leading him aside. Joey is out of
text: control. The man regains control of Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTION MAN 3
dialog: Whoa! Whoa!
dialog: 
text: He pulls Joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart-
text: rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against
text: the fence. Joey remains disoriented in the midst of the
text: market day chaos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D)
dialog: Easy...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN AUCTION RING. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes.
text: There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market
dialog: day.
dialog: 
text: We concentrate on two men - Ted Narracott (DAD), in his
dialog: forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have
text: worn him down before his time, and SI EASTON, his more solid
text: friend, both working farmers. Just behind Si is his 15 year
text: old son, ANDREW. Ted has a drink in his hand. They all look
text: at Joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Now that's a beauty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Forget it, Ted. He's half
dialog: thoroughbred and not got a day's
dialog: work in him.
text: (points to a plow horse next to
speaker_heading: JOEY)
dialog: Now, there... There's your ticket.
dialog: 
text: In contrast to Joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands
text: like a rock. But Dad remains fixated on Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: But look at him, Si. Look at that creature.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
text: Indeed, Joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging
dialog: because of his upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Don't be daft. You need something
text: solid to plow a field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (fixed on Joey)
dialog: Yeah, but he's something else, that one.
dialog: 
text: The AUCTIONEER announces the start of the auction...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle
dialog: down - horses on my right - men with money
dialog: in their pockets on my left - it's the
dialog: perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?
text: FRED shouts his reply from the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: YES! I's here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm here. Yes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been
dialog: coming here for 20 years - never bought so
text: much as a pork scratching.
dialog: 
dialog: The crowd are loving all this.
text: Dad notices a figure across the ring, LYONS, clearly a man of
text: money. You can see something light up in Dad's eyes - a
dialog: combination of dislike and alcohol.
dialog: 
text: Joey is led into the auction pen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young
dialog: horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my
dialog: wife on our wedding day. Let's get going,
dialog: shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature.
dialog: 
dialog: But no-one bids.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: One guinea.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: One guinea, one guinea, one
dialog: guinea...
dialog: 
scene_heading: YOUNG ANDREW EASTON
dialog: I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister
dialog: Narracott.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Any advance on one guinea? Any
dialog: advance on one guinea?
dialog: 
text: Joey is still trying to get back to his mother. A voice from
text: the crowd pipes up:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Two guineas.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Three!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong
dialog: animal.
dialog: 
text: Lyons whispers to his son, DAVID, 15, next to him. David eyes
text: Joey skeptically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that
dialog: bastard see me off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Five guineas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Six!
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Oh for the love of...!
dialog: 
text: Joey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling
dialog: him back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Seven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.
speaker_heading: (BIDDING)
dialog: Eight.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Stop it - he's your landlord - you
dialog: can't be picking fights with him.
dialog: 
text: Lyons looks over. There is now tension in the crowd as they
text: sense a Battle Royal for the horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Ten guineas.
dialog: 
text: He smirks at Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: You haven't got the money. Let's go
dialog: home - let's have a pint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as
dialog: any in this town.
dialog: 
text: They all look at Lyons in his suit and bowler hat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: That's top price for a workin'
dialog: animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: There are big days and there are
dialog: small days. Which will it be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?
dialog: 
text: All eyes are on Lyons and his son - David is 15, smartly
dialog: dressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID LYONS
dialog: Just let him go, dad, I don't care
dialog: for him, he's too... jumpy.
dialog: 
text: Lyons isn't listening to David; he's looking hard at Ted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Shall we say - twenty five?
dialog: 
text: The crowd gasps. This is clearly personal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run
dialog: for his money.
dialog: 
text: But when he looks at Ted, Ted's eyes are locked into the eyes
dialog: of his rival.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Going, going...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Thirty. Thirty guineas!
dialog: 
text: Total silence. He stares hard at Lyons. Who simply smiles,
text: raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. It dawns on
text: Dad that he's won the auction. He breaks into a sweat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going
dialog: going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott.
dialog: 
text: He bangs his gavel. It's a done deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: What have you done, Ted? What have you done?
dialog: 
text: Dad doesn't acknowledge Si.
dialog: 
text: Moments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back.
text: Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the
text: auction man in a kind of daze.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do
dialog: with him - on a working farm? I hope you
dialog: got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it
dialog: when it comes due.
dialog: 
text: Dad does not acknowledge Lyons. Lyons smiles and walks away
text: with son David, and his cronies. Si shakes his head at Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll
dialog: never forgive you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. SUNSET.
dialog: 
text: MRS. NARRACOTT kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots,
text: when she sees Ted returning.
dialog: 
text: Dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling Joey
text: with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and
text: then at Dad. She is a good-looking, intelligent woman, but
dialog: clearly her life is always hard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: What have you done?
dialog: 
text: Dad stands shamefaced as Albert - the boy we have already met
text: - runs out of the house to join them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: That's Mooney's colt!
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: You were supposed to buy a plow horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You bought him?
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: What'd you pay for him?
dialog: 
text: Albert is totally taken by the horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
dialog: How much, Ted Narracott?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I won't tell you a lie - though I would love
dialog: to. Thirty guineas.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Thirty guineas!
dialog: 
text: She is stunned. She looks at Ted - and he just nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
dialog: He's not worth ten! Are you out of your
dialog: mind? What about the rent?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at
dialog: the way he holds his head!
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: How the hell are we gonna pull anything with
dialog: that? Ted - you have to take him back. You
dialog: have to take him back right now now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: You have to get down on your knees and beg
dialog: for our money back.
dialog: 
text: Joey bridles at the raised voices but Albert takes the rope
text: and tries to calm him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No. No, please don't take him back.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly we see Dad's dejection. He is a man lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We can't take him back till he's broken in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: And how are you gonna train a horse with
dialog: that leg?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I'll train him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't
dialog: know nothing about horses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We have to keep him. We've no choice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Right. Well... you've got one month to
dialog: break him in or I'm taking him back myself.
text: (She turns to the house,
dialog: but then...)
dialog: How did you get to thirty - what other fool
dialog: bid you up that high?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It was Lyons.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott turns back towards the house, then stops,
text: dazed, speaking almost to herself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: We're gonna lose everything. After all we've
dialog: been through - we're gonna lose it all.
dialog: 
text: She turns back to the others - the weight of the mistake
text: heavy on their shoulders - but Albert quickly steps forward.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBIE
dialog: Don't worry, Mum - I'll raise him - and I'll
dialog: raise him good.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Well, you better. Go on - get started. See
dialog: if a child can undo what your fool of a
dialog: father's done to this family of ours.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott storms into the house. Albert immediately
text: goes to stroke Joey but the nervous horse draws back
text: uncomfortably. Dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered,
text: across the yard to the barn.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STABLES. LATER.
dialog: 
text: Albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches Joey in
dialog: the field.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Right. Let's make a start then.
dialog: 
text: As Albert approaches, Joey nervously runs in circles, then
text: stops on a dime, looking at Albert suspiciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's
dialog: beef and gravy to us!
dialog: 
text: Albert squats down. He shows the food. Joey catches the
text: scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on...
dialog: 
text: This time, Albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body
text: fully away from Joey, but keeping the bucket extended.
text: Albert slowly backs towards Joey, speaking gently all the
dialog: while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you're missing your mother.
dialog: Look at you... first time without
dialog: your mum. First time away from home.
dialog: But you're not alone, are you. In
dialog: fact. Cos I'm `ere...
dialog: 
text: Feeling safer, Joey moves toward the bucket of oats and
text: starts to eat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: It's alright. It's alright.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
text: Albert reaches out his hand and touches Joey. And with a
text: slight start, the horse relaxes into Albert's hand, feeling
text: safe with the boy.
dialog: 
text: Albert stares at the distinctive white cross on Joey's
text: forehead. Joey calms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey.
dialog: That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright,
dialog: You're mine now. You're mine.
dialog: 
text: Albert strokes Joey's forehead. Joey lifts his head and the
text: two stare at each other in close proximity.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARMYARD. NEXT DAY.
dialog: 
text: Dad, with a hangover, hobbles off to work the fields. As he
text: reaches the gate, HAROLD the goose snaps at his heels. Dad
text: dismisses him with a stare and heads for the stables.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE FARMYARD, DAY.
dialog: 
text: The training episode: Albert walks Joey around the yard on
text: the rope. It all seems to be going well. Mum looks on. Albert
text: is clearly proud of his progress.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PADDOCK. ANOTHER DAY.
dialog: 
text: Albert's friend, Andrew Easton, sits on a rock with an apple
text: in hand to watch the training.
dialog: 
text: Albert sets Joey in a spot and tells him to wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Whoa. I want you to stay there,
dialog: Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy.
dialog: That's it, you've got it.
dialog: 
text: Of course when Albert walks away, Joey follows.
dialog: 
text: A game of "Grandma's footsteps" ensues as Albert patiently
text: places Joey then walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey, look at him, Albie. He's
text: playing "Grandma's Footsteps."
dialog: 
text: Albert patiently leads Joey back to his starting position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Right, come on, Joey. Back you go.
dialog: Come on. Back you go.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: You're all right. That's it. Good
dialog: boy. Right. You've gotta stay
dialog: there, understand?
dialog: 
text: Albert walks away again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it. Good boy. You've got it.
dialog: Good boy.
dialog: 
text: Finally Joey stays put. Andrew smiles, impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Good boy. Good.
speaker_heading: (TO ALBERT)
dialog: Now call him. Whistle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Come now, Joey. Come on.
dialog: 
text: Albert whistles like an owl. Joey stands completely still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: You can come now, Joey.
dialog: 
text: He whistles again. Joey remains still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Don't think he fancies your owls.
dialog: 
text: Albert walks back to Joey, frustrated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No, I read it in a story. It's how
dialog: the Indians used to summon their
dialog: horses.
text: He gently strokes Joey's nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've
dialog: gotta come, understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: My dad had a dog who stayed when you
dialog: called him. He used to run up
dialog: behind you when you weren't
dialog: looking, and uh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: He's not a dog. He's just puzzling
dialog: it through.
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
text: Albert runs further away than before and whistles. After a
text: moment, Joey trots over to him. Andrew smiles broadly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Brilliant. Look at you.
dialog: 
text: With the basis established, Albert begins to train Joey to
text: react to the owl whistle without his prompting. It's not all
dialog: easy going - sometimes Albert makes progress, sometimes not.
dialog: 
text: QUICK MONTAGE - Mrs. Narracott fills a bucket at the pump,
text: then promptly spills it when Joey trots past her in response
text: to an owl whistle. She calls off, frustrated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Albie.
dialog: 
text: Dad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder.
text: There's an owl call and Joey trots past him in the
text: background. Dad sees Albert welcome Joey by the haystacks,
text: stroking his nose affectionately. Dad walks on, his
text: expression inscrutable.
dialog: 
text: Joey trots up a path, pursuing another owl call. After
text: several more calls, he still can't spot Albert, until he
text: cranes his neck up and sees Albert sitting in a nearby tree.
text: Albert laughs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE. LATER.
dialog: 
text: Lyons is there with his son, David, and his unlikable
text: cronies. He holds a meager handful of cash. Dad and Mum look
text: chastened. The mood is sombre.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: There's only fifteen here.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: The rest will come.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: You know by rights I could take this farm
dialog: back today, don't you? And I'm a great
dialog: believer in my rights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It will come.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: If you drank less beer and bought fewer
dialog: horses you might be able to look your
text: landlord in the eye, Narracott.
dialog: 
text: Lyons begins loading up his ledger into his bag.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I said I'll pay you. We got to plant the
dialog: bottom field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
text: Bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down
dialog: there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: No, we're going to plow it. Just give me
dialog: `til the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe
dialog: you. With interest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: How you going to plow it? Not with that
dialog: fancy animal of yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: He'll do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: You'll not get that one in a harness, let
text: alone pulling a plow. Even drunk on a
dialog: Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't
dialog: wait for the money - there's a war coming.
dialog: 
text: Dad stands up from his chair, resolute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I promise you that field will be plowed.
dialog: We'll plant it with turnips. And the money
dialog: will be yours when harvest comes.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott interjects, desperate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Please, sir. Please.
text: Lyons takes his time. He looks at them both - Ted and Rosie,
text: almost beaten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Very well - if that fancy plows that field
dialog: I'll give you till October to set things
dialog: straight.
dialog: 
text: Lyons heads for the door, but Albert stands in his way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: What if he doesn't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: I'll take the horse on the day he fails.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: LYONS (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'll take your father's farm and give it
dialog: to working men who can hold their pints and
text: hold their heads high in decent company.
dialog: 
text: Lyons tries to move past, but Albert grabs his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No, please. Sir, you can't do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Now, now, now, lad. What - are you bladdered
dialog: as well?! Ted Narracott - I got you down in
dialog: my book!
dialog: 
text: Albert knows he has to back down. Lyons walks past him and

text: Ted stands in the kitchen immobile with upset.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STABLES. MOMENTS LATER.
dialog: 
text: Dad throws open the stable door, jerks the harness from the
text: wall, throws open Joey's stall and starts to lunge at the
dialog: horse.
dialog: 
text: Albert runs in to try to stop him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You can't harness him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: He's got to be collared.
text: Dad starts to grapple with Joey desperately flailing in an
text: attempt to get the harness onto Joey. Joey is completely
text: confused and frightened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No, you can't. Look, you're scaring him,
dialog: Dad. You're scaring him. He...
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
dialog: He can't take a plow!
dialog: 
text: Joey tries to push Dad out of the way, Dad frustrated by this
text: hits Joey hard with the harness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: He's got to plow!
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: He won't be able to do it - he's too young -
dialog: he's not even been backed yet....
dialog: 
text: Joey rears up and kicks Dad. Who falls to the ground.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Ted!
dialog: 
text: Albert grabs Joey's bridle. Joey wrestles with Albert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: It's alright, boy. It's alright. It's
dialog: alright. It's alright.
dialog: 
text: Dad is mad with anger and frustration - and in pain. He
text: staggers to his feet and leaves.
text: Albert calms Joey down. Mrs. Narracott returns the harness
text: to its hook.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes
dialog: on him....
dialog: 
text: But then she notices Dad has returned. He has a gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ted. No. Ted, no!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take
dialog: the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Dad?
text: He grabs the rifle, but Dad shoves him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Move aside.
dialog: 
text: Dad raises the rifle, but Albert wrestles for it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Dad. Stop.
dialog: 
text: Furious with frustration Dad throws Albert to the ground and
text: takes aim at the horse.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott quickly pulls the gun aside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: You shoot that horse we have nothing.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
text: Dad whips the gun back towards Joey to find Albert standing
text: between them - right in front of the gun's barrel. For a
dialog: second we think Albert will be inadvertently shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!
dialog: 
text: Dad pauses his finger just in time. Albert gently holds the
text: barrel of the gun. Speaks calmly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You were right what you said, Dad. "He'll do
dialog: it," you told Lyons, "He'll plow that
dialog: field." And he will! You'll see. He'll show
dialog: you. We'll show you. We'll get it done.
dialog: 
text: Dad looks at him, frozen. Mrs. Narracott eases the gun away
dialog: from him -
speaker_heading: MUM
dialog: Let go. Let go.
dialog: 
text: - and hands it to Albert, telling him -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUM (CONT'D)
dialog: Go back to the house.
dialog: 
text: As Albert leaves, Ted takes out his flask. But Rosie takes it
text: from him gently. He doesn't resist.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Here, here. Some days are best forgotten.
dialog: Today ain't one of them. Come on.
dialog: 
text: They exit the stable together, leaving Joey in his stall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./ EXT. STABLES. DAWN.
text: Albert walks towards the stables - enters. And talks to Joey
text: as he prepares the harness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: How are you today, Joey? I don't know much
dialog: about life, boy, but I do know that there
dialog: are big days and there are small days. And
dialog: most days are small days, and, well, they
dialog: don't matter much to anyone - but this -
dialog: well, this is a big one. This is our big
dialog: day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going
dialog: to take this off -
dialog: (he takes off his coat)
dialog: Well, if it's tough for you - it should be
dialog: tough for me, too...
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
text: He is left in just a loose-fitting white shirt....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow
dialog: and you're gonna learn. Is that
dialog: understood? And then we can be
dialog: together, which is how I believe
dialog: things are meant to be.
dialog: 
text: Joey instinctively balks, but Albert is stern with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here
dialog: we go.
dialog: 
text: As he approaches Joey with the harness, Harold the goose
text: enters the stable to watch.
text: Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his
dialog: own neck and shoulders to demonstrate -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See?
dialog: See? You've just gotta put your nose
dialog: through.
dialog: 
text: It is a moment between them. The horse looks Albert in the
text: eye, then yields. Albert comforts him and show there is
text: nothing to fear. Finally he gets the harness in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it. See? You've got it.
dialog: You've got it. Good boy. There...
dialog: 
text: Harold honks his approval.
dialog: 
text: Albert leads Joey out across the yard, through the broken
dialog: gate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER FIELD. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: It is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields
text: towards the huge lower field. They come to a rusty, primitive
text: plow left in the grass. Albert looks around the field - it is
text: overgrown, it seems to go on forever - even if Joey was a
dialog: plow horse this would be a heavy task.
dialog: 
text: Si Easton and Andrew stroll up the road to watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
text: Too large, too rocky, matted with
text: grass roots. Even a sturdy plow
dialog: horse'd never manage it alone.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yet he will, I say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: You'd swear he'd sprout wings and
dialog: fly if Albert had told you so.
dialog: (smiling at his son:)
dialog: It's a fine thing, loyal to your
dialog: mate. Even if he is a bit barmy. A
dialog: team of two might manage, given a
dialog: month and good weather.
dialog: 
text: They're interrupted by the honk of a horn as Lyons and David
text: pull up in a car. Lyons and David get out. Their driver
text: remains inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: `Course he's watching.
dialog: 
text: Si nods in the direction of the house.
dialog: 
text: Albert steadies Joey and starts to tie on the heavy plow. It
text: just seems too big and bulky for Joey's sleek frame. Albert
text: sets Joey right and fixes the plow.
dialog: 
text: Lyons, David, Si, and Andrew walk towards Dad, who looks on
text: anxiously from a nearby hedgerow. Lyons gestures at David to
text: stay back and walks over to Ted alone. He stands beside him
text: and begins to talk gently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Well, you've raised him up a true
dialog: Narracott, Ted, picture of his
dialog: father, he is: not a dollop of
dialog: ordinary sense but that thick
dialog: stubbornness that'll lead him to
dialog: insist on the impossible.
dialog: 
text: Down in the field, Albert continues to prep the plow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS (CONT'D)
dialog: Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't
dialog: admire you, myself among `em,
dialog: leaving your brothers that fine farm
dialog: and setting yourself at this stoney
dialog: patch of unpromising ground. You've
dialog: fettle enough for twenty men, but
text: with a gimpy leg and the drinking -
dialog: for the pain, isn't it, that you
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: LYONS (CONT'D)
dialog: - yeah, none of us could have
dialog: anticipated an ending better than
dialog: this. Makes me question the wisdom
dialog: of the charity that urged me to rent
dialog: you this place, not only looking at
dialog: you, me old pal, but that pretty
dialog: little wife of yours, thought you
dialog: were a spark, she did.
dialog: 
text: Ted hasn't acknowledged Lyons for a second; he's never taken
text: his eyes off Albert. He simply stands and walks away as
scene_heading: LYONS CONCLUDES:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS (CONT'D)
dialog: And now your son's sinking into the
dialog: selfsame bog that's swallowing you.
dialog: 
text: Albert has been meticulously preparing everything,
text: positioning Joey, checking the tethers, digging the rusty
text: plow in the earth. He takes his position behind the plow,
text: throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: See Joey - I got the collar, too!
dialog: 
text: Albert gently snaps the reins. Joey doesn't move, confused by
dialog: the whole affair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, boy. Walk on. That's it. Walk on!
dialog: Walk on, Joey. Come on, boy, walk on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: You'd be better off startin' at the
dialog: top of the hill and goin' down!
dialog: Gravity's the only friend you're
dialog: gonna have today, young lad.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Walk on, Joey! Walk on! Come on,
dialog: Joey, walk on. Walk on, boy.
dialog: 
text: At the house, Mrs. Narracott opens an upstairs window to look
text: on, anxiously. Ted, standing alone by the fence, only looks
dialog: at Albert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Walk on. Come on, walk on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF:)
dialog: It'll take the whip to move him.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
text: Just as Ted is saying this, Albert, as if hearing his father,
text: takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip. Joey's
text: ears prick up. Albert, grimly determined, snaps the whip at
text: Joey. Joey panics and bolts. The plow spins to its side,
text: pulls Albert off his feet. Joey drags them all the way to
text: the top of the hill, right by the farmhouse.
dialog: 
text: Lyons, yelling, starts laughing and can't stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Bravo! You've reached the top of the
dialog: hill! Off you go again, boy! You'll
dialog: make even better time comin' down!!
dialog: 
text: He continues past Dad, laughing.
dialog: 
text: INTERCUT - Mrs. Narracott looks on from the house. He
text: glances back at her. Her face is full of angry concern for
dialog: their son.
dialog: 
text: Townsfolk begin arriving, climbing the hill to the lower
dialog: field.
dialog: 
text: Ted looks down, ashamed. Mrs. Narracott looks back at Albert,
text: mortified, bruised, setting the plow right again.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and
text: picks up her knitting.
dialog: 
text: Later - Albert has made no progress. Joey is moving, but
text: only in a useless circle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Good boy. Good lad. Good lad. Now
dialog: walk on. Good boy.
dialog: 
text: More townsfolk clamor to the fence. Andrew calls out.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Albie, we're all with ya!
dialog: 
text: Albert tries to encourage him forward but Joey still isn't
text: pulling sufficiently. The plow skips uselessly over the
dialog: surface stones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: Look look look! The plow hasn't even cut
dialog: yet!
dialog: 
text: As Albert struggles with the plow, he sees Dad walking up the
text: hill behind the spectators. He doesn't even turn to his son.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
text: Joey strains as Albert pushes with all his might. We sense
dialog: the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the
text: task. But Joey perseveres. The plow limps along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Do you know - I believe we can do
dialog: it, Joey. I knew when I first saw
dialog: you that you'd be the best of us.
dialog: That's why he bought you. He knows
dialog: you've all the courage he never had.
dialog: I knew when I first saw you that
dialog: you'd be the one who'd save us.
dialog: 
text: The plow skips and Albert falls. Joey's legs buckle and he
text: goes to his knees. Albert rushes to his side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. Whoa.
text: Lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: You've got no chance, lad. He'll not
dialog: turn over half an acre. Give it up
dialog: now. You've done well. You've tried
dialog: hard. You're more of a man than your
dialog: father.
dialog: 
text: Albert examines the collar - he sees it is ripping into
text: Joey's flesh. He grabs his shirt, tears a piece off it,
text: tenderly folds it and puts it between Joey's shoulder and the
dialog: collar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit
dialog: rough, isn't it?
speaker_heading: LYONS
speaker_heading: (A SHRUG:)
dialog: Well, he'll destroy that horse.
dialog: 
text: The crowd's beginning to disperse. One of Lyons' cronies
text: holds his umbrella as he returns to his car. He passes Ted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be over Thursday. Give you a
dialog: day to close it up.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence -
text: holding her knitting in the rain, ignoring the leaving
text: crowds. A SYMPATHETIC NEIGHBOR hands her:
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOUR
dialog: Your wool.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I'm sorry, Rosie.
dialog: 
text: Lyons passes behind her, almost speaks, but then thinks
dialog: better of it.
dialog: 
text: As the rain intensifies, Albert digs his toe into the wet
text: soil and notices how it has softened. Suddenly something
text: flashes through Albert's mind. He leaps into action, runs
text: through the rain to shout at Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey.
dialog: You don't know, so I'm gonna have to
dialog: do the knowing for you when the rest
dialog: of our lives depend on this! So get
dialog: set to pull - and pull straight! And
dialog: pull hard!
dialog: 
text: He races back to the plow and sets himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, boy! Go!
dialog: 
text: Joey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken - the
text: rain has softened the earth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it!
dialog: Good boy, Joey! Good boy!
dialog: 
text: Finally, the plow bites deep into the soil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Walk on! Walk on! Walk on! Walk
dialog: on, Joey!
dialog: 
text: At the fence, Mrs. Narracott looks on in amazement.
dialog: 
text: Albert notices a large rock in their path. Andrew sees it,
dialog: too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Go around it!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey,
dialog: whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll
dialog: break the blade -
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
text: Albert hauls back on the reins, but Joey throws his flanks
text: forward, straining and lurching until the plow blade splits
text: the rock completely in half and now the plow moves more
text: easily through the wet ground.
dialog: 
text: The ground yields. Soon Albert and Joey are making great
text: progress. The wet earth slipping open beneath them.
dialog: 
text: Andrew is loving it, speaks in wonder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Will you look at you?
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott looks very happy, a smile breaking slowly
text: across her face...
dialog: 
text: The crowd begins to return. Lyons notices and looks out from
text: his car - sees the plow digging through the field.
text: Annoyed at the progress Albert's making, he gets out of his
text: car and walks over to Mrs. Narracott. With great disdain he
speaker_heading: SAYS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYONS
dialog: I'd not let a child of mine slip in
text: the mud alongside a plow blade. He
dialog: could lose a foot!
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott brandishes her knitting needles, backing him
dialog: up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE NARRACOTT
dialog: You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr.
dialog: Lyons, if you carry on prating at me
dialog: how to manage my son! Or my plow, or
dialog: my horse, or my field, or my farm!
text: Dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval.
text: Lyons stares at her, gape-mouthed, as she turns her attention
text: back to Albert.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Come on, Albie! Push on through!
dialog: 
text: The rain becomes torrential. Lyons turns towards the car -
text: gestures, frustrated, to his driver, who runs forward with
text: the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain. David remains
text: on the running board, watching Albert plowing.
dialog: 
text: The plow speeds through the earth. The boy and the horse are
text: working as one. It is a moment of triumph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Get it done, Albie! Get it done!
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
text: We pull back to see they have made only the smallest dent in
text: the enormous field.
dialog: 
text: As Lyons' car passes, Dad steps forward, takes in the scene,
text: and almost smiles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE LOWER FIELD. EVENING.
dialog: 
text: The rain has abated. Albert, soaked to the skin, sits next
text: to Joey. They are both covered in mud.
dialog: 
text: Andrew, followed by Si Easton, charges through the gate up to
text: Albert. They are lifting Albert up between them, laughing,
text: Si Easton planting a kiss on Albert's muddy cheek, Andrew
text: tousling his filthy hair, when Mrs. Narracott arrives with
text: Ted. She helps Si and Andrew lift Albert and slings her
text: son's arm over her shoulder, glowing with pride, crying,
text: overjoyed.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Oh, my pair of fools. My mighty
dialog: fools.
dialog: 
text: As the others help Albert up, Ted tends to Joey. He looks
text: over to his son and, after a moment, removes his cap and
text: slightly bows his head.
dialog: 
text: The others stagger away, supporting Albert, and Ted pats the
text: horse and gently begins to unbuckle the harness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STABLES. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Albert washes Joey and tends the wounds and sores on his
text: body. Rosie is putting antiseptic on Albert's wrists and
text: shoulders. Joey bristles but is soothed by Albert's care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: You're as battered and bloodied as he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: And where's Dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
text: Still in the bottom field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Stumbling about, I suppose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: It's not the drink, Albert, that
dialog: makes him stumble -
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (ABRUPTLY)
text: He drinks, mum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Well, so might you if you'd been
dialog: where he's been, seen what he's
dialog: seen!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Well, he don't talk to me about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: He don't talk about it because he
dialog: can't. There aren't words for some
dialog: things. Come here...
dialog: 
text: Rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner
text: of the stables. She rummages until she finds a waterstained
text: brown paper parcel tied with yarn. She brushes away some
text: mouse turds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The mice've been at it. Sit down.
dialog: 
text: They sit together on a step. As she begins to untie the
text: yarn, a change comes over her: her irritated determination
text: gives way to sadness. Albert comes to her and kneels beside
text: her as she gently opens the paper.
dialog: 
text: Inside there's a red and tan pennant, knotted and fringed at
dialog: both ends.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were
dialog: Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial
dialog: Yeomanry.
text: Then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two
text: silver medals. The first, with the profile of Victoria, hangs
text: from a red, blue and orange ribbon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: And that is the Queen's South Africa
dialog: Medal. Every man who fought in the
dialog: Boer War got one of those. But
dialog: this...
dialog: 
text: She holds up the other medal, hanging from a red and black
dialog: ribbon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the Distinguished Conduct
dialog: Medal.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
text: She hands Albert the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He takes
text: it, astonished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Not dad's?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Well it ain't mine, dear. He got
dialog: that after the fighting at
dialog: Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and
dialog: he'd saved some other lads, and
dialog: well... I don't know what else, he
dialog: won't tell me either. But the first
dialog: day he got home he just... tossed
dialog: them out. First day he could walk,
dialog: he threw `em straight in the
dialog: dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I
dialog: said not to.
text: Albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant. She
text: takes the medal back, puts it in the sash, and begins to wrap
dialog: it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: See, what you done today, you and
dialog: Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so
dialog: you should be, my splendid boy. It's
dialog: good to be proud when you done
dialog: something good. But what he done, in
dialog: Africa, whatever it was, he takes no
dialog: pride in it. Hard as it surely was,
dialog: and however much pain it's cost him,
dialog: he refuses to be proud of killing, I
dialog: suppose.
dialog: 
text: She returns the things in the footlocker, closes it.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED:)
dialog: I'd be proud. If I'd gone off to
dialog: war. If I'd gone and saved my
dialog: mates, and -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Well, whether or not you think you'd
dialog: do the same thing as him... Think
dialog: how brave he is for refusing to be
dialog: proud.
dialog: 
text: She heads back to Albert, pennant in hand.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he
dialog: drinks to forget the mistakes that
dialog: he's made - but he never gave up and
dialog: he does that for us. And today, you
dialog: showed the world it's all been worth
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: As she leaves, she drapes the pennant over Albert's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You keep looking after Joey and
dialog: he'll always be looking after you.
dialog: 
text: Albert looks again at the pennant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY:)
dialog: Sergeant, Seventh Battalion,

dialog: (amazed, to Joey:)
dialog: You see this, Joey? It's been
dialog: through an entire war.
dialog: 
text: Albert holds the pennant in wonder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not stealing it. I'll give it
dialog: back to him, someday.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Early morning. Dad hobbling across the furrows, alone,
text: planting the field by hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NARRACOTT FARM. DEVON COUNTRY MONTAGE.
text: Albert and Joey are now in a meadow. They trot past the field
text: he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which
text: Ted tends to.
dialog: 
text: The sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the
text: field and up a small incline. As both Joey and Albert gain
text: confidence they pick up speed. Albert pushes Joey on, they
text: are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the
text: exhilaration of it all. Joey races flat out across the
text: countryside. Albert hanging on for dear life.
dialog: 
text: Albert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car. It's Lyons'
text: car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively-
dialog: tailored rural gentry.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Um, I'm the only boy that drives in
text: the village. No one else drives but
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Oh, yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's right and this is my dad's
dialog: car. You're lucky that you're in
dialog: it. I'm not normally allowed to
dialog: drive it `cause it's so -
dialog: 
text: Albert urges Joey to go faster, till they're neck and neck
text: beside the car, racing it. David Lyons looks to see Albert
text: and Joey running alongside his car. He feigns disinterest.
text: Albert glances at David, but he's much more interested in the
text: very pretty young woman seated next to David, her hands
text: trying to control her hair, flying in the wind. Forgetting
text: himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled. The woman
dialog: turns to David:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Is he a friend of yours?
dialog: 
text: She smiles at Albert, encouraging him. David Lyons, annoyed,
text: pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of Joey.
dialog: 
text: But not for long. The sound of the acceleration and Albert's
text: eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and
text: again he moves out ahead of the car. The young woman grins
dialog: at Albert.
dialog: 
text: Up ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's
text: been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an
text: obstacle. Albert encourages Joey to go faster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Come on, boy, let's show her how to
dialog: fly!
dialog: 
text: They head right for the wall, but at the very last moment,
text: Joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending Albert
text: sailing over the wall.
dialog: 
text: Back in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth,
text: concerned. David says nothing, but allows himself a small
dialog: smile.
dialog: 
text: On the other side of the wall, Albert stands a bit battered,
text: but unfazed.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Well...you're clearly not gonna be a
dialog: jumper.
dialog: 
text: Thunder starts to rumble ominously in the background.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Albert and Joey return, driving sheep before them. Angry
text: storm clouds stretch to the horizon.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: As Albert leads Joey to the stable, lighting blasts across an
text: angry sky. The rain is falling in torrents.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof
text: gives way - water gushes in - Dad rushes to support the roof
text: as the wind forces a window open.
dialog: 
text: At that moment, the door suddenly swings open with the
text: violence of the storm, smashing against the wall - Dad and
text: Rosie turn - and there is Harold the goose, who scuttles in
text: without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo!
dialog: 
text: The thunder cracks again and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER FIELD. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Albert and Dad walk across the field. Mrs. Narracott digs
text: through the mess. The entire crop is flat - ruined by the
text: storms. The ground squelches beneath their feet.
text: The whole field is a write off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: We can try planting something else, or we
dialog: could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.
dialog: 
text: Dad doesn't answer. He shakes his head and limps away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons'
dialog: rent?
dialog: 
text: Ted doesn't turn around.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. EVENING.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott makes some coffee. Ted sits alone on a chair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. NARRACOTT
dialog: What we gonna do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I used to believe that God gave each man his
dialog: fair portion of bad luck. I don't feel that
dialog: any more. I've had more than my share.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: You'll stop loving me, Rose. And I won't
dialog: blame you when you do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never
dialog: love you less.
text: Then somewhere in the distance, an unfamiliar sound...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LANE LEADING TO THE VILLAGE. EVENING.
dialog: 
text: A motorbike rumbles along the lane at huge speed creating a
text: cloud of dust as it goes. The noise of the motorbike is
text: drawing attention from all over the valley. It can be heard
text: fields away and everyone is drawn to this completely unheard
dialog: of sound.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE VILLAGE. EVENING.
dialog: 
text: The motorbike whizzes through the village. Heads turn in
dialog: astonishment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MOTORBIKE RIDER
dialog: It's war!
text: The bike comes to a stop in the market place. The rider takes
text: off his goggles.
dialog: 
text: Men of the village start to flock around the machine, with
dialog: great curiosity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)
dialog: We are at War with Germany. You hear?
text: England is at war with Germany.
dialog: 
text: Shock and amazement. The rider takes off his goggles:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)
dialog: They're going to ring the bells at six
dialog: o'clock - and then never ring them again
text: until the war is over.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: Everyone across England knows that their lives are about to
dialog: change.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM YARD. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Dawn rises over the farm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM YARD. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Albert races to the stables, excited with the campaign
dialog: pennant.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STABLES. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: As Albert enters the stables, he calls out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock
dialog: Fair!
dialog: 
text: Albert opens the doors and stops dead. He looks at the empty
dialog: stables.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT./ INT. KITCHEN / YARD. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Albert runs out.
dialog: 
text: He rushes into the kitchen. His mother stares out the window.
text: She has been crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: What has he done with him?
dialog: 
text: She says nothing, but her face gives everything away. Albert
text: in a panic turns and runs out into the lane. Mrs. Narracott
text: tears up again.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE OF A MARKET TOWN. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The market square is full of military men. The Union Jack is
text: flying up the flagpole. A group of girls has gathered to
text: check out the army boys. Eager young men crowd a table
dialog: staffed by recruiting officers:
dialog: 
scene_heading: RECRUITING OFFICER
dialog: Last name first. First name, middle
dialog: name, last.
dialog: 
text: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS is in the square inspecting Joey,
text: knowledgably. He is a handsome, attractive, modest, upper
text: class man. Dad stands beside him. He checks Joey's teeth, his
text: feet and finally, looks him straight in the eye.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Take my word for it - finest horse
dialog: in the parish. Goes like a racer,
dialog: strong, decent, very fine.
dialog: 
text: Captain Nicholls has immediately connected with Joey and puts
text: him at his ease. SAM PERKINS, a tough sergeant, is physically
text: inspecting Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
text: No curbs, no splints, good feet and
text: teeth. He's as sound as a bell,
dialog: sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: And how much are you charging, sir - for
dialog: this strong, decent, and very fine animal?!
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Forty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I'll give you twenty and not a penny more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Twenty is no good to me, Captain. Thirty
dialog: five and he's yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I don't even know how he rides.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh, he rides... Splendidly. You'll
dialog: be astonished. I promise you that.
dialog: (his heart's in his
text: throat, fighting back
speaker_heading: GRIEF)
dialog: Finest horse in all of Devon. Finest
dialog: horse I ever seen.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE OF A MARKET TOWN. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Albert bursts into the square just in time to see Nicholls
text: and Dad shake hands. Their business concluded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Albert races towards Joey. Ted grabs him. Albert fights to
text: get free. He looks at his father in anger and betrayal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained
dialog: him!
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Albert.
dialog: 
text: Albert is hysterical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just
dialog: paid thirty guineas for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (TO TED:)
dialog: Please, I'll get you money. I will,
dialog: I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work
dialog: for it! I'll work for it.
speaker_heading: (TO NICHOLLS:)
dialog: He won't obey anyone else. He won't
dialog: be any good in the war, neither.
dialog: He...he shies at every sound!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Albert snaps to attention.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Well, if Joey's going, I'm going,
dialog: too. I'm volunteering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I see. What's your name, lad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Albert, sir.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: And how old are you, Albert?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Nineteen, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLS
dialog: Is that the truth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No sir. But, but I look nineteen and
dialog: I'm bigger than most nineteen-year-
dialog: olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And
dialog: I...I'm not afraid of anything.
dialog: 
scene_heading: NICHOLLS INTERJECTS:
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I don't doubt your qualifications,
dialog: Albert, but the law is very clear
dialog: about the proper age for soldiering,
dialog: and your father's done what he had
dialog: to do. You know that. Thirty guineas
dialog: isn't nearly enough to purchase a
dialog: horse as fine as your Joey, I know
dialog: that. But it's all I've got. Will
dialog: you lease him to me, Albert, to be
dialog: my own mount?
text: (he removes his cap,
speaker_heading: EARNEST)
dialog: I promise you, man to man, that I'll
dialog: look after him as closely as you've
dialog: done, I'll respect him and all the
dialog: care that you've taken with him. And
dialog: if I can - I'll return him to your
dialog: care.
dialog: 
text: Albert looks at him. Although Nicholls speaks with authority
text: he has a kindness which Albert recognizes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now say goodbye.
dialog: 
text: Albert kisses Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: It's all right, boy...
dialog: 
text: But at that moment, Sam Perkins pulls Joey away:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough.
dialog: He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way.
speaker_heading: (TO JOEY)
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls walks away into the crowd. The Sergeant pulls Joey,
text: but Joey does not want to be separated from Albert. His
text: reaction is implacable, reminiscent to the separation from
text: his mother. Perkins leads Joey away. They disappear into the
text: crowd and Rosie is suddenly there. Ted senses her silent
dialog: judgment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Do you want to lose the farm, Rose?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: It's the way you did it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: But we're at war.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Aren't we just.
dialog: 
text: She looks at Albert. Implacable. Forever.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The recruits march through town under pennants and the
text: strains of a familiar song("The Jolly Plowboy") - it is a
dialog: song they all know, which means a lot to them - full of soul -
dialog: a song of harvest or a Celtic hymn, something relating
dialog: specifically to the lives they have led together. Everyone of
dialog: every age - everyone in the village knows this song - it is
dialog: theirs.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving
text: behind - cheering - a whole generation of young men is
text: marching off to war. One girlfriend rushes up to kiss her
dialog: leaving boyfriend.
dialog: 
text: Albert watches Joey, then remembers the campaign pennant
text: dangling from his pocket. He runs up to Joey -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Joey...
dialog: 
text: - and tucks the pennant into Joey's halter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: Here now, I've told you - sling your
dialog: hook!
dialog: 
text: But Nicholls intervenes from his car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Let him be, Perkins.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: This isn't the end. This isn't the
dialog: end, my brother... I, Albert
dialog: Narracott, solemnly swear we will be
dialog: together again. Wherever you are, I
dialog: will find you. And I will bring you
dialog: home!
dialog: 
text: And then they are past him, leaving him behind. As Perkins
text: leads Joey across a stone bridge, Albert watches from the
text: bank of the stream.
dialog: 
text: Joey balks one last time -
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: Whoa. Steady, steady. Steady now,
dialog: come on. Walk on! Walk on now,
dialog: come on!
dialog: 
text: - then Perkins leads him away, leaving Albert behind.
dialog: 
text: The very last recruits leave the village - leaving the debris
text: of this army's visit strewn on the square. Like the debris
dialog: of a party you are already beginning to regret.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMY STABLES. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Joey is handed off to a groom. Joey is amazed by the scale
text: of the building. Each horse has a large stall and is being
text: tended to assiduously. Joey looks around at the hundreds of
text: men and horses around him and panics.
speaker_heading: GROOM
dialog: Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy...
dialog: 
text: He bucks, throwing the groom to the ground, and gallops away.
text: But Perkins cuts him off, grabs his halter, and jerks him
text: back to attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin'
dialog: about, you hear? Yer in the army
dialog: now, son.
dialog: 
text: He pushes him into his stall, next to Major Stewart's horse,
text: a magnificent black stallion, TOPTHORN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good boy, good boy. Steady
dialog: steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy,
dialog: back up.
text: Joey rears up in his stall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is
dialog: Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the
dialog: two of you, you hear? If you want to fight,
dialog: you get it over with - `cause once we're
dialog: over there, you're gonna need everything
dialog: you've got for Fritz!
dialog: 
text: This is the first time that Joey has had to deal with another
dialog: horse since his mother - the beginning of one of the most
dialog: important relationships in his life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls passes his gloves and crop to his bat boy who is
text: there to assist him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: There'll be nothing gentle about the war,
dialog: sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about
dialog: this one either!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand that, Sergeant, but I
dialog: want him fit and shining. He's my
dialog: horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls is joined by his friend LIEUTENANT CHARLIE WAVERLY.
text: He is sweet and friendly - upper class but completely benign.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Scares the living daylights out of me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Perkins. Glad he's on our side.
dialog: 
text: They're both joined by a tall, confident officer, MAJOR JAMIE
text: STEWART. He sizes up Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not
dialog: a patch on my Topthorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got
dialog: potential. He's certainly got the bit
text: between his teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: I actually think my Blenheim is faster than
text: the pair of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Clear off!
dialog: 
text: He suddenly turns from the joking into the efficient senior
dialog: officer he is.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, gentlemen, listen here.
dialog: Everything tells us the same story, from
dialog: Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge
dialog: to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first
dialog: attack can and should be the decisive one.
dialog: Perkins...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: Yes, sir!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: No excuses, no mistakes - every
text: horse groomed and fit for
dialog: presentation! I want a full practice
dialog: charge tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM PERKINS
dialog: Sir.
dialog: 
text: They leave.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SALISBURY PLAIN. DAY.
dialog: 
text: The whole regiment is gathered. Everybody is in their
text: ceremonial uniform. It all has the feeling of the Changing of
text: the Guard rather than anything related to a real battle. The
text: day is hot, the plains are quiet and beautiful, the gathering
text: is huge, there is a real sense of pride and anticipation.
dialog: 
text: Captain Nicholls, resplendent in full uniform rides Joey out
text: over the vast expanse of the plain. Both Nicholls and Joey
text: are dressed up like something from the last century, out of
dialog: the Boer War, even the Charge of the Light Brigade. Nicholls
text: is proud and confident. They gather before hundreds of men
text: and horses all lined up to be inspected. Charlie joins them,
text: looking pretty good on Blenheim.
text: Finally, Nicholls and Charlie reach Stewart and Topthorn
text: waiting in position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Thought you two had bottled out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: As if.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls looks at his friend tolerantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: All right, then, let's see what you
dialog: two jokers are made of, shall we?
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: This is what quiet confidence looks like.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie prepare themselves for the
text: charge. Joey and Topthorn size up to one another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Over to you, Captain Nicholls.
dialog: 
text: Topthorn bristles at Joey. Everyone is highly charged. The
dialog: competition between Stewart and Nicholls seems to have been
text: absorbed between the horses. Topthorn and Joey square up for
text: the practice charge like two athletes before a race.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Draw...swords!
dialog: 
text: Nicholls raises his sword. It glints in the summer air. It
text: seems to hang there forever. Every man follows suit.
dialog: 
text: Topthorn and Joey glance at each other, ready to charge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: Give...point!
dialog: 
text: Every sword is pointed directly ahead at arm's length.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: Charge!!!!
dialog: 
text: A roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of
text: hooves breaks the silence. The huge line of horses start
text: running straight ahead of them. Joey and Topthorn run off at
text: top speed. Dust and earth rise up behind them.
text: Bugles, the deafening thunder of hooves. It is exhilarating.
dialog: We see the scale of the operation, we enjoy the speed and the
text: splendor of the mass of men and horses. The soldiers shout in
text: glee and excitement. Each man pushes his horse to out-run
text: those around him, Nicholls and Stewart seem locked in mortal
dialog: combat.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls smiles at Stewart, confidently.
dialog: 
text: Topthorn starts to pull away, ahead of all the other horses
text: in the line. Nicholls pushes Joey on. Topthorn seems too
text: strong, Joey will never catch them. Nicholls is determined
dialog: not to be beaten.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Joey. I know you've got
dialog: it. Come on, boy! Come on!
dialog: 
text: He pushes Joey on. Joey digs in and finds hidden strength and
text: speed. He starts to catch up with Topthorn and draws along
text: side. Nicholls and Stewart exchange tense looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, boy!
dialog: 
text: Stewart is amazed and pushes Topthorn harder.
dialog: 
text: Now both riders are going at their top speed. They are neck
text: and neck - they fight for every inch of advantage, every
text: fibre of their being invested in the race. Nicholls pushes
text: Joey on and Joey pulls away. Joey inches forward till he is
text: almost a length ahead of Topthorn. The effort is enormous.
text: Nicholls looks back at Stewart, very happy. Stewart's
text: frustration shows. He knows he is beaten.
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly they race over the line. Nicholls spears a ring
text: decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls Joey to a halt. They
text: have crossed the enemy line. Nicholls is ecstatic. Topthorn
text: comes to Joey's side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Whoa. Whoa.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls laughs, grinning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Nice of you to turn up.
dialog: 
text: The horses are nose to nose, snorting, we sense the heat, the
text: exertion. Topthorn and Joey are brought together by the
text: effort. We sense Topthorn's newly minted respect for Joey.
text: And Joey is no soft touch - he slightly holds his head up in
text: victory, letting Topthorn know that he knows he won.
dialog: 
text: The other horses come charging in. There is a real sense of
text: achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: He's got speed...I'll give him that. But
dialog: has he got stamina?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: He has everything.
dialog: 
text: The two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration
text: of it all. The two horses, face to face rub against each
text: other for the first time. A bond has been formed...
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OFFICERS' STUDY. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Stewart enters. A phonograph plays "Roses of Picardy." The
text: walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a
text: large map of Western Europe that depicts how the English
text: troops are crossing the channel to confront the Germans near
text: Belgium. Nicholls is writing a letter - though actually at
text: this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of Joey to
text: enclose with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: What are you up to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I'm writing a letter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: With a picture in it?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to
dialog: show him how wonderful he's looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Before we take him away across the Channel
dialog: to face a million Germans guns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Yes. Before that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: 4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the
dialog: Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport
dialog: detachment - they'll need to be at the docks
dialog: at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no
dialog: polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup
dialog: irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing
dialog: to flash in the sun and give us away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
text: As Stewart leaves, he passes Charlie. He casually
text: acknowledges him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Charlie...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Jamie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Charlie.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
text: Charlie checks his new cap in the mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: What do you think of the cap?
dialog: 
text: He shows the bright red lining to Nicholls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Silk lining. I quite like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of
dialog: difference to the Germans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it -
dialog: you're a Boche, just working out which of
dialog: two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good
dialog: Lord - one of them really is wearing a very
dialog: stylish cap indeed!" You might shoot the
dialog: other one instead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Or, alternatively, think - "I fancy that
dialog: cap" and kill you first of all.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Charlie removes the cap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Hadn't thought of that.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls returns to his sketch.

text: their way along the country road. Topthorn and Joey sense
text: the grim change of atmosphere.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODLAND ABOVE A PLAIN. DAY.
dialog: 
text: They are in woodland above a plain stretching for miles. A
text: small table has been taken out for Stewart and his officers.
text: SERGEANT MAJOR SINGH - a turbaned Indian with a magnificent
text: moustache dressed in ceremonial garb - explains the lines of
text: battle on a map.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. MAJOR SINGH
dialog: That is our target - the German 11th
dialog: Division - at the moment bivouacked three
dialog: miles to the east of the Menin Road. We have
dialog: been watching them and they have pitched
text: tents for the night and lit cooking fires.
dialog: Knock them out - and we could slide in
text: behind the German lines and come at them
dialog: from the South at Geluveld.
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Excellent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Numbers?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. MAJOR SINGH
text: About six hundred. Infantry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Twice our size...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: In regiments of horse and men, the
dialog: advantage is ours.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. MAJOR SINGH
dialog: And we have surprise on our side.
dialog: But the sooner we move, the better -
dialog: we have no assurance they'll still
dialog: be there tomorrow morning.
dialog: 
dialog: Our officers just have a second to take in the news. The day
text: has suddenly arrived. The day they have worked for, for so
dialog: long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Right. Good. So - today it is.
dialog: Charlie - tell the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Salisbury formation?
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Salisbury formation. We'll charge
dialog: through them and secure the ground
dialog: behind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SGT. MAJOR SINGH
text: The grass to the left is taller than
dialog: we are - it's perfect cover.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Excellent work, Sergeant Major.
dialog: Time spent on reconnaissance is
dialog: rarely wasted.
dialog: 
text: As Stewart departs:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Thank you, Singh.
speaker_heading: (CALLING AFTER)
dialog: Jamie!
dialog: 
text: Nicholls catches up to Stewart, concerned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: They have no idea we're coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Not having scruples, are you, Jim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: No. I understand the surprise is
dialog: everything. But if it must be done,
dialog: let's do it quickly.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls notices Charlie nervously attending his horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you alright, Charlie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE WAVERLY
dialog: Never been better. Literally, never
dialog: better.
dialog: 
dialog: We worry for him - he is afraid.
dialog: 
text: Stewart rides through the lines astride Topthorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Prepare to mount! Mount!
dialog: 
text: As the cry is echoed throughout the regiment, Nicholls
text: accepts Joey from an attending soldier.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Thank you, Standley.
speaker_heading: (TO JOEY)
dialog: Hey, Joey. My bonny boy. You're
dialog: all right, aren't you, Joey? Hey?
dialog: 
text: Nicholls takes the red campaign pennant from his pocket and
text: threads it through Joey's reins.
dialog: 
text: Minutes later - Stewart addresses the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Gentleman. It is an honour to ride
dialog: beside you. Make the Kaiser rue the
dialog: day he dared to cross swords with
dialog: us. Let every man make himself, his
dialog: King, his country, and his fallen
dialog: comrades proud! Be brave. Fear
dialog: God. Honor the King!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TROOPERS
dialog: (in unison shout)
dialog: Fear God. Honor the King!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OVER GROWN CORN FIELD. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Cut to an elegant field of tall grass, waving in the gentle
text: breeze. Then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of
text: it. They are in fact our soldiers, mounting their horses -
text: but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass.
dialog: 
text: Stewart gives a signal. We see the intense anticipation on
text: his face. He takes out his sabre.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Draw swords!
text: The men draw their sabres in silence. The birds chirping,
dialog: oblivious.
dialog: 
text: Then Nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost
dialog: whispers...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
dialog: Good luck, my friends.
dialog: 
text: He pats Joey's side. And then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART
dialog: Forward, to walk! Walk...march!
dialog: 
text: The regiment begins moving through the field.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Forward to canter! Canter...march!
dialog: 
text: The men start to float over the grass - swept along by their
dialog: invisible horses, until...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly they emerge from the tall grass - the immense power
text: of the galloping horses - silence explodes into a violent
text: crashing of hooves. The noise is immense, swords are flying
text: in the air. Hundreds of horses racing towards the German
text: encampment.
dialog: 
text: On the German side, TWO SOLDIERS wake to the sound of
text: hoofbeats. They pull their tent flap aside to find the
text: invincible charge coming towards them. The Germans are
text: totally unprepared. We see them scramble back towards tents,
text: rush towards their guns - one man pulling up his trousers
text: rushes for cover. One German drops some dirty dishes into a
dialog: wash pot, screaming:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: Kavallerie!
dialog: 
text: Topthorn and Joey race each other like a rerun of their
text: practice on Salisbury Plain. The swords and uniforms glint in
text: the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in
text: panic, others prepare to stand their ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
speaker_heading: CHARGE!
dialog: 
text: The British head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries
text: with sheer exhilaration.
dialog: 
text: We see the horses at close quarters running with all their
text: might. Nicholls and Stewart yell as they approach the enemy.
text: The surprise attack is a huge success. The first row of
text: unprepared Germans are falling...
dialog: 
text: The regiment sweeps through the encampment, cutting down
text: soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the
text: tree line.
dialog: 
text: But then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the
speaker_heading: CAMP --
dialog: 
text: A machine gun. No, a line of machine guns - at least twenty
text: guns, sandbagged apart - the logical, new, modern defence of
text: a garrison. In an instant, the fleeing Germans have manned
text: the guns. All now firing.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
text: The noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else.
text: A score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground, it
text: happens almost so quickly Joey and Topthorn don't realize
text: anything's wrong and find themselves racing straight towards
text: the guns. The bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the
text: regiment are on the ground.
dialog: 
text: Horse after horse races past the guns into the woods...all of
text: them now riderless.
dialog: 
text: Nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings
text: towards him. His face goes slack as he realizes he is about
dialog: to die.
dialog: 
text: A moment later, Joey runs on - we pan up to see he is running
text: on riderless - he has not realized that Nicholls is gone. The
text: bullets whizz around his head, but he still runs directly
dialog: ahead. We would always know him by the red pennant Nicholls
text: tied on his saddle.
dialog: 
text: Joey is now running through the German lines. No one bothers
text: to attack him as the German's concentrate their efforts on
text: the cavalry behind him. The line of machine guns fire as one,
text: decimating the horses and their riders.
dialog: 
text: Joey leaps and dances nimbly through the German ranks, but
text: suddenly rears up in the confusion, surrounded by Germans.
dialog: 
text: Near him, surviving English officers are hauled from their
dialog: horses.
dialog: 
text: Stewart wheels back around on Topthorn, sabre in hand. But
text: he, too, is quickly surrounded by several Germans with their
text: rifles trained on him. A furious GERMAN OFFICER storms over,
dialog: speaks perfect English:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
speaker_heading: (OUTRAGED)
dialog: What? Did you think that a garrison
dialog: on open ground would go undefended?
dialog: Look at yourself! Who do you think
dialog: you are?!!
dialog: 
text: Stewart looks at the Officer - at the guns that surround him -
text: and throws down his sabre, stabbing it into the ground. The
dialog: Germans take Stewart from Topthorn.
dialog: 
text: Around them, the fields are littered with dead soldiers and
dialog: horses.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Topthorn appears disoriented and frightened. Suddenly, he
text: rears up and bolts from his new German handler, galloping
text: over to Joey. The horses briefly nuzzle, but both rear up
text: again as they are separated and led past a young German
dialog: soldier, GUNTHER.
dialog: 
text: He zeroes in on them, the finest horses.
dialog: 
text: A slightly more JUNIOR OFFICER approaches the outraged senior
dialog: officer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER.
dialog: What do we do with the horses?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: If they're injured, shoot them.
scene_heading: JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: And the others, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: The others you round up and take to
dialog: base camp - they will pull guns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD OFFICER
dialog: You'll never get fancy horses like
dialog: these to pull guns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Then shoot them also.
dialog: 
text: Gunther, the young private, now standing behind them,
text: interjects.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Sir - perhaps we could use some of
dialog: them with the ambulances - to get
text: the injured men off the field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Will they take the harness?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: I'd like to try, sir.
dialog: 
text: The officers move away - that's enough talk about horses...
dialog: 
text: CUT ON - Gunther is now with Joey and Topthorn. Near a wooden
text: ambulance - which is like a giant wagon to carry humans. He
text: is with MICHAEL, a very young soldier, his brother - possibly
dialog: as young as 14.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: Gunther lifts a heavy pulling harness - and tries to get
text: Topthorn into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It won't work - they're cavalry
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Let's try.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You won't get the harness on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Come on, Michael.
dialog: 
text: Topthorn balks violently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Easy, now, easy now,
dialog: Englishman... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
dialog: Easy now, easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gunther! It's hopeless - we can't
dialog: help them.
dialog: 
text: And suddenly Joey moves up and presents himself, with his
dialog: strange self assurance and self sacrifice. And instinct for
dialog: survival.
dialog: 
text: He sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which
text: helps to calm Topthorn enough that Gunther can slip the
text: collar onto the big black horse. Gunther turns to Joey,
dialog: impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Well, well, look at you. Whoever
dialog: taught you this has just saved your
dialog: life.
dialog: 
text: Gunther spots the red ribbon in Joey's saddle, removes it,
text: folds it, and places it in his pocket.
dialog: 
text: Later - Gunther and Michael are returning from the
text: battlefield with Topthorn and Joey, pulling an ambulance with
text: British and German wounded. Amongst the wounded, we see a
text: hand gripping a battered, silk lined hat. It is Waverly,
text: wounded but alive.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. DEVON. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Si Easton lets himself in through the gate. Ted pulls up
text: turnips from their three acre crop.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
text: Rosie, just across a furrow, is also engaged in the harvest.
text: It's hard work. Si holds a parcel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: Hello the farm!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
text: (looking up, wiping her
speaker_heading: BROW)
dialog: Hello, Si Easton!
dialog: 
text: Albert passes carrying a crate laden with turnips, but pulls
text: up short when he hears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SI EASTON
dialog: I was at the post office and while I
dialog: was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel
dialog: had come for Albert, from the, from
dialog: the, from over there - and I thought
dialog: I could go up that way in the
dialog: morning. And - here it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Well, who'd be sending me a parcel
dialog: over there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, open it and see.
dialog: 
text: Albert opens the parcel and pulls out a leather sketchbook...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: It's a sketchbook...
dialog: (gasp of realization)
dialog: That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!
dialog: See that? That's a picture of Joey!
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: It's a picture of Joey. Well, I
dialog: never!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
dialog: And there's a letter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Well, go on then, go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: "Dear Albert Narracott.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Captain Nicholls, who died...Captain
dialog: Nicholls, who died in action today
dialog: left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam
dialog: Perkins.
dialog: 
text: Si Easton drops his head guiltily. Rosie catches this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: You weren't to know it was bad news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
text: He was riding Joey when he died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: You don't know that he was riding
dialog: him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
text: "In action," it says.
dialog: 
text: Everybody falls silent. Albert goes to the fence and looks
text: down at the sketches of Joey. Rosie looks at her son, her
text: heart breaking for him. Dad returns to the harvest without a
text: word. Albert looks off to the horizon and - over there.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN BASE CAMP. EVENING.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE -- A step stool.
dialog: 
text: Michael mounts the stool next to Joey and Topthorn, removes
text: their harnesses and carries them across the road.
dialog: 
text: Michael slips and falls into the mud. Gunther dashes over
text: and pulls him up just before a military convoy pulls into the
text: camp, running over the tack.
dialog: 
text: The BASE CAMP OFFICER appears on a motorbike.
text: BASE CAMP OFFICER.
dialog: Gentlemen! We move forward to the
text: frontline tonight. Full marching
dialog: orders. Get moving!
dialog: 
text: As the soldiers hop to their orders, the officer turns to -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: Schroeder! Schroeder!
dialog: 
text: Both Michael and Gunther turn to him. But it's Gunther the
text: Officer wants to talk to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: No, not you - you. Come.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
text: Gunther picks up the dropped harnesses as he approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm keeping you here. You are best
dialog: with the horses and we need to move
dialog: the camp quickly if the enemy
dialog: continue to push through from the
dialog: west.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: They're pushing through?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: I'm told. We will move later when we
dialog: find where the horses are needed
dialog: most.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my
dialog: brother here with me, he's also very
dialog: good with horses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: Oh no no. Not necessary.
speaker_heading: (TO MICHAEL)
dialog: Get moving. We leave tonight.
dialog: 
text: He walks away. Gunther is stricken by the news, but Michael
text: is excited. As he leads Joey past his brother:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's all right, Gunther.
dialog: 
text: Gunther can't really speak. Michael is just a boy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN CAMP / VARIOUS. EVENING.
text: Soldiers are lifting up their equipment - gathering - moving
text: in the same direction.
dialog: 
text: In a quiet tent, a few last soldiers are packing. And there
text: are Gunther and Michael, packing together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: You are not going. I'll tell them
dialog: you are only fourteen, that you're a
dialog: boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Father signed me in. He knew my age
dialog: -and so do they.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
text: The process of packing is their way of coping with the shock.
text: Gunther is folding one of Michael's shirts. Michael takes it
dialog: back...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mother obviously never taught you
dialog: how to fold a shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Of course she did. I just wasn't
dialog: listening. But you need to listen
dialog: now! I promised her, I made her a
dialog: solemn promise, that you would be
dialog: safe with me. With me, Michael!!
dialog: 
text: He leans close to Michael, talking in almost a whisper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: They'll never make a head count.
dialog: There are too many of us. You can
dialog: stay here - slip underneath the bed -
text: until they move out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Then what?
dialog: 
text: Michael carries on with his packing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Gunther, it will be fine. And when
text: all the machines break down and they
dialog: call up the horses, I'll see you at
dialog: the front. We'll be together again.
dialog: 
text: And now the case is packed. Gunther heads to the tent
dialog: opening.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Gunther...
dialog: 
text: Looking round, the tent is now empty. The moment to leave has
text: come. Gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and
text: follows Michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are
text: lining up in the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: I'm giving this to you. For luck.
dialog: 
text: Gunther ties the pennant to the back of Michael's pack as he
text: forms up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: To keep you safe.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
text: Michael smiles at him and begins to march. Marching towards
text: Ypres, on the Western Front.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: Im schnellschritt! Marsch...links!
dialog: Zwei, drei, vier!
dialog: 
text: We settle on young Michael - in line - he passes Gunther. He
text: remains eager. But it is goodbye. These soldiers moving into
text: the darkness and towards death. Gunther looks on - tears in
text: his eyes. The two horses are uneasy - sensing tension.
dialog: 
text: A few minutes later - Gunther grabs a saddle and throws it
text: onto Joey's back.
dialog: 
text: Back to the soldiers.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses. They whip
text: past the back of the line of marching soldiers. It's clear
text: what is happening - Gunther is on Topthorn - and has hold of
text: Joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him.
dialog: 
text: Gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he
text: is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the
text: wind, tied onto Michael's pack. Gunther speeds toward him.
text: This was his plan all along. And in an instant he is beside
text: him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his
text: arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and
text: dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's
text: pounding hooves.
dialog: 
text: Michael looks at the soldiers beside him - he looks at the
text: skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he
text: feels his brother's arm - pulling him upwards. And now, the
text: two of them are fully on Topthorn.
dialog: 
text: They leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers
dialog: try to restore order.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Get back in line! Line!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. LATER.
dialog: 
text: Michael now rides Joey, following Gunther on Topthorn. The
text: brothers look at each other - can't believe what they have
text: done - Michael is following his brother, swept along, doesn't
dialog: know if it is right.
dialog: 
text: And Michael and Joey and Gunther and Topthorn charge on to
dialog: freedom.
dialog: 
text: They spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some
dialog: drying clothes.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
text: As they ride, they grab civilian shirts and jackets and
text: trousers, the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: And on they ride - though all too soon day starts to break in
text: the far distance. They see a very dilapidated windmill. They
text: aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the
dialog: horizon.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. / EXT. WINDMILL. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: They reach the windmill. It feels very unused. The machinery
text: of the windmill creaks in the dawn. The brothers untether the
text: horses, careful now that it is light outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Michael fingers the pennant on Joey's reins. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Will Father be ashamed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: He will pretend to be. Maybe at
dialog: first he will be. But in the end, he
dialog: will be glad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And us? What about us?
dialog: 
text: Gunther looks at him - but doesn't reply. As Michael removes
speaker_heading: JOEY'S SADDLE:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I was ready to go. I was proud to
dialog: go.
text: (after a beat, in a very
speaker_heading: SMALL VOICE)
dialog: I wanted to go.
dialog: 
text: Later - They sit in silence, waiting for sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: The food in Italy is good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What about the women?
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Not as good as the food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because...they've eaten too much of
dialog: the food?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: You are too young for war. And
dialog: you're too young for women!
dialog: 
text: Gunther laughingly pushes him over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't feel so young. Not anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Go to sleep - we have a big night of
dialog: riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael.
dialog: 
text: He jokingly strokes Michael's cheek. Michael swats him away,
text: but as he settles in the hay:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Night night, Gunther.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL. DUSK.
dialog: 
text: Gunther and Michael sleep. Suddenly something awakens Joey.
text: He stirs and then rises. Hear the sound of engines and see
text: lights through the slats sweeping across Joey's face.
text: Michael and Gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a
text: car and several motorcycles approaching. Head-lamps filter
text: through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the
text: brothers awake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: Hei! In die windmühle!
dialog: 
text: The boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Go, go, go...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
text: They race up a nearby ladder, but Michael stumbles against a
text: table, upsetting some gear. It clatters loudly. They cower
text: as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside. Then the
text: windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright
text: headlights of the vehicles.
dialog: 
text: As they're marched out, we see what they see: A German car -
text: two motorcycles. Six Germans, including the officer who was
dialog: in charge of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: Schroeder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: A mistake?
dialog: He's offering an excuse, but -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNTHER
dialog: A promise.
dialog: 
text: The officer accepts this grimly, nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASE CAMP OFFICER
dialog: Ja...
dialog: 
text: As the boys are taken away, he lights a cigarette.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WINDMILL. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Through the turning arms of the windmill, we glimpse the
text: double execution. Four rifles fire - flashes of the soldiers
text: shooting - the bodies on the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDMILL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Complete stillness in the empty countryside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WINDMILL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: There are Joey and Topthorn, still waiting.
dialog: 
text: And then suddenly - the doors of the windmill creak. The two
text: horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence. The
text: door opens a little - and we see, reflected in Joey's eye, a
text: very delicate, beautiful, thirteen-year-old country girl
speaker_heading: (EMILIE).
dialog: 
text: She stares at the horses. They stare straight back at her.
text: And she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind
text: her. Joey and Topthorn settle for a moment.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
text: Time transition - Joey and Topthorn are in a slightly
text: different place - and the door opens again. It is the same
text: little girl - but this time she comes in carrying two buckets
text: full of water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. / EXT. FARMHOUSE / FARM. DAY.
dialog: 
text: A small humble farmhouse - and round it, small fields,
text: planted with different fruit crops. We see an old man
text: (GRANDFATHER), burdened with a basket of berries heading back
text: towards the farmhouse.
dialog: 
text: A SOUND CAUSES HIM TO LOOK OUT ACROSS THE FARM -- far in the
text: distance the STORM OF WAR is in the sky.
dialog: 
text: He enters the kitchen - which is rough, but full of the
text: paraphernalia of jam-making - jars, sieves, pectin, sugar.
text: Emilie is at the sink, washing berries.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Grandpére.
dialog: 
text: He heads towards the side-board, dumps the two bags and lifts
text: the first handful of fruits on to the counter.
dialog: 
text: She empties her clean berries into a bowl. Notes the
text: explosions outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's closer today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: The wind plays tricks with the noise
text: - it's moving away from us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: I can hear it, Grandpére, and there
dialog: is no wind. You shouldn't lie to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Here. There is no wind here. But
dialog: over there - a wind so strong it
dialog: will lift you off the ground...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: You lie about everything. You say
dialog: you aren't worried but it's clear
dialog: you are. I know the war is
dialog: approaching but you say, "Oh, it's
dialog: just a trick of the wind."
dialog: 
text: He retrieves a bottle of medicine from the mantle.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Did I say that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: You started lying when Mama and Papa
dialog: went away.
dialog: 
text: She pours a load of sugar into a bowl with the fruit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: They're dead. But you won't say so.
dialog: Do you think I'll die if you tell me
dialog: the truth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: The truth is -
text: He feeds her a spoonful of the medicine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: - you should speak to your elders
dialog: with respect.
dialog: 
text: She sticks her wet finger in the sugar and sucks it to help
dialog: with the taste of the medicine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: If you tell me the truth about the
dialog: war, I will tell you the truth about
dialog: the big horses I've been keeping in
text: the windmill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (standing, putting his
text: hands on his hips)
dialog: Now - who is the one telling lies!
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. SAME.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather looks stunned as he paces in front of JOEY AND
text: TOPTHORN - who stand in the small courtyard outside the
dialog: house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: In the windmill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Yes. They were standing in the
text: windmill waiting for Don Quixote.
dialog: This is François (Joey) and this is
dialog: Claude (Topthorn).
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: I named them after two boys who
dialog: broke my heart last Summer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: They must belong to someone. Horses
dialog: like this don't just appear from a
dialog: fairy-tale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Yes - I know, Grandpére. They are
dialog: not unicorns - so I will be fair and
dialog: wait -- one day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Emilie... Emilie...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: And if no one comes to get them by
dialog: night-time, then they belong to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Emilie. Look at me. You cannot
dialog: ride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Mother used to tell me how my bones
dialog: would give way with the slightest
dialog: bump or fall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yes. That's right. So it is
dialog: settled?
text: She kisses his cheek --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Good girl.
dialog: 
text: -- but then calmly leads the horses back to the windmill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: It will only be settled when I
dialog: decide which one to ride first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: But it's - Over my dead body!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: At least I won't have long to wait.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
text: That is the end of the conversation as far as she is
dialog: concerned.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Emilie is with the horses in the little stable at the end of
text: the courtyard - a bit away from the farm house - she is
dialog: feeding them out of a bucket - not very nice gruel.... WE
text: SEE THAT SHE IS HESITANT WITH THEM - that she has spent no
dialog: time around horses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
speaker_heading: (TO JOEY)
dialog: I was in love with a boy called
dialog: François - who had your lovely eyes.
speaker_heading: (TO CLAUDE)
dialog: Unfortunately he was in love with a
dialog: girl called Marie, who had your
text: teeth. She fell for a boy called
dialog: Claude - who broke my heart. And who
dialog: I intend to marry one day.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FIELD IN FRONT OF FARMHOUSE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather watches Emilie from inside the house as he makes
dialog: jam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (O.S.)
dialog: Eyes on me. No talking.
dialog: 
text: Outside, Emilie has fashioned two jumps. The big one for Joey
text: and a little demonstration obstacle for herself. She leads
text: Joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some
text: crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground.
text: The red pennant hangs from the stick. Joey stands quietly as
text: Emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with
text: her hand.
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Today we learn to jump. Did you know
dialog: the French cleared one meter eighty-
dialog: five at the Paris Olympics to win
dialog: the gold medal? Today we will beat
dialog: that record.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather chuckles. Emilie indicates the larger barrier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is your jump. When I call
dialog: you....be very brave and leap over
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: She claps, but Joey doesn't move.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Leap over it! Watch me.
dialog: 
text: She turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her
text: six-inch high barrier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And now it's your --
dialog: 
text: She turns to find Joey already stepping over her mini-jump,
text: stopping in front of her. He's only interested in the apple
text: in her hand. She takes a bite herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMP TO:
dialog: 
text: Emilie returns Joey to the starting line and runs back behind
text: the big jump. From behind her back she produces three big
text: carrots dripping soil. Joey's ears perk and he takes off
text: quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between
text: the two jumps.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his
text: strawberry jams. He laughs and goes back to work.
dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO FIELD
dialog: 
text: Aware she's being watched, she slings the carrots over her
text: shoulder, frustrated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMP TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BARN. LATER.
dialog: 
text: Joey slowly emerges from the barn with Emilie out in front
text: leading him with one hand. In the other hand, she carries a
text: small wooden step ladder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: He doesn't think we can do it. But
dialog: we will show him, won't we?
dialog: 
text: Emilie unfolds the ladder beside Joey and shakily starts
text: climbing to the top of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Her voice shaking)
dialog: No need to be afraid.
dialog: (Emilie looking down at
dialog: how far off the ground
speaker_heading: SHE IS)
dialog: You are...very tall.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
text: Before she can swing her leg over Joey's back -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You'll kill yourself.
dialog: 
text: Emilie turns, and there, blocking the hurdle, now standing
text: hands on hips, is Grandfather.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Only if you get in my way to make me
dialog: fall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Oh please, come off the ladd--
dialog: 
text: A SOUND from far down the road. Grandfather looks. Emilie
text: turns to look too. Two trucks led by a German motorcycle are
text: approaching the farm.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Find somewhere to hide them. And do
dialog: it quickly!!!
dialog: 
text: As Emilie races off with the horses, Grandfather pushes over
text: the jumps and jams the pennant into his pocket.
dialog: 
text: The bikes arrive first, just missing Emilie as she leads the
text: horses behind the house.
dialog: 
text: The trucks arrive, pull round - one of the soldiers in the
text: front jumps out and opens the back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Halt! Und aussteigen!
dialog: 
text: The people - 20 of them, all seeming to be poor French
text: peasants, mainly women, move out of the truck. As they walk
text: past, they avoid the eye of the Grandfather, who approaches
dialog: the soldiers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: My name is Bonnard - this is my
dialog: land. Why are you here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS
text: Food for the soldiers at the front.
dialog: Everyone must give their share.
dialog: 
dialog: And suddenly we see what is going to happen - the 20 peasants
text: spread out and move through the field - with either bags, or
text: using the aprons they wear - picking all the fruits - at just
dialog: the moment all the work has brought forth fruit - and the new
dialog: year's crop is ready.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
text: Raspberries, black-currants, gooseberries. In a few minutes,
text: everything he lives by will be gone.
dialog: 
text: Watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is BRANDT,
text: the officer in charge of the unit.
dialog: 
text: Cut to the fields - the aprons and baskets are getting full.
text: They move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts.
dialog: 
text: Back to the Grandfather - and out of the house comes Emilie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: They are taking everything. Where
dialog: are the horses?
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: What horses?
dialog: 
text: The sound of jars breaking draws Grandfather and Emilie into
text: the kitchen, where the Germans continue to raid their other
dialog: supplies.
dialog: 
text: One German picks up waterbath canner -- inspecting it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Leave it if you don't know what it's
dialog: for.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: A pot is a pot. We'll find some use
dialog: for it. Sir, where's the livestock?
text: Brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam
text: from an open jar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: I make jam. We have no animals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: But there's fresh hay in your barn.
dialog: 
text: Emilie enters, overhearing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: We use it to replace the mattress
dialog: stuffings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: Her grandfather?
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: Where are her parents?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
speaker_heading: (BREAKING IN)
dialog: They're dead. They died.
dialog: 
text: The German nods and is about to take his leave, putting the
text: pot back where he found it, when a clumping noise from
text: somewhere in the house begins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: The wind. It plays tricks in the
dialog: attic.
dialog: 
text: Brandt licks his finger and tests:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
text: There is no wind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: An old house creaks.
speaker_heading: (TO EMILIE)
dialog: Go - close the shutters.
dialog: 
text: Emilie runs out of the room. The soldier picks up the
dialog: medicine bottle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: She's sickly, no?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: If you or any of your friends harm
dialog: her, as old as I am, I will kill
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: The soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh. He slaps
text: the medicine flask into Grandfather's chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN SOLDIER
dialog: You know, I was going to give you
dialog: back your pot. But now I'm going to
dialog: keep it. For soup.
dialog: 
text: He slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and
text: leaves the house with the other soldiers.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: We will be back in the new season.
dialog: 
text: As the Germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where
text: Emilie lies curled up on the bed - and there, standing on
text: either side of the bed - are the two horses. They look huge
text: in the tiny room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. LATE THAT NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The sound of shells exploding. A huge bombardment somewhere
text: in the deep distance. But much closer than before. The
text: distant, malicious giants of war growl.
dialog: 
text: It is like a lightning storm on the horizon.
dialog: 
text: The kitchen has been emptied. The war has finally come to
text: them - and we can see it on Emilie's face.
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Tell me what happened to them. To my
dialog: mother and father.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You said you would tell me how they
dialog: died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's
dialog: my birthday! They died fighting,
dialog: didn't they? But when the soldiers
speaker_heading: COME -
dialog: 
text: She finally turns to face him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: - you do nothing. You are a coward,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yes. Yes. It was your parents who
dialog: were brave. I make jams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: And you've never done a brave thing
dialog: in your life?
dialog: 
text: He eases himself into a chair and shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Maybe there are different ways to be
dialog: brave. Did you know the French have
dialog: the best carrier pigeons? And this
dialog: could be the difference in the war -
dialog: our messages getting through.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: I don't want to hear about the
dialog: birds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: They are released at the front and
dialog: told to go home - this is all they
dialog: know. But to get there they must
dialog: fly over a war. Can you imagine
dialog: such a thing? Here you are flying
dialog: over so much pain and terror - and
dialog: you know you can never look down.
dialog: You have to look forward or you'll
dialog: never get home. I ask you - what
dialog: could be braver than that?
dialog: 
text: Emilie sheds a single tear.
scene_heading: INT. THE BARN. DAWN.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather enters the barn, strokes Topthorn's nose as he
text: passes. He sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal
text: a trap door. Then, he opens it.
dialog: 
text: Now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly
text: object, covered in another rug.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN. MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Emilie comes down the stairs as Grandfather waits proudly by
text: the stove. She stops when she sees the OBJECT COVERED BY THE
speaker_heading: RUG.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: A present.
dialog: 
text: Emilie moves toward the object that is covered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: I hope you have not bought me a
dialog: disgusting dress that I then have to
dialog: wear like last year.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: It was disgusting?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
text: Then she stops herself and turns to Grandfather with a
dialog: parental rebuke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me your hand.
dialog: (she takes it in hers)
dialog: Grandpére, we have no money. When
dialog: the war is over, then you can buy me
text: jewels and carriages.
dialog: 
text: The grandfather smiles and gives Emily a hug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Anything you say, my sweet one.
dialog: Anything-you-say! You are, of
dialog: course, the boss. It's just an old
dialog: thing I found - don't worry yourself
dialog: - leave it, I'll put it back.
text: He leaves the room. Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it
text: when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the
text: rug. She looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not
text: being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. Her face
text: explodes with a gorgeous smile. She pulls off the rug that
text: is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle.
text: She runs her hand along the saddle -- can hardly believe it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A HILL. JUST BEYOND THE FARMHOUSE. NEAR THE WINDMILL.
speaker_heading: DAY.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather helps to swing Emilie up and into the saddle.
text: All at once, the Grandfather's charity evaporates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: It was your mother's. I hid it, so
dialog: as not to encourage you. Emilie, I
dialog: want you to ride very slowly, very
dialog: carefully. And promise me you won't
dialog: go far --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: Of course. Okay, I promise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
text: To the top of the hill and straight
dialog: back again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: I promise.
dialog: 
text: Emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to
text: Grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE (CONT'D)
dialog: My hero.
dialog: 
text: She sets off on Joey - and quickly spurs him to a gallop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Slowly...slowly...
dialog: 
text: She rides - past the windmill - and then over the top of a
text: nearby hill - she speeds over it and out of sight.
dialog: 
text: Back to the hill - a sudden change of mood. An empty shot. No
text: movement, no returning girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Emilie!
dialog: 
text: Cut again to the top of the hill, then back to the
text: Grandfather, very worried.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Emilie!
dialog: 
text: Topthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following,
text: sensing danger. Grandfather starts to run in the direction of
dialog: the hill.
dialog: 
text: Topthorn charging over the brow of the hill.
dialog: 
text: The Grandfather running - out of breath.
dialog: 
text: He hears an indistinct scream from Emilie!
dialog: 
text: He reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and
text: there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been
text: fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and
text: motorbikes. It is like a line of Indians in a Western -
text: total, alien fear.
dialog: 
text: And there amongst them is Emilie, astride a panicked Joey,
text: surrounded by soldiers. Another one holds Topthorn, who bucks
text: and rears, but to no avail. Grandfather starts down the hill
text: towards his granddaughter.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN COLUMN NEAR THE WINDMILL. THE SAME
dialog: 
text: The Germans are moving through the horses they have gathered.
text: Emilie, unhorsed, tries to get to Joey, who is being roughly
text: led away by a German soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: No! Let go of me! No!
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather grabs her. She is screaming. He tries to calm her
text: down. Joey is tied up as is Topthorn. Emilie is kicking and
text: screaming - but also desperately short of breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: She is my granddaughter! Emilie,
dialog: stop! Don't hurt her, please!
dialog: Don't hurt her.
dialog: 
text: A soldier roughly shoves Emilie at him.
dialog: 
text: Brandt approaches. Emilie screams at him, in tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIE
dialog: You don't need them! There are so
dialog: many others!
dialog: 
text: Emilie is still sobbing. Grandfather hugs her - in horror
text: that she is now struggling so hard for breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Please, take the bigger one and
dialog: leave the smaller one. You are
dialog: breaking my granddaughter's heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
speaker_heading: (LEAVING)
dialog: The war has taken everything from
dialog: everyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
speaker_heading: (CALLING AFTER)
dialog: What will happen to them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: They will pull artillery until they
speaker_heading: DIE -
speaker_heading: EMILIE
speaker_heading: (COUGHING)
dialog: François!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: - or until the war is over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: It will never be over!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: You have your answer then.
dialog: 
text: The motorbikes start up and drive off. The Grandfather
text: hugging tiny Emilie as she coughs.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
text: The Germans disappear up the lane leaving the old man and the
text: child bereft in the bitter cold.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN CAMP. LATER.
dialog: 
text: Two grooms trail Brandt, leading Joey and Topthorn toward a
text: makeshift corral.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Heiglemann - these are yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: They look strong - should last a
dialog: month or two.
text: FRIEDRICH is an unprepossessing, chubby man. He marvels at
text: Topthorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: You are beautiful.
dialog: 
text: But then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard
text: and weak. He turns to Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a pity they found you.
dialog: 
text: He takes the leads of the pair of them. He sighs...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Such a pity...
dialog: 
text: In a strange way, there are many humans Joey meets, but also
dialog: just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for
text: animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film.
dialog: 
text: And then they go over a ridge - and we suddenly see the
text: explanation of Friedrich's comment. The road they can see
text: below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a
text: scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and
text: artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a
dialog: terrible condition.
dialog: 
dialog: For Joey and Topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers
text: arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in Changi
dialog: prison by the Japanese during World War 2. They have never
dialog: seen horses in this condition. You can see in their eyes the
dialog: confusion. This is a whole different world, where horses can
dialog: turn into creatures that look like this.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: And it is also a vision of their future. This may be the
text: moment the mighty Topthorn begins to lose hope. For Joey it
dialog: is another level of knowledge - another mighty thing he will
dialog: fight through - because he always fights through.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEEP INCLINE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Friedrich leads Joey and Topthorn in the wake of THE HUGE
text: MORSER - an elaborate 15 ton monstrosity with a six inch
text: bore. It takes a team of six horses to haul it with a dozen
text: men pushing from behind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER
dialog: Pull together!
dialog: 
text: A soldier calls from the front of the heavy cannon - pulled
text: by a particularly wretched group of horses.
scene_heading: ARTILLERY SOLDIER
dialog: Halt! Halt! Stop!
dialog: 
text: Lower down the hill, Friedrich waves down the rest of the
dialog: column.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: Stop! Stop!
dialog: 
text: At the front of the Morser, one of the lead horses collapses -
dialog: he will never get up again.
dialog: 
text: Brandt steps up, pulls a revolver out of his pocket and
text: shoots the horse dead. It has come to this.
dialog: 
text: Joey, Topthorn, and all the other horses are spooked by the
dialog: pistol shot.
dialog: 
text: Brandt shouts to Friedrich from the road.
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Heiglemann, bring up another one!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER
dialog: Heiglemann, bring up another horse!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: That one!

speaker_heading: BRANDT (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no. The big black one!

text: Friedrich hauls Topthorn, hesitantly, while Joey watches.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
text: As he reaches Brandt:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: He's a good horse, sir. But if you
text: move him up to the heavy gun, he
dialog: will be no use at all. Prince is
text: already losing condition. His leg,
dialog: sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: You have given them names?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: You should never give a name to
dialog: anything you are certain to lose.
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: His leg is not good enough, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Private, you will do as you are
dialog: told.
speaker_heading: (CALLING OFF)
dialog: Hook him up.
dialog: 
text: Friedrich has no choice but as he starts to lead Topthorn,
text: Joey rears up and escapes his groom. He gallops up the hill
text: to the gun - offering himself up to save Topthorn. It is his
text: "Tale of Two Cities" moment - giving up his life to save his
text: friend. He bucks and rears. Friedrich turns to Brandt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: As you see, sir, this one is
dialog: stronger.
text: Brandt takes up Friedrich, and Joey's, offer -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: Hook him up.
dialog: 
text: As Joey is hooked to the gun, he looks back to Friedrich who
text: leads Topthorn back down the hill.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEEP INCLINE. LATER.
dialog: 
text: The convoy struggles up the hill. Joey feels the dead weight
text: of the gun. These are several tons of cast iron - almost
text: dwarfing the horses. Friedrich notices. Together, this grim
text: circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the
dialog: rain.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
text: Joey leads the team up the incline. Each step is an immense
text: effort. The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed. It
dialog: is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose
text: ground, but his experience in Dartmoor comes into play and
text: although he almost loses his balance several times he stays
text: upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the
dialog: hill.
dialog: 
text: We follow his progress step by step. Friedrich watches
text: anxiously. Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun. One
text: throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction. As they
text: reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too
text: much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back. Joey
text: finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the
text: tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the
text: cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD. DAY.
text: Soldiers scurry around the giant gun, preparing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Halt! Halt! Take the horses away!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER
dialog: Shell!
dialog: 
text: Friedrich observes with Topthorn as a giant shell is carried
text: to the gun's breech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: And load!
dialog: 
text: The men wrestle it into place -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Back! Case!
dialog: - and secure it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Position!
dialog: 
text: The barrel of the giant gun ratchets upward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: And...fire!
dialog: 
text: The shell explodes from the barrel. And then from another.
text: And another. For the first time we see the big picture - the
text: line of assembled cannons of which they were just one tiny
dialog: part.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
text: Each gun recoils violently as they shoot their shells into
text: oblivion - as soon as one shell is fired another is loaded -
text: the noise is deafening - the line seemingly endless - an
dialog: obscene production line of death. This is what the horses
dialog: have been feeding - this massive merciless thing.
dialog: 
text: Smoke wafts from the guns as we see the explosions in the
text: distance. The sound of the explosions takes us to -
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRITISH TRENCH. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Explosions light the dirty faces of British boys in uniform,
text: one after the next. Each light fading out before the next
text: great blast illuminates another anonymous face -then another -
text: and then another - and then ALBERT. Hold on him for extra
text: moments before he fades completely.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES. EARLY DAWN.
scene_heading: TITLE: FRANCE - 1918, THE SOMME
dialog: 
text: With the barrage lifted, the British soldiers that are
text: huddled in a low sub-trench, are ordered back on the line.
text: Andrew Easton is with Albert and he's shaken and terrified. A
dialog: far cry from the happy young boy we knew.
dialog: 
text: A gruff sergeant (SERGEANT MARTIN) walks the trench with a
text: bucket and each soldier puts in their valuables and personal
dialog: belongings. One a lighter, some money, etc.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERGEANT MARTIN
dialog: Valuables in the bucket, lads. If
dialog: you live, you'll get them back. If
dialog: you live, you'll get them back.
dialog: Good lads.
dialog: 
text: Albert and Andrew move down the trench in a line of soldiers
text: who are given ammo belts and grenades.
dialog: 
text: Albert gets his grenades and walks further along the
text: trenches. We follow him in real time as he passes a bunch of
text: soldiers who are kneeling in the ankle deep water, a PADRE is
text: giving them communion. The deafening noise of shelling all
dialog: around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe
dialog: it's a drill like last time.
dialog: 
dialog: We keep following Albert's progress in real time - further on
text: there is a post box where they all put their final letters
text: home in identical green envelopes. We see Albert's letter
text: addressed to "Ted and Rose Narracott" in Devon. He posts it
text: in a battered metal post box.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
text: An officer approaches:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Love letter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: That's my business.
dialog: 
text: It is David - Lyon's son - now in charge of this small group
text: of men. Still arrogant - looking older than Albert in his
text: uniform - and clearly enjoying his superior rank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hear you and your mate were doing
dialog: bird imitations again. You gonna
dialog: write a letter to your horse?
dialog: 
text: Albert ignores him. Andrew can't help but giggle.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: After you find your horse, I've lost
text: my needle in a haystack, and I could
dialog: use some help.
dialog: 
text: David takes up a bucket and walks down the line of soldiers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Anything valuable. Anyone who comes
text: back gets to share it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (TO ANDREW)
dialog: Stay here.
dialog: 
text: Albert follows David down the trench.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember that day me and Joey raced
dialog: you in your car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I remember you somersaulting through
dialog: the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Who was that girl you were with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There was a girl?
dialog: 
text: Albert nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: There was. Don't you remember?
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was just some girl, I suppose. I
dialog: don't recall which one. I do
dialog: remember you falling on your bum in
text: a ditch.
dialog: 
text: Andrew laughs amiably. David points to him, smirking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You see? Always entertaining,
dialog: Narracott, I'll give you that.
dialog: 
text: As David walks on, Andrew smiles at Albert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You did that? You fell on your bum?
dialog: 
text: Albert leaves without answering. Andrew keeps smiling until
text: a large shell explodes nearby. Troops surge towards their
text: ladders as officers scream indistinct orders.
dialog: 
text: Now David leads his troop through the trenches to the front
text: line where they stop, lean against the enemy-side wall
text: nervously and wait - each man in private contemplation.
dialog: 
text: Sergeant Martin moves along the lines, pushing men forward.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERGEANT MARTIN
dialog: Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men,
dialog: get ready to go! Get ready to move
dialog: out! Stay in position!
dialog: 
text: David calls out from atop a trench ladder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hold your nerve, boys. Remember,
dialog: it's not far to go. There's a way
dialog: through.
dialog: (he moves down the line)
dialog: Run fast, keep your wits about you,
dialog: keep your eyes open and God and the
dialog: King will keep an eye on you.
dialog: Company will fix bayonets! Fix
dialog: bayonets!
dialog: 
text: The echo of `fix bayonets' goes down the line - and every man
text: fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun.
dialog: 
text: Then Albert turns to Andrew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You know what it reminds me of out
dialog: there?
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: That bloody impossible lower field
dialog: the day me and Joey plowed it. Best
dialog: day of my life that was and you were
dialog: there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: And this here is the worst day of my
dialog: life, about to begin, and you're
dialog: here cheering me on. Us two, always.
dialog: And him.
dialog: 
text: He nods at David Lyons, who gives instructions to another
dialog: soldier.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Once you're in no man's land, go to
dialog: the flanks. Stay on the flanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
text: David turns to Albert and Andrew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, boys, come on. To the
dialog: ladder!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
speaker_heading: (TO ANDREW)
dialog: Stick close to the gentry, that's
dialog: our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck
dialog: but they have the luck.
text: They both smile. And then the fear takes over again. Andrew
text: particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now.
text: David urges them forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You, too, Narracott.
speaker_heading: (TO ANDREW)
dialog: And you, too.
dialog: 
text: Andrew and Albert pass by the bucket. They throw some
text: valuables in. But a moment later, Albert goes back to the
text: bucket and pulls something out - a worn piece of paper - he
text: unfolds it - it is the little sketch that Captain Nicholls
text: drew of Joey the night before they left for France. He slips
text: it inside his shirt, next to his heart.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, on your ladders, boy. On
dialog: your ladders. In you go, in you go.
dialog: That's it.
dialog: 
text: Andrew turns towards a ladder. As fate and placement would
text: have it - he is first in line. He puts his foot on the
text: ladder, when suddenly the Sergeant stops him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERGEANT MARTIN
dialog: Listen to your sergeant!
dialog: 
text: He pulls Andrew aside, speaking so that everyone can hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: If anybody turns back, if any one of
dialog: our boys come running towards you -
dialog: you take this rifle and you shoot
dialog: them dead. Do you understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS
dialog: Yes, sir!
dialog: 
text: The sergeant pushes in on Andrew, private and intense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Do you understand me? Do you
dialog: understand what I'm telling you,
dialog: son? You take this rifle and you
dialog: shoot them dead. Understand?
dialog: 
text: Andrew looks ready to cry, but manages to nod. Albert turns
text: to him, only to be pushed back by the sergeant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Up there, son. Up your ladder. Up
dialog: your ladder to your work!
text: Albert looks nervously back at Albert, comforting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: It's good. Andrew, it's good.
dialog: Andrew! Nobody's retreating today.
dialog: Andrew! Andrew! Nobody. Is
text: retreating. Today.
dialog: 
text: The COMMANDER arrives, checks the time on his AIDE's watch,
text: mounts his ladder and blows a whistle to signal the charge.
text: A BAGPIPER plays as the men go over the top.
dialog: 
text: David now heads up the ladder first. Gun fire overhead,
text: Albert steels himself, then hauls himself over the top,
text: followed by the next man and the next.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
text: Immediately machine gun fire whistles past, we hear the
text: screams of the first men who are shot. We follow Albert.
dialog: 
dialog: We are him. His vision. His experience. The ground is
text: blasted, there are bodies all around him. He tries to run but
text: his feet sink into the mud. Bullets fly past him. Felled men
text: are screaming at his feet in fear and agony. Albert staggers
text: forward. David is now right by him. They run together. Albert
text: looks round and suddenly, David is hit. He falls to the
text: ground, screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm shot! No!
dialog: 
text: Albert instinctively goes to help. Bullets shower all around
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Just leave me. Leave me!
dialog: 
text: Albert grabs him and drags him onwards with him - David
text: screaming at the pain - Albert grimly determined. Shells
text: explode around them as they stumble on. Other men are
text: running and falling. Albert sees cover in a huge shell-hole
text: so dives into it for a moment's reprieve from the gun fire.
text: He sits in still terror for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You'll be all right here. You'll be
dialog: safe. Someone'll come for ya.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Albert. Albert, listen...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: It's all right. It's all right.
dialog: We're Devon boys, yeah?
text: David looks at Albert as though seeing him for the first
dialog: time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
text: Albert races onward.
dialog: 
text: Back at the trench, Andrew waits - terrified - and then, back
text: out of the mist step two men - heading back towards him. Then
text: a third. They suddenly catch sight of Andrew waiting there
text: with his gun pointed towards them. They slow down - in the
dialog: terror of the assault, they had forgotten that death was
dialog: waiting for them if they turned back.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
text: Time seems to slow down - Andrew shifts his gun from pointing
text: at one - to the other - we see their individual faces. They
dialog: are all just boys really.
dialog: 
text: And suddenly, instinct hits Andrew - he charges up the
text: ladder, and forward, firing - past the three men, towards the
text: enemy. He chooses his death instead of theirs. A sudden
text: barrage of machine gun fire all around him.
dialog: 
text: Cut back to Albert, who makes his way to the edge of the
text: shell hole. Bullets whizz inches from his head. He looks over
text: to see a German machine gun position to his right. Bullets
text: whizz past forcing him to duck.
dialog: 
text: Andrew charges past other soldiers, ignoring their warnings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDOM SOLDIER
dialog: Get down!
text: Albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole,
text: nearer to the German line. He scrambles from shell hole to
text: shell hole. Now he's very close to the machine gun position.
dialog: 
text: Albert takes a grenade, fumbles with the pin as his hands
text: tremble. He finally gets the pin out and he hurls the
text: grenade at the machine gunner. We see the explosion and the
text: machine gun stop. Albert sprints over the top again and makes
text: it all the way into the German trench.
dialog: 
text: Albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty.
text: Albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas-
text: masked German holding a rifle on him.
dialog: 
text: Albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped
text: backwards against the side of the trench still upright.
text: Albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him,
text: ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead
dialog: German soldiers.
dialog: 
text: Albert is alone, everyone else is dead. All the dead wear
text: gas masks.
dialog: 
text: More British soldiers drop into the trench, among them
text: Andrew. He stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers
text: it, and races through the trench.
dialog: 
text: He glimpses Albert ahead of him, stalking through the mist.
text: Andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward, prompting
text: Albert to whirl with his rifle raised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: NO!
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
text: Albert pauses just in time. Then he collapses against the
text: side of the trench, overwhelmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Albie.
dialog: 
text: Andrew grabs Albert and holds him up, embracing him. Albert
dialog: can barely whisper:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: We made it. We made it.
dialog: 
text: A moment later, the pair of them hurry through the trenches.
text: Albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to
dialog: Andrew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Andrew, this way out!
text: Suddenly ANOTHER SOLDIER leaps from a trench branch between
text: them, shouting in panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Gas! Gas! Gas!
dialog: 
text: An instant later, a gas cloud blasts through the trench.
text: Andrew and Albert look in horror. It spreads towards them,
text: too powerful to avoid. Andrew is closest, turns to Albert
dialog: with a helpless -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Albie...
dialog: 
text: - before he takes the full power of it. An instant later, the
text: white, deadly cloud encompasses Albert, too...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF THE BATTLEFIELDS. DUSK.
text: Close on hooves and boots, slogging through muddy water,
text: several inches deep.
dialog: 
text: Friedrich is walking along, leading Topthorn and Joey.
text: Topthorn is limping.
dialog: 
text: Something is wrong - Topthorn seems to be failing - he coughs
text: badly, breathes strangely. Friedrich stops to check on him.
text: An officer notices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep
text: them moving.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: Sir, there's something wrong. This
dialog: one needs to rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: There's no rest for them. Move them
dialog: along. Move them along!
dialog: 
text: Instead, Friedrich leads the horses under the cover of a low
text: bridge for a brief respite. A moment later, Topthorn
text: collapses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: Please, please, please. Stay on
dialog: your feet. No, please. No no no...
dialog: 
text: Friedrich tries to help Topthorn valiantly struggling to get
text: up but finally sinks to the ground again. This time he lies
text: semi-conscious. He is dying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Please please... Stay on your feet.
dialog: 
text: Joey deeply upset nuzzles his nose into Topthorn but the life
text: drains out him. Friedrich is in panic at Topthorn's quick
speaker_heading: DECLINE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. Please please...
dialog: 
text: Friedrich continues to stroke Topthorn's head. Joey pushes
text: Topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness. For
text: a moment we think Topthorn will come round but he slips away
text: and all life leaves his body. Friedrich solemnly strokes the
text: horse, knowing all is lost.
dialog: 
text: Joey does not understand. He pulls at Topthorn's reins, as if
text: trying to pull him upright. Topthorn's body is inert, his
text: head falls to the earth. Joey will not give up, he pulls at
text: him desperately not understanding that Topthorn has died.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Friedrich looks around. Chaos - all the German
text: soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get
text: their guns and helmets. An officer charges down the bank next
text: to the bridge, screaming orders at Friedrich.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: They're coming! Leave it, private!
dialog: 
text: Friedrich tries to pull Joey away to safety but Joey will not
text: leave Topthorn's body. Friedrich pulls at Joey, but Joey is
text: too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the
dialog: danger.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave it! Come with me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH
dialog: Go to hell!
dialog: 
text: The officer nods to two other soldiers who pull Friedrich to
text: safety. As he's dragged away, he screams at Joey:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Run. Run! Run! Run!
dialog: 
text: But this is all background noise to Joey's profound refusal
text: to accept Topthorn is dead. He paws at the ground next to
text: Topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field,
dialog: and he will never leave him.
dialog: 
text: And then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the
text: streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for
text: Joey. He bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he
text: reaches a barbed wire barrier - a dead end. He attempts to
text: run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well. He rears up,
text: but the tank keeps advancing.
dialog: 
text: The tank is about to crush Joey. He has left it too late. He
text: is about to die.
dialog: 
text: But then, counter-intuitively, he runs straight towards the
text: tank and...leaps over it - a leap he learnt from Emilie. Then
text: scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind.
dialog: 
text: Joey keeps on running. He is wild, frightened.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE / VILLAGE / TRENCH. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Joey is free - in countryside - but there is blood pouring
text: from his leg, clearly torn by his encounter with the tank. He
text: runs on - it is becoming night - suddenly there are
text: explosions to the left of him - this fast, elegant creature
text: simply runs through the gaps between explosions.
dialog: 
text: But as he charges on - the sky lights up in the direction he
text: is heading. He is suddenly in the thick of battle. A shell
text: explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench.
text: Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - he
text: finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and he
text: races through it - and finds himself charging towards a
text: German company. Both sides are equally startled - Joey
text: charging through a thin trench lined with German soldiers -
text: the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them.
dialog: 
text: In desperation, Joey scrambles out of the trench - and once
text: again, rushes away from the fighting...
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
text: But now it is very dark indeed - he is stumbling as he runs -
text: there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs.
dialog: 
text: Now it is total night - fog - confusion - he jumps again. And
text: now everywhere there are potholes - the land is massively
text: uneven - shells are exploding all around. And suddenly sees
text: in front of him barbed wire. He crashes through it - more -
text: he bursts through again - now dragging barriers behind him -
text: the barriers tangle, pulling him up short - he flips and
text: lands amongst even more barbed wire.
dialog: 
text: He pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossible.
text: The more he pulls, the more firmly he is trapped. He rises
text: up, wild, magnificent, a beast fighting for his life.
dialog: 
text: He is completely trapped. He cannot move. He cannot see. He
text: is in pain. He falls. It feels like an end.
scene_heading: EXT. BRITISH TRENCH. THE SAME.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE SOLDIER (O.S.)
dialog: Stand to, stand to -
dialog: 
text: A young soldier, a Geordie, is on look-out duty. He looks

dialog: northern, Newcastle accent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE SOLDIER (CONT'D)
text: There's something moving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: What the hell is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE SOLDIER
text: It looks like a cow.
dialog: 
text: He passes the periscope to the second soldier.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: What the hell would a cow be doing out
dialog: there?
dialog: 
text: We see what he sees - nothing but morning mist on the surreal

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: That definitely isn't a cow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (handing over periscope)
dialog: Well, what is it?

speaker_heading: SECOND GERMAN
dialog: It can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD GERMAN
text: It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND GERMAN
dialog: Yes - it's a horse.
text: The second German looks through the periscope, stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD GERMAN
dialog: It's a horse.
dialog: 
text: A third German (PETER) lowers his binoculars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, it's a horse.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES. THE SAME.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BRITISH CAPTAIN
dialog: Well, bugger me. It's a horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE SOLDIER
dialog: Lads, we should call him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BRITISH SOLDIER
dialog: How do you call a horse?
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The Germans hear the clicks and respond with a chorus of

text: He's caught on the wire.

scene_heading: EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES, THE SAME.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE SOLDIER
dialog: Oh sod it...
dialog: 
text: Geordie climbs up the side of the trench, and waves a white
text: handkerchief tied to the end of his bayonet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRITISH CAPTAIN
dialog: What do you think you're doing? Get
dialog: back, do you hear me? Corporal,
dialog: that's an order! Get back!
dialog: 
text: Geordie, not receiving fire, is emboldened to stand up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BRITISH SOLDIER
dialog: Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.
dialog: 
text: He waves the handkerchief to clearly signal he is no threat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The Germans look at the young soldier making his way over No
dialog: Man's Land.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's he doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND GERMAN
dialog: It's a trap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I don't think so. I think he's
text: trying to help.
dialog: 
text: The second German cocks his rifle and starts to take aim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD GERMAN
text: Scare him back into his hole.
dialog: 
text: The second German takes a shot aimed over the Geordie's
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NO MAN'S LAND. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie crouches for cover, waving his handkerchief more
dialog: frantically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: It's a white flag, ent it? You see
dialog: the white flag!? I'm just after
dialog: tending to this here horse, is all!
dialog: 
text: The Georgie marshals his courage and stands again, waving the
dialog: handkerchief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRITISH CAPTAIN
dialog: Get back, you stupid git!
dialog: 
text: There's no fire from the German trenches. Muttering to
text: himself, the Geordie marches forward towards Joey:
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
dialog: want, he leadeth me into green
text: pastures, he lay me down beside the
dialog: still waters...
dialog: 
text: The Geordie walks very slowly across the mud - there are
text: bodies - the ground squelches beneath his feet. He waves his
text: handkerchief as he walks. He crosses a narrow bridge that
text: spans a flooded bomb crater.
dialog: 
text: Joey, lying on his side, wrapped head to toe in barbed wire,
text: covered in mud, watches Geordie approach. When Geordie gets
text: too close, Joey freaks out and begins thrashing about. Joey
text: whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into
text: his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him
text: deeper. Particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped
text: around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to
text: slash it. The Geordie calls out in a soothing voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Poor beastie. Poor babbie. It's
dialog: alright. It's alright. Don't buck
dialog: and wriggle so, you're only
dialog: shredding yourself.
dialog: 
text: Joey calms a little, still moving his head up and down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll blind yourself.
dialog: 
text: He reaches Joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in
text: which Joey's bundled. The Geordie soothes and at the same
text: time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where
dialog: to begin.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bugger me worthless - I didn't think
dialog: to bring gloves or something to cut
speaker_heading: THE -
dialog: 
text: He stabs his hand on one of the barbs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: OW! DAMN! OW!!
dialog: 
text: There's a noise behind him, and the Geordie turns around to
text: see the Peter (the German from the trench) standing several
text: feet away, holding some wire cutters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought perhaps you might need
dialog: these.
text: He holds out the wire cutters. The Geordie, still
text: frightened, stares stupidly at them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: For the barbed wire?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks.
dialog: Cheers. Cheers...
dialog: 
text: He reaches out and takes the proffered cutters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: He returns to Joey, nervous about turning his back. He tries
text: to figure out where to begin cutting. He lifts a long strand
text: of wire that wraps around Joey's neck, stretches across his
text: shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs. He puts
text: the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip
text: when Peter steps closer to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That...That's a very long strand.
dialog: When you cut it, it's going to
dialog: release this -
dialog: 
text: He points to a wire wrapped around the wire the Geordie's
text: lifting. Then he points to two other wires, similarly
speaker_heading: ENTANGLED:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: - and this, and this, and they'll
text: coil back rather violently, which
dialog: I'm afraid will only wound the poor
dialog: fellow further.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: You speak good English.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I speak English well.
dialog: (re: the cutters)
dialog: May I?
dialog: 
text: The Geordie hands them over and Peter surveys the wires.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: What if we cut his head free first?
dialog: So he won't try to stand up and
dialog: blind himself? And then -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Pity you didn't bring a second pair.
dialog: Then I could cut the wire here -
dialog: 
text: He points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd
dialog: been prepared to cut.
dialog: 
text: Peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS!
dialog: 
text: All at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come
text: soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater.
dialog: 
text: Moments later - Peter and the Geordie kneel beside Joey, each
text: with a pair of cutters.
dialog: 
text: Joey is calming down again.
text: The Geordie positions himself across Joey's body so that when
text: he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut Joey. Peter
text: positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick
text: succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: Joey's completely still now.
dialog: 
text: Peter points between Joey's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: His blind spot. The cutters won't
dialog: frighten him. If you could cut
dialog: here, holding this wire -
dialog: 
text: He points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses
text: Joey's eye. Then he points to the wire across Joey's eye.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I could -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Say no more, I'm right behind you.
dialog: 
text: As they reposition themselves, the Geordie says to Joey:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And you understand what's happening,
dialog: do you not, O Best Beloved? That you
dialog: must lay so very nice and still.
dialog: There's a lad, you're a remarkable
dialog: horse, you are, helping us help you.
dialog: There's a lad. There's a remarkable
dialog: lad.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie looks into Joey's huge eye as he and Peter get to
text: work on their cutting. Joey returns his gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So how's things in yonder trench?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Delightful. We read, we knit
dialog: sweaters, and we train our rats to
dialog: perform circus tricks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Well, if ever you need any more
dialog: rats, we can always send ours over.
dialog: `Cause we've more than we need,
dialog: strictly speaking. Besides, they
dialog: scare off all the pretty girls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Our girls aren't afraid of rats.
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind
dialog: what gives robust massages?
dialog: 
text: They laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Every Thursday! And they bring rum
dialog: cake on your birthday.
dialog: 
text: Both men smile at this while Joey is completely still; they
text: work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of
dialog: the wire.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
text: Joey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs
text: a little. The two soldiers smile at one another. Then they
text: set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie cuts through the last wire binding Joey's legs.
text: The two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Look at that horse! Look at the
dialog: muscles he's got, them long legs.
dialog: They're made for running, horses.
dialog: Runnin' away from danger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Running away is all they have.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Yet we taught `em opposite. Running
text: into the fray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: War horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Yeah. War horse. And there he is.
dialog: What a strange beast you've become.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie grabs hold of Joey's halter, though Joey shows no
text: sign of running.
dialog: 
text: Joey is finally free.
dialog: 
text: The two men look at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And now?
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: I take him back with me, yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Since I supplied the cutters, the
dialog: horse is mine. This is fair, no?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: In a pig's eye. He's English, plain
dialog: to see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, you mean because he's so filthy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Because he's so smart. And you're
dialog: none too clean yourself.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We could box. And the winner gets
dialog: the horse.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: No, thanks, pet. Must be careful not
dialog: to start a war.
dialog: (patting his pockets:)
dialog: Do you have a coin of any sort?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Coin toss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: He takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the Geordie, who
text: looks at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, Fritz - you're on.
dialog: 
text: He flips the coin back to Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: My name is not Fritz - it is Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Peter - I'm Colin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You call it, Colin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Heads.
text: Peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud. They
text: look down. Peter shakes his head, resigned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not
dialog: look pleased with me. The horse is yours.
dialog: 
text: They collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Gone quiet, hasn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting
dialog: again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe
dialog: I'll ever hit the target.
dialog: 
text: He hands back the cutters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: He notices the Geordie has offered his hand, as well. A
text: beat, then Peter shakes with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Cheerio, mate.
speaker_heading: (RE JOEY:)
dialog: You'll take good care of him, yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: I will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Our strange beast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: And you take care of your own
dialog: strange self.
dialog: 
text: Peter tosses Geordie his cutters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Colin! A pair of German cutters - in memory
dialog: of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: Peter nods, and walks back to his trench. As he goes, the
text: Geordie calls after him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll use `em back in the garden in
dialog: South Shields. You keep your head
dialog: down, now, Pete me lad!
dialog: 
text: As he walks away, Peter turns back briefly, calling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Remarkable! A remarkable horse!
dialog: 
text: The Geordie leads Joey towards the British trenches.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCHES. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Joey is now in the trenches, splashing about in the ankle
text: deep water. He seems enormous in this cramped labyrinth. He
text: is led past the broken and wounded soldiers who look at him
text: with amazement, dumbfounded. It is a surreal image. The horse
dialog: where horses shouldn't be.
dialog: 
text: As Joey makes his journey through the trenches soldiers
text: excitedly gather to watch him come by, taking pleasure in the
dialog: saving of this single life.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCHES. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: We arrive at a section we recognise as the place from where
text: Albert set off only the night before. Sergeant Martin is
text: there - as one man helps a wounded soldier into a medical
text: area. It is David, hobbling and looking shell-shocked.
text: Another wounded soldier approaches, but Martin waves him on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERGEANT MARTIN
dialog: We're full up. Move on.
dialog: 
text: David is seated next to Albert, who now seems in worse
text: condition. His eyes are bandaged and he's wheezing. Andrew
text: is nowhere to be seen. As a MEDICAL OFFICER checks Albert:.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The gas got him - we had to wait
dialog: till morning.
dialog: 
text: The medic moves to Sergeant Martin, looking stricken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDICAL OFFICER
dialog: This can't be all of us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERGEANT MARTIN
dialog: This is all.
dialog: (bellowing to the men)
text: All walking wounded, away to the
dialog: dressing station! Away to the
dialog: dressing station!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL AREA. LATER.
dialog: 
text: Joey is led into the hospital area beyond the trenches. The
text: Geordie leads him through the snowy streets. Bandaged men
text: strewn around, wounded soldiers waiting for attention.
dialog: 
text: The waiting soldiers gather to view the strange spectacle of
dialog: the horse.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
text: At one of the dressing areas, a NURSE tends to Albert's
text: damaged eyes. Behind him, we see Joey pass in the street,
text: but Albert doesn't know it.
dialog: 
text: Joey limps, his foreleg clearly injured. The Geordie soldier
text: stops outside a makeshift hospital. Joey looks frail and
text: exhausted.
dialog: 
text: A DOCTOR storms over from his patients.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What's this doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: We need a vet, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: There are no vets. We've scarcely
dialog: any horses left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: He's cut all over, but this leg
dialog: here's got the worst of it.
dialog: 
text: Geordie strokes Joey as the Doctor examines him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Please, sir -
dialog: 
text: The Doctor heads back into the hospital, dismissive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I've all these men to take care of,
dialog: corporal, you can see that, can't
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Please, sir, this horse can pull
dialog: through anything.
dialog: 
text: The doctor absorbs his earnest appeal.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. INTENSIVE CARE TENT. SAME.
dialog: 
text: Elsewhere, a line of soldiers waiting for medical assistance
text: are curious about what is going on. Blinded by gas, eyes
text: bandaged, one of them turns toward the commotion. It is
dialog: Albert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AN ORDERLY
text: It's a horse they found, wandering about in
dialog: No Man's Land.
text: (easing him back onto a
speaker_heading: COT)
dialog: Down you go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: What kind of an horse?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AN ORDERLY
dialog: Bloody miraculous kind of an horse,
dialog: be my guess. Nothing makes it out
dialog: of No Man's Land.
dialog: 
text: Albert lies there, but can't let go of the thought:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Miraculous horse...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL AREA. SAME.
dialog: 
text: Joey stands - breathing very deeply. The Doctor touches his
text: wounded leg.
dialog: 
text: The men from all over the medical area gather around Joey
text: concerned about their new hero's pain.
dialog: 
text: The doctor looks at the Geordie and frowns shaking his head
dialog: "no."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: (to the doctor:)
dialog: He was alive, y'see, sir, where
dialog: nothing survives, so to me and me
dialog: mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well,
dialog: we have high hopes for him -
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You should shoot him now.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie is broken hearted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Oh, but I can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not
dialog: going to mend.
dialog: 
text: The Doctor sadly addresses a nearby Sergeant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)
text: Sergeant. Put him out of his misery.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
text: The doctor nods his head towards Joey. The sergeant, SERGEANT
text: FRY, takes his gun from his holster, checks that it's loaded.
text: He turns to some nearby NURSES, urging them away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: Ladies, if you please.
dialog: 
text: Total silence from the crowd who have gathered. They thought
dialog: they were there to see something wonderful. And now they find
dialog: that they've gathered for an execution - but can't take their
text: eyes off it. The Sergeant waves them back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, back off. Back off.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie is the last to step away from Joey. The sergeant
text: draws breath - before he steps forward to take aim. Joey is
text: totally still, sensing the atmosphere.
text: The sergeant cocks his pistol.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards
text: away. Joey looks around startled.
dialog: 
text: The sergeant turns Joey's head back around, raises his pistol
dialog: once more.
dialog: 
text: Then, the whistle again. Even the doctor notices this time.
dialog: 
text: Joey turns. Slowly, the crowd parts - another owl whistle -
text: and we see Albert, his eyes bandaged - walking forward
text: blindly - guided by the hands of the crowd.
dialog: 
text: One soldier urges Albert gently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Go on. Do it again.
text: One more whistle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Joey?
dialog: 
text: And this time, Joey trots over to Albert. The horse nuzzles
text: into him. Albert can't see Joey but he touches him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY:)
dialog: Hello, Joey. Hello boy. Where you
dialog: been then, hey? Where in the world
dialog: you been?
dialog: 
text: He strokes Joey's mane. Joey responds, becoming very still.
text: The Doctor approaches with the Geordie.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to the Geordie:)
dialog: Do you know this man?
dialog: 
text: The Geordie shakes his head, no. The Doctor speaks to Albert,
text: gently; clearly he thinks he's dealing with a traumatized,
text: possibly crazy soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: 
text: Albert, realizing he's being addressed, turns to the doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Narracott, Private Albert Narracott,
dialog: sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: This is a random horse, Narracott,
text: and too badly injured.
dialog: (to the orderly)
dialog: Is this man in your care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AN ORDERLY
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: He's not random at all, sir! He's my
dialog: horse, I raised him, in Devon. Sir,
dialog: look at his legs! He's got four
text: white socks, he's brown all over -
dialog: (points to his own
speaker_heading: FOREHEAD)
dialog: - and he has a white mark here -
dialog: like so...
dialog: 
text: He makes the shape of a diamond with his hands. The doctor
text: turns to the orderly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Take him back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AN ORDERLY
dialog: Come on, son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Wait! You can't see `cause of the
dialog: mud.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie looks around, spots a bucket of water, grabs it
text: and uses a rag to clean Joey's legs, revealing the socks. The
text: Geordie looks at the doctor.
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Four white socks!
dialog: 
text: The doctor takes a rag himself and wipes Joey's snout,
text: revealing the white diamond mark.
dialog: 
text: The Sergeant takes this in...and holsters his pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: All right, break it up. Clear off,
dialog: the lot of ya.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You see, sir? He's not random at
dialog: all.
dialog: 
text: The doctor steps up to him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We will attend to your horse. Patch
dialog: him up best we can. Treat him like
text: the soldier he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Thank you, sir.
dialog: 
text: With one last amazed look at Albert and Joey, the doctor
text: returns to the hospital area.
dialog: 
text: Moments later - Albert, the Geordie, and Sergeant Fry all
text: lead Joey through the snowy street together.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MESS HALL. EARLY MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Sergeant Fry strides into the middle of the throng of
dialog: soldiers.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! It falls on me to give
dialog: you some important news. At eleven o'clock
dialog: today, in two minutes time - the War will
text: come to an end.
dialog: 
text: Shock from the troops. Strangely muted. Not the explosion of
dialog: emotion you might have expected.
dialog: 
text: Albert enters, his eyes still red, but no longer bandaged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
dialog: The King and Queen thank you for your
dialog: service. We have been victorious - even if
dialog: at a higher price than many of us might have
dialog: imagined.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
text: When the bells ring out - and they will in a
dialog: moment, for the first time for four years -
dialog: let us remember our brothers fallen in the
dialog: field. And thank God for the end of this
text: struggle and victory.
dialog: 
text: And, in the distance, the church bells ring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STABLES. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Joey stands tall, eating some hay, now healed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FIELD OFFICE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Complete change of atmosphere. Silence. Tension. Albert
text: stands at attention with Sergeant Fry. A severe Major is
text: behind his desk.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I don't understand, sir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAJOR TOMPKINS
dialog: Officers' horses only. All other
dialog: horses are to be auctioned
dialog: immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: That is a complete and bloody outrage. It's
dialog: the lad's horse, sir, from Devon. He raised
dialog: him up from a pup, he did. Trained him
dialog: right up to the day when the army came to
dialog: town.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAJOR TOMPKINS
dialog: These aren't my orders, sergeant.
speaker_heading: (TO ALBERT)
dialog: You'll have to take him to market. That's
dialog: all.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STABLES, DAY.
dialog: 
text: Albert puts on a brave face as he collects Joey and leads him
text: out of the stables in silence.
dialog: 
text: EXT. THE STABLES, THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: As Albert comes out the men have gathered. There's a strange
text: sense of optimism, for such a gloomy moment. The Geordie

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Does the Major know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: The Major put in ten.
dialog: 
text: The Geordie flashes a sly wink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mum's the word where the Major's
dialog: concerned. Your friend on the
dialog: crutches over there -
dialog: 
text: He turns to indicate David Lyons, who nods at Albert
text: solemnly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: - even asked the Major to say that
text: Joey was his, an officer's horse, so
dialog: that he could go back with the
dialog: others.
dialog: 
text: Albert is amazed. He is about to show his gratitude when the
dialog: sergeant major shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't
dialog: want to miss the show.
dialog: 
text: Albert snaps to attention and begins to lead Joey out of the
text: parade ground with the other horses.
dialog: 
text: As they walk off, the sergeant silently adds some of his own
text: money to the notes in Albert's hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MARKET PLACE. DAY.
text: The intense bustle of the market. Farmers are gathered,

speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER

dialog:

speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
dialog: Eight pounds! Ten pounds here! Any
dialog: advance? Sold!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUCTION PEN. THE SAME.
dialog:

text: is led into the pen.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than
dialog: fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work
dialog: horses.
dialog: 
text: The auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Next one. We start at four pounds.
text: Four pounds.
dialog: 
text: The farmers seem disinterested, shaking of heads. The bidding
text: starts. Five pounds, six, seven, now it goes slowly, eight,
text: nine, ten. Albert looks pleased at how it's going. He feels
text: the cash in his hand. It seems to stick on ten, then a new
text: hand comes up at the back of the auction - it is a nasty
text: looking moustached man.
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER
dialog: Eleven.
dialog: 
text: Sergeant Fry scowls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's
dialog: been bidding for the best all
dialog: morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
text: Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERGEANT FRY
dialog: Let me handle this, private.
dialog: (he calls out) )
dialog: Fifteen, and let that be an end to it.
dialog: 
text: He looks daggers at the Butcher.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Any advance at thirty pounds?
dialog: 
text: Then, from the back, another, new French voice...
speaker_heading: FINAL BIDDER
text: One hundred pounds.
dialog: 
text: He steps to the front of the crowd, and suddenly we see who
text: it is. It is Emilie's Grandfather.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: And sir, if you bid against me, I will sell
dialog: the coat on my back and bid to one hundred
dialog: and ten. And if you bid against me again, I
dialog: will sell my farm and bid to a thousand.
dialog: 
text: Everyone looks at Albert who is devastated. Albert is
text: reeling. He hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and
text: brings down his gavel.
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
text: One hundred pounds. Going, going,
dialog: gone.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers slowly disperse, leaving Albert to stare at
dialog: Joey. It really is all over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE AUCTION. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: The Grandfather finishes paying for Joey. Albert and the
text: Geordie stand in front of the grandfather.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Sir, I'll give you all your money.
dialog: Everything you paid when we get back
dialog: to England. I'll give you twice -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You don't know anything about him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know
dialog: everything!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Yes, you found him! I heard you
text: found a horse in the wire between
dialog: the armies -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: No, I found him, he raised him -
dialog: 
text: The Grandfather goes to Joey and takes his reins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: When I heard about the miracle
dialog: horse, I traveled three days because
dialog: I knew whose horse it was. My
dialog: granddaughter's. She saved his life!
dialog: He was everything to her.
dialog: 
text: He pauses, briefly, to collect himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORDIE
dialog: Where is your granddaughter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: The war has taken everything from
dialog: everyone. He is all that I have left
dialog: of her.
dialog: 
text: The Grandfather leads Joey away. Joey pulls, firmly but not
text: wildly, on the rein the grandfather's holding. The
text: grandfather lets go.
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
text: He watches as Joey walks to Albert and nuzzles him. They have
text: a moment together. The Grandfather watches carefully.
dialog: 
text: Albert puts his face right near Joey - speaks gently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I
dialog: won't worry over you none. Hey, I
dialog: found you, didn't I, and you found
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather softens and begins to wonder about this soldier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: And we'll both... we'll both know
dialog: that we made it through. Now go on.
dialog: 
text: He leads Joey back to the Grandfather.
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: We're the lucky ones. Always have
dialog: been. Lucky since the day I met you.
dialog: 
text: He quietly hands over the reins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: God be with you, sir.
dialog: 
text: The grandfather looks at Albert, then takes the regimental
dialog: pennant from his pocket:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Do you know what this is?
dialog: 
text: Albert's amazed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: It's my father's. It's his
dialog: regimental pennant. How did you come
dialog: by this, sir?
dialog: 
text: Grandfather hands Albert the pennant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You may have this.
dialog: 
text: Albert takes the pennant and looks at it, his eyes filling
text: with tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Thank you ever so much for this,
dialog: sir...
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (with a sigh)
dialog: ... And this.
dialog: 
text: He hands Albert Joey's reins. Albert turns to face him,
text: almost mute with disbelief. He reaches for his money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No no, not necessary. He belongs to
dialog: you. That is, of course, what my
dialog: little girl would have wanted. And
dialog: she was the boss.
dialog: 
text: Grandfather laughs, then turns and slowly walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: What was her name?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Emilie.
dialog: (turns back with a smile)
dialog: Her name is Emilie.
dialog: 
text: Albert gently embraces Joey.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD. DEVON. DUSK.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, we are back in the village in Devon, in the fold of
text: the valley. Dusk light. A figure approaches, silhouetted
text: against the setting sun.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Naracott gathers the harvest, then notices as the figure
text: makes its way up the road to the farm.
dialog: 
text: A man in uniform. On a magnificent horse. Mrs. Narracott
text: meets them at the gate and we can finally see them clearly -
dialog: Albert and Joey.
text: Albert dismounts and removes his cap. An instant later, Mrs.
text: Narracott is hugging him for all that her life is worth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FIELD. DEVON. THE SAME.
dialog: 
text: Ted sees them and makes his way to the field gate...shaky.
text: Albert approaches, and stops a slight distance away.
dialog: 
text: Ted opens the gate to stand before his son. Albert slips
text: something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand -
text: Ted's campaign pennant.
dialog: 
text: Ted accepts it quietly, then offers his hand to Albert. They
text: shake, as men. And then slowly embrace, as father and son.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Narracott joins them as Joey looks on - a small family
text: and a beautiful horse, finally home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
