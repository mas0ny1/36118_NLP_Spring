text: We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...
scene_heading: FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY
text: The financial district. Lots of people in suits. A shaky,
text: spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...
text: JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a
text: tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter. He
text: starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and
text: dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...
text: WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET
text: As Foley goes inside, we then...
text: CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...
text: LOOKING FOR MONEY?
dialog: YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
text: We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BANK
text: as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
text: while he studies the bank layout.
text: Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
text: the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
text: area at the front. An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
text: hands with the man and they both sit down.
text: Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
text: window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
text: with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.
speaker_heading: TELLER/LORETTA
dialog: How can I help you, sir?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Loretta, you see that guy talking to
dialog: your manager, has his case open?
text: Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly,
text: begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
dialog: managers. Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
dialog: but he's not in today.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: But you see the guy with the attache
dialog: case?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (looks again)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: That's my partner. He has a gun in
dialog: there. And if you don't do exactly
dialog: what I tell you, or you give me any
dialog: kind of a problem, I'll look over at
dialog: my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.
text: Guindon between the eyes.
text: Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now take one of those big envelopes
dialog: and put as many hundreds, fifties and
dialog: twenties as you can pack into it.
dialog: Nothing with bank straps or rubber
dialog: bands. I don't want any dye packs. I
dialog: don't want any bait money. Start with
dialog: the second drawer and then the one
dialog: over there, under the computer. Come
dialog: on, Loretta, the key's right there
dialog: next to you. No bills off the bottom
dialog: of the drawer.
dialog: (as she works)
dialog: First time being robbed?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: You're doing great. Just smile,
dialog: Loretta, so you won't look like you're
text: being held up.
dialog: (she smiles awkwardly)
dialog: That's the way, you're doing fine.
text: We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the
text: front door. When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having
text: some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, give me the twenties. I'll put
dialog: 'em in my pocket. Okay, I haven't had
dialog: to give my partner a sign; that's good.
dialog: Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds
dialog: till after I'm out the door, make sure
dialog: you haven't set off the alarm. If you
dialog: have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon
dialog: between the eyes. Okay? I think
dialog: that'll do it. Thank you, Loretta,
dialog: and have a nice day.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You, too.
text: Foley heads for the door. He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk,
text: looks back at Loretta. Foley smiles at her, then turns to the
text: Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: She's cute, isn't she?
text: The man looks across the bank at Loretta.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Uh, yeah, I guess so.
text: Foley winks at Loretta and walks out.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Mr. Guindon)
dialog: Who was that?
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - SAME
text: As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME
text: As Foley tries to start the car. No go. He tries again.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Come on...
text: But the car won't start. Foley bangs on the wheel...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck!
text: Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open
text: window into Foley's ear...
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I think you flooded it.
text: Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling,
text: now has his gun pointing at him.
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: Get out've the car, sir.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Wanna hear a funny story?
speaker_heading: SECOND COP
dialog: Shut up and get out've the car.
dialog: And as Foley obliges, we then...
text: FADE TO WHITE.
text: We hear a MAN GRUNT. Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps
text: through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as
text: we realize he's on his way to the rim when...
text: ...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
text: A BASKETBALL GAME in progress. All of the men, Foley included,
text: are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts. The game is
text: rough. Hair is pulled. Eyes are poked. Faces punched.
scene_heading: A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION. BELLE GLADE,
dialog: FLORIDA."
text: Foley is the oldest player here. He's getting tired, starts to
text: lose his breath. He finally walks off the court, breathing so
text: hard he can't even talk. He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
text: to come in and take his place.
text: Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath. He looks
dialog: across the yard to where...
text: A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES
text: sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards. All of
text: them are over sixty. One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
text: hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...
text: INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:
text: As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
text: Mal and Lucky Strike packs. Another tends to a tomato bush in
text: a tiny patch of garden near the wall. Another one sits nearby
text: painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.
text: Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
text: his eye. He watches as...
speaker_heading: TWO LATINO MEN
text: both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
text: and begin stretching out. One of them nods to Foley. Foley
text: nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
text: over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: You want something, Foley?
text: Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Some people are going out of here.
dialog: What if I told you where and when?
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I expect you to look out for me, Pup,
dialog: let me run off work details.
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: Okay. How many going out?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I hear six.
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Looks like tonight.
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: You know who they are?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I do, but I won't tell you just yet.
dialog: Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
text: right before lock-down.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH
text: As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea
text: of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
text: at a table full of other little Latins. CHINO -- fifties, in
text: shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.
text: Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
text: of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
text: with a bunch of bikers.
text: Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
text: off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.
scene_heading: EXT. MESS - DAY
text: Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette. He puts an arm
text: around Lulu, starts to walk off...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (OS)
dialog: Today's the day, huh?
text: Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
text: down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
dialog: thing to having him on a leash.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You excited?
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why you think is today?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You were out running this morning,
dialog: sticking to your routine, anybody
dialog: happened to notice. But you only did
dialog: a couple of miles instead of your usual
dialog: five. Saving yourself for the main
dialog: event. Then I see you inside eating
text: ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
dialog: for endurance.
text: Chino and Lulu exchange looks.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: You want, I tole you you can come.
dialog: You all right, Foley. I like you.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You told me I can come 'cause I caught
dialog: you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you
text: and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
dialog: thought maybe you two were making out.
text: Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So what, you finish ahead of schedule?
text: Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: You see what they doing, those posts
dialog: out there? Putting up another fence,
text: five metres on the other side of the
dialog: one that's there. We wait until Super
dialog: Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
dialog: fence built and we have to dig another
dialog: nine, ten days. So we going soon as
dialog: it's dark. You want -- I mean it --
dialog: you can still come.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I appreciate the offer. And it's
dialog: tempting.
text: Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence
text: not twenty yards away.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: But, man, it's a long run to
dialog: civilization. A hundred miles to Miami?
dialog: I'm too old to start acting crazy, try
dialog: a stunt like that. You make it out,
dialog: send me a postcard.
scene_heading: CUT TO: A NOTEPAD
text: where we see someone has written "IT'S MAGIC!" then crossed out
text: the "IT'S" and replaced it with the word "LIKE". We hear THE
text: PHONE RING AND...
scene_heading: REVEAL: INT. ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Miami Beach Moderne. ADELE -- mid-thirties, pretty, Foley's ex --
text: sits at her kitchen table writing on a pad. She grabs the phone.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (then, sighs)
dialog: Yeah, I accept.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY
text: Foley on the phone...
speaker_heading: FOLEY'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, Adele, how you doing?
scene_heading: INTERCUTTING FOLEY &amp; ADELE:
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice?
text: Next time, leave the engine running.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: That's funny, Adele. How many more
dialog: times you gonna gimme that one?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Till it's not funny any more. What do
dialog: you want, Jack?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You know that Super Bowl party? They
dialog: changed the date. It's on tonight,
dialog: eight-thirty.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't
dialog: monitored?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I said not as a rule.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: So why don't you come right out and
dialog: tell me what you're talking about?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there
dialog: in the free world.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: What's free about it? I'm looking for
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Emil the Amazing. The bastard fired
dialog: me and hired another girl, a redhead.
dialog: I'm working on a new business card,
dialog: pass out to the cafes. How's this
dialog: sound--
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (cuts her off)
dialog: Listen, Adele, the reason I called,
dialog: that party is today instead of Sunday.
dialog: About eight-thirty, like only a few
dialog: hours from now. So you'll have to get
dialog: hold of Buddy, whatever he might be
dialog: doing...
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: And the one driving the other car?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Well, seeing as you have so much luck
dialog: with cars, Buddy thought it might be
dialog: better to bring two. He got this guy
dialog: he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Glenn Michaels.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Yeah, that's him. Buddy says Glenn
dialog: thinks you guys are real cool.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: He did, huh. Well, tell Buddy I see
dialog: Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step
dialog: on 'em. I might not even take 'em off
dialog: first.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

dialog: a table...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Happy birthday.
text: ...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair,
text: a knockout -- sits. She picks up the box and shakes it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You fit another Chanel suit in here?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Something better. Open it.
text: Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present. Marshall watches,
text: takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how
text: everyone's looking at the two of them...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (opens the box)
dialog: Oh my God...
text: She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box...
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: It's a --
speaker_heading: KAREN

text: She leans across the table and kisses him.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks, Dad.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Happy birthday, kid.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You want another Coke?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (checks her watch)
dialog: Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades,
dialog: then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Which one is that? The ATF guy?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now,
dialog: he switched over.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: He's still married though, huh?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: Technically. They're separated.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Oh, he's moved out?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: He's about to.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Then they're not separated, are they?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Can we change the subject?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: What're you doing at Glades?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Serving process, a Summons and
dialog: Complaint. Some con doing mandatory
dialog: life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
dialog: He files suit, says he has no choice
dialog: in what they serve and it violates his
dialog: civil rights.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You know you can always step in, work
dialog: with me full-time as one of my
dialog: investigators.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You used to like it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Dad...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing
dialog: wrong with them necessarily if they're
dialog: divorced. Why settle for some cowboy
text: cop who drinks too much and cheats on
dialog: his wife? That's the way those hotshots
dialog: are, all of 'em.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I really gotta go.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: We don't get to talk much any more.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch
dialog: the Super Bowl with you?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I'd like that.
text: She gets up, kisses him again.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Thanks for the gun, Dad.
scene_heading: INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY
text: Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk. He looks about the
text: cell. All he's got to show for himself. It's now quiet on
text: the cellblock. Foley closes his eyes and we...
scene_heading: CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM
text: A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE
text: "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing
text: trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.
scene_heading: Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY. LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.
text: And then... TWO YEARS AGO.
text: AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM
text: Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black,
text: Foley's age, shaved head.
text: The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as
text: does Maurice. GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades --
text: counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the
text: fighter's ear.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's
dialog: gonna send this guy out in a body bag.
text: Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking
text: as those around him. The guy looks nervous, can feel the other
text: cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.
text: The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet.
text: Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling. Foley turns
text: and watches the fight now...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Anyone ever tell you why they call him
dialog: Snoopy?
text: Buddy shakes his head. Maurice dances around the other guy
text: now. Teases him.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back
dialog: when he was pro. Now you pet him, he
text: goes down.
text: The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely
text: glances off Maurice's jaw. Sure enough, Maurice makes a big
text: show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally
text: goes down.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I don't believe it.
text: Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
text: and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
text: Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
text: nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's
text: pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons. He throws
text: a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
dialog: technique...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.
dialog: Fuckin' pathetic.
text: Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
text: stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one
text: hand thrust into his pocket. Foley watches as Maurice stops
text: the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
text: fights -- as he comes out into the yard.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It's Richard Ripley.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (looking now)
dialog: The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I
text: didn't recognize him without his rug.
text: Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy
text: nodding, acquiescent, respectful.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Dick the Ripper they called him, on
dialog: account of all the people he ripped
dialog: off.
text: Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's he doin' here?
speaker_heading: GLENN (OS)
dialog: Three years.
text: They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades
text: we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few
text: feet away. He's shirtless, tan, in shape.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: He got three years and fined fifty
dialog: million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking
dialog: check. Like that, fifty mil, signed
dialog: his name.
dialog: (struggles with the
dialog: bar)
dialog: Whoa-- little help here!
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Who you talkin' to, Studs? Me, or
dialog: Buddy. I can't tell, you got those
text: shades on.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I guess the bright glare out here made
dialog: it hard to see the numbers on the
dialog: weights.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I'll take the shades off. Just get
dialog: this fuckin' thing off me.
text: Foley helps him get the bar up. Glenn sits up.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How do you know he wrote a check?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: He told me. He works the laundry with
dialog: me. The guy loves to talk.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney. I hear he
dialog: rolled over on all the snitches he was
dialog: doing business with and got 'em all
dialog: brought up.
text: He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the
text: swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Hey, anybody that can write a check
dialog: for fifty mil, he says <i>any</i>thing I'm
dialog: all fucking ears. Like the other day,
dialog: he tells me how he's got all this money
dialog: in foreign banks, plus around five mil
text: in uncut diamonds at his house. He
dialog: said, quote, "Where I can put my hands
dialog: on it anytime."
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Cool. Where's the guy live?
text: Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
text: Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making
dialog: notations...
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Detroit. Snoopy Miller told me uncut
dialog: diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?
text: They look like plain old rocks.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: So. What's your point?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: My point is, that's probably what you're
dialog: gonna end up with.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: You think he's lying?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Use your head. The guys got five
dialog: million lying around his house, you
dialog: really think he's gonna tell some
dialog: motormouth he just met in prison about
dialog: it?
text: A BELL SOUNDS. Everyone starts walking for the gate.
text: Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate,
text: Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket.
text: SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who
text: moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his
text: left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like
text: congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
text: and we see the long metal shiv--
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (watching Snoopy)
dialog: Here it comes.
text: Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs
text: him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away. The Boxer
text: stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last
text: jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,
dialog: even if it's on purpose.
text: We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body. And now
text: everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for...
text: Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the
dialog: body.
text: Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes
text: Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks
text: to him as they walk into the block...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You don't wanna be standing there, the
dialog: hacks start asking questions you don't
dialog: wanna answer.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Oh, uh, right, thanks...
text: Foley then moves away. He sees Maurice looking back at him,
text: giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW)
text: He lies there another moment when...
text: A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk.
text: Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the
text: toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the
text: bathroom. Foley shakes his head and turns away...
scene_heading: EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY
text: As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
text: a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door,
dialog: when he sees...
text: A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come
text: out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.
text: Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman
text: is opening her trunk before coming forward...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.
text: She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the
text: groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I didn't ask for your help, so don't
dialog: expect a tip.
text: Buddy smiles, waves her off.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's okay, ma'am. I'll just take
dialog: your car.
text: She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DUSK
text: In the midst of a remodel. As door opens and Pup comes in.
text: Foley puts a finger to his lips...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: They're right underneath you, Pup.
dialog: They dug a tunnel.
text: Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the
text: chapel, eyes on the floor, listening...
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: I don't hear 'em. Where's the tunnel
dialog: come out?
text: Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of
text: the pews to a window.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: Second fence post from the tower out
dialog: there. Go on, take a look.
text: As Pup stares out the window...
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: I don't see nothing there.
text: Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT
text: CRUCIFIX. He picks it up, starts up the aisle...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You will directly. Keep watching.

text: then the fence strung with razor wire. Karen parks near the
text: fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Hi. Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's not? Could you tell him that...
dialog: never mind. I'll call back.
text: Headlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind
text: her. The lights go off, then come on again. She adjusts the
text: mirror to deflect the glare.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK
text: As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field.
text: He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen
text: checks her face out in the rear-view.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DUSK
text: As Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor,
text: holds the crucifix down against his leg.
speaker_heading: PUP
dialog: There some car headlights out there...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Jesus Christ...
text: Now he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it...
speaker_heading: PUP (CONT'D)
dialog: Man outside the fence! By tower six!
dialog: (responds to radio)
dialog: This is Officer Pupko...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake!
text: Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it
text: smack against the side of Pup's head. Drops him clean with one
text: swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a
text: sound coming from him.
scene_heading: INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT
text: As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car
text: door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there,
text: crouching down.
text: Karen turns on her headlights. No, not crouched. The guy is
text: <i>coming out of the ground</i>. On <i>this</i> side of the fence.
text: Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the
text: ground. Right in front of her.
text: Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by
text: the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised
text: there for a moment before taking off into the dark. Karen gets
text: out of the car...
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME
text: As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow
text: the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before
text: the men disappear into the dark.
text: Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he
text: gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her
dialog: trunk...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's she doing?
text: He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a
text: holstered pistol.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: But then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there
text: again and comes out this time racking a shotgun.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and
text: raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND.
text: Buddy gets out of the car...
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING AREA - SAME
text: As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty,
text: standing by the hole they just crawled out of.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Get your hands in the air!
text: Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds,
dialog: start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.
text: They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark,
text: then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate,
text: to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it
text: for the cons. They take off running...
text: Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't
dialog: fire...
text: The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it,
text: open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
text: cut down as they run.
text: The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more
dialog: interested in the hole the convicts had come out of. Now they're
text: standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons
text: ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other
dialog: as...
text: A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying
text: something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited,
text: pointing towards the orange grove.
text: They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
dialog: see if they're alive, then keep going.
text: The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out. He takes his time,
text: puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an
text: honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.
text: Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
text: shotgun on Buddy. Buddy raises the palm of his hand.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: It's okay, honey, we're good guys.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What're you doing here?
text: Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when
dialog: they're already pretty sure what you're doing. She glances
text: around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature
text: out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.
text: She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
text: shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.
text: They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still
text: up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence,
text: past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
text: grove. A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I bet that's all the hacks they send
dialog: out. Otherwise nobody's left to mind
dialog: the store.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Why don't we talk about it later?
text: He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
text: headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why you're just a girl. What do you
dialog: do for a living you pack a shotgun?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm a federal marshal and you're under
dialog: arrest, both of you guys.
text: Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious
dialog: thought, but what he says is...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I bet I smell, don't I?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll
dialog: get out of here.
text: Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk. She's
text: reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...
text: Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against
text: the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're
text: cuddled up in bed.
text: He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the
text: gun in his face. Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
dialog: everything goes...
speaker_heading: BLACK
text: Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing.
text: Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (VO)
dialog: You comfy?
speaker_heading: KAREN (VO)
dialog: If I could have a little more room.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (VO)
dialog: There isn't any. All this shit you
dialog: got in here. What is all this stuff
dialog: anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's
dialog: this can?
speaker_heading: KAREN (VO)
dialog: For your breath. You could use it.
dialog: Squirt some in your mouth.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (VO)
dialog: You devil, it's mace, huh? What've
dialog: you got here, a billy? Use it on poor
dialog: unfortunate offenders.
text: A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
text: on. He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he
text: looks at all of her now and finally says...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (VO)
dialog: Where's your gun, your pistol?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: In my bag, in the car.
text: They go over some bumps. We hear men's voices from somewhere
text: far off, outside.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know you don't have a chance of
dialog: making it. Guards are out here already,
dialog: they'll stop the car.
text: He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also,
dialog: just, well, looking.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: They're off in the cane by now chasing
dialog: Cubans. I timed it to slip between
dialog: the cracks, you might say.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - NIGHT
text: As Buddy floors it away from the prison, checks the rearview
dialog: mirror...
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK - SAME
text: As Jack tries to wipe some of the mud off his face.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Boy, it stunk in there.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I believe it. You've ruined a nine-
dialog: hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, went real nice with that twelve
dialog: gauge, too.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Tell me, why in the world would someone
dialog: like you ever become a federal marshall?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The idea of going after guys like you
dialog: appealed to me.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Guys like me, huh. Well, listen, even
dialog: though I've been celibate lately, I'm
dialog: not gonna force myself on you. I've
dialog: never done that in my life.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You wouldn't have time anyway. We
dialog: come to a roadblock, they'll run the
dialog: car, find out in five seconds who it
dialog: belongs to.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: If they get set up in time, which I
dialog: doubt. And even if they do they'll be
dialog: looking for a buncha little Latin
dialog: fellas, not a big black guy driving a
dialog: Ford.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass
dialog: like this.
text: More bumps. Then picking up speed as the road smooths out.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Who, Buddy? Yeah. He's a good guy.
dialog: Back when we jailed together, he'd
dialog: call his sister every week without
dialog: fail. She's a born-again Christian,
text: does bookkeeping for a televangelist.
text: Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins,
dialog: tells her about whatever bank he
dialog: happened to rob.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Buddy. That's his given name?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (woops, beat)
dialog: One I gave him, yeah.
dialog: (mouths)
dialog: Fuck...
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME
text: As Buddy rifles through Karen's bag while he drives. He looks up
text: from her badge and ID case at the road.
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK - SAME
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: So, what's your name? It'll be in the
dialog: paper tomorrow anyway.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Jack Foley. You've probably heard of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Why, are you famous?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Time I was convicted in California?
dialog: FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than
text: anyone in the computer.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How many was that?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Tell you the truth, I don't know. I
dialog: started when I was eighteen, driving
dialog: for my Uncle Cully and his partner,
dialog: Gus. They go into a bank this one
text: time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter
text: to get the tellers and breaks his leg.
dialog: All three of us ended up in Angola.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That's funny.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I thought so, too.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I believe you would have. Another fall,
dialog: I did seven years at Lompoc. And I
dialog: don't mean the place next door where
dialog: some of Nixon's people went.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I know the difference. You were in
text: Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary.
dialog: I've delivered people there. So
dialog: basically you've spent half your life
dialog: in prison.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I
dialog: do a full thirty years, no time off.
dialog: Can you imagine looking at that?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I don't have to. I don't rob banks.
text: He looks at her, then looks away as we...
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - SAME
text: As the car turns into a main highway now...
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK - SAME
text: As Foley plays the light down the length of her...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You don't seem all that scared.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Of course I am.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You don't act like it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What do you want me to do? Scream? I
dialog: don't think it would help much.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy,
dialog: and wait for you to screw up.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You were married? All those falls,
dialog: I'm surprised you had time.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It was just a year, give or take a few
dialog: days. I mean, it's not like we didn't
dialog: get along or anything. We had fun, we
dialog: just didn't have that... that thing,
dialog: you know? That spark, you know what I
dialog: mean? You gotta have that.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: We still talk, though.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - SAME
text: As Buddy passes a sign that says "MIAMI, 74 MILES."
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK - SAME
text: As she tries to get a look at him...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You know, this isn't gonna end well,
dialog: these things never do.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot
dialog: like a dog, it'll be in the street,
dialog: not off a goddamn fence.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You must see yourself as some kind of
dialog: Clyde Barrow.
text: And for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on
dialog: the road. Then...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde? Hm.
dialog: You ever see pictures of him, the way
dialog: he wore his hat? You could tell he
dialog: had that don't-give-a-shit air about
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I don't recall his hat, but I've seen
text: pictures of him lying dead, shot by
dialog: Texas Rangers. Did you know he didn't
dialog: have his shoes on?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: They put a hundred and eighty-seven
text: bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker
text: and the car they were driving. Bonnie
text: was eating a sandwich.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You're full of interesting facts, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It was May, 1934, near Gibsland,
dialog: Louisiana.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Quiet. Empty. A moment later the car flies past.
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK - SAME
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: That part in the movie where they get
dialog: shot? Warren Beatty and... I can't
dialog: think of her name.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Faye Dunaway.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, I liked her in that movie about
dialog: TV...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: <i>Network</i>. Yeah, she was good.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: And the guy saying he wasn't gonna
dialog: take any more shit from anybody...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Peter Finch.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, right. Anyway, that scene where
dialog: Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get
dialog: shot? I remember thinking at the time
dialog: it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you
dialog: have to.
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: Bleeding on a country road.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you
dialog: were in that car -- eating a sandwich --
dialog: you wouldn't have known what hit you.
text: We HEAR FAINT SIRENS OS...
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME TIME
text: As Buddy sees FLASHING LIGHTS approach from the opposite
text: direction. He stays cool as the green and whites get closer...
text: closer... then fly right on past.
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK - SAME
text: As the SIRENS SCREAM AT US FOR A MOMENT, then FADE.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You're sure easy to talk to. I wonder --
dialog: say we met under different circumstances
dialog: and got to talking, say you were in a
dialog: bar and I came up to you -- I wonder
dialog: what would happen.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I mean if you didn't know who I was.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You'd probably tell me.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'm just saying I think if we met under
dialog: different circumstances...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You have to be kidding.
text: Silence. Foley tries to get back to where it was working...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked,
dialog: <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: With Robert Redford, when he was young.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah...
text: They lie there a moment, think about that as we hear THE CAR
text: SLOWING DOWN, coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the
text: road to a stop.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I never thought it made sense, though,
dialog: the way they got together so quick.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I mean, romantically.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well, but if --
text: The trunk goes dark again as the car's turned off.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (OS)
dialog: You still alive in there?
text: And the trunk lid raises so that we see Karen and Foley lying
text: in the back. Foley gets out. Karen doesn't move.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (OS)
dialog: Where in the hell are we?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's
text: waiting with the other car.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Okay, honey, come on out of there.
text: Karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings
text: up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing
text: in the opening, in the dark, but right there.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Get your hands up and turn around.
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Shit...
text: Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite
text: directions as she begins firing from the inside...
text: As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car. We can
text: see they're beneath an overpass. Foley stares at the trunk.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: We may as well leave her, we're leaving
dialog: the car and we gotta leave her some place
dialog: anyway, what's the difference where?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: She's coming with us.
text: Foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Jesus Christ, what were you doing in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd
dialog: like to know who she is.
text: Foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I already looked. Her name is Karen
dialog: Sisco. Like the Cisco Kid only spelled
dialog: different, S-i-s-c-o.
text: A sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep
text: to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment
text: of the overpass. When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the
text: trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Karen? Be a good girl now, you hear?
dialog: Now, I'm gonna open the--
text: Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're putting holes in your car!
text: He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him.
text: He settles down, then...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're not leaving you. I'm gonna open
dialog: the trunk enough for you to throw the
dialog: gun out. Okay? You shoot -- Buddy's
dialog: got your shotgun, says he'll shoot
dialog: back if you do and I can't stop him.
dialog: So it's up to you.
text: Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny,
text: gives him the keys.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey!
text: Coming from somewhere above them.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's me, Glenn.
text: Foley steps out into the open, Buddy close behind him. They
text: look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening
text: sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail. We can see his
text: long blond hair falling beside his face, now half-concealed
text: behind dark sunglasses.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Hey, Jack, good to see you, man. The
dialog: fuck're you guys shooting at?
text: Foley looks at Buddy.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Do we need him?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: The green-and-whites saw us. One of
dialog: 'em starts thinking, what's that car
dialog: doing there? Ties it to the break and
text: turns around...
text: Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were
dialog: somebody else.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since
dialog: Lompoc. What's going on?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Oh, nuthin'.
text: Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs
text: on the trunk.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You coming out?
text: Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk
text: and racks the pump on the shotgun. Foley leans close to the
dialog: metal.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear that?
text: He turns the key and raises the lid. Karen, bunched in there,
text: extends her arm, her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You win, Jack.
text: "Jack." Buddy gives him another funny look.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT
text: As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
text: Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS."
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Have your clothes cleaned and send me
dialog: the bill.
text: Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade,
text: move through the scrub. Glenn leans against the car, flashers
text: blinking.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'll send it to you at Glades.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a
dialog: sewer?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Take your sunglasses off.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I see better with them on.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw
dialog: 'em off the overpass while they're
dialog: still on your head.
text: Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
text: Wait in the car.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: You're in civilization now, man, ease
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'd like you to go wait in the car.
dialog: How's that? Take her with you and put
text: her in back.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: In the trunk?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: The backseat.
text: Foley stares at him, waiting. Glenn motions to Karen...
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Come on. I have to do what I'm told.
text: She walks past Foley without looking at him.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Wait a minute. Let me have your
dialog: raincoat.
dialog: (looks at Buddy)
dialog: Somebody forgot to bring me clean
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I brought 'em, they're back at Glades
dialog: in the Cadillac. You wanted to take
dialog: her car.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You can blame me if you want. I don't
dialog: mind.
text: He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds
text: it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Here you are, sir.
text: Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back
text: on and takes Karen by the arm.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's wrong with you?
text: Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the
dialog: backseat.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll
dialog: never know.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How 'bout the score was his idea to
dialog: begin with?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin' guy's
dialog: got a vacant lot for a head. Was you
dialog: and me figured the whole thing out.
text: Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform,
text: all of them caked with muck.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You're pulling at it. Here...
text: He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard
text: shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and
text: tearing the shirt.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know why, but every time he
text: opens his mouth I want to punch him
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: He ain't the problem, Jack.
text: Foley looks at him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna pull your head outta your
dialog: ass and tell me why we're bringing <i>her</i>
dialog: with us?
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME
text: As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome
text: light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door.
text: He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs
text: his hand through his hair...
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: ...if he thinks he can talk to me like
dialog: this. Shit, I don't even know what I
dialog: need them for.
text: Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against
text: the dark foliage.
speaker_heading: GLENN (CONT'D)
dialog: I got a big score lined up up north.
dialog: They wouldn't even know about it, it
dialog: wasn't for me. I could do it right
dialog: now myself, except it's so fucking
dialog: cold up there in January--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Glenn?
text: His head turns so that we can see his designer shades.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't remember me, do you?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It couldn't have been out at Glades,
dialog: if that's what you're thinking. I was
dialog: never out there.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, that's not what I'm thinking.
text: He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: But you're sure we've met, huh?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Last fall, I drove you from the Palm
dialog: Beach county jail to the federal
dialog: courthouse, twice. You're Glenn
dialog: Michaels.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I never forget anyone I've cuffed and
text: shackled.
text: He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's
text: been turned to stone.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if
dialog: we can work this out...
text: He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead...
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do we have a gun in the car?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I remember you now. Shit.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Foley's not going to make it. And if
dialog: he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
text: She touches his shoulder and he jumps.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I can understand if you and Foley
dialog: are close.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: We're not. I'm helping him, yeah--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Wait. <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn? At
dialog: this point, technically, I doubt you
dialog: could be charged with aiding a fugitive.
dialog: So you still have a choice. You can
dialog: help him and risk going down again,
dialog: get cuffed and shackled, hope to God
dialog: you pull a reasonable judge, not some
dialog: hard-on. Or, if you want to play it
dialog: another way...
text: She pauses. He turns and looks at her.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Like how?
scene_heading: EXT. OVERPASS - SAME
text: Foley watches a car pass on the highway.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You want to take her to my place and
dialog: get cleaned up? You come out of the
dialog: bathroom with your after-shave on and
dialog: she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I want to talk to her again, that's
dialog: all. See what would happen under, you
dialog: know, normal circumstances.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You're too late, Jack.
text: Foley doesn't say anything. Just takes a deep breath as we
text: HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over...
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: He wants to get out of here and I don't
dialog: blame him.
text: They start towards the car. Then stop and watch as it takes
text: off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement. Their backs
text: to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're
text: out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word.
text: We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER...
scene_heading: CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC
text: As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY
text: -- strut purposefully up the hall. They step into...
speaker_heading: THE PRISON LIBRARY
text: Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
text: coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Dick. My man.
text: Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the
text: library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: I got your fishies for you.
text: He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (reaches for them)
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (pulls them back)
dialog: Not so fast, Dick.
dialog: (off Ripley's look)
dialog: Starting now, there's gonna be an across
dialog: the board cost a living increase.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Year ago, I come in here on credit
dialog: card fraud, but after I shanked that
text: loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
dialog: day, my Dunn &amp; Broadstreet, has gone
dialog: way the fuck up.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I think it's Dunn &amp; Bradstreet. But
dialog: then, I could be wrong...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Whoever. The point is, prices are
dialog: goin' up, too. Better get your little
dialog: black book out, Richard. We got some
dialog: business to talk about.
text: Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's start with the fish. They was
dialog: two grand, but now they's three.
text: Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: That Bausch &amp; Lomb Saline shit you
dialog: asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Well, I need that...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an
dialog: even three c's.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey.
dialog: They all look to where...
speaker_heading: JACK FOLEY
text: Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of
text: some kind. Himey gives him a mean stare. Foley points to a
text: sign that says "QUIET PLEASE."
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Sign says "Shut the fuck up." Or can't
dialog: you guys read?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There a problem, Foley?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, I got a problem. This is the
dialog: dumbest fucking shakedown in the history
text: of dump shakedowns. Three hundred
dialog: bucks for a pillow?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Sounds high, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Must be a real soft pillow.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
text: Faux goose down.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Still...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: How much for your company at chow?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
text: Company, shit. I watch the man's back.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I bet. How much?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Another C.
text: Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this
dialog: guy to fuck off.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Really? Well, I uhhh...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: First of all, if he kills you, he's
dialog: not gonna get any more money out of
dialog: you.
text: Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Man doesn't have to get killed. He
dialog: could accidentally fall on something
dialog: sharp, like a shiv. Or my dick.
text: Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You stick anything in this guy, Snoop,
dialog: they transfer his ass outta here
dialog: faster'n you can throw a fight, and
dialog: you still end up with nothing.
text: Ripley nods, takes this in.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: This doesn't concern you, Foley. Why
dialog: don't you go on out to the yard, have
dialog: yourself a smoke?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't smoke.
speaker_heading: HIMEY
dialog: (slowly rising)
dialog: You heard the man. Go on outta here.
text: Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
dialog: He's ranked number thirty-two in the
dialog: federal prison system.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (looking at Himey)
dialog: Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
text: Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock
text: Foley in the head when...
text: ...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand,
text: like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual
text: into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending
text: his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
text: back-first with a loud thud.
text: Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A
text: WHISTLE. They all freeze, look to...
text: A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE
text: Who nods towards the door. We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS,
text: takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up,
text: covers his now bleeding nose.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: What's going on here?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Oh, you know, reading's funnamental
dialog: an' shit, we just excited.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Clear outta here.
text: The guard exits. Maurice and Foley are still staring at each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the
dialog: fish thing?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (looks at Foley)
dialog: Yeah. Sure. It's all settled.
text: He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into
text: Ripley's open hand. Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a
text: fist, crushing the fish. He taps his fist to Ripley's.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: That's how you do it.
text: Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with
text: Himey. Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at
dialog: Foley.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks for your help.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Any time.
text: We hear a PHONE RING and then...
scene_heading: CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW)
text: As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
text: Stick and jab, fool. Stick and jab.
text: A frisbee whizzes past the television. We hear A DOG YELP OS.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Watch that shit!
text: Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a
text: green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE
text: RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: (calls OS)
dialog: Tuffy. C'mere, boy...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You gonna answer the phone?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: What for? It's not for me.
text: Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a
text: little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bad dog.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (scoops up the dog)
dialog: Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
dialog: little Tuffy?
text: He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a
dialog: Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra
dialog: money.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: That's the dumbest thing I heard in my
dialog: life. Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't
dialog: pay for shit. You gonna get a gig,
dialog: it's gotta be for one of the big three:
dialog: Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit
dialog: for the fat dogs. Now answer the fuckin
dialog: phone.
text: She comes over, picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (hands it to Maurice)
dialog: For you.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (takes it)

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You crazy, come up here? It's fuckin

speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I wanna talk to you about a job.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I can't really go into it right now.
dialog: I'll just tell you it's someone big.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Someone? Gimme a hint.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: It's a guy you know.
speaker_heading: MAURICE

speaker_heading: GLENN

speaker_heading: GLENN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Oh, I'm here, all right. I'm very here.
dialog: Question is, why aren't you here?
scene_heading: EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA - NIGHT
text: As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: Cause she had her hand on her gun the
text: whole time, waiting to make her move.
text: Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You're just jealous it was me in the
dialog: trunk with her and not you.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You're right.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A "hideout." Not much in the way of furnishings. Foley follows
text: Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: First thing I'm gonna do is get all
dialog: this mud off me.
text: Foley starts for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been dreaming about a hot bath
dialog: for the last six months. Soak the prison
dialog: off me.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: There's some lilac oil, you want some,
text: a vanilla candle under the sink.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Oh, man.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: There's something about a nice hot
dialog: bath, transforms a person. It's not
dialog: just about opening up your pores, know
dialog: what I mean? There's just something
dialog: about the heat and the wet that's
dialog: calming you know? Settles me in a way
dialog: that I really can't articulate.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I know exactly what you mean. It's
dialog: just a feeling.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, I could go for some wine
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: There's a store around the corner,
dialog: I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Sounds great.
text: Foley goes into the bathroom. A moment later WE HEAR THE BATH
speaker_heading: RUNNING.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
text: As Buddy leaves the apartment, starts down the hall, KAREN STEPS
text: INTO FRAME, watches as he disappears down the stairs. Gun drawn,
text: she then moves towards the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: As Foley undresses, picks up a candle off the sink and smells
text: it. He notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
text: As Karen slips the door. She looks around, HEARS THE WATER
speaker_heading: RUNNING.
text: She racks the slide on her gun, snicks off the safety and starts
text: for the bathroom. Suddenly, the water is turned off. She stops
text: where she is. She then moves a careful step at a time towards
text: the open doorway.
text: Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet
text: resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub,
text: then she's in the doorway, looking down at...
text: Foley, lying there in the tub, his eyes closed. Karen cuts her
text: eyes down the length of him, taking a moment here to check him
text: out, long enough for Foley to open his eyes and grab her hand,
text: the one holding the gun.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Hey.
text: They look at each other a moment. He then pulls her down to
text: him and kisses her. She kisses him back. He then pulls her
text: into the tub with him as we now hear...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL SISCO (VO)
dialog: Karen...?
scene_heading: CUT TO: KAREN
text: As she opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What?
scene_heading: REVEAL: A HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Flowers everywhere. Karen -- bruises on her face -- lies in

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You were talking in your sleep.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What'd I say?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: "Hey, yourself."
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Huh.
text: We hear A KNOCK at the door. They look to where Special Agent
text: DANIEL BURDON -- black, forties, expensive suit -- stands in
text: the doorway, file in one hand.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, Daniel.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: (to Marshall)
dialog: Daniel Burdon, FBI.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Marshall Sisco. Karen's dad.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: You mind please waiting outside. We
dialog: have some business to do here.
text: Marshall looks at him a moment. Then, to Karen...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I need to go to the john anyway.
text: Burdon waits for Marshall to walk out, then sits down.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: That's nice of you to offer, Karen,
dialog: but I got all the help I can use right
dialog: now. Instead, let's talk about how
dialog: you got the bump on your head.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (indicates file)
dialog: Isn't that my report you're holding
dialog: onto?
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.
dialog: Starting with when you tried to grab
dialog: the wheel -- where was this?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
dialog: And now we see it...
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Take the next exit.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: What am I supposed to do now?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: Glenn, take the exit.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna
dialog: turn myself in.
text: She reaches over and grabs the wheel.
speaker_heading: GLENN (CONT'D)
dialog: The fuck are you doing?!
text: He hits the brakes. The car goes off the road, down the grade,
text: the abutment coming right at us as we go back to...
scene_heading: THE HOSPITAL ROOM
text: As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The next thing I knew, the paramedics
dialog: were taking me out the car.
text: Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then...
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: There's a couple of points I keep
dialog: wondering about have to do with the
dialog: two guys that grabbed you. Buddy is
dialog: it? And this fella Jack Foley. I
dialog: swear the man must've robbed two hundred
dialog: banks in his time.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Really? Huh. He told me he didn't
dialog: remember how many he robbed.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: You talked to him?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: In the trunk, yeah?
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: What'd you talk about?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh... different things, prison, movies.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: This fella holds you hostage, you talk
dialog: about movies?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It was an unusual experience.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Foley made me think of that fella Carl
dialog: Tillman, the one you were seeing, it
dialog: turns out the same time he was doing
dialog: banks. You recall that?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't
dialog: know he robbed banks.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe
dialog: he did, and I told you. So you had to
dialog: at least suspect him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: And what happened to Carl?
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: The time came, you shot him. But you
dialog: didn't shoot Foley or the guy with
dialog: him. They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
dialog: and you let them throw you in the trunk.
dialog: Okay, now you got your Sig in your
dialog: hand. You say in the report you
dialog: couldn't turn around, he had you pinned
dialog: down. But when the trunk opened, how
dialog: come you didn't cap the two guys then?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Is that what you would've done?
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: You say in the report Glenn didn't
dialog: have a gun, but you let him get away,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Daniel, what do you work on most of
dialog: the time, fraud? Go after crooked
dialog: bookkeepers.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen
dialog: years, on all kinds of investigations.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Have you ever shot a man? How many
dialog: times have you been primary through
dialog: the door?
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: I have to qualify, is that it?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You have to know what you're talking
dialog: about.
text: We hear CHUCKLING OS. Burdon glances at the doorway where we
text: see Marshall now standing, enjoying this.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: We'll talk another time, Karen. All
dialog: right? I'd like to know why Foley put
dialog: you in that second car when he didn't
dialog: need you any more.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You'll have to ask him.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Sounds to me like he liked having you
dialog: around. I'll see you, Karen. Mr.
dialog: Sisco.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Agent Burdon.
text: Marshall waits for him to walk out...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: The white man's Burdon. That's what
dialog: everybody calls him in Miami. The
dialog: Metro-Dade guys. He's got a knack for
dialog: pissing people off.
text: She's not listening. He sits down, takes her hand...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you thinking about?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The Sig Sauer you got me for my
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Tell you what, you're a good girl, you
dialog: might get another one for Christmas.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'll get it back when I get Foley.
scene_heading: EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy
text: climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm,

text: Buddy opens it and squints at him.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Oh-- Are you delivering the oxygen?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Uh, no, ma'am. Sorry.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream.
text: This one's nicer, with a view of the beach. Jack stands on the
text: balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE.
text: He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo.
text: He does the same with her gym I.D. card. He finds her address
text: book and opens it up. A photo of her father slips out. Jack
text: examines it a moment, then flips through the book.
text: He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in
text: and comes up with her us Marshal I.D. He slips it open and
text: studies the badge and the picture opposite.
text: He holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees...
scene_heading: THE OPEN TRUNK OF THE CAR - LAST NIGHT
text: As Karen gets out, saying...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You win, Jack.
text: BACK IN THE APARTMENT
text: Foley turns away from the view as Buddy walks in, sets the
text: grocery bag down on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You made the front page.
text: He holds up the newspaper so that Foley can see his picture on
text: the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all
dialog: that much like him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: They pass this picture around you can
dialog: go anywhere you want, nobody'll know
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I wasn't feeling my best that day.
dialog: I'd just drawn thirty to life.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Maybe this'll make you feel better.
text: Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a NEW ZIPPO.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it.
text: He looks at the paper on the coffee table as Buddy sits down,
text: pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Paper says there's ten grand each on
dialog: you, Chino and Lulu.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Just that she got away.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, but what happened after she drove
dialog: off with Glenn?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You'll have to ask Glenn. And most
text: likely, he's on his way to Detroit,
dialog: where we should be.
text: Foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of
text: Karen's bag spread out on the table.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You realize what you're doing? Worrying
dialog: about a person that works in law
dialog: enforcement. You want to sit down and
dialog: have cocktails with a girl that tried
dialog: to shoot you. You hear what I'm saying?
text: Foley holds up the picture of Marshall Sisco.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Think this old guy is her boyfriend?
text: It's the only picture she carries.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Am I going to Detroit by myself?
text: Foley picks up her drivers licence photo.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Longer we hang around down here, Jack,
dialog: better chance there is either Glenn's
dialog: gonna fuck up the whole score, or we
dialog: gonna get busted, or both.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: We'll leave first thing in the morning.

speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, he looks a lot...

speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)

dialog: Hi, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: In case no one knows what he does.
dialog: Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says,
dialog: "Undercover"?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No. Course not.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Great. We got one of 'em.
text: Karen looks at him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Was it Foley?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (before he can answer)
dialog: Off a tip?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in
text: this hobo camp out by the airport,
dialog: called the number--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I knew it, soon as I saw they were
dialog: offering a reward.
text: She grabs Nicolet by the arm.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Was it Foley?
text: Marshall looks at her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Foley? Oh. No, it was one of the
dialog: Cubans. Linares.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We went out there, full SWAT, two
dialog: choppers, the whole bit, but Linares
dialog: started shooting anyway. We put him
text: down, but somehow Chirino got away.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Did you pay the guy the reward?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, as soon as we got back.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Foley hadn't been there?
text: Her father gives her a look.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This place was strictly Cuban. If
dialog: Foley had a ride he must have his own
text: agenda. He seems to be the only one
dialog: knows what he's doing.
text: THE PHONE RINGS. Marshall moves to it.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah, she is. Just a minute.
dialog: (hands her the phone)
dialog: For you.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Hello?
text: CUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY
text: On the balcony. Flipping through a copy of <i>Vogue</i> while Buddy
text: watches television inside.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INTERCUTTING KAREN &amp; FOLEY - DAY
text: Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray
text: drones on.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You know who this is?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yes.
text: She walks out to her father's balcony now.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I just wanted to see if you're okay,
dialog: make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or,
dialog: you know, anything.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Something I've been wondering, Ray...
text: Marshall picks up the newspaper...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
text: It says in the headline, "I slept with
text: a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."
dialog: She lives in Little Havana, her
dialog: husband's out of town working when one
text: of the escapees shows up at her door...
text: She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How'd you get this number?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Who was it answered the phone?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'm just worried maybe I'm not old
dialog: enough for you.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That's my dad.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: Really. He has a cop's face.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How do you know? Wait-- you have my
dialog: wallet.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: And your gun.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Think I could have them back?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: How do we do that?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Let's see. You could come on by my
dialog: dad's place, drop 'em off.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Sure. I'll just leave 'em with the
text: S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
text: Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's
dialog: been looking for: an ad for <i>Defiance</i> perfume.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: There's a guy here on the task force
dialog: right now. Maybe I should put him on
dialog: the phone, let you two work it out.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You won't do that.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Because you're having too much fun.
text: She doesn't know what to say to that. Foley smells the ad.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE HOUSE
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: ...She fixes him pork chops and rice,
dialog: the next thing you know they're making
text: love on the sofa. She says he was
dialog: very gentle.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I spoke to her. The guy told her he
dialog: missed his little girl and she felt
dialog: sorry for him.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: That's how you score now?
scene_heading: ON THE PATIO:
text: Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: My dad's retired. He was a Private
dialog: Investigator. Forty years. I used to
dialog: work for him.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I can just picture that, a cute girl
dialog: like you following slip-and-fall and
dialog: whiplash cheaters.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Something I've been wondering, what
dialog: ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why? You think he might tell you where
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Unless you wanna tell me.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: He's dead. He did twenty-seven years
dialog: before he came out and died not too
dialog: long after in Charity Hospital, I think
dialog: trying to make up for all the good
dialog: times he'd missed.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That's not gonna be me.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: One last score, that the idea? Move
dialog: to some island.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'm partial to mountains myself. But
dialog: if you like islands, we'll make it an
dialog: island.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I just thought maybe you and me could--
text: Buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Who you talking to?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Is that Buddy?
text: Foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone. He looks at Buddy.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You better come see this.
scene_heading: INT. MARSHALL'S CONDO - DAY
text: As Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up,
text: opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: The woman also said he stole her
text: husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol,
text: and some of his clothes.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: So the woman's married. She goes to
dialog: bed with this prison escapee because
text: he misses his little girl and then
dialog: tells the world about it. But you
dialog: don't reveal her name, you protect
dialog: her. It sounds like you're saying
dialog: it's okay as long as her husband doesn't
dialog: find out about it. Like the guy who
text: cheats on his wife, saying what she
dialog: doesn't know won't hurt her.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Dad.
text: He looks over at her now. Gives her an innocent look.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: As Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at
text: the hobo camp. We catch a glimpse of RAY NICOLET, GUN IN HIS
text: WAISTBAND, STICKING HIS CHEST OUT FOR THE CAMERA.
text: Foley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered
text: with a sheet.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: He's running for his life, he doesn't
dialog: give a shit about you.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: He's gotta know by now that I gave him
dialog: up back at Glades. He does, he's gonna
dialog: try to find me. Maybe go see Adele,
dialog: see what she knows.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: He knows where she lives?
text: Foley doesn't answer. Buddy mutes the set. Turns to Foley.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: We were talking one time, drinking
dialog: rum. I may've mentioned Adele, how
dialog: she worked for a magician. Chino got
dialog: interested. He's like, Yeah? How
dialog: does he saw the woman in half? He
dialog: wanted to meet her. Or get a look at
dialog: her if she ever came to visit.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So call her up. Tell her don't talk
dialog: to any Cubans.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: Her phone's probably tapped.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: And you know they're gonna have some
text: people watching the hotel.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S BOAT - DAY
text: Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints
text: the trim on the boat.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Remember, pay attention to how she
dialog: talks about Foley, her tone. Do it
dialog: right, she'll tell you things she
dialog: wouldn't tell Burdon. Tell her you
dialog: think he's a nice guy. No, first tell
text: her about being in the trunk with him,
text: in the dark for half an hour, and see
dialog: how she takes it. If she's in on it,
dialog: what does she get for all the
dialog: aggravation; cops breathing on her? I
dialog: bet nothing. So she still likes him
dialog: enough to stick her neck out. You
dialog: think that's possible? What kind of
dialog: guy is he?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: He's pretty laid back, confident.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: But you know he's dirty and you still
dialog: wanna see him again.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I want to bust his ass, put him in
text: shackles.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Maybe. But you're also curious about
dialog: the man. Twice last night you asked
dialog: your married boyfriend Nicolet about
dialog: him. You were concerned, but you didn't
dialog: want to show it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: My married boyfriend - setting him up
dialog: with that news story so you could talk
dialog: about infidelity. I couldn't believe
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You like the wild ones, don't you?
dialog: Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You
dialog: know, I've always said there's a thin
text: line between the cowboy cops and the
dialog: armed robbers, all those guys that
dialog: love to pack.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: Yeah, but you talked all the way from
dialog: GCI to the turnpike. It sounds more
text: like a first date than a kidnapping.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a look. He goes back to his painting.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: Go talk to the ex-wife.
scene_heading: INT. ADELE DELISI'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: As Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped
text: dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when THE
text: PHONE RINGS. She grabs it...
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Hi, this is Adele speaking.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYPHONE - DAY
text: Adele's neighbourhood. Near the beach. Chino on the phone. He
text: wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: Oh, is this Adele?
speaker_heading: ADELE (PHONE)
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: Uh-- sorry. Wrong number.
text: He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in
text: one of his pockets. As he then starts off down the street, we
text: can see the name "COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING" on the back of
dialog: the jumpsuit.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY
text: Buddy drives. Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit --
text: is beside him. Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Nice disguise.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'm a tourist.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You at least bring the gun?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (lifts straw bag)
dialog: In here with my suntan lotion and beach
dialog: towel.
dialog: (points)
dialog: That's her place.
text: As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front,
dialog: obviously FBI...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: There. You see the guy sitting on the
dialog: porch? The old ladies and one guy?
dialog: You know they'll have a couple more in
text: a car somewhere.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (watching something
dialog: else)
dialog: Uh-huh...
text: Buddy follows Foley's gaze to...
text: ACROSS THE STREET
text: As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse
text: for change. She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she
text: bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh, my.
text: Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under
text: the car and grab it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you saw her. That's all you
dialog: get.
text: They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG
dialog: AGENT her ID...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I guess Adele's in good hands.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Sure looks that way.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Let's go to Detroit.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Now you're talkin'.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the
text: narrow opening.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: You were <i>both</i> in the trunk? Together?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: From Glades to the turnpike. Then I
dialog: left with Glenn.
text: Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up,
text: heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The FBI didn't tell you I was with
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they
dialog: asked questions.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: But you know what I'm talking about,
dialog: don't you? About Glenn, don't you,
dialog: and the second car?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I know a Glenn.
text: She thinks a moment. The door closes and opens again, all the
text: way. Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties,
dialog: but no bra.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm getting ready to go out. You can
dialog: come in if you want, sit down for a
dialog: minute. Would you like a Diet Coke?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, thanks.
text: She comes in, checks out the place. She turns a chair from the
text: glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the
text: kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Those are cute shoes. The kind of
dialog: jobs I get, I have to wear these killer
dialog: spikes, they ruin your feet.
text: She walks away, comes back with an ashtray.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: When you were in the trunk with Jack...
text: Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You mean, did he try to jump me? No,
dialog: but he was kind of talkative.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: He gets that way when he's nervous
dialog: sometimes.
text: Adele sits down at the other end of the table.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You didn't visit him in prison.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: He didn't want me to.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I don't know. He was different after
text: he was sentenced, looking at thirty
dialog: years. Said it depressed him every
dialog: time the younger cons called him an
dialog: old timer.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: But you spoke to him on the phone.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: He'd call every once in a while.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: He called the day he escaped.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: He did? I don't remember. Did he say
dialog: about me? In the trunk?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (beat, lies)
dialog: He said he wished the two of you could
dialog: start over, live a normal life.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Huh. Problem is, Jack's idea of a
dialog: normal life is robbing banks. It's
dialog: all he's ever done.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Did you know that when you married
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: He said he was a card player. I could
dialog: live with that. I never knew he robbed
dialog: banks till he got busted with that car
dialog: that caught fire -- if you can imagine
dialog: something like that happening, comes
text: out of the bank and the car's on fire.
dialog: I did go see him in jail to tell him I
dialog: was filing for divorce. He said,
dialog: "Okay." Jack's so easy going.
dialog: (then)
dialog: He was fun, but never what you'd call
dialog: a real husband.
text: Adele looks out the window. Karen waits, looks to an end table
text: where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere
dialog: ten years back.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll say one thing for Jack, he was
dialog: never ugly or mean, or drank too much.
dialog: He was very considerate, lights on or
dialog: off, if you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Really.
dialog: (looking at the picture)
dialog: Hm.
text: She realizes Adele is looking at her.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get
dialog: caught. I'd like to get him before he
dialog: does something else, makes it worse on
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Buddy'll take care of him. Keep him
dialog: out've trouble. He's Jack's conscience.
dialog: Always has been.
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: He tell you how they met?
text: Karen shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
text: Jack came out of a bank he just robbed
dialog: in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen
text: car to start. Battery was dead. He
text: looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a
text: burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers
dialog: him a thousand dollars for a jump.
dialog: Turns out, Buddy was casing the same
dialog: bank and saw the whole thing. Buddy
dialog: says, I'll take the thousand, but we're
dialog: leaving in my car, not that piece of
dialog: shit you come in.
dialog: (then)
dialog: They musta robbed fifty banks together.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Till they got busted.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that
dialog: was on account of Buddy, for some
dialog: reason, decided to call his sister and
dialog: confess to a job before they'd done it
text: instead of after. She called the FBI
text: and they both went down, ended up at
dialog: Lompoc.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I think Buddy felt kinda bad about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Any idea where I could find Buddy? Or
dialog: Glenn?
text: Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick
text: raps on the door.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: Adele? You in there?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: I want to speak with you, please.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.
dialog: He tole me your number and where you
dialog: live. See, I'm looking for an assistant
dialog: and would like to speak to you.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Oh. Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: You did work for Emil, right?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost
dialog: four years.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: You were his what, his box?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: His assistant.
text: Karen looks at the door. Something's wrong... through the glass
text: bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement
text: on the other side, someone doing <i>something</i>...
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: You say you perform in the Miami area?
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, around here. I was a mayishan in
dialog: Cuba before I come here. Manuel the
dialog: Mayishan was my name.
text: And now Karen and Adele look at each other.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you open the door?
text: Karen shakes her head "no."
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I'm not dressed.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: Listen to me.
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
text: Boom. Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of
text: the table, sees Adele staring at her.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Ask him his name.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Jose Chirino.
text: Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me
dialog: Chino. I'm the same person.
text: Karen moves along the table to Adele...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Tell him to wait in the hall, you have
dialog: to get dressed. Say it loud.
text: As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Wait in the hall! I have to get
dialog: dressed!
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't
dialog: bother you no more.
text: Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position
text: beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of
text: the three glass panels in the centre of the door.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I don't know where he is.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape
dialog: from prison. He tole me, I can't find
dialog: him to see you. So why don't you open
dialog: this fucking door. Okay? So we can
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (staring at Karen)
dialog: Go away, or I'll call the police.
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE
dialog: Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
text: Adele says nothing. Then...
speaker_heading: CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm
dialog: leaving.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm going now. I see you maybe some
dialog: time, okay? Bye bye.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (low)
dialog: Go in the bedroom and --
text: Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes
text: through one of the glass panels. Adele and Karen both jump as
text: Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob...
text: ...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight
text: as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm
text: still sticking through the glass...
text: ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he
text: bangs against a wall and falls to the floor. Dazed, Chino
text: reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet.
text: Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the
text: front sight on his chest.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave it where it is.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Wait. You not Adele?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm a federal marshal and you're under
dialog: arrest. Put the gun on the table. I
dialog: mean, now.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: Oh. Then this must be Adele...
text: He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Put it down or I'll shoot.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What do you want to bet?
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I could walk out of here.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If you move, if you look at her again,
dialog: you're dead.
text: Chino doesn't move. Keeps his gun on Adele. Karen starts
text: walking towards him...
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You can live or die, it's up to you.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: Oh, is that right? You going to shoot
dialog: me? Nice girl like you?
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You don't, huh?
text: And with that, she kicks him in the knee. Chino buckles over
text: and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: On your knees.
text: He does as he's told. Karen raises his jacket, feels around
text: his waist from behind.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
text: Lie face down on the floor.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: (hurting)
dialog: What?!
text: She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there. She puts
text: her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials. She
text: sees Adele staring at her.
speaker_heading: CHINO (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Adele)
dialog: Excuse me...
text: Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: Excuse me, Adele?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: You do the sawing of the box in half
dialog: trick with you inside?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHINO
dialog: Tell me, how do you do that?
text: Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with
dialog: her foot.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: Karen. Where are you? I been trying
dialog: to get a hold of you.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Daniel. Listen --
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: Where are you? I been trying to reach
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm at Adele Delisi's.
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: What-- we already talked to her. That's
text: a dead end.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (looking at Chino)
dialog: Yeah, I know. I was just leaving.
dialog: Why were you trying to reach me?
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
text: There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around
dialog: the same time Foley was there. We got

dialog: in Hallandale. I want you to go there,

dialog: him as the other guy. If he does, you
dialog: call me right away...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: All right, but...
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: But don't you do anything. You just
dialog: have a seat, wait for me to get there.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Sure, Daniel.
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: Now. What is it you wanted to tell
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to
dialog: bring in Chirino, would you put me on
dialog: the task force?
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: What? Is that what you're calling me
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yes or no, Daniel. If I get him, will
dialog: you let me go after Foley?
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in
dialog: Chirino, you can be on the task
dialog: force.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That's all I wanted to know.
speaker_heading: BURDON (PHONE)
dialog: Good. Now forget about the ex-wife

speaker_heading: ADELE

scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: First thing we do, we get to Detroit,
text: we find Glenn, then we find a window
dialog: to throw him out of.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was
text: up there to take down the Ripper, where
dialog: would I go?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Well, first off, if you were Glenn,
dialog: you wouldn't be thinking.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal
dialog: from Lompoc?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be
text: brain dead by now.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: He isn't fighting no more. Glenn told
dialog: me the Snoop's been managing some guys
text: up there now, works out at the Kronk.
scene_heading: INT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters
text: with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running
text: shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags.
text: Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: You get the key?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: They're in 7D.
text: She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: I want two men outside, front and back.
text: Conway and Jessup go on up to seven,
text: cover both ends of the hall.
text: Burdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents. Burden
text: looks at them one at a time.
speaker_heading: BURDON (CONT'D)
dialog: You're primary, you're secondary, you're
dialog: point man.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You're gonna use a ram?
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Yeah, why?
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: The manager's door is metal.
text: They all look at her.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I mean? They might all be.
text: And a ram on a metal door makes an awful
dialog: lot of noise for what good it does.
text: Burdon looks at her, not all that happy she spoke up. The fourth
text: man raises the shotgun, a three-inch strip of metal taped to
dialog: the muzzle.
speaker_heading: FOURTH MAN
dialog: I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun
dialog: oughta do the trick.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: Fine. Whatever.
text: He sees the elevator still hasn't come down.
speaker_heading: BURDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck it. Let's take the stairs.
dialog: Karen...
text: Burdon pauses, looks at Karen, hands her a radio.
speaker_heading: BURDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Take the radio, stay down here in the
text: lobby, watch the elevator.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: You can go wait out in the car, you
dialog: want to.
text: She doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: BURDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg
dialog: come in behind us, whatta you do?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Call and tell you.
speaker_heading: BURDON
dialog: And you let them come up. You don't
dialog: try to make the bust yourself. You
dialog: understand?
text: Before she can answer, an old woman steps in, asks Burdon...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Are you delivering the oxygen?
text: Burdon looks at her, then nods for his men to start up the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY
text: Everyone's in position as Burdon eases the key into the lock,
text: turns it. The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut.
text: The guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the
text: seam, where the lock enters the frame, the muzzle of the shotgun
text: exactly three inches now from the dead bolt, and looks over his
text: shoulder at Burdon.
dialog: With the sound of the blast, we then...
scene_heading: CUT TO: INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - DAY
text: As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady. The doors open.
text: The woman doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Is this your floor, mother?
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: Oh. Yes, it is.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOBBY - SAME TIME - DAY
text: As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on

speaker_heading: OLD GENT
dialog: Like to play some gin?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, thank you.

scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY
text: As we hear Burdon's voice.
speaker_heading: BURDON (RADIO)
dialog: Karen. They're not up here. Keep
dialog: your eyes open.
text: Karen looks off towards the street entrance, then back at the
text: elevator where the man is still waiting, leaning on his cane.
text: The elevator door opens to reveal Buddy and Foley.
speaker_heading: OLD GENT
dialog: Going up?
text: Buddy and Foley don't answer. The old man starts to get on,
text: feeling with his cane, taking forever.
text: Karen and Foley are staring at each other. He doesn't move.
text: Not until the elevator door begins to close.
text: Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as...
text: Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when...
text: Foley raises his hand. And waves as the door closes.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: As the elevator resumes going down.
speaker_heading: OLD GENT
dialog: Shit, I wanted to go up.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Let's just hope there's no one in the
dialog: garage.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: She looked right at me. She didn't
text: yell or get excited. She didn't move.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY
text: As they get in and Buddy starts the car...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: They know where I live, I guess they
dialog: know what I drive, so maybe we should
text: pick up another car on the way.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: She just sat there, looking right at
dialog: me.
text: Buddy gives him a look, shakes his head and then burns rubber
dialog: out of the garage as we...
text: CUT TO: A CLOSE-UP OF KAREN - DAY
text: Staring straight ahead.
speaker_heading: BURDON (ON THE RADIO)
dialog: Karen. Report. You see anything?

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: As Marshall walks Karen to the gate.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: He waved to you?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty
dialog: sure he did.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You wave back?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I didn't have time.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I imagine you would've though.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got
text: two calls from Buddy up in Detroit
dialog: this morning, called Burdon. She's
dialog: also the one gave Burdon Buddy's
dialog: address.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: So what I want to know is why Buddy
dialog: still calls his sister every week even
dialog: after she turned him in.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
text: He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got
dialog: such a big score up north, did Foley
dialog: hang around Miami for so long?
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: Any thoughts on that one?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: None I'd like to share.
text: She gives him a kiss...
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAURICE (VO)

scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME
text: Glenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka "Snoopy" --
text: wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I've diversified since the last time
dialog: you saw me. I've vertically integrated
dialog: and now I'm into home invasions and
text: the occasional grand larceny.
text: Glenn just nods, stares out the window.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my
dialog: bodyguard when I feel I need one, and
dialog: my driver.
text: Maurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved-
text: looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch the road, boy.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I like this Town Car. We can cruise
dialog: the man's neighbourhood without getting
dialog: the police or private security people
dialog: on our ass.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving
text: around a black guy wearing shades and
dialog: a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they
dialog: won't think anything of it.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: It's lilac, man, the color, and the
dialog: style's made known by Deion and other
dialog: defensive backs in the pros. I could
dialog: be one of them living out here with
dialog: doctors of my race and basketball
dialog: players. Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's
dialog: house up on the left. Yeah. The brick
text: wall. There's his drive, right there.
text: The car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming
dialog: up here, do this themself?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: If they're not busted now, they're
dialog: gonna be.

scene_heading: EXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER
text: People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black

text: snow-covered trash.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: So you still haven't said, how you
dialog: wanna do it?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I'll show you, soon as I get one more
dialog: guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,
text: Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: What?
text: The car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a
text: bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always
text: seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You get everything?
text: Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat. Glenn stares at
text: it. Something about the bag makes him uneasy. Maybe it's the
text: HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool. Kenneth, this is the man I told
dialog: you about, Glenn.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The one gonna help us rip off the rich

speaker_heading: MAURICE

speaker_heading: GLENN

speaker_heading: GLENN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a minute. I'm letting <i>you</i> in on
dialog: this, not all your friends.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You just ask me how we gonna do it.
dialog: That's what I'm here for, tell you
dialog: how. We the experts.
text: Glenn can't believe this is happening.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thing I'm worried about is you.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Yeah. If you can step up and actually
dialog: do it. Understand? 'Stead of just
dialog: talking the talk.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Can I do what?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
dialog: dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I
dialog: used to sell to been dealin' on his
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: What-- when?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Right now, son.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I don't have to prove shit to you.
dialog: The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job. You're either
dialog: in or you're not. You wanna pop some
dialog: crack dealer pissed you off, that's
dialog: your problem, not mine.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you
dialog: don't have to give me no tone of voice,
dialog: okay? You don't like what I'm saying,
dialog: you can get out anywhere along here
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I think you're forgetting, this is my
dialog: car. I drove it up here.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Hey, shit, come on. I say I want this
dialog: car, man, it's mine. You go get
dialog: yourself another one. I say I'm in on
dialog: Ripley? I'm in, with or without <i>your</i>
dialog: ass. I say I want you to come along
dialog: on another job, see if you for real or
dialog: not, guess what you gonna do?
text: Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades.
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: We're here.
text: Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit-
text: looking two-story house. Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the
text: hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
text: to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Let's go see Eddie.
text: Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (V.O.)
dialog: Must take balls, do what you do.
scene_heading: EXT. LOMPOC FPC - YARD - DAY
text: As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Tell me something. What's it like,
dialog: walk in a bank with a gun, stick it
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know. I never used a gun.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You'd be surprised what all you can
dialog: get, you ask for it the right way.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep
dialog: all my money in banks.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: No? Where do you keep it, Dick?
dialog: (Ripley smiles)
dialog: I'm talking about all those uncut
dialog: diamonds you told Glenn about.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (still smiling)
dialog: I know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You're the one with balls, Dick, say
dialog: something like that to someone like
dialog: Glenn. Or maybe you just forgot where
dialog: you were for a minute.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?
dialog: I mean, do you believe Glenn?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Plus, even it was true, he'd still
dialog: have to figure out where I keep 'em.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Doesn't have to figure out shit. You
dialog: told him you keep 'em at your house.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (shrugs, big smile)
dialog: It's a big house.
text: Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the
dialog: yard.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me something, Jack, how much longer
dialog: you in here?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Twenty-two months, three days, two
dialog: hours. Why?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I was just thinking that I could use a
dialog: guy like you, someone knows how to ask
dialog: for things the right way. I'm talkin'
dialog: about when you're outta here. I mean,
dialog: you can't rob banks for ever.
text: Foley looks at Ripley.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It's a little late for me.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hey, Jack? Bullshit. I didn't make
dialog: my first million until I was forty-
dialog: two. Forty-two. You really want to
dialog: change, it's never too late.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know. I'm not exactly the
dialog: nine-to-five type.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Who is? But then you gotta look at a
dialog: job as more than just work. You gotta
dialog: look at it as peace of mind. As
dialog: <i>security</i>, you know what I mean? I got
dialog: offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,
dialog: take your pick.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: My ex-wife's in Miami. It's nice down
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No need to decide now. Be like the
dialog: fish. Let whatever happens happen.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: The fish?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yeah, fish live in the present. They
dialog: don't dwell on yesterday and they don't
dialog: worry about tomorrow. Even when a big
dialog: fish attacks a little fish, there's no
text: neurosis involved. No guilt afterward.
text: No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.
dialog: They just do it. They accept.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I can't say that I've paid that much
dialog: attention to 'em before.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: The fish saved my life. Two years
dialog: ago, I found out I had high blood
dialog: pressure. So my doctor, he tells me
dialog: to go get an aquarium, look at the
dialog: fish every time I felt myself stressing
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: And the guy sent you a bill for this?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It works. You should try it sometime.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: The next time I walk into a bank.
text: Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Think about my offer, Jack.
text: Foley watches him go.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (V.O.)
dialog: Hey, Jack...
text: CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY
text: As he turns to us.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What?
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR
text: Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
text: brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You see this one...
text: Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: "Fight over tuna casserole may have
dialog: spurred slaying." Seems this woman's
dialog: live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
dialog: complained about her tuna noodle
text: casserole and she shot him in the face
text: with a twelve-gauge. Police found
text: noodles in the woman's hair and think
text: the guy dumped the casserole dish on
dialog: her before she shot him. They'd been
dialog: together ten years.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Love is funny.
text: Buddy looks at him. Notices something over Foley's shoulder.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey--
text: And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
text: pulls into the Kronk parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN CAR - SAME
text: Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the
text: front seat. Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging
text: himself, shaking. Maurice looks out the window...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Was a time you see a gold Mercedes
text: over in the parking lot has a license
dialog: plate on it say HITMAN? You know Tommy
text: Hearns is inside. Seeing the car would
dialog: get our juices flowing.
text: Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: You already got your juices flowing,
dialog: huh? Pissed your pants back there at
dialog: Eddie's house, didn't you?
text: Glenn just looks at Maurice.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: That was some shit, huh?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: (indicates Kenneth)
dialog: Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that
dialog: to that poor girl.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Do what?
text: Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Just wait till we get inside Ripley's
dialog: house.
text: And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: It's all right with you, I'll just
text: hang in the car.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No. You gonna stay close to me from
dialog: now on. So you don't disappear on me.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Why would I do that?
text: Maurice looks at him, starts laughing. White Boy Bob and Kenneth
text: join in. Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens
text: Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T-
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Was worse than you imagined, wasn't
dialog: it?
dialog: (then, smiles)
dialog: Baby, you with the bad boys now.
scene_heading: INT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME
text: As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Whatta you think?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
dialog: now we got us another partner.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Or two.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - DAY
text: Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring.

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Stick and jab!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey, Studs, how you doing?
text: He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing
dialog: here?
text: They sit down on either side of him, close.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Weren't you expecting us?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: That broad you picked up -- did you
dialog: know she was a US Marshal, for Christ
dialog: sake?
text: Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat
text: and sits down again.
speaker_heading: GLENN (CONT'D)
dialog: She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope
dialog: bust. She drove me to court. Twice.
dialog: You know what she said, we're in the
dialog: car on the turnpike? "I never forget
dialog: anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah? She said that to you?
text: Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face,
text: almost smiling.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to your shades? Someone
dialog: finally step on 'em?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: (touches his head)
dialog: I don't know...
text: Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Whose blood you got all over you?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: These guys, man, they're crazy.
dialog: (looks off)
dialog: Shit.
text: Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy
text: Bob beside him, carrying his shirts.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo
dialog: rag?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's he do now, tell fortunes?
text: Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley
text: to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it.
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: We have a problem here?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (walking over)
dialog: Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: It seems to me I been reading about
dialog: you in the newspaper. Busted out of
dialog: some joint in Florida, huh?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Low class of people there, Snoop.
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: You call him that again I'll put your
text: head through the wall.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What? You mean Snoop?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy,
dialog: is what White Boy's trying to say.
dialog: He's a little crude, you understand.
dialog: No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: But you call this bozo White Boy?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: White Boy Bob.
dialog: (baiting)
dialog: White Boy used to be a fighter.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's he do now outside of shoot his
dialog: mouth off?
text: White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Like being back in the yard, huh?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
text: Just like it. Nobody backing down.
dialog: You back down, you pussy. Tell me what
dialog: you and Buddy doing up here in the
dialog: cold?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Glenn didn't tell you?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I thought you guys were busted.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why? Just because you left us standing
dialog: on the side of the road?
text: Foley looks at Glenn. Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously. Foley
text: smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard. Now Maurice
text: starts laughing. Buddy, too. White Boy's lost, looking from
text: one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile
text: going away as he says...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn
dialog: promised you or what you think you're
dialog: gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy
dialog: get half of whatever we take from
dialog: Ripley, understand? How you and Glenn
dialog: cut up the rest is up to you.
speaker_heading: MAURICE

speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Warm? Man, it's ninety-five degrees
dialog: in here, sometimes a hundred -- the
dialog: way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd
dialog: sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy
dialog: Hearns. No, I ain't talking any
dialog: business in here. To me this is holy
dialog: ground, man. You understand? I got
dialog: to be someplace anyway. Y'all want to
dialog: talk, come to the fights tomorrow night,
dialog: we'll sit down and look at it good.
dialog: The State Theater.
text: Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: We'll see you tomorrow then.
text: Maurice then watches as they walk out.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: White Boy, how much is the reward on
dialog: the man again?
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: Ten gees.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You recall, did it say dead or alive?
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
text: The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier.
text: Now it's a CRIME SCENE. A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers
text: stand just behind the yellow tape. A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up
text: the front yard.
text: Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly-
text: freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm looking for Ray Cruz.
speaker_heading: COP
text: He's inside.
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: With everybody else.
text: Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk. She pauses
text: to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD
text: BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - SAME
text: Hell. Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in
text: the doorway. Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A
text: MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the
text: chest. He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist.
text: Congealed blood runs down the stairs. COPS and CRIME SCENE
text: TECHS are everywhere. Karen looks at the guy on the stairs.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Called themselves the Youngboys.
text: Karen looks over as RAYMOND CRUZ, a stocky, genial-looking
text: detective comes out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Ironic, isn't it?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How are you, Raymond?
speaker_heading: CRUZ
text: Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.
text: He kisses her on the cheek. She indicates the body by the door.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Quite a mess.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Yeah. And I thought everyone liked
dialog: Eddie.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CRUZ
text: Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon,
dialog: used to buy scag off a corner till he
dialog: kicked it and found his happiness with
text: crack and then started dealing himself.
dialog: Word on the street was he was saving
dialog: up for an operation.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What is it with crack and transsexuals?
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had
dialog: these girls cooked the rocks he called
dialog: the Rockettes.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yeah. I saw one of 'em outside.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Yonelle. Looks like someone raped
text: her, shot her, then threw her out the
dialog: window.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Fuckin' animals.
text: This shuts them both up. Cruz indicates the door.
speaker_heading: CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's get some air.
text: She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on
dialog: the ground...
text: A BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES
text: Wrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing.
text: Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
text: As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press
text: photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Other than we had so much fun the last
dialog: time we worked together. You gonna
dialog: tell me why you're comin' to me instead
dialog: of the FBI?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I report to the FBI, first thing they're
dialog: gonna do is ask me to go get some
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and
dialog: property now, also sex crimes and child
dialog: abuse.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions
dialog: are big, too.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had
dialog: this guy Glenn Michaels on possession
text: with intent but couldn't make it stick.
dialog: In his statement, Glenn said he went
dialog: up to Detroit to visit a friend and
dialog: look into job opportunities -- if you
dialog: can believe that.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Who was the friend?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Guy named Maurice Miller, also known
text: as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He's a
dialog: fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray
text: Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other
text: Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'll need a last known address.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: That's fine, but I don't want you to
dialog: talk to Miller alone.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,
dialog: I'm armed.
text: He turns and looks at her.
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Yes, you are. I'll call you tomorrow
dialog: with the address.
text: As he gets into his car, we then:
scene_heading: CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER
text: The crime scene from the night before. A shot of Karen and Ray
text: Cruz as they exit the house. A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER"
dialog: blah-blah-blah...
speaker_heading: BUDDY (PHONE)
dialog: You have the paper?
scene_heading: REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the
text: newspaper photograph of Karen.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: It's a terrific shot of her.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME
text: Buddy looking at the same shot...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Outside of that.
scene_heading: INTERCUTTING FOLEY &amp; BUDDY
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Doesn't say what she's doing up here,
dialog: but I don't think it has anything to
dialog: do with us.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: She came up here on her vacation, 'cause
dialog: she likes shitty weather.
text: Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center
text: and pulls out a tie.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I think she's after Glenn. The girl
dialog: still with you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less
dialog: you pay for it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You tell your sister about it?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Just hung up.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: How long you talk to her?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Two hours.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: How long were you with the girl?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: Forty-five minutes.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You didn't tell your sister about
dialog: Ripley, did you? 'Cause I don't wanna
dialog: go through that again.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Forget about my sister. If Karen
dialog: Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked.
dialog: Tomorrow night at the fights we all
dialog: get picked up.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Let's drive by where we're meeting and
dialog: have a look. Maybe take a look at
dialog: Ripley's place while we're at it.
text: Foley hangs up. He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (V.O.)
dialog: I guess next time I see you, you'll be
text: wearing a suit and tie...
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY
text: Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a
text: jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up
text: his belongings. He's going home.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I still haven't made up my mind yet.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What's to think about?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You goin' right back to work?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year,
dialog: study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz...
dialog: then come back, maybe take some tennis
dialog: lessons.
text: He tears a picture off the wall...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here...
dialog: (hands it to Foley)
dialog: Something to remember me by.
text: Foley stares at the photograph of sea life.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not the real thing, but it's still
dialog: nice to look at.
text: Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: See you on the outside, Jack.
scene_heading: INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in
dialog: the overall effect.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hi! I just broke outta jail!
text: His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at
text: the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside,
text: grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone...
speaker_heading: VOICE (PHONE)
dialog: Atheneum Hotel.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Karen Sisco, please.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (pause, then)
dialog: I'm sorry, but there's no one by that
dialog: name registered.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Thank you.
text: He dials the next number...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Best Western...
scene_heading: EXT. MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Red brick, showing its age. Karen rings the doorbell and then
text: waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy
text: coat. The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe
text: holding her arms close against the cold.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Moselle Miller?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm looking for Maurice.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: You find him, tell him the dog got run
dialog: over and I'm out of grocery money.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: Moselle. Who you talking to?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
text: Lady looking for Maurice.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: What's she want?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: Hasn't said.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: That's not Maurice?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: That's Kenneth, my brother. He's
text: talking on the phone.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: Ask what she want with him?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: You ask her. Maurice's business is
dialog: none of <i>my</i> business.
text: Sounding tired or bored. She turns from the door and walks
text: into the living room. Karen steps inside, pushes the door
text: closed and steps into the foyer.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: How do I know?
text: Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
text: sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
dialog: the phone...
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The State, huh. Who's fighting?
text: Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
text: lighting a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: You like to sit down?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Thanks.
text: Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
text: daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
text: fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm looking for a friend of mine I think
dialog: Maurice knows.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: You not with probation, one of those?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: You a lawyer?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No, I'm not. Maybe you know him.
dialog: Glenn Michaels?
text: Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: Glenn? No, I don't know any Glenn.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: He said he stayed here last November.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: Here? In this house?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: He said he stayed with Maurice.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much. I
dialog: like to know where he goes, but at the
dialog: same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your dog was killed?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
text: Got run over by a car.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What did you call it?
text: Moselle looks at the couch, where a MANGLED FRISBEE sits.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: Was a she, name Tuffy.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (nods, then)
dialog: Where do you think I might find Maurice?
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
dialog: I don't know -- the gym, the fights.
dialog: I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights. Having
dialog: some tomorrow night at the State
dialog: Theater. He use to take me.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The State Theater?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What you want with Maurice?
text: Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from
text: the foyer.
speaker_heading: MOSELLE
text: She looking for a man name of Glenn.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Did I ask you? Go on out of here. Do
dialog: something with yourself.
text: He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away
text: from them through the dining room. Karen watches him come toward
text: her now in kind of an easy strut. She indicates the scar over
dialog: his eye...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You're a fighter?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: How you know that?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I can tell.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I <i>was</i>...
text: He moves his head in what might be a feint.
speaker_heading: KENNETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Till I got my retina detached two time.
text: He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What'd you fight, middleweight?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Light to super-middleweight, as my
dialog: body developed. You go about what,
dialog: bantam?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Flyweight.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: You know your divisions. You like the
dialog: fights? Like the rough stuff? Yeah,
dialog: I bet you do.
dialog: (moves closer)
dialog: Like to get down and tussle a little
dialog: bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she
dialog: got run over, we use to get down on
text: the floor and tussle. I say to her,
dialog: "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat
dialog: for you." And I give Tuffy what every
dialog: dog love best. You know what that is?
text: A bone.
dialog: (real close)
dialog: I can give you a bone, too, girl.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You're not my type.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Don't matter. I let the monster out,
dialog: you gonna do what it wants.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Just a minute.
text: Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Bring your own rubbers with you?
text: Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip
text: on a golf club. Kenneth grins at her...
speaker_heading: KENNETHN (CONT'D)
dialog: What else you have in there, mace?
dialog: Have a whistle, different kinds of
dialog: female-protection shit?
text: Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I have to go, Kenneth.
text: She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's
text: like a golf club grip.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?
text: She steps aside and brushes past him. He grabs her left wrist...
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: We gonna tussle first.
text: Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
text: out of the grip. She pulls an arm's length away from him and
text: chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
dialog: away...
speaker_heading: KENNETH (CONT'D)
dialog: God <i>damn</i>...
text: He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
text: when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
text: his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.
speaker_heading: KENNETH (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
text: And she walks out. She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
text: Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
text: comes out with a business card.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I wrote my hotel number on there -- in
dialog: case you run into Glenn.
text: Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe. Karen smiles
text: at her and walks out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME
text: Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Now that's a really big house.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost
text: looks like a prison.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: No doubt the man's got some big-ass
dialog: security system.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: Time comes, we knock on the door. See
dialog: if he wants to talk about old times.
dialog: Go in the easy way.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we
dialog: got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole
dialog: with us?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Who says anybody's gonna be with us?
dialog: I say we go to the fights tomorrow,
dialog: find out what the Snoop's big plan is,
dialog: then go in ahead of those guys --
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while
dialog: we're off livin' the good life.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Tell me something, Buddy. You know
dialog: anyone who's actually done one last
dialog: big score and gone to live the good
dialog: life? Cause it occurred to me that
dialog: everyone talks about doing it, but I
dialog: don't know anyone who's actually gone
dialog: and done it. Do you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
text: Foley looks at him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, they don't know for sure he's
dialog: dead.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look, there's always a chance we'll
dialog: walk out've there with nothing. I say
dialog: let fate decide.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Let fate decide? What're you, the
dialog: fuckin' Dali Lama now?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: My sister believes in fate, but not
dialog: hell. That's why she stopped praying
dialog: for the lost souls since you don't
dialog: hear that much about purgatory anymore.
dialog: But every day she asks her boss to
dialog: pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think,
dialog: you think there's a hell, Jack?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional
dialog: Institution and I'm sure as shit not
dialog: going back there or any place like it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You might not have a choice.
text: Foley looks at him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: They put a gun on you, you still have
dialog: a choice, don't you?
text: Foley turns back to the house. And now we hear...
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN (VO)
dialog: I think you're gonna fit right in...
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY
text: The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a
text: grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty
text: suit and tie.
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long
dialog: discussion about your role in the
dialog: company and it was his feeling that
dialog: you would be happiest working down
dialog: here in Miami. How's that sound to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Great.
text: Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley...
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: You're about a 42 long, right?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What?
text: But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering. Foley looks at the
text: desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the-
text: bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar.
text: Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: Okay. Let's see how she fits.
text: Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what
text: looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: Your uniform.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: My what?
text: Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one
text: arm. Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you kidding me?
scene_heading: RICHARD RIPLEY'S OFFICE
text: View. Wet bar. Huge fucking aquarium.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST (OS)
dialog: Sir, you can't go in there...
text: Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist
text: right behind him now.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Jack? Whoa-- what's the problem?
dialog: Take it easy, let's talk...
text: Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a PANIC BUTTON beneath his desk...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: A security guard? Are you fucking
dialog: kidding me?
text: Ripley considers Foley a moment, then...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up.
dialog: But I was pretty sure that, if you
dialog: did, you'd throw the job in my face.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Understand something, Jack. Up to
dialog: this point, everything you've done
dialog: with your life means absolutely nothing
text: in the real world. Less than nothing.
text: Foley says nothing.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a bank robber. This is not a
dialog: marketable skill. There are no old
text: bank robbers out in the world living
dialog: on pensions. You know this. That's
dialog: why you're here right now.
dialog: 
text: Still Foley says nothing.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at
dialog: a lousy wage. You think you're better
dialog: than that? Fine. Show me. Show me
dialog: that you're really willing to change
dialog: and we'll talk about something better.
dialog: A lot better. But first, Jack, you
dialog: gotta earn it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: How, Dick? The way you earned it? By
dialog: marrying some rich broad owns the
text: company, selling it off a piece at a
dialog: time, then divorcing her? What is
dialog: this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by
dialog: the bootstraps bullshit? Back in
dialog: prison, guy like you, place like that,
dialog: you were ice cream for freaks. You
dialog: were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and
dialog: a dozen other guys coulda bled you
dialog: till you had nothing. Till you were
dialog: nothing. I saved your ass. So you'll
dialog: pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a
dialog: fuckin stool all day saying "sign in
dialog: here please" or "hey, pal, you can't
dialog: park there." Okay, Dick? I can't do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Jack, I'm disappointed. I guess I
dialog: misjudged you.
text: Two massive SECURITY GUARDS appear in the doorway...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Hey, what job he promise <i>you</i> guys?
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: There's two ways we can do this.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah? What are they?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Gentlemen. I think we've calmed down
dialog: now. Haven't we, Jack?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Oh, yeah, I'm calm. In fact, I'm totally
dialog: "relaxed..."
text: And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH) and wings
text: it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.
scene_heading: EXT. RIPLEY'S BUILDING - FLORIDA - DAY
text: As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two
text: guards. He picks himself up. He kicks at the guards, who wave
dialog: him off, go back inside.
text: Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...
text: THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET
text: The one from the opening. Foley looks at it a moment, then
text: calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he
text: starts across the street...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY
text: As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of
text: Karen he tore out of the morning paper. He's written the name
text: "WESTIN" on it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Listen, I gotta get some better shoes,
dialog: few other things before tomorrow. Why
dialog: don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen,
dialog: we'll hook up later?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah, and I better call my sister.
scene_heading: CUT TO: THE SNOWSTORM
text: It's really coming down. We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're
text: looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of
dialog: the Westin.
text: A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are
text: laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to
text: an adjacent table.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Jack Daniel's, please, water on the
dialog: side.
text: She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast
text: sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above
dialog: the city, down there somewhere.
scene_heading: EXECUTIVE GUY'S VOICE
dialog: Celeste, do us again, please, and put
dialog: the lady's drink on our bill.
text: She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling,
text: pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Thanks anyway.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (drifting over)
dialog: They want to buy you a drink.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I get that. Tell them I'd rather pay
dialog: for my own.
text: She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress
text: delivering the message. Then they look at Karen. She gives
text: them a shrug, turns to watch the snow. Her drink arrives. She
text: takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE GUY
dialog: Excuse me. My associates and I made a
dialog: bet on what you do for a living.
text: She glances at the table, the other two watching.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: And I won. Hi, I'm Philip.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd
dialog: like to just have a quiet drink and
dialog: leave. Okay?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Don't you want to know what I guessed?
dialog: How I know what you do for a living?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly
dialog: curious. Really, I don't want to be
dialog: rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left
dialog: alone.
text: She turns back to the snowstorm. She sees his reflection turn
text: and leave. A moment later, the next one appears at the table.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE GUY #2
dialog: I think I know why you're depressed --
dialog: if I may offer an observation.
text: She just looks at him. So sure of himself.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE GUY #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a hunch you're the new sales
dialog: rep and your customer isn't exactly
text: knocked out by the idea of a young
dialog: lady, even one as stunning as you,
dialog: handling the account. Am I close?
dialog: Hi, I'm Andy.
text: She says nothing to him.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We're ad guys. We flew in from New
dialog: York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker
dialog: Distillery, present this test-market
dialog: campaign for their new margarita mix.
dialog: What we do, we show this guy who looks
dialog: like a Mexican bandido, you know, with
dialog: the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Andy? Really. Who gives a shit?
text: He gives her a sympathetic expression.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Want to tell me what happened?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Beat it, will you?
text: She stares at the guy until he turns away. She sips her drink,
text: stares once more out at the blizzard. After a few moments,
text: another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Can I buy you a drink?
text: Boom. Not one of the executive guys. She stares at the
text: reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK
text: FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah, I'd love one.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Would you like to sit down?
text: He pulls the chair out, looking at her. The three guys at the
text: other table now staring as he sits down. Foley offers his
dialog: hand...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'm Gary.
text: She hesitates, then shakes his hand...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm Celeste.
text: She smiles with him. When she lowers her hand to the table,
text: his hand comes down to cover hers. She watches his expression
text: as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers,
text: and lays her hand on his. The tips of her fingers brush his
text: knuckles, lightly back and forth.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: It takes hours to get a drink around
dialog: here. There's only one waitress.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I can go to the bar.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Don't leave me.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Those guys bother you?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, they're all right. I meant, you
dialog: just got here.
text: She picks up her drink and places it in front of him.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Help yourself.
text: She watches him take a sip, smack his lips.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You like bourbon?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Love it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (passes the glass
dialog: back)
dialog: Well, we got that out of the way.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for
dialog: a living?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm a sales rep. I came here to call
dialog: on a customer and they gave me a hard
dialog: time because I'm a girl.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Is that how you think of yourself?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What, as a sales rep?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: A girl.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I don't have a problem with it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I like your hair. And that suit.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I had one just like it -- well, it was
dialog: the same idea, but I had to get rid of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It smelled.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What do you do for a living, Gary?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How far do we go with this?
text: This stops her, throws her off balance.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Not yet. Don't say anything yet. Okay?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't think it works if we're somebody
dialog: else. You know what I mean? Gary and
dialog: Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It's your game. I've never played
dialog: this before.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It's not a game. Something you play.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Well, does it make sense to you?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It doesn't have to, it's something
dialog: that happens. It's like seeing a person
dialog: you never saw before -- you could be
dialog: passing on the street -- you look at
text: each other and for a few seconds,
dialog: there's a kind of recognition. Like
dialog: you both know something. But then the
text: next moment the person's gone, and
dialog: it's too late to do anything about it,
dialog: but you remember it because it was
dialog: right there and you let it go, and you
dialog: think, "What if I had stopped and said
dialog: something?" It might happen only a
dialog: few times in your life.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Or once.
text: They look at each other a moment, then...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why don't we get out of here.
text: They both get up. The ad guys at the table watch as she follows
text: Foley to the elevator. Karen winks at them.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: As they ride down to Karen's room. She looks at him, looks
text: away. The doors open and they exit.
scene_heading: INT. HER HOTEL SUITE
text: As he follows her in. She walks to the bar, fixes them each a
text: drink. He checks out the room, takes in her view.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: How'd you find me?
text: He comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her
text: picture and shows it to her.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, God...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I called your room from downstairs.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If I had answered, what were you gonna
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Well, I'd say who I was and do you
dialog: remember me and ask if you'd like to
dialog: meet for a drink.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If I remembered you. I came looking
dialog: for you. I would've said sure, let's
dialog: do it. But for all you knew I could
text: show up with a SWAT team. Why would
dialog: you trust me?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It would be worth the risk.
text: She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You like taking risks.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: So do you.
text: He kisses her now, puts his arms around her.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What's the hurry, Jack? You have to
dialog: be somewhere?
text: She hands him his drink. They both drink, then...
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sooner or later...
text: She stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You really wear that suit.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: That's not what you were about to say.
text: She shrugs, lets it go. He puts down his drink, kisses her.
text: She lets him, then moves to the couch.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Remember how talkative you were? In
dialog: the trunk? Adele said you do that
dialog: when you're nervous.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: She did, huh.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, but in a nice way.
text: He sits down and they kiss again. This time she peels his jacket
text: off. He does the same with hers. He's starting to unbutton
dialog: her blouse when--
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (unbuttoning)
dialog: I might've smelled like a sewer, but
dialog: you could tell I was a gentleman.
dialog: They say John Dillinger was a pretty
dialog: nice guy.
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: He killed a police officer.
text: He stops. Looks at her.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I hear he didn't mean to. The cop
text: fell as Dillinger was aiming at his
text: leg and got him through the heart.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why not?
text: She looks at him, decides to get off this subject. Anyway he's
text: finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands
text: inside her shirt. She closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You know that Sig .380 you took was my
dialog: favourite. My father gave it to me.
text: As he kisses her on the neck.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you gonna do with me?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know. I hadn't worked that
dialog: part out yet. All I knew was that I
dialog: liked you, and I didn't want to leave
dialog: you there, never see you again.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You waved to me in the elevator.
text: She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I wasn't sure you caught that.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I couldn't believe it. I was thinking
dialog: of you by then, a lot, wondering what
dialog: it would be like if we did meet. Like
dialog: if we could take a time-out...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Really? I was thinking the same thing.
dialog: If we could call time and get together
dialog: for a while.
text: They look at each other a moment.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I saw you on the street.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: Outside Adele's.
text: He starts to kiss her again, but--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You were going to see her?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: To warn her about Chino.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: So she did help you?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't think we should get into that.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: No, you're right. Or Buddy. I won't
dialog: ask if he's with you or what you're
dialog: doing here in Detroit. Or if you've
text: run into Glenn Michaels yet.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Don't talk like that, okay? You scare
dialog: me.
text: And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Come on.
text: He gets up and she leads him across the room...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME
text: Jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to
text: take off his pants.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Are you gonna leave your tie on?
text: He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she
text: gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him,
text: standing close to help him with the tie...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: My God, look at you.
text: When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck
text: again and then as she turns off the light...
text: She kisses him. He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with
text: him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You having fun?
text: She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: CUT TO: KAREN
text: Eyes open, serious now.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
text: She's lying in Jack's arms. She looks at him a moment, then
text: moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You coming back?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm just going to the bathroom.
text: She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the
text: door. Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
text: She comes in. Looks at herself in the mirror. Suddenly
text: feels self-conscious. She grabs a bathrobe off the door.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME
text: Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the
text: ceiling. She comes out again and stands looking down at him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I want you to know something. I wasn't
dialog: looking for just a fuck, if that's
dialog: what you're thinking.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Why are you mad?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Or I did it for some kind of kinky
dialog: thrill. Score with a bank robber the
dialog: way some women go for rough trade.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What about <i>my</i> motive? Now I can say I
dialog: fucked a US Marshal. You think I
dialog: will?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I don't know.
text: He raises the covers, but she just stands there.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I know of a guy he goes in the bank
text: holding a bottle he says is
text: nitroglycerin. He scores some cash
text: off a teller, he's on his way out when
text: he drops the bottle. It shatters on
text: the tile floor, he slips in the stuff,
text: cracks his head and they've got him.
dialog: The nitro was canola oil. I know more
dialog: fucked-up bank robbers than ones that
dialog: know what they're doing. I doubt one
dialog: in ten can tell a dye pack when he
text: sees one. Most bank robbers are fucking
text: morons. To go to bed with a bank robber
dialog: for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd
dialog: have to be as dumb as they are. I
dialog: know you're not dumb, so why would I
dialog: think that? Why would <i>you</i> think I
dialog: might think that?
text: She comes over and sits down on the bed.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You're not dumb.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know about that. You can't do
dialog: three falls and think you have much of
text: a brain.
text: They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him. He senses
text: this, looks at her...
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You getting serious on me now?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm trying not to. I just wanna know
dialog: what's gonna happen.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know.
text: And he kisses her.
scene_heading: EXT. DETROIT - DAY
text: The sun is out. The snow has stopped falling. A white blanket
dialog: covers everything.
scene_heading: INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME
text: Karen opens her eyes, wakes up. She closes them again, lies
text: on her side, but doesn't move for a moment. Then...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.
text: She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back. She turns her head:
text: Foley's gone. She gets out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME
text: Karen comes into the room tying her robe. She looks at the
dialog: coffee table where...
text: Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and
text: the ice bucket. She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift"
dialog: from Foley: Her Sig-Sauer .38.
scene_heading: INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his
text: underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room-
text: service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: It took you, what, seven hours to buy
dialog: a pair of shoes?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I saw Karen Sisco.
text: Buddy turns to him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: And she saw you?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yes, she did.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So how's that work, a wanted felon
dialog: socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You know how I felt about her.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Did you give her a jump? If you did I
dialog: might begin to understand where your
dialog: head's at.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: It wasn't about getting laid. I just
dialog: wanted to know what might've happened
dialog: if things were different.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You find out?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, I did.
text: Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So what's that mean? That you're
dialog: disappointed by what you found or you're
dialog: sorry you robbed all those banks?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of
text: glasses. She reaches for the phone, dials. A moment later, we
text: hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT
text: A ring set up on stage. Men hang out on the side. Where movie
text: seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of
text: them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through
text: the theatre to the bar. Rap music booms out of speakers as
text: fighters are announced.
text: Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob
text: who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude
text: black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along
text: the apron of the stage.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Stick and jab, stick and jab!
text: White Boy Bob throws down a beer and gives Glenn's shoulder a jab.
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: You drink like a girl.
text: White Boy looks around to see if there are any other morons
text: sitting nearby who think it's funny. Kenneth comes through for
text: his pal and laughs.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - SAME
text: As Karen walks through the bar, pauses as she sees Glenn sitting
text: with White Boy and Kenneth. She steps back into the shadows as
text: Glenn glances anxiously about.
speaker_heading: ON GLENN
text: As he pushes his chair back.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I got to go take a piss.
text: He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White
text: Boy Bob. But before he can grab them...
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: What're you telling us for? You want
dialog: somebody to hold your little pecker?
text: Glenn gets up, sees his coat on the back of the chair, but knows
text: he can't take it with him. He walks away from the table.
scene_heading: EXT. STATE THEATER - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME
text: Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot.
text: Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN CAR - SAME TIME
text: Glenn behind the wheel, half lying on his right side as he tries
text: to rip open the locked glove compartment. His head jerks around
text: as Karen opens the door. He sits up straight as she gets in
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Glenn, are you trying to steal this
dialog: car?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Jesus, I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Another one of those days, huh, nothing
dialog: seems to go right?
text: He raises his empty hands.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I don't have the keys.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I see that.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I mean I'm not stealing the fucking
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You're not?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I already stole it. Last week or
dialog: whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't
dialog: be stealing it again, can I?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The two guys you were with -- that
dialog: one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it?
dialog: I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that
dialog: didn't look like him.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Jesus. How'd you know about Snoopy?
text: Karen looks at him, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Glenn, I know your life history, who
dialog: your friends are, where you've been
dialog: and now, it looks like, where you're
dialog: going. Put your hands on the wheel.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: You're gonna bust me for picking up a
dialog: car?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: For the car, for aiding and abetting a
text: prison escape, and conspiring to do
dialog: whatever you came here for.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Listen, these guys, they're gonna be
dialog: out here any minute looking for me.
dialog: They're fucking animals.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What's going on, Glenn?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck
dialog: outta here.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: But I thought the whole thing was your
dialog: idea?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but
dialog: these guys, man, they're into shit I
dialog: can't handle.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Ripley? You mean the wall street guy?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at
dialog: his office tomorrow, take him out to
dialog: his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I
dialog: don't give a shit what they do.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: And is Foley a part of this?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: He's supposed to be, but he hasn't
dialog: shown up yet, which is a good thing
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Maurice is gonna kill him, try and
dialog: collect the reward.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you say he hasn't shown up, you
dialog: think he backed out?
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I don't know-- he doesn't exactly
dialog: confide in me.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Gee, I wonder why not.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I'm freezing my ass off.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You want to get out of here, run, it'll
dialog: warm you up.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to
dialog: me...
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I know, you'll find me. Jesus, I
dialog: believe it. I keep thinking if you
dialog: hadn't driven me to federal court last
dialog: summer, you wouldn't even know who I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow
dialog: you'd be in jail or dead. Look at it
dialog: that way. Go on.
text: And he takes off. She sits there another moment, then flicks
text: her cigarette out the door, gets out the car.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME
text: Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people
text: leaving. A few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches
text: as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - SAME
text: Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come
text: down the aisle to their table.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Where you been? You miss the big boys,
text: come in time for the walkout fights.
dialog: Well, shit, you may as well pull up a
dialog: chair.
text: Foley and Buddy remain standing.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and
dialog: this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.
text: Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Who's sitting here?
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he
dialog: went to the men's about a while ago
dialog: and never came back.
text: Foley gives Buddy a look. White Boy Bob grins at them.
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
dialog: I think he must've fell in.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I sent these two looking for him, they
text: come back shaking their heads.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Well, if he left his coat and he's
dialog: been gone a while.
speaker_heading: WHITE BOY BOB
text: The car's still there. I looked.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (to the ring)
dialog: Reggie, push off and hit, man. Push
dialog: him off.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: We're leaving.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: The fuck you talking about?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn
dialog: is...
text: Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Look, what you worried about Glenn
dialog: for? What's he know?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I thought everything.
text: Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while
text: the other one takes wild swings and misses...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Glenn knows everything we suppose to
dialog: do tomorrow. Glenn could tell somebody
dialog: that, yeah, but it don't mean shit.
dialog: You understand? 'Cause Glenn don't
dialog: know I changed the plan.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It's happening tonight.
text: Foley looks at Maurice now.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Soon as we leave here. Stop home and
dialog: pick up what we need and go do it.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You got two minutes, that's all. Make
dialog: up your mind.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I wasn't asking permission.
text: Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy.
speaker_heading: FOLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: They want to go tonight, before Glenn
dialog: gets in any trouble, opens his big
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Whatta you wanna do?
text: Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know they gonna set us up.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I get that feeling, yeah.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: But you still think you can get the
dialog: diamonds fore they do?
text: Foley looks at him a moment, then...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I'll make you a deal. Get out of here.
dialog: Right now. I'll do the job with the
dialog: Snoop, meet you wherever you want and
dialog: give you half.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Half for doing what?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Getting me out of Glades for starters.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: And who watches your back?
speaker_heading: ON MAURICE
text: As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy
text: and Foley talk up at the bar.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Man has all that reward on his head
text: and still talks like a con in the yard.

speaker_heading: KENNETH

speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I don't have any idea.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Let's go upstairs, have a look at the
dialog: man's bedroom. All right now, you and
dialog: Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.
dialog: Look at the wall behind any pictures
text: hanging on it. Look at the walls in
text: the closets. The man has a safe, it's
dialog: gonna be up there somewhere.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: How about his place in Florida? If
dialog: you'd called, we could've checked his
dialog: walls down there before we left. That
dialog: is, if you'd checked to see where he
dialog: was. You follow me?
text: Maurice gives him a look, pulls the maid up the stairs. Kenneth
text: and White Boy Bob follow...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You set off any kind of alarm and you're

text: Kenneth puts his arm around the maid.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What's you name, mama?
text: He hooks a finger in the waist of her panties, pulls on the
text: elastic, is about to look in there when Maurice backhands him
text: across the face.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
text: First money, then pussy.
text: Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.
speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: MIDGE (O.S.)
dialog: This what you want?
text: Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe,
text: but more importantly, clutching the shotgun. Foley crosses and
text: takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when --
speaker_heading: MIDGE (CONT'D)
text: It's empty.
text: Foley just looks at her.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

speaker_heading: KAREN (OS)
dialog: Maurice--

scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME
text: As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS,
text: then a BODY FALL.
text: He stands still. Not sure who was just shot. After a long moment,
dialog: we then hear:
speaker_heading: KAREN (OS)
dialog: Jack?
text: He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: KAREN (OS) (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you're up there.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - SAME
text: As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down
text: over his face. He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his
text: pistol in another.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Come on, Jack -- don't.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Pretend I'm somebody else.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You think I'd shoot you?
text: Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun. AND NOW WE HEAR
text: THE SIRENS...
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: If you don't, one of those guys will.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What're you now, a desperado? Put the
text: guns down.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I told you, I'm not going back.
text: He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen,
text: but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or
dialog: look around.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Don't do this. Please.
text: They stand there staring at each other.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: No more time outs.
text: He raises the guns. She sadly shakes her head.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You win, Jack.
text: She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns,
text: grabbing hold of his right thigh. And now Cruz and several
text: other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop...
speaker_heading: CRUZ
dialog: Karen, I told you not to--
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Wait, I know him --okay?
text: She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently
text: lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You just did, for Christ sake.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You know what I mean.
text: She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish things were different. I'm
dialog: sorry, Jack.
text: Foley looks like he's in pain. He watches as she walks back
text: down the stairs. As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and
text: pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer.
speaker_heading: MIDGE
dialog: Richard!
text: She comes running down the stairs into his arms. They embrace.
text: He looks at Foley over her shoulder...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (sympathetic)
dialog: Listen, Jack...
dialog: (but then)
dialog: What'd you do with my diamonds?
text: Foley just looks at him.

scene_heading: INT. CAB - SAME
text: Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: The airport.
text: The cab pulls away. Buddy glances up front, then pulls the
text: Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up. There's a bit of
text: water in along with the diamonds. A tiny fish swims in the
text: water. Something about this makes Buddy smile as we...

scene_heading: EXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING
text: The sun is out. The sky is clear.
speaker_heading: KAREN (VO)
dialog: They don't know yet if they want to
dialog: bring him up on the homicides.
scene_heading: INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Karen on the phone. Her suitcase on the bed.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I doubt if they will. The Bureau's
dialog: put a detainer on him, so when they're
dialog: through with him here he'll go back to
dialog: Florida.
scene_heading: INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME
text: Marshall on the phone...
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: You gonna go get him?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: It's possible. Why?
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: I was just thinking... you could have
dialog: a nice time with him on the plane --
dialog: like picking up where your interlude,
dialog: or whatever you call it, left off.
text: And then throw him in the can.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: He knew what he was doing. Nobody
dialog: forced him to rob banks.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: My little girl, the tough babe.
text: Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: Where Foley stands staring out of his window.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Foley.
text: As Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway,
text: we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY
text: The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black
text: government van waits. The Marshal helps Foley inside.
speaker_heading: FEDERAL MARSHAL
dialog: Have a nice trip.
dialog: (looks OS)
dialog: I'll get the other one.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. VAN - SAME
text: As Foley sits down, stares at the floor. He looks depressed.
text: We hear the front door open, then close.
speaker_heading: KAREN (OS)
dialog: Jack?
text: He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that
text: separates the front from the back.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I got you a present, something for the
dialog: road.
text: She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate.
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to take it away, though, soon
text: as the ride's over.
text: Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once
text: more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with
text: a shaved head -- into the back of the van.
speaker_heading: FEDERAL MARSHAL
text: Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.
text: An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the
text: door then gets in up front with Karen.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: <i>Hejira?</i> What kinda name is that?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Islamic.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: What's it mean, "No Hair"?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed
dialog: from Mecca in 622.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: The flight?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: The brothers in Leavenworth gave me
dialog: the name.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You were at Leavenworth, huh?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: For a time.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Meaning time came, I left.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You busted out?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: I prefer to call it an exodus from an
dialog: undesirable place.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (interested now)
dialog: And how long was it before they caught
dialog: up with you?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: That time?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: There were others.
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Yeah. That was the ninth.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (really interested)
dialog: The ninth?
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Ten, you count the prison hospital in
dialog: Ohio I walked away from.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Hejira.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: And so now you're off to Glades.
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to
dialog: leave last night with the lady marshal,
dialog: but for some reason she wanted to wait.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (looks at Karen)
dialog: She did, huh.
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Cheaper I guess, take us both down in
text: one van.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought
dialog: we'd have a lot to talk about.
speaker_heading: HEJIRA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It's a long way down to Florida.
text: Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and
text: considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little
dialog: higher than when he first sat down, as we then...
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
