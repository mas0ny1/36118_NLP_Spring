scene_heading: INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE
text: COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to
text: shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves
text: OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: She throws water on her face as the music continues. She
text: looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.
text: She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.
text: The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she
text: smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS
text: is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see
text: much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's
dialog: important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the
text: following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Walter...time for school, honey.
dialog: 
text: She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.

dialog: It's cereal, it's supposed to be

dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the

text: and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in
text: her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to
text: an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that
text: only a few other kids have arrived.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: We're here, sweetie. Come on.
dialog: 
text: She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward
text: the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the
text: school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
text: Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room
text: is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy
text: wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening
text: and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
dialog: 
text: Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created
text: by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator
text: to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns
text: at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane
text: toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Okay Sandy, what's the prob--

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just

scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick
text: telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.
dialog: 
text: Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees
text: gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine
text: closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up,
text: we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows
text: indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.
dialog: 
text: She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again.
text: She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey, mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: So how was school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. We learned about dinosaurs,
dialog: and I got in a fight with Billy
dialog: Mankowski.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He hit me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Did you hit him back?
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Good. Rule number one: Never start
dialog: a fight, but always finish it. So
dialog: why did he hit you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because I hit him.
dialog: 
text: She stops, looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Wait...you hit him first?

dialog: Why?
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He said my dad ran off because he

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Your dad never even had a chance to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Then why did he leave?
dialog: 
text: Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Well, the same day you were born,
text: something else arrived. It came in
text: the mail, in a box just slightly
dialog: bigger than you. You know what was
dialog: in that box?
dialog: (he shakes head)
dialog: Something called responsibility.
dialog: Now, to some people, responsibility
dialog: is fun, it's what you live your
dialog: whole life for. Other people think
dialog: it's the scariest thing in the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So he ran away because he was scared
dialog: of what was in the box?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's dumb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: That's what I thought.
dialog: 
text: She turns and crouches down in front of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Walter, I decided a long time ago
dialog: that I would always tell you the
dialog: truth, that I would treat you like
dialog: a grown-up. I can't expect you to
dialog: respect me unless I respect you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've never lied to you. Your father
dialog: leaving had nothing to do with you,
dialog: and everything to do with what was

scene_heading: EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Did I miss Amos and Andy?

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I'm afraid so, sport. Come on now,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh. Am I too heavy for you to carry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Not for years yet, Walter. Not for

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. TARR
dialog: I am. Captain Jones said the boy

text: but within the realm of possibility.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What about the circumcision?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. TARR
dialog: Very likely his abductor thought it

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Look, doctor --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. TARR
dialog: As you can see, there's a perfectly

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Wouldn't I know whether or not he
dialog: was my son? I'm his mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. TARR
dialog: Which means you're in no position
dialog: to be objective. You are looking
text: through the prism of extreme emotion

speaker_heading: DR. TARR
dialog: Good boy. Quite right. But as you

dialog: all right. Now, I'm sure you know
dialog: Mrs. Collins here, and her son,
dialog: Walter. How many of you recognize
dialog: this young boy as Walter Collins?
dialog: 
text: He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply.
text: Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. TARR
dialog: Now, now, no need to be afraid.
dialog: Surely you knew Walter, and played
dialog: with him? So which of you can
dialog: identify Walter for me, for his
dialog: mother, and for the police? This
dialog: officer would want you to do the
dialog: right thing as good young citizens.
dialog: 
text: The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize

dialog: Northcott Ranch...oh yeah. You're

speaker_heading: YBARRA

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING
dialog: 
text: A long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHICKEN COOP
dialog: 
text: A few chickens inside, held back by wire. An ax is nearby,

dialog: 
dialog: CHANGELING A True Story 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
text: As suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house,
text: SLAMMING the door. Ybarra runs to the porch, tries the door.
text: Locked from the inside. He pounds on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YBARRA
dialog: This is the police. I have a warrant
dialog: for a minor named Sanford Clark.
text: Open the door and stand aside.
dialog: 
text: No reply. He braces himself and KICKS open the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place.
text: The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a

text: except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock.
text: There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances
text: into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world.
text: Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of
text: wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches
text: for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the
text: closet explodes outward and --
dialog: 
text: -- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking
text: him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on
text: the floor as Sanford tries to escape.
speaker_heading: YBARRA
dialog: Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your
dialog: face through the floor!
dialog: 
text: Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling. Ybarra
text: cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YBARRA
dialog: On your feet.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Sir, I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: The key, of course, is the context
dialog: in which words like this get used.
dialog: You have to do that in scrabble,
dialog: you know, when somebody challenges
dialog: a word...show how it's used in a
dialog: sentence. So "incompetent," as in --
dialog: (reads)
dialog: "A department so incompetent that

speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Captain, your handling of the Collins

speaker_heading: JONES

speaker_heading: DAVIS

speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Sir?
dialog: 
text: Davis turns back to him from the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: The Mayor wants this to go away. I
dialog: want this to go away. The way you
dialog: do that is to stop insisting that
dialog: Walter Collins was not among those

dialog: ranch. Because if the boy you
dialog: brought back isn't Walter Collins,
dialog: and he's not dead up at that ranch,

speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: The boy's been gone for nearly a

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going

dialog: 
text: With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOUNTIE
dialog: Screw this...I'm too old for this
dialog: fightin' shit....

dialog: 
text: -- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers
text: and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned
dialog: by Gordon.
dialog: 
text: As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: But he was identified, was he not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Yes, but...I guess I still can't
dialog: accept it. It doesn't feel real to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: It never does. I lost a daughter

dialog: not a day goes by I don't think, I

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I'm sorry. Please, sit.
dialog: 
text: They do as Christine looks to Briegleb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I've been on the phone all day with
dialog: the appointment secretary for the
dialog: police commission. They won't let
dialog: me testify at the hearing, or call
dialog: witnesses. They say it's not
dialog: necessary.
dialog: 
scene_heading: REV. BRIEGLEB
dialog: I know. My sources tell me the
dialog: police commission is going to come
text: out with a report that whitewashes
dialog: the whole thing. They're going to
dialog: say that Jones and the rest of the
dialog: LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,
dialog: that the real blame is with the
dialog: kid...and with you, for being
dialog: difficult and forcing them to put
dialog: you away for your own safety.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Then we'll just have to hire a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What's the charge, Chief?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF DAVIS
dialog: The charge is conduct unbecoming an
dialog: officer, and using improper and

dialog: It further charges that he exceeded
dialog: his authority as a police officer
text: by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on
dialog: the alleged charge of insanity

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR CRYER
dialog: I've heard this, yes. But since
dialog: one of the main purposes of such a

dialog: be to suspend Captain Jones, and
dialog: since that action has now been taken,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Hey...I saw you in the papers. You

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Not guilty, your honor.
dialog: 
text: He glances back at his audience. The bailiff rights him again.

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: In light of the defendant's penchant

dialog: We then instituted a nationwide

dialog: he admitted to being Walter Collins,

dialog: Yes. She denied his identity in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: But as subsequent events have
dialog: demonstrated, she was correct. So
dialog: what prompted you to send her for
dialog: psychological evaluation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Whether or not this was in fact the
dialog: correct boy was not relevant to my
dialog: decision. Throughout this period,
dialog: she acted strangely. She was often
text: cool, aloof and unemotional,
dialog: especially when presented with the
dialog: boy we located in De Kalb, and in
dialog: our subsequent conversations. It
dialog: was because of her disturbing
dialog: behavior that I submitted her for
dialog: observation to the psychopathic
dialog: ward of Los Angeles County General
dialog: Hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Just like that. You snap your

speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Every home in this state is in grave

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't

speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Yes, so it would appear. The bottom

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: That's correct. There was no need
dialog: to serve the warrant since she was
text: at that time already in custody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Let me see if I have this straight.
text: A woman was thrown into the

dialog: Technically...yes.
dialog: 
text: More murmuring from the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Extraordinary steps were necessary
dialog: because we were dealing with an
dialog: extraordinary situation! Is it our
dialog: fault that we were being deceived
dialog: by the boy who claimed to be Walter
dialog: Collins? No. In light of his claims
dialog: and her behavior, who wouldn't begin
dialog: to wonder if there was something
dialog: wrong with her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Because she questioned you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Because she wouldn't listen, because
dialog: she insisted on being obstinate and
dialog: taking matters into her own hands
dialog: best left to qualified officers,
dialog: because --

speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: Because she was fighting for the

dialog: 
text: This silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin
text: drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAHN
dialog: And in the end, that's what happened,
dialog: isn't it? At some point, while all
dialog: this was going on, Walter Collins

speaker_heading: GORDON
text: The hangings. Ten o'clock tonight,
text: I get to see what's inside. I hear
dialog: there's thirteen steps going up to
dialog: the gallows...'cause thirteen is
dialog: unlucky. Helps make sure you're
dialog: gonna go to hell when you die. But
dialog: I got 'em beat. I outsmarted 'em.
dialog: 
text: He looks to Christine, smiles nervously, glances back out the
dialog: window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: They're gonna let me have whatever
dialog: I want for dinner. Got a steak
text: coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes
dialog: and green beans. I always wondered
dialog: why they did that whole last meal
dialog: thing. One of the other guys on
dialog: Death Row said when you take the
dialog: drop, you foul yourself, and
dialog: everything you ate...comes out the
dialog: other end. So maybe that's why
dialog: they make sure you got something in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sure you don't got a cigarette?
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head. He nods absently for a moment.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a
dialog: good guy. He's writing a book about
dialog: all the death sentences he's carried
dialog: out in this place. Says it's called
dialog: "Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women."
dialog: Beats my record all to hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Mr. Northcott...you asked me to

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Did you kill him? Did you kill my

scene_heading: INT. EXECUTION AREA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is

dialog: 
text: Several other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in

dialog:

speaker_heading: WARDEN
dialog: Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
dialog: been found guilty of murder, the
dialog: penalty for which is death by

dialog: or reprieves, therefore the execution
dialog: will go forward as stipulated under
dialog: the laws of the State of California.
dialog: Do you have any last words?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: No...nothing.
dialog: (to chaplain)
dialog: I kept clean after I confessed,
dialog: reverend...just like I said I would.
dialog: 
text: The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Will it...will it hurt?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Please...not so fast...don't make
dialog: me walk so fast!
dialog: 
text: They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the
text: last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs
text: together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Thirteen steps...thirteen steps...
dialog: but I didn't touch all of 'em, you
dialog: bastards...I didn't touch all of
dialog: 'em!
dialog: 
text: They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure
text: the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: A prayer! Please, somebody, say a
dialog: prayer for me!
dialog: 
text: The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner
text: approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden
text: looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in
text: a terrified, shaking voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Silent night...holy night...all is
dialog: calm...all is bright...round yon
dialog: virgin mother and child...holy infant
dialog: so tender and mild --

text: slowing...slowing...until it finally stops.
dialog: 
text: Christine covers her eyes. There is no cheering in the witness
text: room. Only the sound of weeping.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SAN QUENTIN - NIGHT

dialog: Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: When we get out, we split up, go in
dialog: different directions, they can't
dialog: catch all of us. Ready?

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: Pull!
dialog: 
text: They do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the

dialog: pulling...then suddenly --
dialog: 
text: -- the corner FALLS AWAY, part of the roof starting to come

speaker_heading: JEFFREY

dialog:

text: running their way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hurry!
dialog: 
text: Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the
text: coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first

speaker_heading: YBARRA
dialog: What happened after that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hid in the woods for two days,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was afraid! I thought they'd
dialog: come after me, or my folks...so I
dialog: didn't tell anybody. I was on my

dialog: this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told
dialog: her I was an orphan, on my own.
dialog: She said I could stay on, and...I
dialog: did.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Every night, I'd wake up, thinking
dialog: they were right outside my window.

dialog: I can't go back now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YBARRA
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Since I didn't tell anybody what
dialog: happened, I was afraid they'd blame

dialog: just...stayed away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YBARRA
dialog: So what made you come forward now,
dialog: after all this time?

dialog: You don't think he's still out there,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Why not? Three boys made a run for

dialog: got out, maybe either or both of
dialog: the others did too. Maybe Walter
dialog: went through the same fears he did.
dialog: Afraid to come home or identify
