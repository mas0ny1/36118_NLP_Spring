scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE YORKSHIRE MOORLAND LATE AFTERNOON
text: The WOMAN HIKER seen from the back climbs out of the stream

text: She runs over it and disappears into the melancholy
dialog: countryside.
text: MIX THROUGH TO the next scene.
scene_heading: EXT, YORKSHIRE VILLAGE HIGH STREET DUSK

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION EVENING
text: A POLICE SERGEANT sits at a desk. The HIKER, again seen
text: from the back, rushes up to him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN HIKER
dialog: Murder! ... Murder! ...You must come
text: at once! There's a woman lying dead
dialog: out at Marley Copse. I think she's
dialog: been strangled.
scene_heading: EXT. YORKSHIRE MOORLAND NIGHT
text: A HIGH SHOT of a police car racing through the countryside.
text: It is driven by a POLICE CONSTABLE. Next to him is the
text: POLICE SURGEON. Two figures are dimly perceived sitting in
text: the back seat. One is the WOMAN HIKER. The other is
text: helmeted. We hear their conversation, but never go inside
text: the car, or get a clear view of the features of the WOMAN.
dialog: 6
dialog: Continued
speaker_heading: POLICE SERGEANT
dialog: Now madam, what time did you say it
dialog: was when you found the body?
speaker_heading: WOMAN HIKER
dialog: About a quarter past four ... I think
dialog: she'd only just been killed.
speaker_heading: POLICE SERGEANT
dialog: How did you know that? Did you see
dialog: anybody hanging about?
speaker_heading: WOMAN HIKER
text: No. But she was still warm.
text: The car races away from CAMERA, over the Moors.
scene_heading: EXT. MARLEY COPSE NIGHT
text: A torch breaks the darkness and lights up the distorted face
text: of ALICE CORRIGAN. The strangled body lies in deepish bracken
text: Beside it kneels a POLICE SURGEON.
speaker_heading: POLICE SURGEON
dialog: Let's see, It's now six o'clock.
dialog: I'd say she'd been dead no more than
dialog: two hours. Say four o'clock, as the
dialog: outside for time of death.
speaker_heading: POLICE SERGEANT
dialog: The young woman said she was still warm
dialog: when she found her at four fifteen sir.
speaker_heading: POLICE SURGEON
dialog: Well, so she would have been. Warm
dialog: as toast.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF THE TROJAN INSURANCE COMPANY DAY
text: A SENIOR EXECUTIVE of the Trojan Insurance Company sits at his

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Hercules Parrot, sir.
text: The SECRETARY withdraws as HERCULE POIROT enters. He carries

text: on the other side of the desk.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Good morning Monsieur Poirot. Please
dialog: take a seat,
dialog: Continued
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Bon Jour Monsieur.
text: He sits in the proffered seat as the EXECUTIVE regains his
dialog: own chair.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Well, I hope you have some good news
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Alas no. I regret that I can find
dialog: nothing in these reports to justify
dialog: my re-investigating this case for you.
dialog: It is dll perfectly clear from the
dialog: police reports. I know Mrs Alice
dialog: Corrigan insured her life with your
text: company, in her husband's favour, and
dialog: that, he was the only person with a
dialog: motive for killing her, but when it
dialog: comes down to the copper tacks, he could
dialog: not possibly have done so. Clearly on
dialog: the evidence, the lady was murdered
dialog: between four o'clock and four fifteen,
text: when the body was found at Marley Copse.
dialog: From two o'clock to four twenty, Mr
dialog: Edward Corrigan was seen by at least half
text: a dozen people to be on a train coming
dialog: up from London. And the railway station
dialog: was a good fifteen minutes walk from
dialog: Marley Copse. Non, it is, parbleu, one
dialog: of those rare cases where the Insurance
dialog: Company must, aS you say, laugh and
dialog: lump it. .
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Well if that's your view Monsieur Poirot,
dialog: then I suppose we'll have to er - do
dialog: just that. I must say I'm not surprised.
text: The evidence is most conclusive. Still
dialog: we had hoped ...
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: For a miracle? Alas it is not possible.
dialog: 4s is most often the case in les affaires
dialog: criminelles, the facts are exactly as
dialog: they appear to be. I wish you good day,
dialog: Monsieur.
text: POIROT rises, bows and departs, leaving the folder of papers

scene_heading: INT. THE BAR OF THE JOLLY ROGER HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON
text: DAPHNE CASTLE, a flamboyant fortyish ex-courtesan, now
text: proprietress of the Jolly Roger Hotel stands in the bar
text: straightening her hair, and generally putting the finishing

text: summer's evening. She looks out of the bottle glass windows

text: DAPHNE CASTLE reacts with satisfaction.
scene_heading: EXT. ROWING BOAT LATE AFTERNOON
text: BILL the Boatman is rowing three guests across from the Main-
text: land. He is a typical Salt. In the boat are MR and MRS
text: ODELL GARDENER, an American couple from New York. She is
text: large, with blue rinsed hair and diamante spectacles worn on
text: a chain. He is thin, tall, slightly stooped and legalistic,
text: with a scrawny neck topped by a turtle shaped head. The
text: last occupant of the boat is MISS AGNES BREWSTER, an
text: athletic, middle~aged spinster, who cloaks her vulnerability
text: under a gruff manner.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: (looking towards the Island)
dialog: Ah! Smugglers’ Island! My, doesn't
dialog: it look romantic. I can just see
dialog: Warner Baxter and Elissa Landi in
dialog: a movie, set here, can't you Odell?
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: Yes dear.
dialog: 13
dialog: Continued
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: It would have to be something; like the
dialog: kidnapping of a Sheik's daughter by a
dialog: brigand of the sea ... Oriental Pride
text: yields to Piratical kisses in a duel
text: of male might and female charm. An
text: exotic drama of love's sublime cruelty.
text: She sighs rapturously.
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: I believe they have already used those
dialog: particular phrases to describe the motion
dialog: picture "In Her Arms" dear, though I
dialog: pelieve on that occasion they were
dialog: Parisian kisses to which Oriental Pride
dialog: yielded.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Well never mind about that Odell. In
dialog: the Jolly Roger Hotel it would darn well
text: yield to a Pirate's busses.
dialog: (to Miss Brewster)
dialog: We're Myra and Odell Gardener by the
dialog: way. From New York City.
text: MR and MRS GARDENER extend their hands. MISS BREWSTER shakes
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: How do you do, I'm Agnes Brewster.
dialog: I hope you are enjoying your holiday.
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: It's been just great. We've been doing
scene_heading: England. MISS BREWSTER
dialog: And have you done it?
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: Sure. Canterbury Cathedral. The Crown
dialog: Jewels, Lords Croquet Ground, though
dialog: those gentlemen weren't playing the
dialog: day we were there - you know the whole
dialog: box of tricks. But enough is enough.
dialog: Last week I said to Mr Kelso at
dialog: Cooks, sight seeing is all very well,
dialog: but all I want now is to get to some
dialog: quiet spot in the Mediterranean and
dialog: just relax. Mind you, I said not just
dialog: anywhere. Oh no. It had to be sanitary.
dialog: A cousin of Odell's went to a place in
dialog: Wales last year where they only had an
dialog: earth closet. Isn't it so Odell?

dialog: Continued
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: Two earth closets I think it was, dear.
dialog: One for the guests and one for the
dialog: servants. Mind you, I believe it was
dialog: very picturesque.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Picturesque or not, you'd think at
dialog: least they'd have been able to provide
text: the paying customers with a water closet.
dialog: (to Miss Brewster)
dialog: You British sometimes take this Olde
dialog: Worlde charm to quite ludicrous lengths.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: It's just that we don't believe in
dialog: pampering ourselves that's all. It's
dialog: my belief that all that central heating
dialog: you have in America saps the energy of
dialog: the nation, aside from being extremely
dialog: bad for the complexion, It encourages
text: -acne in the young, and craters in the
dialog: not so young.
dialog: (to Bill the Boatman)
dialog: Come along Boatman, dig those oars in!
dialog: Pull with a will!
text: BILL gives her a sour look and rows even more lethargically
dialog: than he has been doing.
text: MIX THROUGH TO the next scene.
text: THE TERRACE OF THE JOLLY ROGER HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON
text: DAPHNE CASTLE stands on the terrace of the Jolly Roger Hotel

text: steps from the tiny harbour to the hotel carrying baggage.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: I am Dapline Castle, let me welcome
dialog: you to Smugglers' Island. I do hope
dialog: you'll be most comfortable here.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER

dialog: Earth closets! What can you possibly
dialog: mean Miss Brewster?

speaker_heading: MR GARDENER

dialog: indigenous to the United States
dialog: of America, Mrs Castile.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: (to Mrs Gardener)
dialog: I'm sure you will find all the loos
dialog: here perfectly adequate Mrs Gardener.
dialog: We even bave bidets in all the bath-
dialog: rooms, If you will please follow me.
text: DAPHNE CASTLE moves off towards the hotel, followed by
scene_heading: MISS BREWSTER.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: I tend to believe that bidets are
text: basically un-American, Odell. Still
dialog: I suppose we'll have to put up with
dialog: them.
text: The GARDENERS follow the others towards the Hotel.
scene_heading: EXT. ROWING BOAT LATE AFTERNOON
text: BILL rows his boat towards Smugglers’ Island. It contains
text: MR BLATT, a jolly, coarse, life-and-soul-of-the-party, self-
text: made man, and PATRICK REDFERN and his wife CHRISTINE REDFERN.
text: He is a good looking young Irishman, fair-haired, and
text: athletic. She is fair skinned, pleasant looking in a
text: somewhat washed-out way. They are sitting in a reserved
text: silence. MR BLATT inevitably decides to start the ball
dialog: rolling.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Well, well, well! Might as well
dialog: break the ice. Blatt's the name.
dialog: Horace Blatt. Beef or mutton. L
dialog: for leather. Aphorism. Tea for two,

speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: I say, I say, I say. How do you
dialog: make an Irishman burn his ear?
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Ring him up when he's ironing. It
dialog: wasn't very funny when I first heard
dialog: it five years ago.
text: MR BLATT, crushed, looks away towards the Island.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR AND VIEW OF BEDROOMS EVENING
text: The two servants BERT and CHARLIE are putting the luggage in

dialog: pissyboos?
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Quite right. -
text: CHRISTINE shoots her husband a venomous look.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Yes, when fate cast me up here on
dialog: this old rock, I said to myself people
dialog: are going to have fun in a crazy old
dialog: English atmosphere even though it's
dialog: in the Med. So you'll find the
dialog: servants are all English and properly
dialog: trained, and there's lots of games
dialog: to play and of course there's great
dialog: grub.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Ah now we're talking. Most English
text: hotels fall down in that department.
text: Cold mutton and cabinet pudding are
dialog: not my idea of holiday nourishment.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: I don't think you'll find that either
dialog: dish features on darling Andrea's
dialog: menus. Let's face it, he is almost the
dialog: greatest saucier in the Aegean. I say
dialog: almost, because he does have a slightly

dialog: be the mistress of King Zog of Albania,
dialog: and when he married he gave her this
dialog: island.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN (V.0.)
dialog: Provided she kept away, I suppose.
dialog: Generous fellow.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: Wise fellow. Wives don't much like
dialog: girl friends hanging around the place -
dialog: or didn't you know that either?
text: PATRICK REDFERN walks into the room, wearing only a swimming
text: costume. and carrying his robe. We note his fine physique.
text: There is a moment of tension between them.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Yes, I had noticed. Toodle doo.
text: He leaves the room jauntily. CHRISTINE looks after him
text: speculatively then moves to the window to look out. Her

scene_heading: EXT. THE SMALL HARBOUR EVENING
text: We see the harbour from CHRISTINE REDFERN's point of view

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Gawd bless you sir. It's calmer

dialog: and you pushed me in in my best dress?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Absolutely. And you flew into the most
dialog: frightful rage, and half choked me to
dialog: death,
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Not me, It's impossible. The only
dialog: attack I've ever made on anyone was
dialog: when I threw my spaghetti alla yongole
text: at Mussolini for trying to grope
dialog: me under the table in the Vatican.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: What rot! You used to fly into the
dialog: most fearful rages in those days.
dialog: We all had to watch our ps and qs
dialog: a bit. Ah here comes Arlena now ...
text: ARLENA MARSHALL enters the room. She is dramatically
text: attired and gorgeous to look at. Conversation ceases on the
text: instant as all eyes turn towards her. PATRICK REDFERN
text: takes a few steps in her direction, his arms outstretched,
text: and we freeze the picture. A series of quick cuts
dialog: establish the company's reactions.
text: SLOW MIX THROUGH to the next scene.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TERRACE ABOVE THE BATHING BEACH MORNING
text: HERCULE POIROT arrayed in a white duck suit lies in a deck
text: chair surveying the sunlit scene below. Sunbathing on the
text: beach are MR and MRS REDFERN (the latter in the shade of an
scene_heading: umbrella), HORACE BLATT, KENNETH MARSHALL and LINDA MARSHALL
text: and MR and MRS GARDENER. DAPHNE CASTLE is swimming.
text: MISS BREWSTER sits beside POIROT on the terrace.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: I understand you are a very distinguished
dialog: detective Monsieur Poirot.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: People have been felicitous enough
dialog: to have told me that I have some slight
dialog: skill in that metier, Madame.
dialog: 16
dialog: 22 Continued
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: I do hope we 're not going to have any
text: bodies on Smugglers' Island.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Let me assure you Madame I am here
dialog: simply to spend the holiday. I do
dialog: not even think of crime. And yet as
dialog: to bodies, what are they?
text: He points down to the beach below.
text: Regard them there lying out in rows
text: like corpses in the morgue. They are
dialog: not men and women. There is nothing
dialog: personal about them. They are just
text: bodies, like butchers' meat on Slabs.
text: Chunks of flesh grilling in the sun.
dialog: When I was young one barely saw even
dialog: the ankle.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: I must say though that I think the
dialog: things we wear nowadays are much more
dialog: sensible. The air must be allowed to
text: circulate freely round the body.
dialog: A healthy mind in a healthy body,
dialog: that's my motto and I keep mine healthy
dialog: rowing.
text: POIROT looks down self-consciously at his expansive paunch.
text: MISS BREWSTER notices.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: You'd soon have that off if you rowed
dialog: Monsieur Poirot.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mademoiselle I detest boats. I have
dialog: the mal de mer. Even my bath gives me
dialog: sea sickness.
text: On the beach we see CHRISTINE REDFERN get up from under her
text: umbrella,.and start to walk up the steps towards the hotel.
text: PATRICK REDFERN goes down the beach to swim. The CAMERA
text: ZOOMS in for a moment to isolate him as he plunges in and
text: starts to swim, using a powerful crawl stroke.
dialog: 22 Continued
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: (half Voice Over Patrick
dialog: Redfern swimming and half
dialog: direct speech)
dialog: How unfortunate. I suppose it's a bit
dialog: like heights. Some people can't stand
dialog: them. I'm not very good myself, but
dialog: Mrs Redfern is far worse. Why only
dialog: this morning on the cliff path above
text: Keelhaul Caves, she turned giddy
dialog: and simply clung to me, quite unable to
dialog: move.
dialog: 17
text: CHRISTINE REDFERN comes up to the group. Her skin noticeably
dialog: very white,
dialog: Hullo dear. We were just talking
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: It's a wonder my ears weren't burning.
text: Everywhere else does, so easily.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You don't like the sunbathing, Madame?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: I only wish I could but I don't go
dialog: brown. I just become like a cassata ~
text: pink skin, white blisters, and green
text: in the face.
text: Polite laughter while she puts on her robe.
dialog: Isn't it blissful here. So tranquil.
dialog: So far away from all trouble and
dialog: violence.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: It is true the sky is blue, and the
dialog: sun shines, but you forget Madame,
text: everywhere there is evil under the sun.
text: ARLENA MARSHALL walks down from the hotel to the beach,
text: passing the group. She is very suntanned, and wears a back-
text: less white bathing suit. On her head she wears a fantastic
text: Chinese hat of jade green cardboard. She moves with superb
text: assurance and the whole effect is rather like a stage entrance.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Ah, Madame Marshall! What was her
dialog: stage name?

speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Arlena Stuart.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Oh yes. I saw her in Come and Go
dialog: a couple of years ago at the Alhambra,
dialog: It was trés charmant. Did you ever
dialog: see her Mademoiselle?
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: I was employed by her once, and she
dialog: is not charmant Monsieur Poirot,
dialog: believe me. She's poisonously
text: rotten through and through.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Is it possible, Mademoiselle?
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: Yes. I was her secretary for over
dialog: five years. I tell you she can be a
dialog: remorseless fiend. She wants every-
dialog: thing for herself. She'll give
dialog: nothing to anybody else ~- no references,
dialog: no help. And she'll-.use any device
dialog: to prevent you telling the truth about
dialog: her.
scene_heading: EXT. BOOTY BEACH MORNING
text: ARLENA MARSHALL has reached the beach, and stands irresolutely
text: looking about her. PATRICK REDFERN swims back to the beach
text: with powerful, flamboyant strokes, as if drawn towards her
text: by a magnet.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TERRACE ABOVE THE BATHING BEACH MORNING
scene_heading: The group of POIROT, MISS BREWSTER and CHRISTINE REDFERN
text: is as it was before in Scene 22.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: What you say is truly shocking
dialog: Mademoiselle. Don't you think so
dialog: Madame Redfern?
text: CHRISTINE REDFERN gets to her feet and waves to her husband.
text: In the distance we see him pause, then ignore the wave, and
text: deliberately walk off with ARLENA MARSHALL down the beach.
text: Abruptly. CHRISTINE REDFERN turns and leaves the terrace,

speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER

dialog: of the small harbour.
text: Slowly POIROT shakes his head.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mais oui. Undoubtedly there is the
dialog: smell of evil here.
text: POIROT struggles out of the deck chair and strolls down the
text: steps towards the beach.
scene_heading: EXT. BOOTY BEACH MORNING
text: DAPHNE CASTLE comes out of the sea. Her bathing suit is
text: outstandingly chic. Her gaze is alternating between
text: KENNETH MARSHALL who is lying next to his daughter on the
text: sand taking the sun, and ARLENA MARSHALL and PATRICK REDFERN
text: who are sitting and talking further down the beach, as
text: POIROT strolls up to her.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Good morning Mademoiselle. What a
text: charming costume.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Why thank you Monsieur Poirot.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: The bathing costume can be so un-
dialog: flattering n'est ce pas?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: (looking at Arlena)
dialog: It is my opinion that ninety eight
dialog: percent of all the people in this
dialog: world should never put one on.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mrs Marshall of course being one of
dialog: the remaining two percent.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Obviously. It's one of a couple of
dialog: activities she does to perfection.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: The other being?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Adultery.
dialog: 20
dialog: 25 Continued
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: So you think your old friend of
dialog: seventeen years ago has made the
dialog: mistake in marrying her eh?
text: She shoots him a shrewd look.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: A mistake? It's a silver plated,
text: copper bottomed, gilt-edged, disaster.
dialog: Still it probably suits him. He
dialog: always was a collector of lame ducks.
speaker_heading: POIROT
text: She doesn't look much like le canard
dialog: poiteux, to me.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Ob you don't understand. He married
dialog: his first wife simply because no one
dialog: elise would have her, and when she
dialog: died he upped and married that shop-
dialog: worn piece of fluff when she was
text: jilted by Lord Coddington after being
text: cited in his divorce.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Well perhaps Mademoiselle, she makes
dialog: him the good wife.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Good wives, as they say in Italy,
dialog: do not grow horns on their husbands'
dialog: heads. Why only last year that
dialog: randy old fool Sir George Barry left
dialog: her every penny of his money, -
dialog: about one hundred thousand pounds by
dialog: all account - enough to keep her
dialog: in single chins for life and I tell
dialog: you, she didn't get that for her racing
text: tips. Now it looks as if she's got her
text: claws into Patrick Redfern, and that
dialog: poor wife of his hasn't the faintest
dialog: idea of how to remove them. It's a
dialog: pity really, but in the end I suppose
dialog: all ladies have to learn to defend
dialog: what they want. Don't you agree
dialog: Monsieur Poirot.
text: She smiles at POIROT mischievously and walks off along the
text: beach to join KENNETH MARSHALL, POIROT looks after her
text: thoughtfully. He sees LINDA MARSHALL get up and run down
text: the beach towards where PATRICK REDFERN and ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: 25
dialog: 21
dialog: Continued
text: are talking. Slowly he walks in the same direction. MR
text: BLATT comes splashing up from the sea, in a loud striped
text: bathing suit which makes him look like a corpulent wasp,
text: and intercepts POIROT.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
text: He roars
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Good morning Monsieur P. I see
dialog: they won't get you in the briny in
text: a hurry.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Non. I have never cared for la
dialog: mer.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Well I suppose you can't teach an
dialog: old frog new tricks eh?
text: laughs uproariously. HERCULE POIROT is scandalized.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: An old frog? ... What can this mean?
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Frog ... Froggie ... You know -
dialog: Frenchman.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: I am not old, and I am not a
dialog: Frenchman.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Monsieur, I am a Belgian.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: I beg pardon. I thought they were
dialog: all the same, vieux haricot.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Vieux haricot - Old Bean - get it?
text: with laughter again, towelling himself vigorously
text: as he does so. POIROT nods in mystification.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Care to join me for a pre-lunch
dialog: livener?
dialog: 25
dialog: 22

text: POIROT still looks bemused, so MR BLATT mimes the action of
dialog: drinking.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Ah l'aperitif. Une bonne idee,
text: Before turning back towards the hotel, POIROT looks down the
text: beach to where LINDA has joined her step-mother and PATRICK
text: REDFERN about thirty yards away. The CAMERA ZOOMS in to join
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: {to Linda)
dialog: What the hell are you doing here Linda?
dialog: Did your father send you to play goose-
dialog: berry, chaperon, or spy?
speaker_heading: LINDA MARSHALL
dialog: (panting)
dialog: I thought I'd just come for a chat
dialog: Arlena. I don't seem to be having
dialog: any fun.
speaker_heading: ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: Well why don't you go back to the
dialog: hotel, dahling, and write out five
dialog: hundred times, I must try not to look
dialog: so abysmally dowdy, and if you take
dialog: your own advice you may just get to
dialog: have some.
text: LINDA flees awkwardly away down the beach towards where
text: POIROT and MR BLATT are starting their walk towards the
text: swimming pool bar. She is sobbing and cursing under her
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: (to Patrick Redfern)
dialog: Really, that girl runs like a diseased
dialog: dromedary.
text: The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK to its previous position. As she
text: passes POIROT and MR BLATT we hear distinctly what she is
dialog: saying.
speaker_heading: LINDA MARSHALL
dialog: The bitch! ... I could kill her! ...
dialog: I could kill her!
text: POIROT shakes his head at MR BLATT who looks away in

dialog: with her?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Arlena of course, She does make you
dialog: look a bit cheapyboos.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: I suppose she does. Still I can cope
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Do you think Linda can?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Well, she's always on at the child,
text: bitching the hell out of her.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Yes. It's a pity about that. Linda's
text: like her mother. She takes things hard.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Then why not do something about it?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Like what for instance?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Like fixing up a divorce for instance.
dialog: People do it all the time you know -
dialog: with most of my friends it's almost
dialog: a full time occupation.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Not with me. A deal's a deal. I
dialog: don't approve of quick marriage and

speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: Look at that. Still up to her old

speaker_heading: ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: Dahling, I swear to you it was the

dialog: really. You wouldn't tell me even
dialog: if you were down 'ere on a job, would
dialog: you now?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Possibly not, but I assure you it is
dialog: not the case. And as for you, I could
dialog: ask you the same question. I wouldn't
dialog: have thought these people here were
dialog: your tasse de the.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: You're right there. Bloody stand-

scene_heading: EXT. BOOTY BEACH MORNING
text: Booty Beach is empty save for ARLENA MARSHALL who is trying

text: POIROT appears and stands watching her,
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Do you require assistance, Madame?
text: ARLENA MARSHALL gives him one of her seductive looks.
speaker_heading: ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: Oh Monsieur Poirot, would you?
dialog: I'm afraid it's a bit too heavy
dialog: for me.
text: POIROT walks down to the water's edge, but stops when he
text: realises he is wearing white suede shoes. Gingerly he removes
text: them, and puts them carefully with his socks, several feet
text: beyond the tide mark. He then meticulously rolls up his
text: trousers to the knees and walks into the sea. The float is
text: successfully launched, and ARLENA MARSHALL, holding her
text: paddle, jumps on it.
speaker_heading: ARLENA MARSHALL
dialog: Thank you so much and Monsieur Poirot,

text: at the point which the float has just rounded.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: The top of the morning to you.
dialog: You seem to have given your shoes
text: a bath.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Alas it is so.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: You know you want to use a wire brush

text: He laughs delightedly. POIROT scowls.- After a moment or

scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Hullo, hullo, hullo. Been taking
dialog: your shoes for a swim?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: (gritting his teeth)
text: An unfortunate wave.
text: KENNETH MARSHALL saunters off down to the sea. Behind the
text: back of the unamused POIROT we see and hear MR and MRS

text: eagerly, but is obviously disappointed.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: And where is Madame Redfern this
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Who? ... Oh I don't know, I think

speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER

speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: A friend of ours did something like

dialog: Eileen Scholenblautwitz, Odell? Her
dialog: old man gave her a watch for their
dialog: wedding anniversary that must have
dialog: cost a couple of arms and a leg, and
text: she went into the water with it. When
dialog: she came out she found of course that
dialog: it wasn't working. Do you remember what
dialog: she said? "The Godammed thing's stopped
dialog: at eleven diamonds past three rubies".
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: I thought it was in the morning dear,
dialog: and she said "three rubies past eleven
dialog: diamonds."
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: It was in the afternoon Odell, and she
dialog: said "eleven diamonds past three rubies",
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: I'm sure you're right dear.
text: We watch KENNETH MARSHALL swimming. He does it well,
text: disappearing under the surface of the water for longish
text: periods. A BRIEF MIX indicates a small time change.
text: Finally he walks up the beach.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: Hi there Captain Marshall! Where's
dialog: Linda this morning?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Linda? ... I don't know. Mooning
dialog: about the Island somewhere I expect.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: You know that girl looks kinda peaky
dialog: to me. You ought to give her some of
dialog: that Virol. They say anaemic girls
dialog: need it. I*ve seen it on the hoardings.

text: KENNETH MARSHALL walks away up the beach towards the hotel.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: If you want my opinion, it's that
dialog: step-mother of hers that's doing her
dialog: no good. We knew an only child once
dialog: whose father married again, didn't
dialog: we Odell - remember Gloria
text: Stuhlnichsteiner. She grew hair all
text: over her bosom.
text: We hear the sound of someone approaching, and PATRICK REDFERN
text: looks up hopefully, obviously to see if it is ARLENA MARSHALL
text: and then down again sulkily, as we see it is MISS BREWSTER.
text: He rises abruptly and starts to walk up and down the beach.

dialog: grey cells,
text: She laughs.
dialog: And you Madame, - have you had your
dialog: swim this morning?
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: Oh yes I had one about ten o'clock.
dialog: In fact I was lucky to survive.

speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: What a dangerous thing to do. Odell
dialog: do you remember the Angelsturmer kid
dialog: who got concussion right there in Mid
dialog: town Manhattan, from a can of tooth-

speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: Are you sure it wasn't toilet cleanser,
dialog: dear. I had the distinct impression
dialog: that that little Dutch girl on the can
dialog: came into it somewhere ...
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: Toothpaste!
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: Concussion you say, from a tooth-

dialog: difficult to believe.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: It fell from a forty fifth floor

speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: Where's Mrs Marshall this morning?
text: POIROT shrugs elaborately.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: I haven't seen her, But Mr Redfern
dialog: sure looks mighty put out.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: Yes he does, but it's Captain Marshall
dialog: I really feel sorry for. He's such
dialog: & quiet man - always so composed, but
text: I'll bet he's actually seething inside.
text: The CAMERA joins PATRICK REDFERN, now some distance away from
text: the group of MR and MRS GARDENER, MISS BREWSTER and HERCULE
text: POIROT. He saunters around aiming vicious swipes at limpets
text: and crabs, with a piece of driftwood he has picked up.
text: Occasionally he looks up in the direction of the hotel, then
text: falls again to abusing the marine creatures. Back in the

text: and the open sea on its left.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: Good. Let's see how long you can
dialog: keep that up for ...

text: o'clock. It is quite a small cove facing North West,
text: and the beach above the water line is shadowed by a huge
text: overhanging cliff. A float is drawn up on the peach.
text: A figure of a woman lies sprawled out on the sand, in the
text: shaded part. WE ZOOM IN TO A CLOSE UP to see that her
text: face is covered by a large screen cardboard Chinese hat from
text: under which a long red curl escapes. Bronzed limbs protrude

speaker_heading: DR MUSA
text: Good. Strangled between 11 and 12.
dialog: O.K.?
dialog: ‘ He acts it out as before.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Most helpful. We'll send the body
dialog: over to the mainland for the post
dialog: mortem.
speaker_heading: DR MUSA
dialog: Yes. Yes. Chop her up later. Goodbye.
text: DR MUSA packs up his bag and with a formal bow, trudges over
text: the sand towards the ladder and starts to climb up it.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Competent enough I daresay, but needs
text: to brush up his bedside manner.
dialog: (to Sergeant)

scene_heading: INT. THE RESIDENTS' LOUNGE HOTEL AFTERNOON
text: RACE and POIROT are alone in the lounge.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: It is absolutely extraordinary finding
dialog: you here Poirot. Wherever there's a
dialog: juicy murder you seem to pop up like
text: a jack rabbit.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: I could say the same thing about you
dialog: cher Colonel. If it is not too
dialog: indiscreet of me may I enquire what
dialog: you were doing visiting le roi Zog?
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Dope running if you must know. There's
dialog: a@ chap I've been after for years -
text: uses a dozen aliases. He's moving the
dialog: stuff up now from Turkey through the
dialog: Balkans, and I've had a strong tip off
dialog: he's round here at the moment. Still
dialog: we'd better get on with this lot. It
dialog: looks a very tricky business.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: It is true that most people here would
dialog: have murdered Madame Marshall avec
dialog: grande plaisir but do not worry mon
dialog: vieux. .The order and method of Hercule
dialog: Poirot will triumph in the end. Now I
dialog: suppose you will want to start by
dialog: finding out who was the last person to
dialog: see Madame Marshall alive?
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Yes. I have always found they are the
dialog: most suspicious.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Parbleu! In this case I think you
dialog: will find that that person was me.
dialog: 50
dialog: 59 Continued
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: What !!
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mais oui. Apart of course from
dialog: the murderer. I helped her push her
text: float out from Booty Beach at about
dialog: ten forty this morning. She asked
dialog: me not to tell anyone where she was
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: POTROT
dialog: She said she wanted to be alone.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: From what I hear, that was not a
dialog: desire she expressed too frequently.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: My own opinion exactly. But who
dialog: then, did she go to meet?
text: RACE shrugs.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: At any event she would have arrived
dialog: there shortly after eleven o'clock -
dialog: the earliest time Dr Musa gave for
dialog: her death,
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Exactement. .
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: So we can assume that she was murdered
dialog: there, and not transported there after
dialog: she was killed - which I suppose limits
dialog: our suspects to those people on the
dialog: Island, since anyone coming over from
dialog: the mainland would have been seen.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: And no one was?
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Not so far as we have been able to find out.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Then let us begin with the husband, if for
dialog: no other reason than that matrimonial causes
dialog: provide the motive for the majority of
dialog: female murders.

text: objects. Standing against one of the walls is a desk with
text: papers and a typewriter on it.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: So that is why we thought we would
dialog: start our enquiries with you, Capitaine
text: Marshall. A callous reason, but sensible,
dialog: I'm sure you'll agree. After all, you
dialog: have a very good, very old fashioned
dialog: motive - jealously.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: You think that,
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Come, sir. It is a matter of common
dialog: knowledge here that your wife and Mr
dialog: Redfern were on terms of the greatest
dialog: intimacy.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: I do not listen to tittle tattle,
dialog: Inspector. My wife is dead and cannot
dialog: defend herself.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: I'm not asking her to defend herself.
dialog: If I'm asking anybody, I'm asking you.
dialog: Were you jealous of her?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Many men have admired my wife Colonel.
dialog: If I was the type of man who would kill
dialog: for jealously, I would have killed her
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: It has been my experience that all men
dialog: are the type of men who would kill for

scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Here they are, If you put one of your

speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: What is there to show that they could
dialog: not have been typed at some other time
dialog: - say last night for example?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Today is the twenty-fifth. As you will
dialog: see, these letters are postdated in
dialog: answer to this one from my stockbroker,
dialog: posted in London, the twenty-third, and
dialog: arriving here on this morning's post at
dialog: about ten thirty. As I was down on
dialog: Booty Beach with you Monsieur Poirot
dialog: at a little after ten forty five, you
dialog: will see clearly that I must have typed
dialog: them when I said I did.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: It would appear so.
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Well, if you're still not satisfied, why
dialog: not ask the chambermaid if she heard the
text: machine going. She was moving about the
dialog: corridor some of the time, doing out other

dialog: I mean did she look agitated, or flushed,
dialog: or excited in any way?
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Don't be silly Daphne. You do exagger-

scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Just two things, Monsieur. Firstly, will

speaker_heading: POIROT

scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: She inherited some money recently - yes.

dialog: Just like I'm sure Mrs Redfern did, be-

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Chard)
dialog: Non, Mademoiselle, it ts not at all the
dialog: same. One is a pleasurable fantasy -

dialog: you think about her father?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Le bon Capitaine would be more
dialog: prudent to cultivate an air of |
dialog: greater tristesse if he does not
dialog: wish to be suspected of her death.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Perhaps you're right. Well I'li get
dialog: the sergeant to work on the type-

dialog: Very impressive stuff, eh Monsieur
dialog: Poirot? He should be in training
dialog: for the Berlin Olympics.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mais oui. Those I should like to

speaker_heading: POIROT

speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: And what might that mean?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: That you are gay — lighthearted.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Lighthearted! If I didn't do some-
dialog: thing, I think I'd go off my chump.
dialog: What's happened is so unbelievable.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Not in my experience, monsieur. I
dialog: find it quite believable.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: Obviously you are more accustomed to
dialog: murder than I am, Monsieur Poirot.
dialog: You have probably seen quite a few
dialog: in your time, and have learnt how to
dialog: behave.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Vraiment and they have also given
dialog: me many opportunities of observing how
dialog: suspects behave. And I can assure
dialog: you that very few of them have been
dialog: blithe.

speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN

dialog: 64
dialog: 70 Continued
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: No, I must admit it was not coincidence.
dialog: She asked me to come, and I suppose I
dialog: couldn't resist. You see I was infatu-
dialog: ated with her. I'd have done any mortal
dialog: thing the asked.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You paint a very clear picture of her.
dialog: She was the eternal Circe, n'est ce pas?
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: (rueful)
dialog: She turned men into swine alright! You
dialog: see deep down I know I love my wife.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Well mon vieux, that does rather
dialog: establish a motive for the murder n'est
dialog: ce pas?
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: A motive - for me? Holy Mother of God
dialog: why should I have wanted her dead? I
dialog: was crazy about her.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: So you say. But it is possible she had
dialog: become too importunate, and was making
dialog: it impossible for you to return to the
dialog: wife you loved. Many women have been

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: How about your wife? She had a good motive
dialog: for killing Madame Marshall.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: What!!
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Absolument. La Jalousie!!
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: What nonsense. There's no violence in
dialog: her. Besides how could she have done
dialog: it? She'd never have been able to climb
dialog: down that ladder to the beach - she's no
dialog: head for that sort of thing at all. - And
dialog: even if she could have, she was no match
dialog: for Arlena. She'd have been the one to
dialog: have been murdered. No, if it's jealousy
dialog: you're after I'd have a go at Ken Marshall.
dialog: He must be favourite. Now is that all?

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Merci, madame. We Will heed your advice.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: You do that. She probably battered her
dialog: with a bit of driftwood or something, and
dialog: then finished her off with a little pressure
dialog: on the carot artery, or whatever it's called.
dialog: Everyone knows about that - all the crime
dialog: novels are full of it. In fact an eleven
dialog: year old child did something like that only

dialog: surprised at the manner of Madame
dialog: Marshall's death?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: Well of course to be around when an
dialog: actual murder is committed is so rare
dialog: that of course it is surprising - sur-
dialog: prising and shocking. But I suppose she
dialog: was the kind of woman ...
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: To whom such a thing might happen? ...
dialog: Yes. I find that very significant.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: Well I mean to say it's true. After all
dialog: people like her are always mixed up with
dialog: everything that's squalid and sordid -
dialog: blackmail, jealousy, violence - every
dialog: kind of crude emotion.

text: There is a tiny pause during which CHRISTINE REDFERN comes to
dialog: a decision.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: Yes, Monsieur Poirot. I'm afraid she
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: What!!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN
dialog: I didn't mean to overhear, but I couldn't
dialog: help it. It was yesterday afternoon. I
text: was coming back from a walk along Mutiny
text: Mile, and as I passed along the cliff above
dialog: Blood Bay, I heard voices coming up from the
dialog: beach. Arlena Marshall was saying "It's no
dialog: use pressing me. I simply haven't got it to
dialog: give you any more. As it is, my husband is
text: getting suspicious". And another voice - a
dialog: man's said "What rubbish. You'll pay up or
dialog: I'll really make things hot for you".
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: You'll pay up, or I'll really make things
dialog: hot for you?

text: Parbleu. He must have been listening to

dialog: I'm sorry you think it's a cliché, Monsieur
dialog: Poirot, but those were the words used.

speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: And that's all you heard?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE REDFERN

speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Yes. I can quite see that. Thank you
dialog: Mrs Redfern. We'll follow it up.

speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Now we are getting somewhere.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Well it does explain Mrs Marshall's
text: seemingly inexplicable behaviour this
dialog: morning doesn't it? Blood Bay is an
dialog: ideal spot for a rendezvous with this
text: fellow who's blackmailing her. It's
text: accessible only by water or a ladder
dialog: steep enough to deter most people and
text: a great part of it is invisible from
dialog: above.
speaker_heading: POLROT
dialog: As you say it is an ideal spot for a
dialog: rendezvous. But explain this to me,
dialog: mon cher. Why is it not the pitiless
text: and urgent blackmailer who lies dead,
dialog: but his victim? Is this not indeed

speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: Now, Odell I get another turn for
dialog: hitting you.
text: She takes another shot and goes through a hoop.
dialog: And I get another one for going through
dialog: the hoop.
text: She knocks her ball towards the next hoop. MR GARDENER trudges
text: off to retrieve his ball. He plays a good shot which puts it
text: back near his wife's ball. She whacks it away in another
text: direction, but by doing so puts her own out of position, to get
text: through the hoop. As her husband's back is turned while he
text: goes to retrieve his own ball, she quite blatantly cheats,
text: moving her ball so that she can easily manoeuvre it through the
text: hoop. She does this then whacks it joyfully up towards the
text: finishing post. MR GARDENER looks on in a defeated way, from
text: the bushes where his ball is.
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: I thought we agreed one had to go
text: through the hoop at the top again,
text: before finishing dear.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: You are quite in error Odell. We agreed
dialog: no such thing.

dialog: charming and sympathetic. I remember
dialog: I lost a bracelet once at the Savoy -
dialog: we thought it had been stolen - and a
text: delightful young officer came and found
text: it in a vase of roses where it must have
dialog: fallen from my wrist when I was arranging
dialog: them. I thought he'd have been mad as hell
dialog: wasting his time and all. But not a bit
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: MR GARDENER
dialog: It wasn't a vase of roses, honey. It
text: was a jardiniere in the fireplace.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
text: It was a vase of roses, Odell. Red, long
dialog: stemmed roses that Hattie Hymenheimer
dialog: had sent to us. Surely you remember how

speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Well, there it is. Ken certainly isn't

speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Monsieur Poirot, I don't wish to be

text: in Malaya who was drowned by a huge
text: Moray Eel which darted out of a hole
text: and dragged her to the ocean floor, its
text: teeth buried in her throat. and that
dialog: gave me a new theory - about the Brewster

dialog: Arlena's secretary for years and was fired?
dialog: Well anyway she could have been lurking
text: in the water off Blood Bay when she appeared
dialog: on that float thing and could have leapt
text: up and pulled her off it ...

dialog: Not a soul. I was all on my little owneo.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: And where did you go?
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
text: South West. The wind was right behind me.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You didn't happen to approach Blood Bay
dialog: at any time during the morning, did you?
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Is that where the dark deed was done? No.
dialog: I didn't go within miles of the Place. As a
dialog: matter of fact I haven't seen anyone all day.

speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: 'Fraid so. Not much use I suppose.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Have you any ideas who could have done it?
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Well it's obvious, isn't it? Cherchez le
text: hubby.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: It may be so, yes. All we know for certain
dialog: is that Madame Marshall had a secret rendez-
dialog: vous with someone at Blood Bay this morning.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Well, that had to be Redfern. Though why
dialog: pick a draughty cove for a bit of nooky
dialog: beats me. Reminds me of the old one about
text: the wife watching her old man coming out of
dialog: the sea, and saying to her friend, "Fred goes
text: all blue and stiff when he's been in the
dialog: water - not that I worry about the colour."
text: Once again MR BLATT cracks up laughing. POIROT regards him
text: quizzically; RACE coldly.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: It wasn't Mr Redfern. We know that for a
text: fact. It was somebody else - a blackmailer
dialog: for example. °
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: (blustering)
dialog: A blackmailer ... Wotcher mean?
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: (heavily)
dialog: We believe she was being blackmailed -
text: by a man.
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Well don't look at me. That's not my
dialog: handwriting.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: How do you make your money Monsieur Blatt?
speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: It's all perfectly legit. I'm in what you

speaker_heading: MR BLATT
dialog: Listen, if it wasn't Redfern and it wasn't
dialog: Marshall, I'll bet I know who it was. Has
dialog: to be. She said she was going to do it.
dialog: Don't you remember, you were with me on the
dialog: beach, yesterday morning, when she ran past?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You mean Mademoiselle Linda? Vraiment. She
dialog: did certainly threaten to kill her step-
dialog: mother, But she's so young.

speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: GLADYS NORRACOTT jumps.
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Oooooh. Lord, you startied me.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Sorry. Is your name Gladys Norracott?
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Yes that’s me. I were just putting away
dialog: Some of Mrs Marshall's things. I must say
text: her smalls weren't ‘arf frilly.
text: POIROT's eyes gleam as he fingers the pile.
speaker_heading: POIROT

text: GLADYS NORRACOTT gives POIROT a sharp, suspicious look, and

dialog: the wardrobe.
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Was there something, sir?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: I understand that you were on duty on
dialog: this floor between eleven and twelve
dialog: o'clock this morning.
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Not after eleven thirty I wasn't. I had
dialog: to go to a staff meeting didn't I?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Well, before you left for your meeting did
text: you hear the sound of a typewriter coming
dialog: from Captain Marshall's bedroom?
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
text: Yes. I heard him typing away quite steady.
text: POIROT's gaze travels to a huge array of cosmetic bottles lined
text: up on the dressing table. Identifiable but not over prominent
text: is a bottle of perfume labelled Souffle De Mer.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Now I want you to take a look at these
dialog: botties. Can you tell me if any are
dialog: missing?
text: She stares helplessly at them.
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Lord sir, you'd have to have the memory
dialog: of an h'elephant to be able to tell that.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: What about the other rooms, where I pre-
dialog: sume there are somewhat fewer bottles?
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: I can't say I noticed nothing. What kind
dialog: of a bottle might it be?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Alas that I cannot tell you. Eh maintenant,

dialog: Odd sir?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Yes, Gladys. Odd. Unusual. Out of place.
dialog: Different to the normal run of things.
text: at him with a doltish expression on her face. POIROT
text: waits patiently.
dialog: She looks
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Well there was one thing, though it was
dialog: nothing really. Just someone having a bath
dialog: a bit after twelve o'clock. I mean that's
dialog: odd or unusual isn't it? Most people have
dialog: baths in the early morning or in the
text: evening, but not in the middle of the day.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Who had this bath?
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: I reelly couldn't say. I just heard it
dialog: going down the waste that's all.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You're sure it was a bath - not one of
dialog: the hand basins?
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Quite sure. I mean you can't mistake bath
dialog: water running away, now can you? It makes
text: a kind of gurgling sound.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Like someone choking?
scene_heading: GLADYS NORRACOTT
dialog: Sort of, yes.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Or being strangled?
text: at bim wide-eyed, her hand flying to her mouth.
text: DAPHNE CASTLE appears in the doorway, and sees only GLADYS

speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Oh it's you Monsieur Poirot.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: A votre service, Madame.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: I'm afraid it's no use questioning Gladys
dialog: about anything. She's as dense as dough.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: I have not found it so, Madame.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Really? Well have you arrested anyone
dialog: yet? I told you who it was.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Your choice of murderer has so far been
dialog: somewhat extensive.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Has it? Well I can’t stop now and
dialog: sort it out for you. I've simply got
dialog: to keep an eye on Andrea. He's making
dialog: a curry de Poulet Vindaloos for dinner,
dialog: and the last time he cooked it, it was
dialog: s0 hot we practically had to call the
text: fire brigade from the mainland.
dialog: Arriverdutch as they say in Holland.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Au revoir encore Madame.
text: She bustles out. RACE and POIROT follow slowly.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: She's quite potty. She’1l be accusing
dialog: us next.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Do not distress yourself about Madame
dialog: Castle, mon vieux. Order and method
dialog: will prevail.

text: THE MAIN LANDING OF THE HOTEL EVENING
text: POIROT and RACE walk out onto the main -landing.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: There is nothing irrelevant about
dialog: my questions, je vous assure.
dialog: They are eminently the most logical.
dialog: If you have an empty bottle on your
dialog: dressing table, or in your bathroom,
dialog: what do you do with it? Do you drop
dialog: it in the waste paper basket, or do
dialog: you go to the trouble of going out
dialog: onto your balcony and hurling it into
dialog: the sea?
speaker_heading: : RACE
dialog: H'm, I see what you mean. You would
dialog: only do that if you didn't want to
dialog: be connected with it.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Exactement.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: And the bath? What is so strange
dialog: about the bath?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: The time - a little after twelve
dialog: o'clock. Consider which of the
dialog: guests were in the hotel at that
dialog: hour. Madame Redfern. Monsieur
dialog: Gardener. Madame Castle
dialog: and Capitaine Marshall. They were
text: all about to play tennis - a curious
dialog: time to choose to take a bath, n'est
dialog: ce pas? See you at le dejeuner.

text: The others ignore him.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: I hope you're not going to be ill,
dialog: Odell, like poor Mrs Auschsteiner-
dialog: boltz's girl Sadie. Do you remember
dialog: how she was when she ate the hot
dialog: chillies in Alberquque?
speaker_heading: MR GARDDNGR
dialog: Dear, I thought it was Gazpachio in
dialog: Mexico City.
speaker_heading: MRS GARDENER
dialog: It was hot chillies in Alberquque,
dialog: and all night long she was up and
dialog: down to the john, which was about
text: half a mile away.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE CASTLE
dialog: Are you sure it wasn't an earth

dialog: Could I please have a glass of iced
dialog: water,
scene_heading: KENNETH MARSHALL
dialog: Good idea. For me too please. About
text: a gallon of it.
text: A chorus of "Me toos". POIROT rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mesdames, Monsieurs, talking of water,
dialog: I would like to disturb you all from
dialog: the excellence of your dinner for a
dialog: moment, by asking you just one simple
dialog: question, which may have some bearing
dialog: on our murder. Did any of you have a
dialog: bath this morning about midday, or a
dialog: few minutes later?

text: The CAMERA moves round the circle of faces, They all shake
text: their heads. POIROT turns to RACE.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Voila! Another little mystery to
dialog: torture the logical mind. A bath
dialog: poured out, which no one will admit
dialog: to taking.
dialog: (to the Company)
dialog: Please continue to consume the dish

text: Bosun's chair on the cliff top. He crosses himself
text: devoutly, as he is swung out over the side of the cliff and
text: lowered by the SERGEANT. RACE himself descends into the bay
text: by the iron ladder clamped to the cliff face, enjoying as
text: he does so the grotesque sight of his colleague swinging
text: around in the air above his head like a helpless whale.

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Mais c'est bien impudent tout cela!
text: RACE leaps off the ladder and is in time to catch the wildly
text: gyrating POIROT, and release him from his harness.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Well done Poirot. That should have
dialog: juiced up the little grey cells for you.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: They have not been juiced. They have
text: been paralysed.
text: After considerable attention to his toilet POIROT recovers
text: himself enough to take an interest in his surroundings. As
text: the sergeant descends the iron ladder, he walks over to the
text: taped outline figure lying above the waterline in the shade
text: of the overhanging cliff. The green Chinese hat lies over the
text: spot where the face would be, and the white bathing costume
text: is spread out over the trunk of the body. He studies it
text: intently. Behind him the sergeant picks up a couple of objects
text: ‘from the beach.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: I have found these on the sand.
text: He holds out a pair of scissors and a pipe stem. POIROT
text: and RACE study them curiously.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Right. Hang on to them will you.
dialog: (to Poirot)
dialog: Do you think they're significant?

scene_heading: . PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: We stayed like this for a minute or so.
dialog: You see we were shocked. We didn't know
dialog: what to do. Then in case the murderer
dialog: was still hanging about, I volunteered to
dialog: stay with the body while Miss Brewster went
dialog: to fetch the police. I touched nothing
dialog: other than to make sure she was dead.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: And I rowed away back to the hotel. I

text: POIROT walks thoughtfully about the cove examining the cliffs.
text: Suddenly he stops and beckons to RACE:
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Come here Colonel. Look at this.
text: RACE joins POIROT and sees what POIROT has found - a narrow
text: gap in the cliff face. They squeeze through it.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE MIDDAY

speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: H'm. The air's quite fresh.
text: POIROT sniffs delicately.
speaker_heading: POIROT
text: Indeed. It smells of le Souffle De Mer.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: POIROT
text: The breath of the sea.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: H'm. Very poetic.
text: The two men look about them, examining the cave in detail.

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: One might perhaps see that there is
dialog: nothing up there.
dialog: 108

dialog: Continued
text: RACE stretches up a long arm, but is still too short for an
text: effective search by about a foot. Somewhat precariously he
text: manages a toe-hold in the cave wall, and hoisting himself up
text: is now able to investigate the shelf properly. Suddenly he
text: whistles and descends abruptly. In his hands is a tin box
text: labelled Sandwiches.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Ah a picnic box.
speaker_heading: POIROT
text: A curious place to hide the egg and
dialog: cress sandwiches, would you not say,
dialog: mon vieux?
text: RACE opens the box. WE TRACK in to a CLOSE UP to see that
text: the various compartments, labelled Salt, Pepper and Mustard
text: are all full of what looks like salt. RACE wets a finger
dialog: and tastes some.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Good God! ... Not egg and cress, Poirot.
dialog: Heroin! ... So my information was
dialog: correct ... What a lucky break! The
dialog: fellow I've been looking for is obviously
dialog: using this place as a drop or a cache.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: What a fortunate find, mon cher. Now all
dialog: you have to do is have a watch kept and
dialog: you will soon know who it is
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: Exactly. It will give that idle Sergeant
dialog: of mine something to do.
text: RACE puts the sandwich box back where he found it.
dialog: You know, I've been thinking. It
dialog: could be that Mrs Marshall was an addict,
dialog: and came here yesterday morning to meet’
dialog: her supplier.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Non. Non. Non. It is not possible.
dialog: She had steady nerves, and radiant health.
dialog: But of course there is always the possibility
dialog: that she discovered this business accidentally
dialog: and was Silenced. Alons. Let us return to
dialog: the hotel.

dialog: 110
text: POIROT and RACE emerge from the cave. POIROT looks first at
text: the bosun's harness and then at the poat. Each object draws
text: a shudder from him.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Alas, I stand between the Scylla of
text: Vertigo, and the Charybdis of Mal De Mer.
dialog: (he shrugs massively)
dialog: It is true one does not die of Mal De Mer,
dialog: whereas another journey in that infernal
dialog: machine might well induce une crise des
dialog: nerfs from which I would never recover.
dialog: (to Patrick Redfern)
dialog: Would you permit me, Monsieur, to prevail
dialog: on Mademoiselle Brewster for your place in
dialog: her boat.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Please go ahead. I'11 use the ladder.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: You are too amiable.
text: PATRICK REDFERN gives POIROT a dazzling smile and walks away
text: across the beach towards the ladder. He is followed by RACE.
text: POIROT meanwhile walks apprehensively down the beach towards
text: the boat, in the company of Miss Brewster.
speaker_heading: MISS BREWSTER
dialog: All you have to do is to hop in Monsieur
dialog: Poirot, and leave everything else to me.
text: Gingerly he complies with her suggestion. As soon as he is
text: settled she casts off, and jumps into’ the boat making it
text: lurch sickeningly. As POIROT groans unhappily she bends to
text: the oars. Back on the beach the sergeant conceals himself

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Now from my own unhappy experience I
dialog: know it takes about twenty five minutes

speaker_heading: POIROT
text: Capitaine Marshall was in his room typing.

dialog: and Mademoiselle Marshall were here at
text: Cutlass Cove until twelve o'clock, when
text: Madame Redfern left to go back to the hotel,
text: leaving Mademoiselle Linda alone. Finally
dialog: Monsieur Blatt was out here sailing in a
dialog: South Westerly direction. Now what does all
dialog: that tell us?
text: RACE points to the relevant markers.
speaker_heading: RACE
dialog: That the only people with watertight alibis
text: are Captain Marshall with his hour's typing,
dialog: Mr Redfern who was either in your sight, or
dialog: Miss Brewster's. and Mrs Redfern and Linda

speaker_heading: POIROT

dialog: Company to investigate a case of strangul-
dialog: ation which the police were satisfied was
dialog: the work of a madman or tramp, and not of
dialog: the obvious suspect - the husband who ben-
dialog: efited from the Insurance Policy. I read
dialog: the documents and decided it was useless
dialog: to investigate, because the husband had
text: an obviously cast iron alibi, being on a
text: train miles away at the time of the murder.
dialog: Now suddenly I am not so sure, that incredible
dialog: as it may seem, I Hercule Poirot, did not make
dialog: the bad mistake.
text: He looks crestfallen.

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Can't you see they share the same
dialog: pattern - the cold blooded plotting,

dialog: alibi of the husband. Mon vieux, I
dialog: want you to do something for me. I
dialog: want you to get me photographs of all
dialog: the witnesses in that case - the husband,
dialog: the hiker who found the body, everybody

dialog: Her husband's name I think was Edward,

dialog: In a nutshell her bank told me that
dialog: out of the hundred thousand pounds left

speaker_heading: RACE

speaker_heading: POIROT

text: There is a further buzz of surprised conversation, and
text: POIROT takes a small bow.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: It is at the moment only a theory, -
dialog: though one which I am quite sure is.
dialog: the correct one. However, thanks
dialog: to the good offices of my dear
dialog: colleague Colonel Race, I am hoping
dialog: that certain proofs will arrive

speaker_heading: POIROT (V.0.)
dialog: I visited the scene of the crime at

dialog: to say the same time the body was
dialog: discovered. I was struck at once by
dialog: one very interesting fact. Madame
text: Marshall had been obviously lying in
dialog: the shade. And yet as I learned
text: from the reconstruction her face
dialog: had been covered by her great big
dialog: green Chinese hat. Why, I asked myself
text: was her face shielded from a non-
dialog: existent sun? There could only be
dialog: one answer - the murderer had wanted

dialog: But why mes amis had the murderer
dialog: wanted it concealed?
text: He looks directly at PATRICK REDFERN who stirs uneasily in his

speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: 1 think you know very well why,
dialog: Monsieur Redfern.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: What can you mean?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: I mean that everyone here at this
dialog: hotel had the opportunity to kill
dialog: Madame Marshall, except for you and
dialog: Madame Redfern. She hadn't got
dialog: the opportunity because she was with
text: Mademoiselle Linda in Cutlass Cove.
dialog: (he points to Cutlass Cove

speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: Well there you are then. If we are
dialog: the least suspicious of all the
dialog: people here, why should I know why
dialog: the murderer had wanted to conceal
dialog: Arlena'’s face with the hat?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Because the singular impossibility of
dialog: you and your wife having done the crime,
dialog: convinces me beyond doubt that you
dialog: actually did do it.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: What!! Is it daft you are?
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: No, I don't think so Monsieur Redfern.

dialog: D‘you mind telling me how J did it then?
speaker_heading: POIROT

dialog: Alice Corrigan at llkley earlier this
dialog: year,with the able assistance of your
dialog: wite or partner Christine, who helped
dialog: you here, in the same way as she helped

speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Merci. Vous est trop gentil ...Let
dialog: me say at once that the crime depended
dialog: 6n the character of Madame Marshall.
dialog: From the start I saw she was the
dialog: archetypal victim. It wasn't she who
dialog: fatally attracted men. It was men
dialog: like you who fatally attracted her -
text: an adventurer, a man of good looks and
dialog: easy assurance who makes his living
text: out of women, and often ends up killing
dialog: them. In other words you were the most
dialog: likely suspect.
speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN

speaker_heading: PATRICK REDFERN
dialog: If anything at all of what you're
dialog: saying were true, d'you mind telling
dialog: me why on earth I should kill her.
dialog: Presumably there would have been
dialog: plenty more where that came from.
speaker_heading: POIROT
dialog: Not so, mon ami. There was very
dialog: little left. And it wasn't going to
dialog: be very long before her husband was
dialog: going to start asking awkward questions

dialog: True, as I knew from Mr Blatt's
