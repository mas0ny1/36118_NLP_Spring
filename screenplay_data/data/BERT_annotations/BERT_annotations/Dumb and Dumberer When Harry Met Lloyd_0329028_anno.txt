scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: WE HEAR the sounds of a woman in labor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR O.S.
dialog: Push... That's it.
text: The darkness slowly gives way to light as we reveal a smallish 60's
dialog: style delivery room.
scene_heading: SUPER TITLE: RHODE ISLAND 1969.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Okay... Mrs. Dunne you're doing
dialog: great. There's the head... I can
dialog: see it now... Congratulations, uhh,
dialog: it's... gone back in.
text: MRS. DUNNE is confused, as are the doctors and nurses. The DOCTOR makes
dialog: another attempt.
text: The doctor reaches towards camera and we pull back into the blackness.
text: Fade up on white letters: H A RR Y. A small baby hand REACHES IN and
dialog: turns the second "R" backwards!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR V.O.
dialog: You're going to need to push
dialog: harder.
scene_heading: MRS. DUNNE V.O.
text: It feels like he's holding on.
text: The doctor reaches in and pulls out a tiny foot. A tug-ofwar ensues
text: between the baby foot and the large doctor hand, and it looks like the
dialog: baby's winning.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You got a shy one here.
text: The doctor reaches back in and pulls out another foot. The feet kick
text: their way out of the doctor's hand.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont'd)
dialog: Come out you little bastard!
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: (gasping)
text: I think it's holding onto my lungsungs-
dialog: ungs- ungs.
text: We see her chest shaking. The doctor reaches in, yes - way in and feels
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It's a boy! Ow, he bit me.
dialog: (to nurses)
dialog: A little help.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNNE HOUSE ) MOMENTS LATER
text: A Police car pulls to a stop and the two patrolmen rush out.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNNE HOUSE BACKYARD D DAY
text: EIGHT YEAR OLD HARRY, standing over a old well in the backyard. The
text: Police approach as Harry pulls up the end of a rope.
scene_heading: TEN-YEAR OLD HARRY
dialog: Captain Rob fell in the well! Help
dialog: him! Captain Rob, can you hear
dialog: me!?
text: The Cops look anxiously down into the well bur see that it's not a real
dialog: â€˜well' at all.
speaker_heading: OFFICER DAVE
dialog: Now Harry we can't keep coming out
dialog: here getting your... friend out of
dialog: trouble. You see it's keeping us
dialog: from chasing the real bad guys.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TEN-YEAR OLD HARRY
dialog: Thanks for saving Captain Rob.
dialog: (hears 0.8.)
dialog: Okay - wait for me!
text: HARRY runs off, leaving the policeman a bit bewildered as
text: MRS. DUNNE approaches.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: I'm sorry David, He just gets a
dialog: little mixed up sometimes.
speaker_heading: OFFICER DAVE
dialog: Oh that's okay. Harry's a fine boy,
dialog: overly active imagination is all.
scene_heading: TEN-YEAR OLD HARRY O.S.
dialog: Lay off the breaks, Captain Rob.
text: PAN TO see Harry push an empty go-cart to the front yard.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNNE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - TEN YEARS LATER
text: HARRY stands in the front yard looking around for Captain Rob. A beat
text: later Mrs. Dunne appears in the doorway holding a rolled up scroll.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is it true what you said to Captain
dialog: Rob?
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Yes, Harry. I can't home school
dialog: you anymore. So maybe it's time to
dialog: make some new friends, some friends
dialog: your own age...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm just not ready.
text: Dejected, Harry starts back inside. Mrs. Dunne stops him.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Oh, I almost forgot. Captain Rob
dialog: left this behind for you, he said
dialog: count your steps very carefully.
text: She hands him a rolled-up scroll. Harry brightens, his dream again
text: alive. He unrolls the scroll and we see his mother has drawn a crude
text: map, with an "X" marking the school.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Wow, a treasure map! What's the
dialog: treasure?
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: It could be anything. You're going
dialog: to discover a whole new world when
dialog: you get to school.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wow just like Marco Polo.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: I don't follow.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know Mom, like in the pool.
text: She acts like she gets it. They have a deep heart-felt hug.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: You're going to be just fine,
speaker_heading: HARRY.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I know I am, Mom.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Here's your lunch. And an apple
dialog: and banana for extra energy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Maybe the treasure's a chest full
dialog: of apples and bananas!
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Could be. Sweet boy.
text: She tries to comb Harry's hair, but the COMB GETS STUCK.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Mom, you know that never works.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Right.
text: She pats down his hair with her hands. Harry puts the banana in his
text: pants pocket and starts walking right.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE (cont'd)
dialog: Other left. And now it's nine
dialog: hundred sixty seven. Bye Harry!
dialog: I love you!
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Angle on LLOYD CHRISTMAS, getting his hair trimmed by his father, RAY.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (chokes up)
dialog: Senior year. My little boy. Who
dialog: woulda thunk it?
dialog: (as he cuts)
dialog: You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't
dialog: say it enough, but I'm proud of you
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (in the bowl, echoes)
dialog: Thanks, Pop.
text: RAY pulls the bowl off his head and dusts him off.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Here's for not crying.
text: RAY hands him a lollipop from the pile of chewed gum.
speaker_heading: RAY (cont'd)
dialog: School's gonna open soon. Go get
dialog: cleaned up.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Keys, please.
text: RAY throws him a huge ring of keys. Lloyd catches it and does a quick
text: spin with them, like a ninja-locksmith.
scene_heading: MUSIC/TITLES BEGIN (or) CONTINUE
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Exiting a door that reads 'CUSTODIAN CLOSET', Lloyd dances along to a
text: fast paced rhythm. He walks past the gymnasium (and a sign reading
dialog: "Boy's Showers").
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: LLOYD enters a door that reads, "Chemistry Lab".
scene_heading: INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - MOMENTS LATER
text: A poster on the wall reads: 'Chemical Shower - For Use In Case of
text: Contamination only!' And a drawing of a man pulling a chain over his
dialog: head.
text: LLOYD still sings as he pulls the chain, which starts the extremely
text: brief fire extinguisher-like chemical shower. He pulls again and again
text: while soaping up. He shakes himself off, refreshed.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
text: TIGHT SHOT on napkin dispenser, Lloyd's hand delicately pulls one
text: napkin out - the last one. Still singing, we reveal,
text: LLOYD, his wet naked body plastered with hundreds of paper napkins he's
text: been using to dry himself. He walks off doing an impression of a mummy.
scene_heading: INT. AUTO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: LLOYD, still covered in napkins, presses a button and a massive paint
text: drying fan fires up. All the napkins fly off him, as Lloyd backs up,
text: stepping on a FLOOR-CREEPER which rolls quickly out of frame.
speaker_heading: SFX: Crash
text: Reveal Lloyd has landed in a spill-barrel of transmission fluid.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - MOMENTS LATER Once again Lloyd showers, and
text: shakes himself off, refreshed.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/LOST & FOUND - MOMENTS LATER
text: LLOYD walks out of the closet wearing an assortment of odd clothing.
text: RAY exits another classroom at the same time.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (full of pride)
dialog: You sure are looking sharp there in
dialog: your back to school outfit.
text: RAY pulls out an old camera from lost and found.
speaker_heading: RAY (cont'd)
dialog: Let me take your picture.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No can do. Gotta catch my bus.
dialog: See ya, Pop!!
text: We HOLD ON Ray as he watches Lloyd run off.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: But you're already at school!
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: We go through this every year.
text: He picks up and eats an old sandwich from the lost and found.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - SECONDS LATER
text: LLOYD rushes out the school's front doors, going against the flow of
text: people entering. Books and papers fly as he runs away from the school.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Out of my way! Can't miss my bus!
dialog: Gotta get to school!
text: Then he tears off down the street. Some students look back at him.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: HARRY, with his combed hair, is reading his map as he finishes the
dialog: apple.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (counting steps, eating
dialog: his apple)
dialog: Seven hundred thirty two... bite
dialog: number six... Follow the map, find
dialog: a friend - how does the apple work
dialog: into this.
dialog: (he stops)
dialog: This is distracting. One of these
dialog: has to go.
text: He looks at the map, he looks at the apple, then the map, than the
dialog: apple.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: I sure hope I'm making the right
dialog: decision.
text: He looks at the apple again.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Now take your seeds and grow into a
dialog: beautiful pie.
text: He tosses the apple.
text: It lands in a yard where it hits a MEAN LOOKING DOG in the head. The
text: dog looks up, growls when he sees Harry and begins the chase in full
text: attack mode.
text: HARRY hears the growling dog, turns and after a swallowed cry starts
dialog: running.
text: The dog's overly long chain unravels as he gains on Harry.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: We see Lloyd running towards camera in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Must catch bus...
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Back on Harry as the dog is about to bite his ass.
text: Then very quickly we see the chain stop the dog in mid-air with a yelp,
text: just as Harry rounds the corner and SMASHES HEAD FIRST INTO LLOYD. It
text: looks very painful as they both fall to the ground.
text: LLOYD shakes it off and holds his mouth. Harry's once combed hair is
text: now permanently disheveled.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Somebody chipped my tooth.
text: REVEAL his trademarked chipped tooth.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How do you think I feel? Someone
dialog: bit me in the forehead.
text: REVEAL the piece of tooth is stuck in his forehead. Harry plucks it out
text: and tosses it away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You could've saved that for the
dialog: tooth fairy!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's stupid! I happen to know my
dialog: mom is the tooth fairy.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Your mom is the tooth fairy? That
dialog: is so cool!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, she must do all the flying
dialog: around when I'm asleep.
dialog: (extends his hand)
speaker_heading: HARRY Dunne.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No thanks, not hungry. Harry
dialog: Dunne. Why does that name not
dialog: sound familiar?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Probably because we've never met.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No, that's not it. Anyway -
dialog: (extends his hand)
text: LLOYD Christmas.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Here I am bragging my Mom is the
dialog: tooth fairy, and I'm talking to
dialog: Santa's kid!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I haven't seen you around here
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Home school. Til today.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Home school? What's that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I go to school where I live.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Me too!
text: LLOYD sees his school bus pass.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: Aw, I missed it. Now I gotta walk.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (hold up map)
dialog: I think it's just over there.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Is that what I think it is?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, it's a treasure map.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My mom says the treasure's
text: somewhere in the school.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I don't know. I'm pretty familiar
dialog: with the school and I've never seen
dialog: that "X". But... I do know
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (leans in)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (he tags him)
dialog: You're it.
text: LLOYD takes off.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (calls after him)
dialog: I'm "it"? What's "it"?
speaker_heading: LLOYD stops.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I don't really know. But whatever
dialog: it is, it's something you don't
dialog: want to be. And, right now, you
dialog: are.
text: He walks away. Harry catches up to him, and as they walk away we watch
text: them tag back and forth.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL QUAD - MOMENTS LATER
text: They walk through the crowd. Harry is pleasantly overwhelmed by all the
dialog: attractive girls.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: High school is all about looking
dialog: cool. So stick with me.
text: They see a group of CHEERLEADERS.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (ga-ga)
dialog: Wow. Are those cheerleaders, just
dialog: like on TV?
text: LLOYD turns Harry away from the girls as if avoiding homeless people.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make
dialog: eye contact or they might talk to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don't we want them to talk to us?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: No no no no no.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well, besides cooties and other
dialog: medical reasons, they're not in the
dialog: cool crowd. Which I am, and you
dialog: want to be. Know what I mean?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.
text: HARRY turns and sees JESSICA, a beautiful seventeen-year-old.
text: DRAMATIC MUSIC comes up, Harry is entirely in love. He spends a few
text: very uncomfortable moments trying to remember how to breathe.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: She's a total dork. Just look how
text: she dresses.
text: LLOYD points to Jessica in her short, sexy skirt.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: Check out her skirt, it's so short.
dialog: I mean, where's the flood?
text: He points at her tight shirt and ample cleavage.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: And look at her shirt, it's not
dialog: even buttoned right. Her milk
dialog: bubbles are popping out! Loser!
text: JESSICA drops something and picks it up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh my gosh, I don't think she's
dialog: even wearing underwear!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two
dialog: pairs right now.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me too!
text: LLOYD raises his hand to high five. Harry doesn't know what he's doing
text: and in self defense, punches Lloyd in the chest.
text: LLOYD goes in to poke him in the eye.
text: They are about to (playfully) get into it when, suddenly, LLOYD is
text: bumped from behind, as we reveal TURK, a LOST BOYS type with a SHITTY
text: TOUGH GUY HAIRCUT. He reaches up and GRABS LLOYD by the neck.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (choked)
dialog: This is my Injun friend, Turk. He's
text: part of the cool crowd.
dialog: (to Turk)
dialog: Hey Kimosabe!
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Shut up, ass face.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (proud)
dialog: That's the Iroquois name he's given
dialog: me because I have the strong face
dialog: of an ass.
text: TURK drags Lloyd away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: See ya, Harry! Gotta have a little
dialog: pow wow.
text: HARRY is left alone for a moment. Looking down, he turns away, running
text: headfirst into JESSICA.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (stumbling for something
dialog: to say)
dialog: Well I hope the carpet matches the
text: drapes.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (points to her newspaper)
text: In the new library there.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Oh, yeah. I don't think they do.
dialog: You're new here, right?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Depends how you define 'new'...
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: You're the kid who was home
dialog: schooled.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. How'd you know?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I've been assigned to write an
dialog: article about you for the school
dialog: paper. It was either a feature on
dialog: you or the new four-color ink pens
text: at the student store.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Four colors? Neato!
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Yeah, well, I'd much rather write
dialog: an expose or a hard hitting
dialog: investigative piece, but nothing
dialog: really ever happens around here.
dialog: But, I chose you and that's fine.
dialog: (she extends her hand)
dialog: I'm Jessica Matthews.
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: HARRY Dunne.
text: HARRY has never had a part of a girl so close to him so he just stares
text: in awe of her hand for a long beat. Finally Harry gathers the courage
text: to shake her hand and just as they're about to touch, Turk comes over
text: with Lloyd in tow.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (laughs to Harry)
dialog: Hey, freak show, did Jessica give
dialog: you that banana in your pants?
text: HARRY does in fact have a banana in his front pocket.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (looks down)
dialog: Naw, my Mom did.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (grimacing)
dialog: Gross!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (pull's out his banana)
dialog: Wanna bite?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: TURK, leave him alone.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (mimicking Jessica)
dialog: TURK, leave him alone.
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: You're coming too.
text: He pushes Harry away from Jessica.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Hey, Turk rescued you from the
dialog: nerd. You're in!
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: I'll talk to you later.
text: TURK leads Lloyd away with Harry.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: So have you been held back two
dialog: years like Lloyd?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (as if)
dialog: No. I've been held back three.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: PRINCIPAL COLLINS, the forty-something headmaster of this painfully
text: below average school, is there with the attractive, albeit overly done
text: head lunch lady, MS. HELLER.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: .+. and, Principal Collins, you'll
dialog: be pleased to know that this year

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Good. Good. Good. Well, that's
dialog: good.
text: PRINCIPAL COLLINS gets up.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
dialog: Well it sounds like it's going to
dialog: be another hot year in the kitchen.
text: They lunge at each other. They pull at each others clothes, bang into
text: walls, fall to the floor and as Heller goes down.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: God, I've missed you.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: And I you.
dialog: More kissing.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS V.O
dialog: (passionately)
dialog: Yes. Yes. Oh yes.
text: They hotly embrace and fall back behind the desk (Heller opens the
text: center drawer on the way down). There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. A PREPPY
text: FEMALE student, TALIA, enters and stands in the doorway, looks around
text: at the empty room.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: PRINCIPAL COLLINS? Hello?
text: Still on his knees, he shoves Ms. Heller under the desk and pushes in
text: the center drawer - this SLAMS INTO HELLER'S HEAD.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS 0.S.
dialog: Yes, what is it?
text: Collins doesn't appear.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: (slightly confused)
dialog: Uhh, Sir it's time for morning
dialog: announcements.
text: Collins POPS UP, still on his knees, looking a little disheveled,
text: glasses askew.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Yes, I know dear. Well, why don't
dialog: you do the announcements this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: But what do I announce?
text: He pops back up.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: You announce the most important
dialog: news of the day.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Make something up.
text: She WALKS AWAY a bit confused.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Collins comes out from behind the desk. Heller follows, zipping up her
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: You know honey, I've finally
dialog: figured out a way of bilking enough
dialog: money from the school to get us
dialog: that condo in Waikiki.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: How baby-cakes? You've done it
dialog: all.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Small potatoes. This one is big

dialog: idea is genius.
text: She nuzzles up to him.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: It's the big potato.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Yes, it's the big potato. Just
dialog: have a look at this.
text: He picks up a TATTERED GRANT BOOK.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
dialog: The Richard Moffit Special Needs
dialog: Grant. Unbelievable. This kid was
dialog: in a Special Needs program, learned
dialog: how to string a couple of sentences
dialog: together and now he's some
dialog: successful hot shot.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Like you.
text: INSERT: There's a PHOTOGRAPH OF A MAN over the LISTING.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Anyway, the state is giving a
dialog: hundred thousand dollars in his
dialog: name to every school that has a
dialog: special Needs class.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Oh, this is fantastic. So all we
dialog: have to do is kill this Moffit guy
dialog: and we get all the money!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: No. No. That's not it. We don't
dialog: kill him. We don't kill anybody.
dialog: But I like the way you're thinking.
dialog: You're focused and you're trying to
dialog: follow. No, what we need to do is
dialog: start a fake Special Needs class.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: We start our own class?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather,
dialog: aloha hot weather.
text: MS. HELLER looks confused.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: You said "aloha" twice.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Aloha means hello and goodbye.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Oh wow. Look at you.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Now, the problem is where do we
dialog: find kids we can pass off as
dialog: "special"?
text: Out the window they see the back of Harry and Lloyd rise into frame,
text: being hoisted up the flagpole by their underwear.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
dialog: Bingo.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Times two.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: (sneaky)
dialog: I think you'll make a good teacher.

speaker_heading: MS. HELLER

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: MS. HELLER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: And the reason you two are here

speaker_heading: LLOYD

dialog: Can we eat there tomorrow?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sure, but first we have to find
dialog: kids special, needy and classy
dialog: enough to be in Special Needs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It'll be like taking candy from a
dialog: stranger.
text: They sit and Harry picks up a clipboard with a sign-up sheet that says
text: "Special Needs". We see Harry and Lloyd's childish scrawl on the first
dialog: and second lines.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (sounding it out)
text: HARRY...
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: The second R is silent.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, of course.
text: Just then a SKATER PUNK limps by.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: Look, a little crippled boy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: His curse is our blessing.
text: They walk over to Toby, a seventeen year old student on crutches. He
text: looks perfectly healthy except for a CAST on both his leg and hand.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (speaking slowly)
dialog: Hello, little orphan boy. What
dialog: happened to you?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Skateboard.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: One day they'll find a cure.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You brave soldier.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: What? It's nothing, the cast comes
dialog: off in six weeks.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: Of course it does.
dialog: (sotto to Harry)
text: Obviously in denial.
dialog: (to Toby)
dialog: Maybe we can help.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We're part of a special class
dialog: taught by the lunch lady, er, I
dialog: mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like
dialog: to join us, it doesn't require any
dialog: walking.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: And nobody will make fun of your
text: horrible deformity.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: How much homework is there?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's the downside. There is
dialog: none.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Wait a minute. I can spend the
dialog: whole year in a class taught by the
dialog: lunch lady? Can I bring my
dialog: girlfriend?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (with great pity)
dialog: You can bring whatever you want,
dialog: little friend.
text: Music: An inexpensive genre defining discovery... Recruiting montage
text: begins.
text: HARRY holds the clip board as Lloyd hands Toby a pen. He signs his name
text: like a three year old because of his cast.
dialog: 
text: The ' in TOBY dissolves through to:
scene_heading: INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: A CUT-OUT HOLE POV in the locker room. PUSH CLOSER IN to see girls
text: walking around in various stages of undress. One girl stops, bends
text: down, looks right at the camera and screams. She shoots her shampoo
text: bottle TOWARDS CAMERA.
text: ANGLE ON: what she's looking at.
text: It's a small hole in the wall with an eyeball looking in.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Covering his eye, Turk is being hauled away by a UNIFORMED SECURITY
text: GUARD, some of the girls (wrapped in towels) stand in the background).
text: HARRY and Lloyd approach, take out wallet badges reading "Special
text: Needs" and wave them at the security guard. The guard shrugs and leaves
text: Turk with Harry and Lloyd.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Okay. I owe you this one.
text: HARRY BENDS OVER as Lloyd puts the clipboard on his back so TURK can
text: sign. As he messily scribbles his name, we see HARRY's BUTT CRACK.
text: The 'T' in Turk DISSOLVES through to:
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
text: Tight on football T-SHAPED GOAL POST. TILT to reveal a practice game in
text: progress. A player, CARL catches a pass, screams as he crashes through
text: blockers and runs head on into the goal post!
text: He's on the ground. Teammates crowd around as the couch eases his
text: helmet off. Harry and Lloyd push their way through, see how dazed he
text: is, gives each other a thumbs up.
text: TWO OTHER PLAYERS put him on a stretcher. They start to carry him away
text: when Lloyd taps the guy at the head of the stretcher on the shoulder a
text: la "We'll take it from here." Then Harry takes lead on the stretcher as
text: Lloyd puts a pen in Carl's hand and helps him scrawl his name on the
dialog: class list.
dialog: His entire name - 'Carl', DISSOLVES through to:
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL GRASS AREA - DAY
text: TIGHT ON NOODLES in a bowl that spell 'CARL'. CHOPSTICKS ENTER FRAME
text: and mixes then up. CUT WIDE to reveal:
text: HARRY is with an attractive Asian girl eating the noodles from the
text: bowl. Lloyd walks in with Toby, Turk and Carl who leans on him for
dialog: support.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ...oh also, we even have a slogan.
dialog: 's' and 'P' stands for 'Special
dialog: People', which is the kind of kids
dialog: we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for â€˜Aren't
dialog: Zerosâ€™ because that is less then
dialog: one, and when you put it all
dialog: together it spells...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (listens then interrupts)
dialog: HARRY, what are you doing? She's a
dialog: foreign exchange student. She
dialog: doesn't speak the English.
dialog: (to girl)
text: CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy
dialog: chong chong.
text: She sees Turk standing there. They share a flirtatious glance then she
text: looks back at Lloyd, signs her name on their list in Asian characters.
dialog: DISSOLVE the bottom character through to:
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
text: CLOSE ON the exact Asian character, it's on a small flyer with more
dialog: writing including a header: 'The Goeku School of Fancy Writingâ€™.
text: WATER SPRAYS into frame and we REVEAL that the flyer is under a
text: windshield wiper and we are at a WET T-SHIRT CONTEST/CHEERLEADER CAR
speaker_heading: WASH.
text: A horse runs up, actually a BOY IN A WELL-USED HORSE COSTUME (his feet
text: are the horses front legs). He wears a sign that reads "Support the
text: Stallions Car Wash!" As the cheerleaders wash cars, he lopes around.
text: HARRY, Lloyd, Toby, Turk, Carl and Ching Chong are watching from the
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: How about Lewis?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Which one's Lewis.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: The horse.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: A horse? I don't think so, pal.
text: The horse nudges a cheerleader - who removes his head. REVEAL LEWIS, is
text: the boy in the costume. His arm's are locked in to the suit so the
text: cheerleader hold's a bottle of water for him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse.
text: The boys walk up to him, impressed.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Now that's more of what we're
dialog: looking for.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: LEWIS HOLDS the clipboard with his front horse hooves.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Well I need to get a job and you're
dialog: telling me that if I join up - I
dialog: can really come and go whenever I
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You were born free and free you
dialog: should remain.
text: LEWIS signs, hoof-signature is barely legible. Harry pops a sugar cube
text: in his mouth. Lewis reacts and spits it out.
text: HARRY tries to calm the beast--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Whoa, Nellie!
text: LLOYD holds up the clipboard to check out the list.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
speaker_heading: LLOYD V.O.
dialog: Special Needs class 1986.
speaker_heading: HARRY V.O.
dialog: We are the chosen ones.
text: TIGHT on Harry and Lloyd.
text: HEROIC MUSIC PLAYS as we PULL BACK to see our Seven Samurai each
text: DRAMATICALLY SILHOUETTED in the hallway. There's the half-horse, half-
text: boy, a kid on crutches, a football player holding a helmet, a girl with
text: Chinese pig-tails, a kid with a spikey mohawk and of course - Harry and
text: Lloyd. Bored, the group slowly stops, except for Harry and Lloyd.
text: TURK stops first, Ching Chong runs to him, then Lewis and TOBY stop to
text: chill, while Carl collapses against the lockers.
scene_heading: INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The girls shower and soap themselves, also IN SILHOUETTE. The Blackness

scene_heading: EXT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: HARRY and Lloyd are sitting at the dining room table, finishing off
text: their bowls of food.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Maybe we should ask Jessica to join
dialog: the class.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
speaker_heading: JESSICA? Please hold for my
dialog: reaction.
text: With determination he drinks a mouthful of red HAWAIIAN PUNCH, makes a
text: â€œwait for it" gesture then does a huge spit take.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: No nerds!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right, I forgot.
text: MRS. DUNNE enters with dessert as Lloyd is licking the bottom of his
dialog: bowl.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D.
dialog: Where's Mr. D?
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: He passed away three years ago.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (chipper)
dialog: Well he missed a great pot of stew!
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: It was meatloaf. You just put
dialog: everything in your soup.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I liked it a lot.
text: MRS. DUNNE leans down to Harry.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you
dialog: making a real friend.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is it okay if he spends the night?
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: (to Lloyd)
dialog: LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah, I left my dad a note.
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON: NOTE
dialog: "Pop, I'm sleeping at Harry's tonight. Love, Lloyd. P.S. Out of
dialog: Ketchup".
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL the note is actually GIGANTIC, as it has been
text: written on the gymnasium floor in ketchup. The last "u" and "p" are
text: written in mustard. Ray chuckles and starts mopping, quickly realizing
text: he's made a discovery with the ketchup/mustard combo wax.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Huh! Who woulda' thought the
dialog: combination of these condiments
dialog: would leave such a shine...
speaker_heading: WHIP BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Mrs Dunne sits with them and dishes up apple pie.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Then a sleep-over is okay by me.
dialog: Okay boys, eat up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's
dialog: pie!
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: So boys, how was your first day?
text: HARRY and Lloyd talk at the same time interrupting each other excitedly
text: eating while talking, spraying food all over their table. Mrs. Dunne
text: patiently listens to their gibberish as food flies out of their mouth.
scene_heading: EXT. HARRY'S HOUSE ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
text: A light is on in the upstairs window.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: HARRY and Lloyd are in cowboy and spaceman pajamas. Harry is leaning
text: over his bed playing cards with Lloyd who is lying on the floor.
text: LLOYD holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Got any crazy eights?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Go fish.
text: LLOYD pulls a card off the top of the deck and looks at it. It's a
text: King. We see he already has two in his hand. He throws it down, face
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Nothin'.
text: HARRY places a two down beside it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: War!
text: LLOYD hands him a dice. Harry rolls a four.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Ha! Now move your peg seven spaces
dialog: and put your shirt on backwards.
dialog: Boy, you really suck at this game.
text: HARRY's shirt is already on backwards. He turns it the right side
text: around and Lloyd cracks up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, yeah. Well I almost always
dialog: beat Captain Rob.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Who's Captain Rob?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just a guy I hang out with.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I know the type. Lives in the
text: basement, smells like a sponge...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No! Captain Rob is seven feet
dialog: tall, wears an eye patch, got a
dialog: hook for a hand...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sounds like a pirate.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What? No no. He's got a parrot on
text: his shoulder, buries treasure...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah, he's a pirate.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't think so. This guy drinks
dialog: rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho"
dialog: has a peg leg...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Peg leg?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, go-cart accident.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Exactly! A pirate!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If he heard you talking like that
dialog: he'd make you walk the plank.
dialog: (moving dice)
dialog: Three, two, one. Now it's your
dialog: turn, spin.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now
dialog: swallow it!
text: LLOYD tosses the monopoly game piece into Harry's mouth. He chokes it

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Mmm, that's good top hat.
text: MRS. DUNNE enters.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Hey you two. Lights out.
speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Only If I can be on the bottom
text: They jump into the top and bottom of Harry's bunk-beds.
text: MRS. DUNNEr gives harry a kiss as he tucks himself in.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: â€˜Night, mom.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: â€˜Night, Mrs. D.
text: She leans up to Lloyd and gives him a peck on the forehead.
speaker_heading: MRS. DUNNE
dialog: Thank you, for being a friend to my
speaker_heading: HARRY.
text: She turns off the light and exits. Lloyd is a little taken aback from
text: the kiss. He leans down to Harry.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Whoa. What was that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Your mom made a move on me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She did not.
text: INT.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: LLOYD, she's my mom.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I can't help my heart. And when
dialog: I'm your dad, you'll have to do as
dialog: I say.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Will not.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Don't use that tone with me, young
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I will stop this car right now.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're not my real dad.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You take that back!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut Up! Buttlick!
speaker_heading: LLOYD

text: They don't even notice him.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're it.
text: LLOYD and Harry tag back and forth a half dozen times.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Please pay me two fifty.
scene_heading: LLOYD TAGS Cale.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're it.
text: They both stare at him for a long beat. He doesn't move.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: You're it.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: No, I'm not it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, you are. He touched you.
dialog: You're "it" until you touch someone
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: I have five kids at home, I know
dialog: how it works. I'm just not "it".
dialog: Okay guys? Two fifty.
text: LLOYD grabs the Cale's arm and makes it touch Harry.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: You're it.
text: HARRY immediately tags the store employee back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're it.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Guys. Give me the two fifty and go
dialog: away.
text: HARRY grabs his other arm and tags Lloyd with it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Lloyd)
dialog: You're it.
text: LLOYD immediately tags the store employee back.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're it.
text: Then Lloyd grabs the guy's arm and tags Harry.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: You're it.
text: This goes back and forth almost impossibly fast. Harry with one arm and
text: Lloyd with the other. They say, "You're it" with each tag. Cale's arms
text: are now flailing.
text: He finally erupts.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Enough! !
text: He tags Lloyd. Hard.
speaker_heading: CALE (cont'd)
dialog: (building anger)
dialog: You're it!
speaker_heading: CALE (cont'd)
dialog: No touch backs, no do overs, no
dialog: erasees, stamped to infinity plus
dialog: one and THIS WHOLE STORE IS HOME
dialog: FREE! !
text: HARRY and Lloyd look impressed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can he do that?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (staring at the clerk)
dialog: HARRY, he can and he did. And now
text: it's on like Donkey Kong.
text: LLOYD and the Cale glare at each other.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - MOMENTS LATER
text: HARRY and Lloyd walk out of the store sipping their drinks.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: These are really cold, huh?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's why you have to drink it
dialog: fast, trust me.
text: They both take huge fast sips.
text: Our angle follows the icy liquid INTO THE STRAW and then we move (in a
text: stylized way) into Harry's brain to see BLOOD VESSELS STOP and the
dialog: brain get FROSTED OVER.
text: Then PULL OUT from Harry's head to see a quick half-dissolve that shows
text: three-quarters of his brain with a layer of white frost.
text: They both continue to get brain freezes as the scene goes on but they
dialog: don't realize it's from the drink.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Owww... refreshing.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Ow... What do you want to do,
speaker_heading: HARRY?
text: LLOYD gets a brain freeze. Harry keeps slurping.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: Owww.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't know. Owwww.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Maybe I should go home and grade
dialog: papers. Owwww.
text: They sip harder. Their eyes twitch as the pain sears through their
dialog: heads.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: My head is suddenly killing me.
dialog: Maybe it's from all the learning
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Put some ice on it.
text: He sips some more.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Owww.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: And my mouph is frozen.
text: JESSICA jogs over. She's wearing tight running shorts and a jogging-
text: bikini top.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Hey guys.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Heddo Jeth-ica.
text: Because of the brain freeze, Harry and Lloyd both talk to her with very
text: slurred speech and drooling a little. Jessica talks to them sweetly,
dialog: like they're slow.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: HARRY, I heard Collins has you in
dialog: some kind of special class.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: If dou're trying to get in, dou're
dialog: doo late.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Oh no, I know that class isn't for
dialog: me. But I'm happy for you guys.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Do you thill want to do an arwticle
dialog: on me, Jethica?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Yes, you and the whole Special
dialog: Needs class.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Why ith dat newth?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: This school's never had one before.
dialog: I'd like to talk to you and all
dialog: your special friends.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-ece-
text: wald twrip.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: A field trip? Maybe I'll join you.
dialog: See you tomorrow.
text: She jogs off, her tight shorts and top bouncing as she goes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: There she goes, now wearing nothing
text: but her underwear.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What a nerd. I don't know where
dialog: that girl's ever gonna find a
dialog: husband.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: PRINCIPAL COLLINS and Ms. Heller are in his office. It's the only light
text: on in the building. Don Ho's "Tiny Bubbles" plays on a record player.
text: Ms. Heller wears a coconut bra and a grass skirt. She does a hula for
text: Collins. He sips his tenth umbrella'd drink and snaps a Polaroid.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Knock knock.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (modelling)
dialog: Guess what"s under these coconuts.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: It's a surprise.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Well I've got a little surprise for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: You got the Extender?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: No. No. I heard from Superintendent
dialog: ZIMMER this morning and evidently
dialog: he's so impressed with our Special
dialog: Needs class, he's bringing Richard
dialog: MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving
dialog: Day parade- check in hand.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Monkey, this is too exciting! I
dialog: can't believe our dream is coming
dialog: true.
text: Collins picks up a POLAROID CAMERA.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Smile sweetheart.
text: He snaps a shot of Ms. Heller's chest. He waves it dry.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
text: More pictures for the chest.
text: He opens a chest by his desk and drops the photos into it.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: So what do you keep in there?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I
dialog: tape everything that goes on in
dialog: this office.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Everything?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Everything. Just for the record.
text: He hits the stop button on small tape recorder in an open drawer of his
text: desk. He ejects the tape and puts it into the wooden chest.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Oh, just like the President.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Just like the President.
text: Angle holds on the chest, which Collins has left unlocked.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - A LITTLE LATER
text: LLOYD runs up and sees Harry, who's dressed like a QUEEN, complete with
text: tiara and flowing gown made from a drape.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: LLOYD, where've you been? I've
dialog: been waiting forever. I'm so
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sorry. Why are you dressed like a
dialog: Queen! ?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: -..cause you said...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: HARRY, I said don't â€˜dress like a
dialog: Queen"!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (getting it)
dialog: Oh... that makes much more sense. I
dialog: had a heck of time getting these
dialog: drapes from my mom. You don't want
dialog: to know where I put the cord.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: HARRY! Here he comes.
text: We see Cale the clerk closing up the store. Lloyd and Harry sneak over.
text: Cale turns and sees Lloyd the Ninja and Harry the Queen.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: So you're out of the store, huh?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (holding back the
dialog: urprise)
dialog: Actually we have something for you.
text: LLOYD taps him lightly on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're it!
text: The Ninja and the Queen run away laughing maniacally. Cale looks
text: confused and hurt.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: JESSICA, carrying a camera, approaches Ms. Heller getting out of her
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on
dialog: your field trip? I'm thinking of
dialog: doing a story on your special needs
dialog: class.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: I'm not interested. Not after the
dialog: smear story you did on my chicken
dialog: sushi.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Well, when 200 students are
dialog: hospitalized with stomach cramps I
dialog: think it's newsworthy.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Nevertheless, you could have
dialog: mentioned the sauce.
dialog: (noticing camera)
dialog: Well, I see you have a camera.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: So can I come along?
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (grabs the camera)
dialog: No.
text: JESSICA notices something under Ms. Heller's shirt.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Are you wearing a coconut bra?
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Oh, you're good.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Why are you teaching Special Needs?
dialog: You're the lunch lady.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Dietician! This interview is over.
dialog: You can have the camera back
dialog: tomorrow. Come by the classroom.
text: Heller heads off.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: You mean the lunch room?
text: Heller stops and turns back to her.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Well played.
text: MS. HELLER storms away, leaving a confused Jessica.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
text: LLOYD unrolls the map. Behind them there is a 'SLOW CHILDREN CROSSING'
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: According to the map, we're just
text: about at school.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, but we still haven't found
dialog: any treasure.
text: A long yellow school bus is parked in front of the school. TURK, Ching
text: Chong and Carl stand next to the front door.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I think we may have found something
dialog: even better.
text: The bus now appears to be GETTING LONGER! Then we see that it was
text: actually a long bus PARKED BEHIND a SUPER-SHORT BUS.
dialog: SFX: Majestic chorus.
dialog: They look like they've seen the Holy Grail (if they knew what that
dialog: was).
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: Look! Look!
text: The short bus is even shorter than a regular short bus. It's custom
text: suited to the Special Needs class, as it only has three rows of seats.
text: Harry and Lloyd run up to it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Our own special bus.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How do you know it's for us?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: Duh. The cool kids sit in the back
dialog: of the bus. Here, every row is in
dialog: the back. We're all cool!
text: LLOYD and Harry run in. Lloyd runs as fast as he can down the tiny
text: aisle, and smacks into the back of the bus.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: (brings head up - giddy)
dialog: It's even shorter than I imagined!
text: HARRY runs smack into the back of the bus.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you sure? It feels about right
dialog: to me.
text: LLOYD gets up and again runs into the back of the bus.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Nope. I was right.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wanna bet?
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: In the parking lot, Jessica approaches the Special needs kids
text: congregating outside the short bus. Over the following, we continue to
text: hear the thumping of Harry and Lloyd smash into the back of the bus.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: TURK, what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: special Needs class.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Being a jerk doesn't make you
dialog: special.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: You're just jealous.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: And, Ching Chong, you're not a
dialog: Special Needs kid. You're just a
dialog: foreign exchange student.
speaker_heading: CHING CHONG
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: I ride with my man.
text: She hugs Turk and buries her face in his chest.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (to Jessica)
dialog: This is the greatest class ever,
dialog: don't ruin it.
text: They start to board the bus as Ms. Heller approaches.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (to Jessica)
dialog: I thought I told you to get lost.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Look Ms. Heller, there's something
dialog: fishy here, and I don't think it's
dialog: Friday's special.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: I wouldn't know. Being that I'm
dialog: just the teacher and all.
text: MARGIE, the BUS DRIVER, a crotchety old matron in her early sixties,
text: passes Ms. Heller and boards the bus.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: You ever have one of those days
dialog: when you just want to drive the bus
dialog: into a wall and end it all?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Okay, everyone in.
text: MS. HELLER follows her on and slams the door in Jessica's face. Jessica
text: looks determined. She's found her story!
scene_heading: INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: MS. HELLER sits behind Margie as she starts the engine.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Let's go Margie. The museum ain't
dialog: going to teach itself.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Museum huh, haven't been there
dialog: since my husband left me. I love
dialog: art.
text: She throws it in gear and pulls away.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: As the bus heads up the street, Jessica hops into her PARENT'S STATION
text: WAGON, which is actually three or four feet LONGER than the short bus!
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: This is a much bigger story than
text: four color pens.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - MOMENTS LATER
text: The bus pulls to a stop. On the corner is a NEBBISH GUY carrying a fish
text: tank. He waits - then Margie waves him to go across. Then she honks the
text: horn, LOUD. He jumps - throwing the fish tank in the air.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Fun stuff.
text: She drives on - BURNING RUBBER! We see that Jessica is following.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER
text: MS. HELLER looks out the back window and sees Jessica following in her
dialog: station wagon.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll
dialog: give you a scoop... of short bus.
dialog: (to Margie)
dialog: Lose her!
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Loser... oh yeah he was a loser
dialog: alright. A big loser.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: He was a big loser! What are you
dialog: deaf! ?
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Uh, no and I don't
dialog: appreciate...turn down here!
text: MARGIE yanks the wheel, making a sharp turn to the left. We CRANE down
text: as it passes. And pick it up further down the street. Our ANGLE is
text: inside a RECORD STORE as we see the bus make a hard right turn -
text: followed by Jessica.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET HILLS - CONTINUOUS
text: The bus careens down the street followed by Jessica's station wagon.
text: Jessica is almost along side them.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Don't let her pass!
text: Heller leans forward and hits the 'NO PASSING' TOGGLE.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: SIDE OF THE BUS as the big 'No Passing' SIGN FLIPS OUT, close to
text: Jessica's windshield. She almost HITS IT then slows.
speaker_heading: MARGIE O.S.
dialog: Yeah it started with a pass...
scene_heading: INT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: -.."hi cutie, nice knockers", then
dialog: same old same old.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (to Margie)
dialog: That's great, now make a left, then
dialog: straight!
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Oh, yeah he was straight all right,
dialog: just wasn't very good in the sack.
dialog: I used to give him directions.
dialog: Higher, lower, faster, harder,
dialog: small circles, do the alphabet.
dialog: Useless.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: REAR OF THE BUS, red lights flash, sign reads: 'No Passing When Red
text: Lights Flash'. The road narrows so Jessica must again fall in line
text: behind her.
scene_heading: INT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: MS. HELLER sees a street up ahead.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Left here! Left!
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: You bet I left him, took the dog
dialog: and we was history.
text: MS. HELLER sees a tiny alley between two buildings. They turn left,
text: power-sliding down an alley, Jessica misses the turn and makes a one-
dialog: eighty.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (looking behind them)
dialog: Ha! Too big to make the turn!
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: No, it actually fit quite nicely.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well, except for the fact that it
dialog: wasn't really as long as it was
dialog: wide.
scene_heading: INT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: They do a rough turn and exit the alley. Ms. Heller looks around for
dialog: Jessica.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: I think you did it.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Damn right I did it. Went back and
dialog: set the house on fire, his little
dialog: floozy testified in court - and I
dialog: ended up doing ten years at Rikers,
dialog: got my teeth knocked out by Mike
dialog: the Dyke.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (now paying attention)
dialog: What the hell are you talking
dialog: about?
text: ANGLE ON: Lloyd, Harry and Carl. Once again, Carl is starting to get
text: better, he notices his surroundings.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hey, I'm not supposed to be on the
dialog: short bus. I've got a Calculus
dialog: class.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to Harry, whimsical)
dialog: He's a dreamer.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, actually I think I'm all
dialog: better.
text: ANGLE ON: Heller. IN THE MIRROR, she sees Jessica pull up behind them.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Turn here! Go, go, go!
text: And she SLAMS her foot on Margie's gas pedal, as Margie makes a turn
text: through a DIRT CONSTRUCTION SITE.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: In the lot, the bus leaves a trail of dust as Jessica's car follows.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORT STEEP STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: A serene moment before a far away scream is heard, then the SHORT BUS
text: CRASHES THROUGH A FENCE, fully launched in the air!
text: While in the air, our angle FLOWS INTO the bus.
scene_heading: INT. SHORT BUS SLOW-MO - CONTINUOUS
text: In ULTRA-SLOW MOTION, it's ZERO GRAVITY as we TRACK through the bus to
dialog: see:
text: MARGIE'S UNFAZED, but her dentures FLOAT OUT OF HER MOUTH. MS. HELLER,
text: frozen in a scream, legs in the air. As CARL floats past TOBY, then
text: past LEWIS, CHING CHONG and TURK who are in a jumble of arms and legs.
text: CARL continues on to HARRY and LLOYD who act as if they are on Apollo
text: 13, tongue's out both chasing the same FREEZE-DRIED ICE CREAM, come
text: together almost for a KISS, then grossed out, break apart. Other food
text: from their lunch bags is floating around.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: We BURST OUT of the bus as it LANDS ROUGHLY ON THE STREET, SLAMMING
text: CARL hard against the back window, followed by a mess of food stuffs
text: and Margie's dentures that get slammed against the window and
text: sandwiched by half of a peanut butter sandwich. The Short Bus ambles
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: HARRY (0.S.)
dialog: (re: bus ride)
dialog: Again, again!
text: Everyone shouts "Again!".
scene_heading: EXT. JESSICA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: She lands even more roughly, and must LOCK UP HER BRAKES as a BIG TRUCK
text: backs into her path. Beyond the truck she sees the Short Bus driving
text: away. She's defeated.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM LOBBY - LATER - DAY
text: WE SEE the bus on the street outside the glass doors.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER (0.S.)
dialog: Here we are.
text: The kids file inside. They are disheveled, covered in food, drooling,
text: tripping, Carl's back to his old, cloudy way - you get the picture.
text: TWO PASSERSBY, a MAN and a WOMAN, notice the motley crew.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (sympathetic)
dialog: special needs.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Well, aren't they just so sweet.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Everyone find a partner. You're
dialog: not any good to me dead.
text: The class ad-libs partnering up: Turk with Ching Chong, Toby with
text: Terri, Lewis with Carl. Harry and Lloyd look around nervously for a
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been
dialog: my partner.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sucks for you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who's your partner?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (looks around at the
dialog: obviously partnered class)
dialog: I don't know. I haven't decided
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can
dialog: I say this... you and I
dialog: could...perhaps ...maybe...uh...
dialog: partner up?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You and me? Dream on, desperado.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Sorry. You're right, field
dialog: trip partner is a big commitment.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'm kidding! Of course I'll be
dialog: your partner.
text: LLOYD puts his arm around Harry and they head into the museum.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: You have some serious self-worth
dialog: issues, my ugly, stupid, pudgy
dialog: little friend.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stop it, you're embarrassing me.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - LATER
text: CLOSE ON a giant white polar bear in menacing pose, arms up, teeth
dialog: bared.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I've always wanted to be a polar
text: bear. Tall, strong, six stomachs.
dialog: He's the most beautiful creature in
dialog: the forest.
text: REVEAL Harry and Lloyd looking up at the polar bear. Harry's in awe.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's a cow, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, I could go for a tall glass

text: MS. HELLER ENTERS and corrals Harry, Lloyd, and the rest of the Special
dialog: Needs class.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Okay, class, everyone gather round.
dialog: Mr. Collins wants a picture to
dialog: prove you were here.
dialog: (catching herself)
dialog: And to cherish.
text: She unfurls a banner, and hands it to Turk and Ching Chong to hold. It
text: reads "SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS FIELD TRIP 1986".
text: She spots a nearby MUSEUM DOCENT.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER (cont'd)
dialog: Excuse me, Do you mind?
text: She hands her camera to the Docent who snaps their photo.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER (cont'd)
dialog: Good, got it.
dialog: (to docent)
dialog: How long is the average field trip
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DOCENT
dialog: To fully experience all we have to
dialog: offer? Maybe two hours.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Alright. I'll be back in four.
dialog: Give them the tour twice and talk
dialog: slowly.
text: She puts the camera away and walks off.
speaker_heading: DOCENT
dialog: (to class)
dialog: Okay, okay, listen up everybody.
dialog: Welcome to the Shea Museum of
dialog: Natural History. Where your
dialog: journey into the past comes alive!
text: She turns and faces the polar bear.
speaker_heading: DOCENT (cont'd)
dialog: (bad acting polar bear)
dialog: Grrr. Roar. Grrr. My name is
dialog: Ursus Maritmus and I live in parts
dialog: of Northern Canada and the
dialog: Antarctic. Grr. Roar. Grr. I
dialog: rely on a keen sense of a smell to

dialog: Roar.
text: She turns back around in a menacing polar bear pose and sees everyone's
text: gone except for Harry and Lloyd.
speaker_heading: DOCENT (cont'd)
dialog: Uh-oh scared them away. Too many
dialog: "Roars."
text: The young boy raises his hand.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: (points)
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: DOCENT
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Like I said, Ursus Maritimus.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to boy with authority)
dialog: That's not a real name. His

speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: What's his name?
text: He points to a Snow Fox.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Also Snowy.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY

dialog: LLOYD Christmas - Special Needs.
dialog: I'll take over from here ma'am.
text: She just eyes him passively then walks away.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: (to kid)
dialog: You see, the animal kingdom is
dialog: actually very simple. Everything
dialog: is named Snowy, at least in cold
dialog: climates. On the other hand,
dialog: "Scorchy" over here...
text: LLOYD points to a camel in a desert exhibit and leads the kid off,

speaker_heading: HARRY !
speaker_heading: HARRY

dialog: want you to know this whole thing
dialog: is a scam.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a
dialog: fake.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It
dialog: hasn't moved in half an hour. And
dialog: those Eskimos over there...I'm sure
dialog: at least one of them is a
text: mannequin.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I
dialog: have something that's kind of

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, you want to talk about your
dialog: delicates?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Are you trying to be funny? Or are
dialog: you actually re--, re...special
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We're all special. Everyone Lloyd
dialog: and I chose for the class is

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: You and Lloyd chose the class!?
text: JESSICA, thinks a moment as she figures things out.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (cont'd)
dialog: This is starting to make more
dialog: sense.
text: Just then, Jessica sees Turk walking down a corridor towards them -
text: he's goofing around with Lewis and Ching Chong.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (cont'd)
dialog: We can't really talk here. Can you
dialog: come to my house tonight?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Come over around seven.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: O'clock?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: HARRY

text: JESSICA walks off.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: A date.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER
text: ANGLE ON the empty hallway. WE HEAR muffled voices from above. Some
text: dust falls into frame then ABRUPTLY, Harry and LLOYD fall directly in
text: front of us from above. With some plaster ceiling following. Harry
dialog: loved the fall, Lloyd doesn't much care.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sorry about that Harry, first time
dialog: I've brought a friend up there. You
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yea!
text: LLOYD throws a ceiling piece back up and they walk on.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: So Lloyd, you gotta help me. A
dialog: real live date with a real live
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think she wants me to come over
dialog: to put me into the right position
dialog: to check out her delicates, what
dialog: ever that means.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get
dialog: "some".
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Some what?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You know... She's gonna be all over
dialog: you like a barrel of monkeys, with
text: her tight shirt and short skirt...
dialog: Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, Lloyd. You must know
dialog: someone I can talk to.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sure I do. On one condition.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You can't marry my mom.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It's really not up to you, Harry.
dialog: But we just want you to feel like
dialog: you're part of the decision.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Alright, if you really want to go
dialog: down this road, well girl's like
dialog: chocolate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER
text: Tight on a candy vending machine. HARRY sees CHOCOLATE BARS for sale
text: behind the glass, among other edible goodies including CLEAR PACKAGES
text: OF PEANUTS called: SONNIE JEWEL PEANUTS, and next to it - VIOLET
text: CRUMBLE He puts in some coins and presses what he thinks the code for
text: chocolate is. But he's off by one and the peanuts next to the chocolate
text: drops down. He tries again. And the Violet Crumble drops down. Again,
text: some lifesavers fall. He tries again. Nope. Baked apple pie. He puts in
dialog: more coins...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: The vending machine is almost completely empty -- except for the
text: chocolate bars. Snack goods fill the dispenser tray and spill out onto
text: the floor around Harry. He reaches in and is out of coins. Frustrated,
text: he reaches up into the candy return at the bottom. After a few beats,
text: the look on his face tells us he's stuck. Maybe forever.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - ABOUT A HALF-HOUR LATER
text: HARRY's arm is now incredibly jammed half-way up INTO THE MACHINE. He's
text: twisted into a pretzel, and just as he's about to grab a HANDFUL of the
text: chocolate bars from the rack inside. Then the whole machine CRASHES
scene_heading: DOWN ON HIM.
text: CLOSE ON: His hand reaching out, grabs some of the prized chocolate
text: bars and Sonnie Jewel Peanuts that have spilled on the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON Harry outside her front door.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (practicing)
dialog: Hello, Jessica. It's nice to see
dialog: you, Jessica. No that's not right.
dialog: JESSICA, hi. It's Harry, remember
dialog: me from before? No, that's stupid.
dialog: JESSICA, hello. Hello, Jessica.
dialog: JESSICA Jessica Jessica. Mrs.
dialog: HARRY Jessica. Mr. Harry Jessica.
scene_heading: J-e-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i--
speaker_heading: JESSICA O.S.
speaker_heading: HARRY !
text: Reveal Harry has actually been standing in front of Jessica the whole
dialog: time. She's putting a stop to this. But handles it with kid gloves,
text: still not sure if he's mentally challenged.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: HARRY, let's go inside.
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: JESSICA ushers Harry inside.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Wipe your feet. My parents are
dialog: totally anal.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ooh gross.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Would you like something to drink?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, but I'm buying.
text: He giggles, clearly nervous beyond belief.
dialog: JESSICA HARRY, I have a lot of questions to ask you so let's just do it
dialog: upstairs? HARRY Good plan. I'm not ready for "downstairs."
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: JESSICA sits on the bed, going over notes.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Okay, there's a lot for us to go
dialog: over, so it may get hard for you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard
dialog: for me? Hard for me?
dialog: (then)
dialog: You had questions?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I checked with the school board,
dialog: she's not an accredited teacher.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's okay. Lloyd's really the
text: one teaching the class.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She says that she's got more
dialog: important things to do now that the
dialog: new mall opened.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Sit down, I have something to tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (sits on radiator)
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Well, I'll tell you what I think.
dialog: I think she and Principal Collins
dialog: are embezzling money from the
dialog: school, and I think they've been
dialog: doing it for years.
text: CLOSE UP on Harry's face as she continues to lay out her theory. He's
text: hasn't paid any attention to her.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Wow, She's really making me feel
dialog: hot. Must be those feelings Lloyd
dialog: was talking about.
text: As she prattles on, Harry doesn't realize the "small bench" he sat on
text: is actually a radiator.
text: CLOSE UP on Harry's butt as steam wafts up.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: And if that's not bad enough, I
dialog: think your so-called 'Special Needs
dialog: class' is all a scam! But I just
dialog: need proof.
text: HARRY's not really hearing any of this.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I don't know how long I can sit
dialog: here. I didn't think the first time
dialog: would hurt so much...
dialog: (out loud)
dialog: Especially in the ass.
text: She goes to him, puts hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: What? Well now I'm in a position
dialog: where I may just heed your help.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Po, po, position...? Hey, here's
dialog: thought, have you a bathroom?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
text: Just down the hall.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Very good. Back in a jiff.
text: He does a little bow and exits the bedroom slowly so Jessica doesn't
text: see his scalded butt.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: HARRY walks down the hallway in utter pain. He can't make any noise,
text: but is face looks like he's about to burst. WE SEE SMOKE drifting up
dialog: from his hot ass.
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: HARRY backs into the bathroom and slowly closes the door. He carefully
dialog: locks it, then--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
text: Three minutes of scalding ass comes out in a primal cry. He jumps up
text: and down in pain and grabs his butt in a desperate attempt to cool it
text: off. Then he looks at his hand. It's brown with peanuts in it.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
dialog: Could the heat have possibly compromised his sphincter control? He
text: brings his hand up and inspects it. Then he smells it. Then he tastes
text: it (not bad). Then he examines his stained hand a little closer, picks
text: off a coagulated CHUNK OF PEANUT, pops that in his mouth and begins
dialog: eating it.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Yummy.
text: He reaches back down into his pants and this time pulls out the Sonnie
text: Day Peanuts bag and chocolate bar wrapper. A huge wave of relief wafts
text: over his face. He takes another lick as he grabs a white towel off the
text: rack and starts to wipe off the chocolate. He makes grunting noises as
text: he wipes.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, what a mess.
text: In trying to clean-up he only make its worse. Chocolate is quickly
text: everywhere: On his hands, face, shirt, towels, all over his pants, the
text: sink, the mirrors, etc. He panics.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (0.S.)
dialog: HARRY? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you kidding? I couldn't be
dialog: more okay.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (0.S.)
dialog: My mom wants to know if you can
dialog: stay for dinner.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you kidding? I'll be down in a
dialog: "T-crapped-my-pants."
speaker_heading: JESSICA (0.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Coming.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - SAME TIME
text: LLOYD cruises down the sidewalk on Ray's floor waxer. The "WAX ON"

scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: JESSICA 0.8.
dialog: HARRY, are you coming down?

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I kinda screwed things up.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'm sure you're overreacting.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're always your harshest critic.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She wants me to stay for dinner, I
dialog: don't know what to say to her.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay, I saw this in a movie once.
text: Open the dining room window and
dialog: follow my lead. Say what I say.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you
dialog: downstairs, I gotta find some

text: HARRY glances in a different window and sees some dry cleaning that
text: looks like a looks like a man's blue suit hanging on a hook.
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: HARRY walks down the stairs wearing the suit.
text: TILT TO REVEAL it's actually a woman's pant suit with shoulder pads and
text: a very blousy cut jacket a la Nancy Regan circa 1985.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: What are you wearing?
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL MAIN ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: really asked Lloyd if he farted.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Well, something stinks.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Maybe it's this mix tape I made

text: He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited!
dialog: So, are you ready to take me to the

scene_heading: INT. COLLINS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: throwing
dialog: it and
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Nothing.
text: LLOYD enters, seductively sliding onto Collins' desk.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (cont'd)

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Let's just do it and get out of

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh, wow. Straight to the business.
dialog: But okay, I'll get ready.
text: LLOYD lifts his leg up to take off a shoe. He hops around on the other

speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: I just can't get it off.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I'm so close I can feel it.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Me too. I'm almost there.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: That's it. I'm done.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That was fast. Well, did you at

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: No, it was a complete waste of
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This is so embarrassing, it's never

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Boyfriend? What about all that

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. COLLINS' OFFICE - LATER
text: The office is back to normal. Lloyd is just finishing when he picks a
text: lamp off the ground and spies a steel chest with a padlock sitting
text: under a table in the center of the room.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh. My. God. The treasure chest.
dialog: This must be the chest Harry's been
dialog: looking for. This is it. I found

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: LLOYD

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: HARRY sits in a chair NOT watching an episode of LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY in

text: window. After a beat we see Lloyd's head slowly appear in the window
text: straining as hard as a face possibly could to look over the ledge. It
text: can't hold the position any more and drops out of frame. A second
text: later, a huge amount of gravel and stones pelt the window. Then a
text: gigantic cinder block comes flying through the glass. The window
text: explodes. Harry looks at the cinder block. There is a note attached:
text: "LOOK OUT WINDOW. I'M TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION."
scene_heading: EXT. HARRY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Reveal Harry's on the first floor, and Lloyd is inches away outside the

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: HARRY! I found the treasure!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Go away, assface.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Did you hear what I said? The
dialog: treasure! Like on your map!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, right. Why don't you show it
dialog: to your "girlfriend"?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: JESSICA and I are through. I
dialog: couldn't stand being with her
dialog: knowing you liked her. It wasn't
dialog: worth our friendship. Oh, and she
dialog: also has a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Captain Rob came back?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Captain Rob)
dialog: Yeah, he does sound like a rat

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, there's no reason to use that
dialog: kind of language!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (beat, then laughs)
dialog: Good one, Captain Rob. He does
dialog: look like a you-know-what.
speaker_heading: LLOYD

scene_heading: INT. RAY'S BASEMENT APARTMENT
text: LLOYD has stuffed pillows and blankets and has built a stuffed Harry.

scene_heading: INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - NEXT MORNING

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: HARRY, would you like to share with
dialog: the rest of us what's so funny?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You wouldn't get it. Just a

text: LLOYD snaps a piece of chalk in jealous rage.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay, class. Who can tell me who
dialog: painted the Declaration of
dialog: Independence?
text: The class ignores him, but Harry shoots his hand in the air.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ooh, ooh. Call on me!
text: LLOYD looks around the class, pretending not to see Harry. TURK and
text: Ching Chong are making out, Terri is painting her nails, Toby is asleep
text: on her lap. Carl is near a black-board that has the 'x's and 'o's of a
text: football play, he's scribbling circles around one of the 'x's ,

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me, me, me!
speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HARRY

scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. PETE'S FISH SHANTY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: OWNER

speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Hey, Lloyd.

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Duh. I'm in your class at school.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh my God, it's really you. You're

speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I don't know if you'd call us
dialog: "friends"...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You really are a pirate.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Can you believe it?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: So I'm an â€œarrrrrs-hole", eh
dialog: Captain Rob?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: LLOYD exits frame. We hold a beat, as Lewis hands out a flyer then

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I want my friend back!
text: LLOYD storms off. Lewis POV: From the hole in the head, he sees the

speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: I think I have to let you go. And
dialog: you gotta pay for the busted head.
text: INT. HARRY'S LIVING ROOM N NEXT MORNING There is STATIC on the TV,
text: Harry's fallen asleep on the couch. Pebbles hit his now taped up
text: window, it wakes him up. HARRY looks and sees Lloyd's head popping up
text: and down as if jumping up from a lower floor. He walks over revealing
text: they are on the first floor, and Lloyd's outside doing push-ups
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: LLOYD, doing girlie push-ups is not
dialog: going to impress me.
text: LLOYD stands up.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Well how about this.

text: LLOYD's face falls.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: (ecstatic)

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: The documents. The photos! The

speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: The evidence of what?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Sweetheart keep up with me for half

text: Now Ms. Heller starts to panic.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: I don't know where it is. It's not

speaker_heading: MS. HELLER

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS

text: HARRY and Lloyd, best friends once again, sit near the front.
speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: A turd.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Not things that float. Ideas for a

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Or maybe crossing a river!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Like the Atlantic!
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: So it's settled.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You mean we have to parade around

speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: On a float of George Washington?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: This is gonna be the best

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: We're gonna look like idiots.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Did I mention if you don't make a
dialog: float, there'll be no Special Needs
dialog: class next semester?
text: LLOYD and Harry look horrified.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER (cont'd)
dialog: Which means back to homework, real

text: This sinks in for a beat, then as one they all run out.
scene_heading: EXT. FLOAT BUILDING MONTAGE - DAY
text: We hear the theme from the "A-Team" re-mixed with an Eban Schletter

text: grabbing the pieces that will make up the float. They include: HANDS
text: grab tools off of the tractor shed's wall.
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a hammer driving nails.
text: EXTREME ANGLE on a wood saw cutting through wood. TURK rips out some
text: heating duct, hands it down to Ching Chong.
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a paint brush painting on wood. LLOYD carrying
text: rolls of toilet paper from a supply room - trailing a piece from his
text: pants, err - I mean, poophole. CARL does a rush towards a chicken wire
text: fence - pulling it out around him. LEWIS, TOBY and TERRI roll him up in
text: it like it's a rug and sneakily walk away.
text: CLOSE ON the famous painting, "Washington Crossing the Delaware". Lewis

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Poor question. Too wordy. A good

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: If you have to ask, you don't know.

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You're it!
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Come on Harry, let's go.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Hey! That's my shopping cart!
text: The boys race off in the cart, down the street, following Collins.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL COLLINS CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: They are oblivious to the explosion behind them.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: So what did you say to my parents
dialog: on the phone?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Not to expect you tonight.
text: Through the rear window WE SEE Harry and Lloyd roll up in the cart and
text: crouch down.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME
text: HARRY and Lloyd grab on to the rear bumper of the car and hang on as
text: Collins drives on.
scene_heading: EXT CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: HARRY and Lloyd riding Collins' car through the streets. They swing out
text: into the street and almost crash head-on into a FIRE TRUCK with a
text: DALMATION riding on top. They turn back and watch it go away.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Cute puppy.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: He must be on his way to pee out a
dialog: fire.
text: Up ahead, they see a 'MR. SOFTEE' ICE CREAM TRUCK with a softserve cone
text: on top.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, look. Ice cream.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You thinking what I'm thinking?
text: As Collins' car stops for a red light, the boys race through the
text: intersection and grab a hold of the ice cream truck.
scene_heading: INT. MR. SOFTEE ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: We see that the DRIVER has no idea what's going on.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET - A LITTLE LATER
text: The boys are at the side window of the ice cream truck, now each
text: holding ice cream cones.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey Harry, want dessert!
text: They SPLIT OFF from the ice cream truck. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. COLEY DOG - HOT DOG CAR - CONTINUOUS TIGHT ON the Hot Dog

scene_heading: INT. COLLINS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: I'm going to ask you one last time
dialog: and if I don't get an answer, I
dialog: don't even want to think about the
dialog: consequences which would be
dialog: frightening to say the least.
dialog: Where's my chest, Jessica?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
text: Collins empties out Jessica's backpack. He holds up a tape.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Well, what have we here? It
text: appears be a tape.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: That's not your tape.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Then where did you get this not my
dialog: tape.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Don't play with me dear, you're way
dialog: out of your league.
text: Collins exits with the tape.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: HARRY and Lloyd road weary and wind blown, approach the house. They
text: peek in a window and see the back of Jessica's head. She's alone in the
text: room. Harry taps on the window.
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: JESSICA!
text: JESSICA turns, sees Harry and Lloyd outside the window. They are a mess
text: - covered in ice cream, ketchup and mustard.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (debonair)
dialog: Looks like the best man won.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why didn't you tell us your
dialog: boyfriend was Principal Collins?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: What? No! Look.
text: She holds up her hand which is handcuffed to the table.
speaker_heading: HARRY / LLOYD
dialog: Kinky!
text: Suddenly they hear the sound of Lloyd's mix tape.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hey, that's my mix tape! You're
dialog: using it for your seduction? I'm
dialog: flattered.
scene_heading: INT. COLLINS STUDY - CONTINUOUS
text: Collins is at a tape recorder, looking very confused at LLOYD's
text: singing. He presses fast forward and is annoyed when all he hears is
text: Lloyd's rambling.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: ... If I may quote the twentieth
dialog: century poet
dialog: (mispronounces 'Piscopo')
dialog: - Joe Piscahpo:
dialog: (Like Billy Crystal)
dialog: You look Marvelous...
scene_heading: INT. COLLINS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: LLOYD, when we were in Principal
dialog: Collins's office, did you see any
dialog: kind of chest?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I
dialog: know where that is.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You found my treasure? Why didn't
dialog: you tell me.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Three words. I did. But you were
dialog: all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, I'm listening now.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Me, too. This is my favorite part
dialog: of the tape.
text: LLOYD bops along as he listens to his mix tape.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: HARRY, Lloyd, listen to me. I only
dialog: have time to say this once.
dialog: Collins is a criminal. He's
dialog: kidnapped me. The evidence you
dialog: need to convict him is in that
dialog: chest. You've got to take what's
dialog: in that chest and make sure people
dialog: know about it before the parade
dialog: tomorrow and Collins and Heller get
dialog: their money and leave town...
text: The boys hear none of this. We hear their thoughts as their minds
dialog: wander.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (V.O.)
dialog: God she's cute. Look at her teeth.
dialog: I bet she could bite through
dialog: anything. Yes, yes she could.
text: JESSICA sees Lloyd nodding like he's paying attention. She looks at
text: Harry, who's also nodding.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I wonder what Lloyd's thinking
dialog: about?
text: (Harry glances over at
text: LLOYD, then back at
speaker_heading: JESSICA)
dialog: Look at all that hair. She must
dialog: have millions of tiny holes in her
dialog: head. Otherwise it would just
text: bunch all up on her brain...
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: So guys, you listening to me?
speaker_heading: HARRY / LLOYD
dialog: Yeah./ Sure.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Remember, before the parade.
speaker_heading: HARRY / LLOYD
dialog: Right, right. The parade.
text: Just then Ms. Heller ENTERS in the background with some SUITCASES.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey look, it's our teacher.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Of course, she's in on it too.
dialog: Don't let her see you. Just go get
dialog: that chest and show the world what
dialog: Collins has been doing. I'm staying
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (lewdly)
dialog: Obviously.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (calls out to Jessica)
dialog: So miss snoopy reporter girl, it
dialog: appears that you've snooped
dialog: yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed
dialog: yourself to a desk. Whose
dialog: wearing the Coconut bra now?
text: JESSICA just stares at her.
speaker_heading: MRS. HELLER
dialog: Well I just have one word for you.
dialog: Aloha. The one that means goodbye!
text: With confidence, Heller heads off down the hallway.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: (to Harry and Lloyd)
dialog: Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
dialog: I can take care of myself and I'm
dialog: getting the story every high school
dialog: reporter dreams of.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: "My dream date with Principal
dialog: Collins."
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I wish I was the one writing that
dialog: story.
scene_heading: INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - DAY
text: TIGHT ON the lock as Lloyd is about to break it. Harry stops him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know Lloyd, the real treasure
dialog: is our friendship.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: How true. But I still feel I
dialog: deserve more than you do of this
dialog: treasure. I mean, I found it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But my mom gave me the map.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I lugged it all over town!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I made the polar bear pants.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: But I ate your Mom's pie.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: I... found that rock.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: It was a diamond and you swallowed
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We were all out of top hats.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Enough! Look what this cursed
dialog: chest is doing to us.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't know who we are anymore.
text: TIGHT ON the trunk. Lloyd breaks the lock. They open the chest, MUSIC
text: SWELLS. WE SEE a shot of Collins' incriminating files, photos, etc.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: What is all this?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I have no idea - it's full of files
dialog: and documents and tapes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Do you know what this means?
speaker_heading: HARRY / LLOYD
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: We're rich!
text: They take the chest contents and throw it like gold coins.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Buddy, we hit the jackpot!
scene_heading: INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: HARRY and Lloyd rolling around in the papers and rubbing them all over
text: their bodies. Harry picks up a casette tape.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey Lloyd. This looks like
dialog: another one of your mix tapes.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Maybe the pirate who buried this
dialog: treasure chest made it. Put it on.
text: HARRY sticks the tape in a player.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0.S.)
dialog: Principal's log, September twenty
dialog: third. Check, check, sound check,
dialog: check.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, it's Principal Collins.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That makes total sense. The
text: treasure chest was in his office.
dialog: Which means Principal Collins is a
dialog: pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob
dialog: never mentioned him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's because Captain Rob is not a
dialog: pirate. We've been through this.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0.S.)
dialog: Testing, testing, one two three...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Boy, his mix tape really isn't as
dialog: good as yours, Lloyd.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0.S.)
dialog: Check, check, check, check...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Although he speaks pretty good
dialog: Chinese.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's not Chinese.
text: LLOYD fast forwards the tape. We hear FAST FORWARD NOISE.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: That's Chinese.
text: LLOYD presses play again.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0.S.)
dialog: ... Find idiots for phony Special
dialog: Needs class, take the Moffit grant
dialog: money and deposit it in an illegal
dialog: personal account...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hmm, I don't get it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What was it Jessica wanted us to do
dialog: with this chest again?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Something about showing the world
dialog: what Principal Collins has done.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right. She's so proud of her
dialog: boyfriend.
text: LLOYD fast forwards a little more.
speaker_heading: LLOYD sees the
dialog: Heller left.
speaker_heading: LLOYD starts's
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0.S.)
dialog: ... And that is how I, Principal
dialog: Collins, became the mastermind
dialog: behind this glorious plan. And the
dialog: Special Needs brats don't know
dialog: anything about it. It's the crime
dialog: of the century.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: He's right. We have committed the
dialog: crime of the century.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What? What did we do?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: We never thanked him for giving us
dialog: our Special Needs class.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (eureka!)
dialog: That's what Jessica was talking
dialog: about!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: She wants us to show the world what
dialog: a great guy Principal Collins is.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And like she said, do it before the
dialog: parade.
text: poor chalk drawing of a float on the blackboard that
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: A float!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's it. Build him a float for
dialog: the Thanksgiving Day parade!
text: modifying the float-sketch - it's scribble.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: HARRY, we found the real thing to
dialog: be thankful for. Screw George
dialog: Washington!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes. Screw George Washington. Just
dialog: like Marilyn Monroe did.
scene_heading: INT. TRACTOR SHED - THAT NIGHT
text: The doors open to REVEAL we're inside the darkened room as the overhead
text: door slides open revealing Harry and Lloyd, hands on hips, ready to
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ready Lloyd?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Put a fork in me Harry, lets get
dialog: started.
text: LLOYD hits the lights to REVEAL the float of George Washington built by
text: the Special Needs class. Lloyd picks up a sledgehammer.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (cont'd)
dialog: Good bye, George Washington, hello
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS.
text: HARRY stops him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wait a minute! Have you ever
dialog: noticed Principal Collins looks a
dialog: little like George Washington?
text: HARRY holds us a photo of Collins.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No. I think he looks a lot like
dialog: George Washington.
text: LLOYD starts to swing his hammer. Harry stops him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wait, wait!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: HARRY, are we gonna build this
dialog: thing or not?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may
dialog: already have what we want.
text: LLOYD takes a long look at Collins' photo, then at Washington's head.
text: He smiles at Harry.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Oh. I get it now.
text: Once again he raises his hammer to take another swing, and HARRY
text: restrains him, the two share an awkward moment.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - NEXT MORNING
text: We start CLOSE ON a small aquarium that has been all taped together
text: (from the bus chase), the NEBBISH GUY stands nearby as we BOOM UP past
text: a MIDWAY CARNIVAL to see the High School's Thanksgiving Day parade is
text: in progress. The bleachers are full of students and townspeople
text: watching. Cheerleaders carry a banner reading, "PROVIDENCE HILL HIGH
scene_heading: SCHOOL THANKSGIVING 1986".
scene_heading: EXT. BLEACHERS - CONTINUOUS
text: PRINCIPAL COLLINS is nervously watching. Heller approaches and sits
text: down next to him.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: So the chest is still out there
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows
dialog: up, we'll get our check and blow
dialog: this pop stand before anyone finds
dialog: out anything.
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: (looking at parade)
dialog: This band sounds terrible.
text: We see the marching band playing instruments that are old, damaged or
dialog: home made.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: I sold all the wind instruments.
dialog: (holds up tickets)
dialog: Hawaiian Air, business class. And
dialog: you like that new fur coat?
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Love it!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Well there's a reason why that
dialog: mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
text: In front of a MARCHING BAND is a boy leading a goat, holding a flag
text: reading "GO STALLIONS!"
speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: This is horse?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: No... no it's not horse, you see I
dialog: sold the horse.
text: Behind the boy, Ray is driving a Cadillac convertible, waving at the
text: crowd. A sign on the car reads "Custodian of the Year". And an ad that
dialog: READS: 'Buy Original Ray's WAX - made from real ketchup and mustard!'
scene_heading: EXT. TRACTOR SHED - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: TOBY (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell?
scene_heading: INT. TRACTOR SHED - CONTINUOUS
text: We HEAR THE MARCHING BAND in the distance, as the Special needs
text: students, Toby, Terri, Carl, Turk, Ching Chong and LEWIS are looking up
dialog: in disbelief.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: What'd you morons do? Where's
dialog: George Washington?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah, why'd you give him a
dialog: makeover?
text: REVEAL Harry and Lloyd putting the finishing touches on the NEW FLOAT.
text: They've RE-SCULPTED "Washington crossing the Delaware" into "Principal
text: Collins the Pirate". With his statue now on a PIRATE SHIP.
dialog: This is all made from found objects that were in the Special Needs
text: class and tractor shed. The statue's glasses are made from shovels and
text: George Washington's white hair is now black and he has bushy black
text: eyebrows matching Collins. Just then Lewis enters wearing the tattered
text: old horse mascot uniform and carrying the head. Half his hair is cut
text: close and tattered.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Sorry I'm late but I woke up tied
dialog: to the bed and...
text: He see's Washington/Collins eyebrows.
speaker_heading: LEWIS (cont'd)
dialog: Hey - that's my hair! Someone cut
dialog: it while I slept!
text: HARRY and Lloyd â€˜act casualâ€™ whistle and look around. The kids walk
text: closer in towards the float and we see: Washington's/Collins'
text: outstretched hand has been replaced with a pirate's hook fashioned from
text: the heating duct. There's a large sign that reads, "PRINCIPAL PIRATE"
text: and the original treasure chest is now prominently displayed as part of
text: the float. The whole thing is attached to Lloyd's waxer with a rope.
text: Harry and Lloyd walk to the side of the boat
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Guys, this is much better.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
text: PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater
dialog: American than George Washington
dialog: will ever be.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: I don't get it. Why'd you make him
dialog: a pirate?
speaker_heading: CHING CHONG (0.S.)
dialog: (breaks the silence)
dialog: I'll tell you why!
text: Reveal Ching Chong at the treasure chest looking through it. For the
text: first time Ching Chong speaks in a perfect American Accent.
speaker_heading: CHING CHONG (cont'd)
dialog: You won't believe these documents.
text: They provide evidence of a long
dialog: history of fraud and embezzlement
dialog: from the school by Principal
dialog: Collins and Ms. Heller, a.k.a. the
dialog: Lunch Lady.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh my god. Can you believe your
dialog: ears?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah! No more clicks and whistles!
dialog: Now she speaks perfect English!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
text: TURK approaches Ching Chong.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (saddened)
dialog: CHING CHONG, What happened to your
dialog: beautiful Asian accent?
speaker_heading: CHING CHONG
dialog: (no accent)
dialog: Actually, my name is Cindy, the
dialog: accent just helps me meet boys.
text: She notices Turk's sad face.
speaker_heading: CHING CHONG (cont'd
dialog: You want it back - you got it Joe!
text: TURK brightens and hugs her as they join the others who are now
text: examining the documents.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We got state money for a ski club?
dialog: We never had a ski club.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Collins took two thousand dollars
dialog: that was supposed to go to a new
dialog: state of the art stallion mascot
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I never saw that. Why have I been
dialog: wearing this one with puke in the
dialog: head?
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: We've gotta tell people about

dialog: I'm not sure if I can do this.
speaker_heading: MOFFIT
dialog: Sure you can. We gotta nail this
dialog: guy. You'll be fine.
speaker_heading: ZIMMER
dialog: Collins can be a pretty crafty guy,
dialog: what do I do if he smells the trap.
speaker_heading: MOFFIT
dialog: (as he hides his badge)
dialog: I don't think he'll smell anything -
dialog: just make sure he takes the check.
dialog: I've been through this a hundred
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: ZIMMER

speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER
dialog: I'd like to introduce you to
dialog: Richard Moffit - former Special
dialog: Needs student and now American
dialog: success story.
text: He gestures to MR. MOFFIT, who is mid 30's. Collins notices that he's
text: only wearing one shoe, the other foot is bare.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: (to Zimmer)
dialog: It seems Mr. Moffit has forgotten
dialog: his shoe.
scene_heading: SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER
dialog: (shrugs, then quietly)
dialog: What're you gonna do. At least
dialog: today he remembered his pants.
dialog: (then, to Moffit)
dialog: Richard, this is Principal Collins.
text: PRINCIPAL COLLINS takes Moffit's hand and shakes it - doesn't let go -
text: Collins sees a folded paper in his pocket (check?) .
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: Mr. Moffit, it's a great pleasure
dialog: to meet you sir. And is that what I
dialog: think it is...?
text: MOFFIT pulls the paper out of his pocket, it is a CHILD LIKE DRAWING OF
speaker_heading: AN AIRPLANE.
speaker_heading: MOFFIT
dialog: Yes! I drew this.
text: Collins looks at Zimmer. Zimmer puts hands in air as 'quotes'.
speaker_heading: ZIMMER

speaker_heading: MOFFIT

dialog: I am strong!
speaker_heading: ZIMMER
dialog: (to Moffit)
dialog: Yes you are.
dialog: (to Collins)
speaker_heading: ZIMMER (cont'd)
dialog: I think Mr. Moffit is looking
dialog: forward to seeing the float from

text: He pats an envelope in his breast pocket. Principal Collins stares at

speaker_heading: MOFFIT
dialog: I can turn on all the faucets in my
dialog: house.
dialog: (close to Collins)
dialog: Even the hose.
speaker_heading: ZIMMER
dialog: (to Moffit)
dialog: But we don't drink from the house
dialog: do we.
text: Collins reacts uncomfortably to all this...
text: ANGLE ON a few other floats and a band pass.
text: CLOSE-ON MARGIE the bus driver.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: (leaning out window)
dialog: Move it will ya! C'mon I got better
dialog: things to do.
text: REVEAL she's driving the SPECIAL NEEDS BUS that is now PULLING the

speaker_heading: MS. HELLER
dialog: Oh, here it comes. You're gonna
dialog: love what the children have done.
text: CLOSE ON Harry and Lloyd on the float.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Start the tape, Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Roger that, Wilco.
text: HARRY grabs two rods which are attached to the Collins float head and

text: voice comes booming out of speakers.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I found a way to bilk enough money
dialog: from the school to put us over the

scene_heading: SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER

text: BACK TO FLOAT where we continue to hear Collins' voice blare from the

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: We've done it all. Trilingual
dialog: education... twelve hundred dollars
dialog: for fake mock government... twelve
dialog: hundred charging tuition...
text: Just then police cars zoom up and screech to a halt. TWO POLICE
text: OFFICERS jump out with Jessica.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, good. There's Jessica.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: How could she miss this? This
dialog: whole salute to Collins was her
dialog: idea.
text: ANGLE ON bleachers again.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: I don't know what those kids are
dialog: doing. Nothing they do makes any
dialog: sense. That's why we started the

dialog: And that's why we need that check!
text: Collins grabs the check...
text: ANGLE ON The float. Harry and Lloyd see Collins running away.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey there goes Principal Collins!
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: He's so modest. Probably

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, that's too bad, this is his
dialog: day.
text: Collins sees the police coming from the other direction, so he turns
text: around and starts running back - towards the float.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, good, he's reconsidered.
text: HARRY waves at Jessica, dropping the hydraulic rod connected to the
text: pirate hook. Just then, Collins runs by, and get's caught up on the
text: hook. HARRY resumes his rod motion - which raises Collins into the air.
text: Held only by the back of his jacket. REVEAL Collins - now DANGLING FROM
text: THE HOOK of the Pirate Collins float. HELLER SEES this and tries to

speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Oh, hello Jessica.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Now who's going to be handcuffed?

text: ANGLE back on Collins still struggling on the hook.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL COLLINS
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I did it all for the children...
