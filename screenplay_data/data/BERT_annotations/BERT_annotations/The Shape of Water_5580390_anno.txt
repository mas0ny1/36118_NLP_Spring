scene_heading: INT. ELISA’S APARTMENT / RIVER FOOTAGE - NIGHT 1
text: We float at the bottom of a river. Surrounded by water.
text: Fish swim away. Debris floating in the water-
text: And, then, a lamp floats by-
dialog: A coffee pot-
dialog: A shoe.
speaker_heading: GILES / NARRATOR
dialog: If I spoke about it- If I did- what
dialog: would I tell you, I wonder? Would I
dialog: tell you about the time...? It
dialog: happened a long time ago- in the
dialog: last days of a fair Prince's
dialog: reign... Or would I tell you about
dialog: the place? A small city near the
dialog: coast but far from everything
dialog: else... Or would I tell you about
dialog: her? The princess without voice...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or perhaps I would just warn you of
dialog: the about the truth of these facts
dialog: and the tale of love and loss and
dialog: the monster that tried to destroy
dialog: it all...
text: Camera pushes and we see: An entire apartment underwater.
text: Objects and furniture float, gently suspended, defying
dialog: gravity.
text: Asleep on/above her bed -- half floating, half weighed down:
text: ELISA. Roughly 30, but ageless, with child-like eyes, dark,
text: lush hair and a thin, beautiful mouth slightly curved into a
text: satisfied smile.
dialog: 
text: She slowly settles/drifts down on the mattress below as an
text: early digital alarm clock lazily floats over a night table
dialog: nearby...
text: SUDDENLY: The alarm goes off!

text: Slowly, she gets up. An ambulance red light briefly
text: illuminates the apartment, its siren fading rapidly.
text: Barefoot, she heads to the bathroom: We see that light is
text: emanating from her FLOORBOARDS.
text: Music and dialogue leaks up through the floorboards too.
dialog: She readies the bathtub

speaker_heading: DIALOGUE
dialog: ”...Who’s the man?”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mahlon, the Judean artisan...”
text: The voices from below continue as she steps into the bathtub:
text: Water overflows and hits the tiled floor.
text: She sinks in. A deep sigh.
text: She sets the egg timer to TWO MINUTES.
text: She sighs. Then rubs her hand with soap, plants her two feet
text: on the base of the tub, sighs again and goes to work on
dialog: herself, gently, slowly-
text: -but with the timer ticking away-
text: She’s almost there when the timer DINGS.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ELISA’S APARTMENT - SAME 3
text: A WALL CLOCK- its minute hand slides into position- TACK!:
dialog: 10:55 PM.
dialog: 
text: Elisa rips off a leaf from a wall calendar and opens a
text: window, letting the fresh air in. Her hair is wet and she
text: nervously looks at the clock on the wall.
dialog: The Calendar leaf back reads: “Time is but a river flowing
dialog: from our past.”
speaker_heading: CLACK! 11:00 PM
text: Elisa stares at a WALL OF SHOES. Chooses a GREEN PAIR.
text: Shines them, quietly- alone- at the table. Puts them on.
text: Another siren goes by.
speaker_heading: CLACK! 11:01 PM
text: She takes out 3 hardboiled eggs- still steaming- out of a
dialog: pot. Uses the calendar sheet to pack one, plus saltines and a
text: small mustard and a half pickle sandwich on a paper bag.
text: Two eggs and a half sandwich go onto a small plate.
text: She undoes the three locks on her door (light & music
text: intensifies still emanating from the floorboards) and-
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4
text: -exits her apartment. We see the “shadowing” of old brass
text: letters -some are still there- they read “DELIVERIES”
text: She goes to the door directly across from hers (similar sign:
text: “PROCESSING”). A TV can be heard inside.
text: She uses a key to let herself in.
scene_heading: INT. GILES APARTMENT - NIGHT 5
text: Full of books. ENTIRELY full of them. Here and there are half-

dialog: Did the sirens wake you up?
dialog: Hard at work at a drawing table- is GILES: late 60's, refined

dialog: when he gets nervous).
speaker_heading: GILES (CONT’D)

dialog: grows still.
text: And just as he releases her... the scars on the sides of
