scene_heading: INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY
text: Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on
text: end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end
text: in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.
text: We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products
text: calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is
text: November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been
text: penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica
text: counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter,
text: in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat
text: red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE
scene_heading: WHITE BACKGROUND.
speaker_heading: MOONSTRUCK
text: Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low
text: TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.
speaker_heading: ZITO'S VOICE
dialog: (barely discernable)
dialog: Three times they cancel the order
dialog: with me, and three times they come
dialog: back. Who they kidding? They cheap,
dialog: cheap, cheap. The other bread they
dialog: get is no good. They save pennies.
dialog: Everybody complain and they come
dialog: back. "Zito, your bread is the best."
dialog: They're like children stupid in school
dialog: who cannot learn. The water. It's
dialog: the water. You buy bread in Hoboken,
dialog: you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water
dialog: is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask
dialog: your father. He knows.
text: During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE
text: DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently
text: with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the
text: pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.
scene_heading: NOW WE SEE ZITO
text: He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's
text: early in the day, and he's already been working for hours,
text: so he's a little tired and disgruntled.
speaker_heading: ZITO
dialog: You want me to make you some coffee?
text: NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME
text: She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is
text: Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked
text: with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes
text: of a dark color.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What d'you know about coffee? Gimme
text: a loaf of bread.
scene_heading: EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY
text: Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping
text: satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She
text: moves off briskly.
scene_heading: EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY
text: This is a little Italian funeral parlor.
scene_heading: INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"
text: A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes,
text: many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front,
text: the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and
text: formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We
text: discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.
text: She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over
dialog: and says.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: He looks great.
speaker_heading: RUBY
dialog: That Al Conti is a genius.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR
text: First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO
text: CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.
speaker_heading: CONTI'S VOICE
dialog: I am a genius.
text: The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half
text: cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming
text: mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's
dialog: tabulations.
speaker_heading: LORETTA'S VOICE
dialog: If you're such an artistic genius,
dialog: why can't you keep track of your
dialog: receipts? How am I going to do your
dialog: income tax?
speaker_heading: CONTI'S VOICE
dialog: I am an artistic genius.
text: The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta
text: sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of
text: coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering
text: figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: If you're an artistic genius, how
dialog: come you got butter on your tie?
text: He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Give it here. I'll give you this,
dialog: Al, you make good coffee.
text: She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has
text: taken off, and slams the ledger shut.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL
text: We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They
text: are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall
text: starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes
text: are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is
text: ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift.
text: He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame,
text: heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that
text: Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a
text: ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes.
text: After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something
text: to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and
scene_heading: INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
text: WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.
text: Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping
text: block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits,
text: unskinned.
scene_heading: INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY
text: A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the
scene_heading: FLORIST'S VOICE.
speaker_heading: FLORIST'S VOICE
dialog: Red roses. Very romantic. The man
dialog: who sends these knows what he's doing.
text: Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the
text: box of roses.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: The man who sends those spends a lot
dialog: of money on something that ends up
text: in the garbage can.
text: The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: I'm glad everybody ain't like you,
dialog: Loretta. I'd be outta business.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Without me, you'd be out of business.
dialog: I like flowers.
text: She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first
dialog: time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of
text: her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red
text: rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.
speaker_heading: END OF CREDITS
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A red neon sign hangs in the window.
text: It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A
dialog: YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested
text: in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.
scene_heading: INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT
text: White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the
text: door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because
text: they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles
text: along pleasantly.
speaker_heading: MUSIC
text: A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.
text: MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.
text: They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is
text: Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is
text: impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens
text: to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a
text: pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a
text: mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is
text: Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked
text: with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and
text: high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.
text: Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who
dialog: hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.
text: Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she
text: watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.
text: BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Are you ready?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Very good, Mr. Johnny.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: We will both have the Salad Ticino.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Uh-huh
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: And I'll have the special fish.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You don't want the fish.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: It's the oily fish tonight. Not before
dialog: the plane ride.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Maybe you're right.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Yes, Miss Loretta.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (to Mr. Johnny)
dialog: That will give you a base. For your
dialog: stomach. You eat that oily fish, you
text: go up in the air, halfway to Sicily
dialog: you'll be green and your hands will
dialog: be sweating.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You look after me.
text: They HEAR a distinguished MAN'S VOICE rise out of the babble.
text: They turn and look. The man's name is PERRY.
scene_heading: PERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POV
text: Perry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his
dialog: girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years
text: younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Patricia, please don't go!
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: What do you think I am, a talking
dialog: dog?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I was just making a point about the
dialog: way you said... the way you stated
dialog: your aspirations.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You can kiss my aspirations!
dialog: Professor!
text: She storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever.
dialog: The height of cleverness. Waiter!
text: An abnormally SHY WAITER stops.
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Could you do away with her dinner,
dialog: and any evidence of her, and bring
dialog: me an big glass of vodka?
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: But absolutely!
text: THE SHY WAITER begins to efficiently clear.
scene_heading: MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA EXCHANGE A GLANCE
text: Mr. Johnny is amused. Bobo serves them their salad.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
text: A man who can't control his woman is
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: She was too young for him.
text: Mr. Johnny considers this a point well taken.
text: BOBO AND HIS NEPHEW EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN
text: Which can be seen through a serving window. They can look
text: out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and
text: philosophical. EDDIE is a young waiter.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What'samatter, Uncle Bobo?
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose
dialog: marriage.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How you know that?
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: He arranged it with me. When he asks
dialog: her, then he'll wave to me and I'll
dialog: bring champagne. Good bachelor
dialog: customer for twenty years. But who
dialog: knows? Maybe he'll lose courage.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Heavy duty stuff.
text: PERRY, FEELING NO PAIN, COLLARS THE SHY WAITER
text: He holds out his empty glass.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Can I get another one of these?
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: Definitely!
text: Perry takes his arm.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: May I presume to ask you a question?
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: Sure!
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Do you have a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: I am alone in the world.
text: Perry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate
text: a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: That's very sad.
text: BOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's
text: already cleared Loretta's.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: How's things?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: No, I want to see the dessert cart.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Very good.
text: Bobo goes. Loretta is surprised.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You never have dessert.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Never is a long time.
text: Mr. Johnny is uneasy. He massages his head.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: My scalp is not getting enough blood
dialog: sometimes.
text: Loretta looks at him strangely. Bobo rolls up the dessert
text: cart. WE SEE Loretta and Mr. Johnny through the frame of the
text: dessert cart. They turn and look at the desserts.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Have Something.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I shouldn't.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Will you marry me?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Will you marry me?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Bobo, take the cart away.
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Are you proposing marriage to me?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You know I was married and that my
dialog: husband died. But what you don't
dialog: know is I think he and I had Bad
dialog: Luck.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: We got married at the City Hall and
dialog: I think it gave bad luck the whole
dialog: marriage.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Right from the start we didn't do it
dialog: right. Could you kneel down?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: On the floor?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
text: Yes, on the floor.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: This is a good suit.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I helped you buy it. It came with
dialog: two pairs of pants. It's for luck,
dialog: Johnny. When you propose marriage to
dialog: a woman, you should kneel down.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Alright.
text: Mr. Johnny slowly gets out of his chair. There's not enough
text: room for him to kneel down. He has to ask two off-duty PRO
text: WRESTLERS who are eating dinner to move their chairs. They
text: do so with bemused expressions. Their names are BOB and MOOK.

dialog: (at a loss)
dialog: The ring?
text: BOB AND MOOK ARE WATCHING MR. JOHNNY'S PERFORMANCE
text: They are deadpan mugs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Mr. Johnny)
dialog: A ring. That's right.
speaker_heading: MOOK
dialog: I woulda sprung for a ring if it was
dialog: me.
text: BOBO AND EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN WATCHING
speaker_heading: BOBO
text: She's got him on his knees. He's
text: ruining his suit.
scene_heading: LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You could use your pinky ring.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I like this ring.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You propose to a woman you should
text: offer her a ring of engagement.
text: Mr. Johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On
dialog: my knees. In front of all these
dialog: people. Will you marry me?
text: She meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony
dialog: Cammareri. I will marry you. I will
dialog: be your wife.
text: Mr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The
text: restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They
text: embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly.
text: A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, SUSAN, IS MAUDLIN FROM THE PROPOSAL
text: Bobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the
text: proposal. She brings her hands together. Bobo's hand flashes
text: out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again.
text: The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room.
scene_heading: LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY
text: Mr. Johnny is in control now. He looks around once, regally.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Bobo! The check!
text: PERRY AND THE SHY WAITER LOOK AT MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I feel like I have just witnessed a
dialog: car accident.
text: The Shy Waiter sits down at Perry's table.
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: When I was twenty-seven years old,
dialog: in Jersey City, I asked a woman to
dialog: marry me. She had red hair. She
text: smelled a jasmine. She wore black
text: shoes with pointy white tips.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: She didn't hear me. She asked me to
dialog: repeat, so she could understand what
dialog: I said. But I wouldn't repeat it.
dialog: Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
scene_heading: MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA
text: He's helping her on with her coat.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Seven-thirty.
speaker_heading: LORETTA

text: Mr. Johnny puts on his coat.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: My mother will be happy I'm getting
dialog: married.
text: Bobo approaches with the bucket of champagne. He's flustered.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr.

speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I forgot to wave. We'll have it at

speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: A week. Two weeks. No more.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Then let's set the date.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: How about a month from today?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Must it be so definite? Can't we
dialog: just say that we will be married
dialog: when I get back?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Where? At the City Hall? No! I want
dialog: the whole wedding or we will have
dialog: Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be

speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY

scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: This is the source of the Vicki Carr song, which is just
text: ending. COSMO CASTORINI, Loretta's father is just turning
text: off the old stereo. He is a powerful man, about 65, with a
text: huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. He's wearing
text: a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue
text: slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture,
text: once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes
text: in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying
text: fire. Cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside
text: a lit fringed lamp. Cosmo sees Loretta as she comes in.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Hi.
text: He sits in his chair and puts his feet up on an old

dialog: Where's Ma?
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Bed.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You're not sleepy?
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: I can't sleep anymore. It's too much
dialog: like death.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Pop, I got news.
text: Cosmo puts down the paper and takes his feet off the ottoman.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Alright. Let's go in the kitchen.

text: as Loretta opens champagne.
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Loretta and Cosmo sit at the kitchen table. It's a big tin
text: table with a black-and-white design. Loretta has put two old-
text: fashioned champagne glasses on the table, the split of
text: champagne, a bag of sugar cubes, and a bottle of bitters.
text: She pours the champagne, drops a little lump of sugar into
text: each glass, and adds a dash of bitters. She hands one of the
dialog: drinks to Cosmo.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Here.

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: In a month.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: I won't come.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You've got to come. You've got to
dialog: give me away.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: I didn't give you away the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: And maybe that's why I had the Bad
dialog: Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and
dialog: I got married in a church, in a
dialog: wedding dress, instead of at the
text: City Hall with strangers standing
dialog: outside the door, maybe then I
dialog: wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I didn't have no wedding cake, no

speaker_heading: COSMO

speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: COSMO
text: It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: It's temporary.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Everything is temporary. That don't
dialog: excuse nothing.
speaker_heading: LORETTA

text: Cosmo's father, is 83 years old. He is taking the Five Dogs
text: out for their morning walk. He has their five leashes bundled
text: in one hand. In the other hand, even though it is a cloudless

scene_heading: EXT. A SMALL CITY PARK SURROUNDED BY HURRICANE FENCE - DAY
text: The Old Man and the Five Dogs appear and enter the park. He
text: approaches a park bench where FELIX and LUCY are already
text: sitting. Felix and Lucy are about the same age as the Old
text: Man. They each have a well-behaved DOG. When the Old Man
text: sits down, he lets the Five Dogs go. The Dogs run off, BARKING
dialog: like mad.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: It's wrong to just let them go.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (ignoring Felix)
dialog: Good morning, Lucy.
speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: You have too many dogs.
text: The dogs can be HEARD in the distance. It sounds like they're
dialog: killing each other.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (goes back to ignoring
dialog: Felix)
dialog: Lucy. There are big things going on
dialog: in my house. My granddaughter Loretta,
dialog: the only daughter of my son Cosmo,
dialog: has engaged herself to be married a
dialog: second time.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I have heard that Johnny Cammareri
text: got down on his knees in The Grand

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: My son does not like this Johnny
text: Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: You should have one dog. Like Lucy.
dialog: Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I
dialog: hadda gun, I would shoot four of
dialog: your dogs.
text: The Old Man makes a low, threatening noise.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Don't fight.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: My granddaughter wants my son to pay

dialog: want to pay.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He should pay.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He owes her a wedding from the first
dialog: time when there was none.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked
dialog: my advice. If he asks my advice, I
dialog: don't know what I will say.
text: The SOUND of the DOGS becomes intense again.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: I won't have to shoot those dogs.
dialog: They will kill each other.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: You think so, huh, Stupid? Those
dialog: dogs love each other.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
text: The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.
text: It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an
text: overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black
text: Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he
text: gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and
text: goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man
text: approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.
text: The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.
text: Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and
text: son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective
text: door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the
text: same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.
text: Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears
text: within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
scene_heading: A RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN
text: Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of

text: until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread
text: with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.
text: Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula
text: flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the
dialog: cooked side.
text: Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in
dialog: the bread.
text: The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula,
text: scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.
text: A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash
text: of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results
text: from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.
text: Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin
text: table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the
text: big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled
text: coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes
text: toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a

text: As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work
text: shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As
text: Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta,
text: who's at the stove.
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: LORETTA

text: Then she takes the pot back to the stove.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: So we'll sell the house.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I got married before, you didn't
dialog: sell.
text: Loretta comes to the table. They sit down to breakfast.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Grandma was still alive. Chiro was

dialog: married and gone to Florida. If you
dialog: and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'm thirty-seven years old.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro
dialog: after I was thirty-seven. It ain't
text: over till it's over.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Johnny has a big apartment. We'll
dialog: live there.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: And we'll sell the house.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the
dialog: house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: RONNY

speaker_heading: LORETTA

dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: And now he's getting married. He has

text: He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I didn't come here to upset you.
text: Ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula,
text: turns them around, and slides them back in.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: They say bread is life. So I bake
dialog: bread, bread, bread.
dialog: (He's picking up loaves
dialog: of bread from one of
dialog: the boxes on the

dialog: And the years go by! By! By! And I

speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Nothing is anybody's fault, but things

text: (holds up his left
dialog: hand to Loretta)
dialog: Look.
text: He pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood.
speaker_heading: RONNY
text: It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago
dialog: I was engaged to be married. Johnny
dialog: came in here, he ordered bread from
dialog: me. I put it in the slicer and I
dialog: talked with him and my hand got caught
dialog: cause I wasn't paying attention. The
dialog: slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny
dialog: 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I
dialog: was maimed, she left me for another
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: That's the bad blood between you and
dialog: Johnny?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I don't care! I ain't no freakin
dialog: monument to justice! I lost my hand,
dialog: I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand,
dialog: Johnny has his bride! You come in
dialog: here and you want me to put away my
dialog: heartbreak and forget?
text: He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with
text: bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Is it just a matter of time till a

dialog: one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe.
dialog: All I have... Have you come here,
dialog: Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to
dialog: take these last few loaves from my
dialog: table? Alright. Alright.
text: The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away,
text: to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a
text: single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.
text: Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy
text: approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: This is the most tormented man I
dialog: have ever known. I am in love with
dialog: this man. He doesn't know that. I
dialog: never told him cause he can never
dialog: love anybody since he lost his hand
dialog: and his girl.
text: She holds out the knife.
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: Here. Why don't you just kill him?
dialog: It would be so much more kind than

text: DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE
text: At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with

speaker_heading: MONA

speaker_heading: COSMO

speaker_heading: COSMO

scene_heading: INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: It's a two-bedroom apartment. The decor reflects Ronny's

text: the colors of Italian passion. But it is all a bit faded,
text: the remains of an old flamboyance. The walls are decorated

speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'm making you a steak.
speaker_heading: RONNY

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Why what?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: You don't know nothing about it.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I was raised that a girl gets married

dialog: to have a baby right away. I said
dialog: no. Then he got hit by a bus. No
dialog: man. No baby. No nothing! I did not
dialog: know that man was a gift I could not

dialog: You are a wolf!
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I'm a wolf?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: The big part of you has no words and

dialog: not get away.
text: (She grabs his wooden
dialog: hand)
dialog: So you chewed off your foot! That
dialog: was the price you had to pay to be
dialog: free.
dialog: (throws his hand down)
dialog: Johnny had nothing to do with it.
dialog: You did what you had to do, between
dialog: you and you, and I know I'm right, I
dialog: don't care what you say. And now
dialog: you're afraid because you found out
dialog: the big part of you is a wolf that
dialog: has the courage to bite off its own
text: hand to save itself from the trap of
dialog: the wrong love. That's why there has
dialog: been no woman since that wrong woman.
dialog: You are scared to death what the

speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: What are you doing!
speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: RONNY

dialog: fool!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Because I have no Luck!
speaker_heading: RONNY

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
text: She changes her mind and lunges into another kiss. They stop

speaker_heading: RONNY
text: It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm

speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: My father needs a plate.

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I never seen anybody so in love like

dialog: it's not really a story. But one
dialog: time I woke up in the middle of the

text: my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't
dialog: think a what it was. I looked out
dialog: the window, and it was the moon! Big
dialog: as a house! I never seen the moon so
dialog: big before or since. I was almost
dialog: scared, like it was gonna crush the

text: there in the street was Cosmo, looking
dialog: up at the windows. This is the funny
dialog: part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I
dialog: thought you brought this big moon
dialog: over to my house cause you were so
dialog: in love and woke me up with it. I
dialog: was half asleep I guess and didn't
dialog: know no better.
speaker_heading: COSMO

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You drank too much and now you sleep

text: kneels down next to her mother, Rose.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: (looking up from her
dialog: prayers)
dialog: Where you been?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I don't wanna talk about it.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Just like your father. I lied to
dialog: him. He thinks you came home last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Thanks. What's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Cosmo's cheating on me.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What! How do you know?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: A wife knows.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Then you don't know. You're just
text: imagining it. He's too old.
text: Rose starts to reply, but then decides it's not worth the
dialog: argument.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I won't be home for dinner.
text: Loretta crosses herself quickly, gets up, and leaves. Rose
text: looks after, and then goes back to her prayer.
scene_heading: INT. CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY
text: Feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue
text: icing to a wedding cake. Then the hands set the plastic bride
text: and groom on the pinnacle. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.
text: Barbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a
text: stainless steel wheeled cart. She's in the back part of the
text: bakery. Barbara is pleased with her creation. We TRAVEL WITH
text: HER as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where
text: Chrissy is waiting on a huge man named HARVEY. She hands him
text: a tiny box, which he takes meekly.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: See you tomorrow, Chrissy.
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: Okay, Harvey.
text: Harvey lumbers off as Barbara enters the front of the store
text: with the cake on its cart. Barbara calls Chrissy's attention
dialog: to the cake.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: So what do you think?
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: The cake!
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: (without enthusiasm)
dialog: Where's Ronny? How come he ain't
dialog: come down?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: How should I know?
text: The PHONE RINGS. Chrissy answers it.
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: That was Ronny. He don't feel good.
dialog: He ain't gonna be down today.
text: Chrissy comes out from behind the counter. She's staring at
dialog: the cake.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: What, is he still upset?
text: Without warning, Chrissy whacks the little bride and groom
text: off the cake and on to the floor.
speaker_heading: CHRISSY
dialog: It's that bitch!
text: Barbara looks at her, shocked.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPPOMAGGI'S ITALIAN PROVISIONS - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY
text: Provolones and salamis hang from above. To the one side is a
text: deli counter, to the other a series of tables displaying
text: cheeses by the pound, packaged cakes, etc. In the back are a
text: few tables and a kitchen with counter. Up front, behind the
text: deli counter, stands Rita Cappomaggi in a blue apron.
text: Out by the tables, Raymond unpacks some jars of olives. In

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (looks around
dialog: cautiously, then
dialog: speaks)
dialog: You were a tiger last night.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Shut up. They'll hear you in the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: So what? The pleasure of marriage is
dialog: you sleep with the woman and then
dialog: you don't worry about nothing. Hey,
dialog: how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's
dialog: eat pasta and roll around.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (scandalized)
dialog: Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice!
dialog: What's got into you?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Did you see it?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (she lies, nervous)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: RITA

text: Her fiancé's in Palermo.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Oh. Right.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I got things to do.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sure you do. You got all that wedding

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well, that's romantic, too.
speaker_heading: (SINGS)
dialog: ...ISN'T IT ROMANTIC...

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: HEY. Make me a bowl of minestrone.
text: The women are left alone.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What's the matter? You look crazy.
speaker_heading: LORETTA

scene_heading: INT. A CHURCH BASEMENT
text: It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels
text: of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game
text: of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of
text: the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them --
text: we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I've got a lot on my mind. Things
dialog: are getting bad in my house. My
dialog: daughter-in-law is mad at my son
dialog: because he will not pay for the
dialog: wedding.
text: A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER
text: An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it
text: with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand
text: belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old
text: Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives
text: a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.
text: Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips
text: it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy
text: goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray
text: where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the
text: Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever
text: to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: At dinner, my daughter-in-law
dialog: threatened to kill me. Things are
dialog: very bad in my house.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Hurry up.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Don't fight.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: If I hit the stick too hard, the
dialog: apple will split. If I am too timid,
text: the apple will fall off the stick.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: We're supposed to do fifty apples.
dialog: We only got twelve done.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I don't know what to advise my son.
dialog: I think he should pay for the wedding,
dialog: but it is important that he don't
dialog: look ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Don't make yourself sick.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Talk to him.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I will. But I must find the right
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Did you see the moon last night?
text: The Old Man's eyes light up. He looks at Lucy.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: FELIX

scene_heading: INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY
scene_heading: EIGHT NEAT STACKS OF MONEY BEING RUBBERBANDED
text: By a woman's hands. The last stack is topped with a filled
text: out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a
text: night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a
text: ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for
text: her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees
dialog: Rita.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Bye, Aunt Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Yeah, I'll be in.
text: Loretta goes out the door, with Rita looking after,
dialog: thoughtful.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY
text: Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA
text: BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if
dialog: anybody's looking, and goes in.
text: WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles
text: appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back
text: into the store.
scene_heading: INT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY
text: WE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with
text: BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little
dialog: bored.
speaker_heading: BONNIE
dialog: So? You want the usual?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I want you to get rid of the grey.
text: TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC STARTS HERE AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE
text: FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is
text: turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful
text: coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and
text: gets very excited.
speaker_heading: BONNIE
dialog: I've been wanting to do this for
dialog: three years! Let me show you some
dialog: magazines! You've got to get a
dialog: manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila!
dialog: I'm gonna need help!
text: SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get
text: very excited and start showing Loretta and each other
text: magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do,
text: leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with
text: her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails.
text: A MONTAGE FOLLOWS
text: They're plucking her eyebrows.
text: They're cutting and dying her hair.
text: They're painting her nails.
scene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP-DAY
text: Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much
text: more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if
text: she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly
scene_heading: EXT. A DOWDY DRESS SHOP - DAY
text: Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.
scene_heading: EXT. A BOLD DRESS SHOP - DAY
text: A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in
text: the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.
text: She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.
scene_heading: INT. INSINUATION - DAY
text: Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer
text: is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta
text: greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey
dialog: what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she
text: wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.
text: There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various
text: dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some
text: incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in
text: a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her
dialog: because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the
text: dress that she ultimately does buy.
scene_heading: EXT. INSINUATION - DUSK
text: Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away
text: down the street.
text: WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL
text: SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops
text: and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and
text: stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.
text: Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy,
text: bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology,
text: and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: END OF MUSIC
text: THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DUSK
text: Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT
text: As Loretta enters she drops her bag and, as she takes off
text: her coat, calls.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.
text: A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks
dialog: up.
text: A WOODEN ACCORDION GATE SEALS OFF THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
text: Visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs.
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens
text: the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch
text: on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated
text: way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.
text: LORETTA WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM
text: She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There
text: are many table and standing lamps throughout the room.
text: LORETTA IS LIGHTING THE FIRE
text: Which was already built in the fireplace. It catches on
text: nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing
text: antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.
text: She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she
text: picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and
text: then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair.
text: Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums.
text: She selects one and puts it on.
speaker_heading: MUSIC
text: Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with
text: herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her
dialog: blouse.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA
text: SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE
text: FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE-UP of LORETTA'S FACE as she puts the final touches on
text: her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.
text: WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening
text: dress and put on her heels. She's swaying to the music. The
text: evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses
dialog: the mirror.
text: WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR
text: In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.
scene_heading: EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT
text: The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the
text: night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.
text: But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge
text: white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights
text: burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along
text: the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the
speaker_heading: MUSIC PLAYS

scene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT
scene_heading: LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV
text: CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created
text: by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled
text: with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand
text: and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House.
text: Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left,
text: inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous
dialog: color.
text: LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN
text: The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.
text: She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights
text: up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger
dialog: jets.
text: Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher
text: into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her
text: eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water,
text: like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.
text: FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER
text: Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for
text: its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing
text: quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite
text: side of the fountain, is Ronny.
text: He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and
text: topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises
text: a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles
text: brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and
text: starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the
text: fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her
text: attempt at composure from, Ronny.
text: Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around
text: the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: You look beautiful. Your hair...
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I thought I'd try it.
dialog: (qrudgingly)
dialog: You look good.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Thank you.
text: He goes to kiss her. She takes a step back.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I said I'd go to the opera with you.
dialog: Nothing else.
text: Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they
text: walk off in the direction of the opera house.
text: ONE OF THE CHAGALL'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET
text: Ronny and Loretta looking up at it.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Who painted that?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Marc Chagall. A Russian.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Kinda gaudy.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: He was having some fun. Yeah, well
text: he's dead.
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: Come on, let's go in.
text: Ronny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building.
scene_heading: INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Ronny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher.
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT
text: Ronny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny's coat is
text: already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands
text: her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns
text: and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.
text: He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Thank you!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I don't know. For your hair. For
dialog: your beautiful dress. For... you
dialog: know, I feel like a man again. You
dialog: know I love the Opera. You know it's
dialog: been a long time since I've been to
dialog: the Opera.
text: His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts
text: to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: So. Where are we sitting?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Come on.
text: He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and
dialog: go into the house.
scene_heading: THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES
text: The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished
text: pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are
text: in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.
text: Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son,
text: John. They are seated and people are looking at them.
text: Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down,
text: something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing
text: good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes
text: her look like a big piece of hard candy.
text: Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row
dialog: of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.
text: They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.
scene_heading: THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV
text: The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into
text: the dark as the house lights go down.
text: WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND
text: Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Here we go.
text: As the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR
text: takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to
text: the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT
text: The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then
text: FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter
dialog: the restaurant.
scene_heading: INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT
text: The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.
text: The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.
text: She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly
text: approaches her. She's very dignified.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: It's just me. I want to eat.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I got a table for you right now.
text: Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: This alright?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Fine.
text: He seats her.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Enjoy your meal.
text: Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the
text: wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV,
text: and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA,
text: is having an argument with the man across from her.
text: But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and
text: the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You
dialog: eating alone tonight?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a
text: martini, no ice and two olives.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Very good.
text: Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table
text: catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a
text: little louder.
speaker_heading: SHEILA'S VOICE
dialog: I'm trying to explain to you how I
dialog: feel. Every time I try to explain
dialog: how I feel, you explain how you feel.
dialog: I don't think that's really much of
text: a response.
speaker_heading: UNSEEN MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Well, its the only response I've
dialog: got.
text: Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: You wanna see a menu?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Not yet. I'll wave.
text: Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at
text: the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the
dialog: man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument
text: goes on.
speaker_heading: SHEILA'S VOICE
dialog: I really do hate it though, when you
dialog: take that tone with me. Like you're
dialog: above it all and isn't it amusing.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: But it is, isn't it?
speaker_heading: SHEILA'S VOICE
dialog: Not to me! This is my life, no matter
dialog: how damned comical it may seem to
dialog: you. I don't need some man standing
text: above the struggle while I roll around
dialog: in the mud!
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I think you like the mud and I don't.
dialog: That's fair, isn't it? If I don't
dialog: care to...
text: Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the
text: man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and
text: stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.
text: When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to
text: Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his
dialog: 50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the
text: earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with
text: beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and
text: apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Sorry about that, folks. She's a
dialog: very pretty mental patient.
text: The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Don't mind about me. But could you
dialog: do me a favor and clear her place
dialog: and take away all evidence of her,
dialog: and bring me a big glass of vodka?
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: Absolutely!
text: The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry
text: notices Rose.
text: They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm not disturbed. By you.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: My lady friend has a personality
dialog: disorder.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: She was just too young for you.
text: The Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (to the Waiter)
dialog: Thanks, comrade.
speaker_heading: SHY WAITER
dialog: It's nothing!
dialog: The Shy Waiter goes.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (Rose's comment strikes
dialog: home)
dialog: Ouch. Too young! I just got that.
dialog: You know how to hurt guy. How old
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: None of your business.
text: He drops his posturing.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Sorry. That was rude.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Will you join me for dinner?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Are you sure?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating
dialog: alone, and it's amazing how often I
dialog: end up doing just that.
text: ROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I'm a professor. I teach
dialog: communications at N.Y.U.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That woman was a student of yours?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: There's old saying my mother told
dialog: me. Would you like to hear it?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Don't shit where you eat.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (taken aback, then
dialog: recovering)
dialog: I'll remember that. What do you do?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm a housewife.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Then why are you eating alone?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you
dialog: a question?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Why do men chase women?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Nerves.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I think it's because they fear death.
speaker_heading: PERRY

dialog: chase women? I find women charming.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I teach these classes I've taught
dialog: for a million years. The spontaneity
dialog: went out of it for me a long time
dialog: ago. I started off, I was excited
dialog: about something and I wanted to share
dialog: it. Now it's rote, it's the
dialog: multiplication table. Except
dialog: sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning
text: along and I look up, and there's
dialog: this fresh young beautiful face, and
dialog: it's all new to her and I'm this
dialog: great guy who's just brilliant and
dialog: thinks out loud. And when that
dialog: happens, when I look out among those
text: chairs and look at a young woman's
text: face, and see me there in her eyes,
dialog: me the way I always wanted to be and
dialog: maybe once was, then I ask her out
dialog: on a date. It doesn't last. It can
dialog: go for a few weeks or a couple of
dialog: precious months, but then she catches
dialog: on that I'm just a burnt out old
dialog: gasbag and that she's as fresh and
text: bright and full of promise as
text: moonlight in a martini. And at that
text: moment, she stands up and throws a
dialog: glass of water in my face, or some
dialog: action to that effect.

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Pop?

speaker_heading: COSMO

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: PERRY

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You're a little boy and you like to

speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Yeah. It smells like snow.

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: My mother guessed that my father was
dialog: seeing somebody and I told her she
dialog: was crazy. She looked like a real
dialog: piece of cheap goods. But who am I
dialog: to talk?
text: Her eyes are full of tears.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: How can you ask me that?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: You're making me feel guilty again.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You are guilty. I'm guilty.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Of what? Only God can point the
dialog: finger, Loretta.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I know what I know.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: And what do you know? You tell me my

dialog: that don't make you no lamb! You're
dialog: gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna
dialog: sell your life short? Playing it
dialog: safe is just about the most dangerous

speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I went with you.
dialog: (pause, nothing)
dialog: Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're
dialog: gonna leave me alone.
dialog: (pause, nothing)
dialog: Right?
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: A person can see where they've messed
dialog: up in their life, and they can change
dialog: how they do things, and they can
dialog: change their Luck. Maybe my nature
dialog: does draw me to you, but I don't
dialog: haveta go with that. I can take hold
dialog: of myself and say yes to some things
dialog: and no to something that's just gonna
dialog: ruin everything! I can do that.
dialog: Otherwise, what is this stupid life
dialog: that God gave us for what?
dialog: (pause, nothing)

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I don't know. Everything seems like
dialog: nothing now against that I want you
dialog: in my bed. I don't care if I burn in
dialog: hell. I don't care if you burn in
dialog: hell. The Past and Future is a joke
dialog: to me now. I see that they're nothing,
dialog: I see they ain't here. The only thing
dialog: that's here is you. And me. I want
dialog: you to come upstairs. Now. I tried
dialog: to take everything last night, like
dialog: you told me, but I couldn't. I
dialog: couldn't take everything in a hundred
dialog: years. It's the way we are. We
dialog: compound each other.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Let me go home.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Let me go home.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'm freezing to death.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Come upstairs. I don't care why you
dialog: come. No, that's not what I mean.
dialog: Loretta, I love you. Not like they
dialog: told you love is and I didn't know
dialog: this either. But love don't make
dialog: things nice, it ruins everything, it
dialog: breaks your heart, it makes things a
dialog: mess. We're not here to make things
dialog: perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The
dialog: stars are perfect. Not us. We are
dialog: here to ruin ourselves and break our
dialog: hearts and love the wrong people and
dialog: die! The storybooks are bullshit.
dialog: Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't
dialog: try to live your life out to somebody
dialog: else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't
dialog: try to live on milk and cookies when
dialog: what you want is meat! Red meat just
dialog: like me! It's wolves run with wolves
dialog: and nothing else! You're a wolf just
dialog: like me! Come upstairs with me and
dialog: get in my bed! Come on! Come on!
dialog: Come on!
text: Loretta follows Ronny into his building.

dialog: windows.
text: NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Out. I don't know where. I was waiting
dialog: up for my husband.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: It's late.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes.
text: There's a pause. Mr. Johnny is uncomfortable with it.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Maybe I should go?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What are you doing here? You're
dialog: supposed to be in Palermo.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: That's what I came to tell Loretta.
dialog: There's been a miracle.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: A miracle. Well, that's news.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: My mother's recovered.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You're kidding?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: The breath had almost totally left

dialog: And then she completely pulled back
dialog: from death and stood up and put on
text: her clothes and began to cook for
text: everyone in the house. The mourners.
dialog: And me. And herself! She ate a meal

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Hello Pop.

text: then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That was my father-in-law, who has a
dialog: wrong idea in his head. Listen,
dialog: Johnny, there's a question I want to
dialog: ask you. And I want you to tell me
dialog: the truth if you can. Why do men
dialog: chase women?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Well. There's the Bible story. God
text: took a rib from Adam and made Eve.
dialog: Maybe men chase women to get the rib
dialog: back. When God took the rib, he left
dialog: a hole there, place where there used
dialog: to be something. and the women have
dialog: that. Maybe a man isn't complete as
text: a man without a woman.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: But why would a man need more than
dialog: one woman?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I don't know. Maybe because he fears
dialog: death.
text: Rose leaps up, very excited.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That's it! That's the reason!
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: COSMO

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: COSMO

speaker_heading: ROSE

text: in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING.
text: We follow her as she SINGS and walks.
text: WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
text: She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt.
text: She comes to it again. She kicks it again.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
text: Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and
text: enters the house.
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and
text: sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.
text: Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles
text: into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.
text: There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What the hell happened to you?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Well. I don't really know where to
dialog: start.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Your hair's different.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Everything's different.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: No. Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No. But I have a hangover.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Where's pop?
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up
dialog: last night.
text: Loretta is suddenly electrified.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What? He's in Sicily!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No more he's not.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: He's with his dying mother!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: She recovered.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: WHAT!! She was dying!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: It was a miracle.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: A miracle? This is modern times!
dialog: There ain't supposed to be miracles
dialog: any more!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I guess it ain't modern times in
dialog: Sicily. He came right from the
dialog: airport. He wanted to talk to you.
dialog: You got a love bite on your neck.
dialog: He's coming back this morning.
text: With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta
text: just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he
text: hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown
text: leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts
text: to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way,
dialog: occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just
text: muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he
dialog: remembers, which is a lot.
text: WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
text: He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an
text: ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize
text: what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.
text: They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a
text: resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other
text: appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back
text: to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
text: Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and
text: then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him
dialog: in.
scene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN
text: Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the
text: kitchen. Rose calls out.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: It's not Johnny.
text: Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's
text: very surprised to see Ronny.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Ronny!
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Is Johnny here?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: He's coming.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Good! We can get this out on the
dialog: table.
dialog: (to Rose)
dialog: I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
dialog: (Shakes her hand)
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Nice to meet you. You've got a love
dialog: bite on your neck. Your mother's
text: recovered from death.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Oh. Good. We're not close. I'm not
dialog: really moved.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You've gotta get outta here.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: No. I'm gonna wait.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (arguing with Ronny)
dialog: Ronny, please...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Would anyone like some oatmeal?
text: LORETTA continues arguing.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: (ignores Loretta)
dialog: Yes, I would like some oatmeal.
text: Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.
text: COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio,
text: puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: His brother.
text: Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of
text: him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he
text: puls down his spoon.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: You're Johnny's brother?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.
text: The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.
text: THE OLD MAN WALKS IN
text: He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.
text: He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his
text: hand opens in a gesture of supplication.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I am old. The Old are not wanted.
dialog: And what they say has no weight.
dialog: But, my son, I must speak. You should
dialog: pay for the wedding of your only
dialog: daughter. You are breaking your house
dialog: through pride. There. I've said it.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: It's okay, Pop. If she gets married,
dialog: I'll pay for the whole thing.
text: The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at
text: the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.
text: He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.
text: The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts
text: down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking
dialog: to Cosmo.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Have I been a good wife?
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I want you to stop seeing her.
text: Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old
text: clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists
text: to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this.
text: Then slowly, he sits down.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: And go to confession.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: (still not looking at
dialog: her)
dialog: A man... under stands one day...
text: that his life is built on nothing.
dialog: And that's a bad, crazy day.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Your life is not built on nothing.
dialog: Ti amo.
text: She puts her hand across the table to him.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Ti amo.
text: He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts
text: his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been
text: able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: It's Johnny. I'll get it.
text: Loretta's tone is fatal.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I'll get it.
text: Rose gets up.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'll get it.
text: She goes to answer the door.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: (goes for the door)
dialog: No, I'll tell him.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: No, I'll tell him.
dialog: (to her father)
dialog: What am I going to tell him?
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: Tell him the truth, Loretta they
dialog: find out anyway.
text: Loretta looks at her father.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I love you Pop.
text: It's a private moment.
text: But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the
speaker_heading: CAPPOMAGGIS.
text: They have their coats on and they look very serious and
text: concerned and timid.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hi Loretta.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Hi, Loretta.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Is there anything you want to tell
dialog: us, honey?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: You? No.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: We just come from the bank.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO
dialog: MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (to Raymond)
dialog: She's got it.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I knew she had it.
text: Loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her
text: everyday bag. She takes out the night deposit bag and hands
dialog: it to Raymond.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: We didn't know what to think. You
dialog: were so weird yesterday, and then
dialog: this morning, we go to the bank and
dialog: no bag.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
text: (a sudden outburst to
dialog: Loretta)
dialog: WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
text: Raymond covers his face to hide his emotion. Rita, meanwhile
text: is clearing the oatmeal bowls.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Listen. Who wants coffee?
text: There is a general acknowledgment. Everybody wants coffee.
text: Rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts
text: of coffee. Raymond and Rita are standing. The rest are
dialog: sitting.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So what are we doing?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We're waiting for Johnny Cammareri.
text: Rita nods. A silence.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I'm his brother.
speaker_heading: TA
dialog: (taking and shaking
dialog: his hand)
dialog: Nice to meet you. I'm Rita Cappomaggi.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (taking and taking
dialog: his hand)
dialog: I'm Raymond Cappomaggi. I'm Rose's
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Silence. Then the Old Man erupts.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Somebody tell a joke!
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. And RINGS AGAIN. Everyone is frozen for
text: a moment, then Rita mobilizes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'll get it.
text: She goes. Loretta puts down her coffee and deep breathes,
text: preparing herself.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'm getting palpitations!
text: She pushes away her coffee.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I thought he was in Palermo.
text: RITA APPEARS WITH MR. JOHNNY IN TOW
text: Rita continues into the room, leaving Mr. Johnny in the
text: doorway. He is in a dark, vested suit. He is a little
text: bewildered by the crowd of people, but succeeds in hiding
text: most of his discomfort.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's Johnny Cammareri.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Johnny.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Loretta...
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Johnny...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Ronny! Our mother has recovered from
dialog: death!
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Have you come to make peace with me?
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Of course I want to.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I don't know. But Johnny, how did
dialog: your mother recover? She was dying.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: We should talk alone.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I can't. I need my family around me
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Well. I told my mother that we were
dialog: to be married. And she got well.
dialog: Right away.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: I'm sure she did.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: It was a miracle!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Johnny, I have something to tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I have something to tell you. But I
dialog: must talk to you alone.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I have no secrets from my family.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Loretta, I can't marry you.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: If I marry you my mother will die.
text: The Old Man laughs a loud sudden laugh, and then subsides.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
dialog: We're engaged.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Loretta, what are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'm talking about a promise. You
dialog: proposed to me!
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: Because my mother was dying! But now
dialog: she's not.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: You're forty-two years old, Johnny,
dialog: and Mama is still running your life.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: And you are a son who doesn't love
dialog: his mother!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: And you're a big liar! I've got your
dialog: ring here!
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I must ask for that back.
text: Loretta struggles and pulls off the ring.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Here! Take your stupid pinky ring.
text: (she throws it at
dialog: Johnny)
dialog: Who needs it? The engagement's off.
text: Mr. Johnny retrieves the ring.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: In time, you will see that this is
dialog: the best thing.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: In time, you will drop dead, and I
dialog: will come to your funeral in a red
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Loretta?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Will you marry me.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Where's the ring?
text: Ronny looks to Mr. Johnny a little sheepishly.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Could I a... borrow that ring.
text: Mr. Johnny, in shock, hands it over to Ronny.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Thanks.
text: He kneels down before Loretta. He presents the ring to her.
speaker_heading: RONNY
dialog: Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini
dialog: Clark?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Before all these people, yes, I will
dialog: marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
text: She takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Do you love him, Loretta?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh God, that's too bad.
text: Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts
text: to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously.
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: What's the matter, Pop?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
text: (Lifts his head and
dialog: cries out)
dialog: I'M CONFUSED !
text: Loretta pushes Ronny away, breaking the kiss. They have both
text: neglected to breathe the whole time they were kissing.
text: They are both gasping for air, especially Loretta.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
text: But then she looks at Ronny, and lunges back to him, diving
text: into another kiss like a mermaid diving into the bluest ocean.
speaker_heading: MUSIC
text: "O SOAVE FANCIULLA" from "La Boheme," COMES UP and engulfs
dialog: the lovers, the family, the world.
text: WE SEE the faces of the lovers swirl away into a golden and
dialog: diamond light, and
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: EIGHT FULL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES
text: Glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop. Into each is
text: dropped a lump of sugar. A bottle of recently employed bitters
text: sits nearby with its cap off (like a respectful peasant in
text: aristocratic company. And the roses in the center.
text: Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE the table is surrounded.
text: Cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last
text: glass of champagne. Rose is by him. Rita and Raymond are
text: side by side, as are Ronny and Loretta. The Old Man sits,
text: staring at his son, intent and approving. But where is Mr.
dialog: Johnny?
speaker_heading: COSMO
text: Everybody take a glass.
text: Everybody takes a glass. The Old Man takes one and gets up
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (to Cosmo)
dialog: Wait.
text: The Old Man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of
text: the kitchen where Mr. Johnny, deeply disturbed and somewhat
text: catatonic, sits on a step-ladder.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (continuing; to Mr.
dialog: Johnny, offering the
dialog: glass)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: I don't want it.
text: But the Old Man, wise and merry and tough, presses the glass
text: on Mr. Johnny, who takes it.
text: COSMO, THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY NOW, LIFTS HIS GLASS
speaker_heading: COSMO
dialog: To... the family. Right? Ti amo.
text: They all lift their glasses.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OF ROSE'S FACE
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Ti amo.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OF RAYMOND AND RITA
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: That's right.
text: Rita nods.
text: A CLOSE-UP OF RONNY AND LORETTA DRINKING THEIR CHAMPAGNE
text: And looking into each other's eyes.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN
text: Who knocks back his drink lustily, and then with a glittering
text: eye looks away from the table.
scene_heading: MR. JOHNNY FROM THE OLD MAN'S POV
text: Mr. Johnny sits without moving, holding his glass. A long
text: moment passes. Mr. Johnny is thinking. Then he nods to
text: himself. He lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNNY
dialog: To family.
text: CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN LOOKING AWAY FROM MR. JOHNNY
text: And he laughs his laugh. This laugh could kill him. The CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK a little. He pounds the table and knocks over the
dialog: roses.
text: A CLOSE-UP OF THE RED ROSES ON THE WHITE TABLETOP CLOSING
text: BLACK CREDITS ROLL AGAINST THE WHITE BACKGROUND.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
