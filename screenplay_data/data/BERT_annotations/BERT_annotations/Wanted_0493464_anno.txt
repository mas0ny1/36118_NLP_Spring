scene_heading: INT. APPLEBY'S - DAY
text: The CAMERA STARTS FROM THE CEILING, pointing straight
text: down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed
text: in business casual, pretending to have a good time at
dialog: lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant.
text: At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in.
text: front of Wesley,'and the CAMERA STARTS descending
text: directly for it, slowly, as we hear...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.O.)
dialog: It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant
dialog: there was a certain amount of inter-
dialog: office pressure to go to Appleby's and
dialog: sit at a table of twenty-five with my
text: boss Janice presiding at the head even
text: though she's too tight to pick up the
dialog: bill. Which meant, the poor bastard
dialog: waiting on us had to split the check
dialog: twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing
dialog: to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf,
dialog: no less -- don't do us any favors,
dialog: Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of

scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: A sharply dressed man, MR. X, wearing a dark .Armani suit,
text: enters a skyscraper through the lobby. He's a shade
text: taller than most of the office workers who are coming and
dialog: going.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY
text: He heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top
dialog: floor.
text: And as his finger presses the button, just where the
text: thumb meets the forefinger, we see a TATTOO of a three-
text: headed dog.
dialog: Soon...
scene_heading: INT. TOP FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY
text: .the doors open again and he finds himself in an
text: opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed.
text: Only one office is at the end of the hall.
text: Expressionless, he makes his way toward it. Without
text: knocking, he steps inside...
scene_heading: INT. PUJA'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: .an office fit for a king. Or a queen. Because behind
text: a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed
text: traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her
text: forehead, the holy third eye. Her name is PUJA.
text: Mr. X sits in the single chair opposite her.
text: After a moment, Puja looks up.
speaker_heading: PUJA
dialog: I didn't expect for you yourself to come.
text: One of the heads, in the flesh.
speaker_heading: MR. X
dialog: You're an important fence.

speaker_heading: PUJA
dialog: I'm flattered.
text: She reaches over to an attachâ¬ case and removes a file.
speaker_heading: PUJA (CONT'D)
text: The name of the target is Henry Helms.
text: Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a
text: few feet away from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both
text: standing. She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,.
text: with piercing eyes.
speaker_heading: PUJA (CONT'D)
dialog: He's a journalist who stumbled on to a
dialog: story exposing a lot of powerful people,
dialog: people who don't like having their power
dialog: threatened.
speaker_heading: MR. x
dialog: Poor Helms.
speaker_heading: PUJA
dialog: There.have been five attempts on his
dialog: life, but he has been well protected...
text: and well hidden. Turns out his wife's
dialog: family has a lot of money. He's in town
dialog: to accept an award.
speaker_heading: MR. X
dialog: We'll see to it that it never makes his
dialog: mantle.
speaker_heading: PUJA
dialog: And for that, my clients will pay
text: handsomely.
text: Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens...
text: .he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts
text: to move a little, like a second dot is trying to emerge
text: from it, like an amoeba splitting.
dialog: It's a sh hooter's laser!
text: His eyes go wide as saucers.
speaker_heading: MR. x
speaker_heading: GET DOWN1!1
text: .but it's too late as bullets rip into her head.
text: splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet
dialog: bar.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
text: Mr. X crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a.
text: PAIR OF GUNS -- as technologically advanced as anything
dialog: we've ever seen -- spring into his hands.
text: The bullets .stop flying and he sprints at the window from
text: which they came, smashing t rough what remains of it,
text: disappearing from the demolished room...
text: .all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood
text: seeping out of that holy third eye.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE SKYSCRAPER - FORTY FLOORS UP - DAY
text: Mr. X's momentum carries him from one building to the
text: next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below.
text: He lands on the...
text: ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING:
text: ...and rolls up quickly, guns ready.
text: His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover
text: on the neighboring rooftop..
text: .and on a dead sprint across the roof...
text: . he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from
text: around an air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his
dialog: left band.
text: The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the
text: flesh... which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears.
text: The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,
dialog: exposing himself. That's all Mr. X needs, and another
text: shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!
text: The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,
text: silencing him, just as...
text: .Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.
text: He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of
dialog: this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r
text: screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the
text: three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in
text: front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.
text: A second marksmen is just on the other side of the
text: stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.
text: Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the
text: marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: /~,
text: ...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that
text: the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the
text: side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and
text: into the ksman's throat.
text: Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is
text: moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then
text: makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of
text: aluminum off the top of the stairwell...
text: ..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head
dialog: of the hiding marksman...
text: . the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending
text: the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the
text: marksman's heads As he falls...
text: THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is
text: breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as
text: he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...
text: all chopped down in a matter of seconds.
text: He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...
speaker_heading: LAST MARKSMAN
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
text: He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.
dialog: Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,
dialog: maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.
speaker_heading: LAST MARKSMEN
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Okay... okay...
text: He finally decides...
text: .and takes one step forward...
text: THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.
text: He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks
text: toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a
text: hunter over his prey.
text: Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,
text: pinning it away from his dropped weapon.
speaker_heading: MR. X
speaker_heading: (GROWLS)
dialog: Who sent you?

dialog:

speaker_heading: LAST MARKSMEN
speaker_heading: (NERVOUSLY)
dialog: We're... we're just the decoys, man. We
dialog: were paid to get you out here...
text: The marksman points at a small VIDEO CAMERA sitting on
text: the roof, relaying their every move...
text: Mr. X's face falls as.those words register, and just
dialog: then...
text: RA ROCKETS over thetreets of the city, block
dialog: after block in the blink of any eye...
text: .until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile away.
text: ON THE NEW ROOFTOP:
text: A man named CROSS is in a crouch, holding a massive RIFLE
text: pointed upward, at an angle...
text: A small SCREEN on Cross' gun shows the scene from the
dialog: roof, along with various elemental measurements: wind
dialog: speed, pressure, temperature, distance, altitude...
dialog: .. the information on __the reflects off of Cross'
text: eyeball as he processes,,the shot... a quick adjustment to
text: the gun and a slight pull of the trigger...
dialog: BOOM...
text: We follow the arcing bullet back over the rooftops in an
dialog: instant. Somehow it keeps it's elevation and it's
dialog: path...
text: .to the resigned look on Mr. X's face: an outsmarted
text: man, a dead man.
text: The bullet hits him square in the chest, and he falls to
text: his knees, then slumps over, dead.
text: Flies start to gather as he lies there.
text: First one, then two, then several as night TIME-DISSOLVES
dialog: to day...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER

dialog: belong to the hottest black woman on the planet, FOX.
text: As they look down at the dead body...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It was a set-up all the way?
text: Sloan just nods.
text: He then stoops down, shoos some of the flies away with
text: the back of his hand and picks up the file that Puja gave
dialog: Mr. X.
text: The CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of Sloan's hand as he

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CONSULTANT
dialog: I asked you about the effects of net

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Well, that's the thing.-
speaker_heading: CONSULTANT
dialog: What's the thing?
speaker_heading: WESLEY

dialog: Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide
dialog: cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I

speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Good God a'mighty.
speaker_heading: CONSULTANT
dialog: Son... everyone knows that net

text: Everyone snickers.
speaker_heading: CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact, to prove my point, I'd like you

text: just keeps sizing him up.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: He'd be damn disappointed in what you've
dialog: become, too.
text: Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Lady...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I've been called a lot of things, but
dialog: "lady" ain't one of 'em.
text: Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him...
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, Wesley, how d'you ever learn
dialog: anything when you won't keep your mouth
dialog: shut and your ears open? I'm trying to

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father, Wesley, wits the greatâ sit

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: This is what you've dreamt about all your

dialog: Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e' e
text: also fisting a Da'r of alms.
text: Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM!
text: BAMI BAMZ BAMI BAM: forcing Cross to take cover on the
text: far side of the aisle.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Move! Now!
text: She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him
text: forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing
dialog: machine.
text: They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle
text: explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of
text: spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a
text: rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce
dialog: and what is blood.
text: Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas
text: and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have
text: a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley.
text: He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section,
text: smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely
text: miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind
text: them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: But Wesley and Fox are too quick.. She still has a.hold

scene_heading: -EXT. OUTSIDE THE GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: There is a cherry red FERRARI convertible parked right

text: Wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Drive!
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What?!!
text: But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and
text: ready, as Wesley's legs. somehow take over and he hops
text: behind the wheel.
text: Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner,
text: practically going up on two tires.
text: Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and
text: smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck
text: when it launches forward.
text: He races through the gears and rips around a corner and
text: out into traffic.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Just drive!
text: The Chevelle stays on his tail behind them; Cross drives
text: and fires his Glock at the same time. Bam! Bam! Sam!
text: Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while
text: Wesley mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at
dialog: what is happening.
text: He spots a side-street...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Hold on!
text: ...whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: EXT. ONE WAY STREET - DAY
text: ...and ends up going the wrong way down a narrow one-way
dialog: street!
text: He now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for
text: them, as Cross stays tight on their ass.
text: Horns are BLARING in his face, but Wesley somehow keeps
text: the. Ferrari on all four tires as he bobs in'and out of
text: the paths of oncoming cars.
text: A 4 X 4 Chevy Pickup is headed like a missile right at
dialog: them...
text: Wesley's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Truck!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Go around it!
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No! Shoot the tires!
text: Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea,
text: then spins and fires away at the oncoming truck.
text: The front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers
text: hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat
text: sends it into a violent roll.
text: Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips
dialog: forward... right over their car!!!
text: Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed his idea
text: worked... when finally it SMASHES down into the street
text: between them and Cross's Chevellel
text: Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out...
text: but it's too late... his Chevelle smashes into the 4 X 4
text: before skidding to a stop, a tangled mess in the street.
text: Wesley snaps back to reality and rips the Ferrari off the
text: one-way street and down a side street.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - LATER
text: He pulls the car to a stop, then looks over at Fox,

speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: There's a lot of things you don't know

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: That... was the man who killed your
dialog: father. And now he's trying to kill you.
text: Wesley forces a laugh, but right now it's hard to paint
dialog: any-thing as ludicrous.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No. I mean... I told you my father died
dialog: when I was a baby.
text: She leans right into his face so that their noses are
text: only inches apart.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Have you ever believed that? Have you
dialog: ever been content with that answer?
text: Wesley stops, not sure of anything right now.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Today's your new birthday, Wesley.
dialog: Drive.
text: He settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again,
text: this time, easing.a little more respectably into traffic.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER
text: The Ferrari cruises to a stop outside a warehouse.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: The people I work with... we believe your

dialog: to you. You knew how to handle the car,
dialog: you knew to shoot at the truck.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I... I...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It's that confidence we're gonna need to
dialog: work on.
text: Wesley is still dazed.

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PROUDLY)

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: When?
text: They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I... I guess I'm not sure.
text: Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the
text: gun in Wesley's hand.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
text: Shoot the wings off the flies.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SLOAN
speaker_heading: (GROWLS)

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I don't...
text: In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun
dialog: off the rolling table and ',s

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: You have three seconds. Three... two...
text: Before he can say one, Wesley reacts... blindly firing
text: the pistol in his hand, indiscriminately, B,AM! BAM!
text: BAM! BAM! CLICK...CLICK...CLICK... until his finger is
text: just jamming on the trigger over and over.
text: After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
text: Sloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and
text: picks up the magnifying glass. He stoops down and

text: THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS:
text: Four flies lie on - the floor. crawling o d... their

scene_heading: IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
text: Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this.
speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: And after we fine tune those skills...

speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. CITY BLOCK - DAY
text: Sloan and Wesley move down a busy commercial street.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: I know thin is hard for you to

dialog: father was a member of the Fraternity, a
dialog: collection of the most powerful assassins
dialog: the world has ever known.
text: They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about

text: When the CAMERA PANS OVER AGAIN, the Chef is gone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - DAY
text: The Gardener works his gardening shears on a hedge in the

text: Then, he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws
text: a long range rifle with a scope. He pokes the rifle
text: through the freshly-cut hole, looks through the lens,
text: starts to squeeze his trigger...
text: The CAMERA SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the
text: neighborhood. We see that we are in the hills over the

text: pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile
dialog: away.
text: He brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet

text: He only gets a block before the gun at his waist

dialog: .I understand, Janice, that junior high
dialog: must have been particularly difficult
dialog: being called Tubby all the time, but that
dialog: doesn't give you the goddamn right to
dialog: treat your workers like horseshit. Sure
dialog: we laugh at you behind your back and sure

speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: .and sure everyone takes their lunch an

text: Janice's eyes fall to her feet.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: .you know, if you weren't such a bitch,
dialog: we might actually feel sorry for you. As
dialog: it is, I feel I can speak for the rest of
dialog: the office when I say... FUCK YOU!!!
text: With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending
dialog: them flying!
text: Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as
text: everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on their
dialog: faces.
text: The loudmouth from the break-room steps out...
speaker_heading: LOUDMOUTH
dialog: That was great dude!
text: He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just
text: WALLOPS him with a right cross, not breaking stride on

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE WESLEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Wesley flies out the front door, just as Fox's Diablo
text: swings around the corner.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's up, new man?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You were watching?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Never stopped. How'd it feel, saying
dialog: exactly what you wanted to say?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
text: Like I had a gun in my hands.
text: Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on
text: the pedal. The Diablo's tires smoke as she launches it
text: out of there.
scene_heading: INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROOM - DAY
text: They return to the butcher shop. Sides of beef hang from
text: hooks next to a cutting table. The Butcher is sharpening
text: a knife.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You need to get used to the blood and the
dialog: muscle and the meat and the sinew and
dialog: what a single blade of steel can do to a
text: chunk of flesh.
text: The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of
text: one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the table.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Take care of him, Butcher.
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER
dialog: Will do, Fox.
text: The Butcher measures Wesley, then starts to talk in a
text: steady, almost bored voice...
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember, it's the body we are killing.
dialog: Know it like a surgeon.
text: Wesley nods, half disgusted, half enthralled.
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, we'll start at the beginning. To
dialog: cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife
text: ice-pick style and thrust down behind the
text: clavicle, cutting side to side.
text: He jabs the blade into the beef... and just as he does...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: FLASH - PARKING GARAGE:

scene_heading: FLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
text: .and the Butcher performs the next move...
scene_heading: THE BUTCHER -
dialog: To slice the diaphragm, first whip your
text: wrist into the target's trachea to
dialog: prevent screaming, then drive the knife
text: at a forty-five degree angle upward just
text: below the rib cage.
text: Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut
dialog: to...
scene_heading: FLASH - LUXURY HOTEL SUITE:
text: . a DRUG KINGPIN coming out of his hotel bathroom
text: wearing a bathrobe. Suddenly the Butcher is on him,
dialog: performing what he just described on this poor bastard,
text: who can no longer scream because he's missing his
dialog: trachea, and just as quickly...
scene_heading: FLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
dialog: .we are right back to the hanging side of beef as the
text: Butcher performs the next move...
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER
dialog: If you want the jugular, pull your
dialog: enemy's head to the left and jab your
text: knife well into his sterno-cleio-
dialog: mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down
dialog: and left.
dialog: Just like before, we smash cut to...
scene_heading: FLASH - DIRTY ALLEY:
text: ...a MAN moseying down an alley, carrying a briefcase,

dialog: demonstrating.

scene_heading: 7 FLASH - HACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:

speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.O.)
dialog: They never show you this shit on the
dialog: McDonald's commercials.
text: .. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely absorbed
text: in the lesson. The Butcher hands him the knife, and
text: Wesley starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to
dialog: please the Butcher, wanting to get it right...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - NIGHT
text: Fox is seated at a small outdoor cafe, sipping on a
text: latte, reading the paper. There's a story about the
text: death threats to Henry Helms on the front page.
text: Just then Wesley approaches, his face splattered with
text: flecks of blood. She wipes his face with a napkin.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You haven't quite figured out this whole
dialog: "blending in" thing, yet. Let's go.
scene_heading: EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT
text: A huge Chevy 4X4 pulls up and Fox hope out from behind

text: Fox pulls out a metal device to pick the lock.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: This...
text: She picks the lock and they step inside...
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE - NIGHT
text: the empty morgue examining room. Empty except for a

dialog: sheets.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: This is the Roach Motel, Wesley.
text: Wesley looks around, disgusted.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, find us some skinny bitches.
text: Wesley uncovers the first body... it's a. black male.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some
dialog: white meat. And nothing too fat.
text: Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second
text: body. He unveils it to reveal... what looks like a dead
text: suburban housewife.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfect. Load up soccer mom.
scene_heading: INT. TARGET ROOM - NIGHT
text: Fox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of
text: thing you see in a police target range. It shows the
text: outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for
dialog: where you're supposed to aim.
text: The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on
text: to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper
text: target. Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom
text: and target to the end of the range.
text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them
text: standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite
dialog: end of the range.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Selecting your weapon and then disposing
dialog: of it is the most pivotal aspect of every
dialog: assassination.
text: An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pick one.
text: Wesley eyes all the weaponry. Finally, he settles on a
text: short-barreled black handgun. Sloan takes it from him
text: and inspects it.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It
text: holds seventeen bullets in the clip and
text: one in the chamber. It's made of a
text: composite material unrecognizable by
text: metal detectors.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog:

speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And the Imanishi's bullets have
text: microchips that communicate with similar
text: ones in the gun.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Computer chips?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Sometimes the closest distance between
dialog: two points is not a straight line. What
dialog: if soccer mom here is between you and
dialog: your target?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I suppose you're going to tell me to
dialog: shoot her first.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: How'd you do in Physics class?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Mostly B's.
text: Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I got a D.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I couldn't remember all the rules --
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: That's it. Rules. What if I told you
dialog: there weren't any?
text: He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: People live by the rules set before them.
dialog: We take them on faith that they are
dialog: right. But how many times in your life
dialog: have you thought you had a better way,
dialog: against-the rules that was simply laughed
dialog: at.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Every day.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Because you use your brain differently
dialog: than other people. All Fraternity
dialog: members do.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Humans use neurons to think. But most
dialog: people can only handle a small percentage
dialog: of those neurons firing at once without
text: suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not
dialog: us. And not you. We have the ability to
dialog: think differently than other people.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: So we set our own rules.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: That's right.
text: Sloan hands him back the weapon.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D
dialog: Try it.
text: Wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him. He
dialog: FIRES...
text: ..and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you ever shot a gun before?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Just the flies.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: So you have no pre-conceived habits we
dialog: need to break. Shoot the target. Don't
dialog: hit mom.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You mean curve the bullet? How?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: This isn't about "how." It's about
dialog: "what." If you'd never been told a
dialog: bullet flies straight and I handed you
dialog: this and said hit that target... what
dialog: would you do? Allow your instincts to
dialog: guide you. Just like the flies.

speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The technology is only here to assist

text: Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing...
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not 'will' that makes the physical
dialog: react how we wish, it's 'control.' You
dialog: are in control...
speaker_heading: BAM BAM BAM!
text: The bullets blast out of the gun, like they are on a
text: track set up by Wesley's brain. He flicks his wrists
dialog: and...
dialog: .they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2
dialog: center of the target!
text: Sloan smiles.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Rules are made to be broken, Wesley. No
dialog: one was better at that than your father.

speaker_heading: CATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doing? Are you leaving? You

text: The CAMERA SWINGS OVER TO CATHY, who is about to pies

speaker_heading: BAM!
text: He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls helpless to the

speaker_heading: FOX (V.0.)

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: We're not sure. The fence he was meeting
text: was shot in the head... which led him out
dialog: to here... but it must've been a set-up
dialog: all along. All I know is it would take a
dialog: hell of a trap to bring your father down.
text: Wesley crouches down by where his father's body would
text: have been, running his fingers over the gravel rooftop.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: My whole life I thought he was dead. I
dialog: shouldn't feel any differently just
dialog: because it happened 20 years later.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: WESLEY

scene_heading: INT. SHITTY MORGUE - NIGHT
text: They stand in a dark corner of a decrepit morgue, where a

text: like much more than a crack-house.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: We cremate our dead. I'd like to say
dialog: it's to honor them, but it's mainly to
dialog: keep anyone from identifying them after

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: These are my father's ashes?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Yeah.

dialog: cremains.
text: But then hisfingegs find something in the dust... a

speaker_heading: THE PHARMACIST
dialog: If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one

dialog: WHAM! WHAM!
speaker_heading: THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, if you find yourself one ' on three,

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: The sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the
text: background as Wesley's voice-over comes up...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.)
dialog: There are two kinds of pain. One is an
text: object. A living thing that crawls
dialog: around the outside of your body. Cuts,
text: broken bones, bruises... all deliver the
dialog: kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and
text: they soon disappear to nothing but the
text: sound of a gnat in your ear.
text: Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I've lived with a different kind of pain
dialog: all my life... the kind that comes from
dialog: two decades of being passed over, pushed
dialog: around, ignored. But you can't hide from
dialog: that kind of pain either...
text: Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: .because it finds you.
text: He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his
dialog: head.
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: Sloan sits across from Wesley at a skinny table in an
text: otherwise bare room.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Watch the eyes. Look for a slight
dialog: swelling of the pupil. You can train
dialog: your body to stay a constant temperature,
dialog: you can control your heartbeat, but you
dialog: can't control the center of your eyes.
dialog: That's how you know when someone is lying
dialog: to you.
text: Sloan looks right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes,
text: trying to fend off his stare.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to fuck Fox?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: I know that's a lie without even seeing
dialog: your eyes.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Fine. Try something else.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Okay. What are you hiding from me?
text: Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Nothing.
text: Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep
text: something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and
text: pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center...
text: places it on the table.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You told me to hunt down my father's
dialog: killer. That's what I'm doing.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: The bullet that killed him. You said his
dialog: heart stopped but there was no entrance
text: wound. This bullet has a hole cut into
dialog: its center...
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You know how a mole buries into the earth
dialog: by pushing the dirt back around it? I
dialog: think this bullet does what the mole
text: does... Splits the skin and pushes it
text: back through its center, filling the
text: space it just passed through.
text: Sloan looks at him, like he might have been
text: underestimating him until now.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fox was telling me that my father used
text: special bullets. It looks like Cross
dialog: does too... which means these are custom
dialog: made. If we find who makes them, then we
dialog: find someone who has access to Cross.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Whatever happened to my father's guns?
dialog: The pearl handled ones?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Don't know. But whoever has them isn't

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Cross. The details of his life.

speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: We keep a record of every assassination
dialog: mission, going back to the Ides of March.
dialog: Maps, diagrams, logistics, complications,
dialog: weapons of choice... it's all there.
text: Wesley nods, impressed. Sloan just keeps leading him
text: through a set of double doors, into...
scene_heading: INT. MAP ROOM -- DAY
text: .a large room, the size of an auditorium. On the floor
text: is a gigantic model of the entire city, built to scale,
text: showing all the buildings, skyscrapers, churches, the
dialog: waterfront, the city streets. Everything the city has to
text: offer laid out in miniature.
text: Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the
dialog: model city...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What's all this?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Where we plot our local hits. This city
dialog: is one of the Fraternity's major
dialog: headquarters.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: (looking around)
text: This room. The books. Seems low-tech.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Part of mastering technology is knowing
dialog: when to use it. Models can't be hacked.
dialog: Your father built this room himself.
text: Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst
text: them are a few vainted red. Some of the model street
text: lamps are also red.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
text: The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire
text: model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on
text: some of the manhole covers.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What's with the red ones?
text: Sloan just smiles...

dialog: STREETLIGHT and we...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: .the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with

text: and trucks whizzing through the street.
text: Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing
text: streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in
dialog: particular.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
text: The Fraternity's grasp reaches every
dialog: facet of the world's major cities,
dialog: including their construction. Look at
dialog: this streetlight.
text: Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the
dialog: pole... the standard thing you find on these things...
dialog: "Municipal C. W. 63070."
dialog: But then there is something different on this one... a
text: tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus
dialog: instead of the seal of the cit
text: Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside,
text: revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand
text: inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the
text: clip expertly, then racks the weapon.
text: Wesley can't believe it.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You have stashes...
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: .everywhere.
speaker_heading: WESLEY

text: Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol
text: starts FIRING next to him.
text: He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &amp;o him, firing at

text: his mind racing.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Cross and my father were tight. But
dialog: Cross thought he should be one of the
dialog: heads of the Fraternity so he left and
dialog: vowed to kill the three heads. Which
dialog: means my father is dead because of petty
dialog: jealousy.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: More reason for Cross to die.
text: Wesley flips to the picture of cross.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: But I don't see jealousy in those eyes,
dialog: do you?
text: Fox walks over and slams the binder shut.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we
dialog: have to kill Henry Helms. Do-you know
dialog: who that is?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: The journalist who's got a price-tag on
text: his head.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: A price-tag that we're going to collect.
dialog: Your father was meeting with a fence
dialog: about the job when Cross took him down.
dialog: So we can only assume Cross knows about
dialog: the target too. We... you... have to
dialog: take Cross out before we prosecute this
dialog: mission. We can't have him out there as
dialog: a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: We've never defaulted on a job and this
dialog: 1k one won't be the first.
scene_heading: INT. TARGET ROOM - DAY
text: Sloan fires at the target, the bullets following his
text: every command. Wesley does the same, equally skilled.
text: Fox sits, watching the two of them. Is it becoming
text: competitive? One shoots and then the other follows,
dialog: neither one ever missing.
text: Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out
text: the body.
text: Fox leans back, impressed.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: May have found your match, Sloan.
text: Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy
dialog: the weapon. No other rules.
text: Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: (to the Gunsmith)
text: Close the gap. Push the body closer to
dialog: the target..
speaker_heading: THE GUNSMITH
text: It's already at four feet.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
text: Closer.
speaker_heading: THE GUNSMITH
dialog: Here's two. Your father couldn't even do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
text: Closer.
speaker_heading: THE GUNSMITH
dialog: Wesley, at some point --
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Closer. I'll say when.
speaker_heading: WN
text: Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body,
text: until it's actually touching the back of the dead
dialog: business man!
speaker_heading: THE GUNSMITH
dialog: How you gonna -- ?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Just run it out there. Let the kid work.
text: The Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range.
text: Wesley looks at Sloan.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You wanna go first?
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: There are limits to everything, Wesley.
text: At some point the body becomes a shield.
text: Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds,
text: lightning fast.
text: The Gunsmith brings the target back to them...
dialog: ..a the business man is riddled with es.
speaker_heading: THE GUNSMITH
dialog: I guess not every rule can be broken.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Check the target.
text: The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five
text: bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found
text: it's mark on the target.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll find one entry below the shoulder,
text: missing the major blood vessels there,
text: exiting the back. Second shot went
text: through the abdomen, clipped only the
text: bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the
text: upper right quadrant of the abdomen,
dialog: which is partially protected by the
text: ribcage, and passed through the liver and
text: probably part of the gallbladder. Upper
dialog: left abdomen is a good place, where
text: number four ruptured the spleen before
text: continuing down main street. And
dialog: finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK."
dialog: Number five entered the mouth, was
text: redirected downward by the upper jawbone
text: ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's
dialog: the shot you'll find in the middle of the
dialog: target.
text: Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Sloan)
dialog: Fuck the rules.
text: With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: And yours is?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: My great-great-great-grandfather on my

dialog: coming over from East Africa and as it
dialog: was pulling into Charleston, he killed
dialog: every white man on the ship and swam to

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.)
dialog: Being a member of the Fraternity was like
dialog: winning the lottery...
text: ON THE CITY STREETS:
text: Traffic lights mean nothing, as Wesley mashes the

text: up the road like a tiger on the prowl.
text: Fox rises up in the passenger seat, looking over the
text: windshield, the wind whipping her face...
speaker_heading: WESLEY.(V.0.)
dialog: This... this is what my dad's life was
dialog: like. He was a fucking god.
text: He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a
text: corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler,
text: which has to slam on its brakes.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where we headed?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Trial by fire, sugar. Hook a right.
text: Wesley whips the car around a corner...
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Park it here, baby.
text: He pulls the car to the side of the street...
text: .in front of a busy outdoor mall. It's covered with

dialog: people.
text: Fox eyes the crowd.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You need a new wardrobe or something?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: we're here for a reason and it ain't

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: It's graduation day, baby.
text: I He nods and makes his way toward...
scene_heading: THE OUTDOOR MALL:
text: .where he quickly mingles with the crowd. He has his
text: hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded-
text: sweatshirt, the pistol inside. People pass him on his
text: left and right, some make eye contact, some don't...
dialog: anybody could be the target..
text: Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the
text: SECURITY GUARD by the theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The
text: Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping at the sunglasses
dialog: stand.
text: And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not
text: expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was
text: shagging his girlfriend... is thumbing through books
text: outside the BARNES AND NOBLE... seemingly. not paying
text: attention to what's around him.
text: Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it?
text: Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts
text: walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck, this
dialog: can't really be happening...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: BARRY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Get down!
text: .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his
dialog: office... The Consultant.
text: He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of

text: Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger...
text: .but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE PORSCHE:

scene_heading: SMASH BACK TO:
scene_heading: THE OUTDOOR MALL:
text: Wesley can't believe his gun is empty. In the split-

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: ...Wesley moves faster than we thought he could move...
text: he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and
text: dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street.
text: The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of
text: the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying.
text: Wesley hooks a right around a SHARPER IMAGE and heads
text: straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission,
dialog: knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why...
text: Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg
text: Room. We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized
text: in all those hours staring at the model. Finally we see
text: one SMALL BENCH next to a fountain, which is bright red.
text: Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and
text: Wesley is running all out for that bench. He goes into a
text: slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding
text: under it, popping up on the other side.
text: He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does,
text: revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL...
text: .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming,
text: using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up,
dialog: surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM:
text: The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting
text: him in his two shoulders and his chest.
text: People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the
text: gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when
text: he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A
text: couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well.
text: Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling
text: too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his
dialog: body...
speaker_heading: FOX
text: Pin shot bullets.
text: Wesley looks down at the gun.
speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But you're only going to have one.
text: Pek War waits, trying not to writhe from the pain...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So my question is... how do I find Cross?
text: Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading...
speaker_heading: PEK WAR
speaker_heading: (DEFENSIVE)
dialog: My clients use middlemen, I don't meet
dialog: them in person, I know so little about
dialog: them...
text: Wesley twitches the handle just a bit.
speaker_heading: PEK WAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Okayl Okayl Dammitl God damiaitl I'll

text: Wesley lets up a little bit.
speaker_heading: PEK WAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Prearranged meets.
text: Fox snatches up a nearby phone.
speaker_heading: WESLEY.
dialog: Start prearranging.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -NIGHT
text: The Porsche once again tears across the asphalt, as
text: Wesley drives.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Wesley, you gotta know something. No
dialog: matter what kind of training you've done
dialog: these last few weeks, killing your first,
dialog: well that's gonna change you forever.
text: Wesley drives for a while. Then...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You know what my foster mother. told me
dialog: when I was six years old?
text: Fox shakes her head.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: She caught me eating some jello out of
dialog: the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I
dialog: wasn't supposed to but I was so damn
dialog: hungry, and it was just some fucking
dialog: jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard
dialog: I couldn't bite down straight for a week,
dialog: she told me... she told me that God had
dialog: killed my parents because I was such a
dialog: wicked boy.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Jesus. Someone needs to find that bitch
dialog: and set her straight.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: So I grew up thinking I was the reason I
dialog: never knew my parents. But now, to find
dialog: out, that no, my father didn't give me up
dialog: because he had died... he gave me up
dialog: because he was Protecting me... well I
dialog: guess I want to give him something back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Here we are.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one
text: of which has the words Times-Herald on it. Newspaper
text: delivery TRUCKS make their way in and out of the loading
dialog: dock area of this building.
text: Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks.
text: Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they
text: can have a view of the corner in front of them.
text: Wesley scans the area quickly.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Not very discreet, are they?
text: Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley
text: is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES
text: peering down. looking over the site.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: The others are only backup singers. This
dialog: is your show.
text: Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear,
text: crouching down.
text: Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a
text: long black overcoat approaching the corner near the
text: newspaper building.
text: Fox's eyes start to dance.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember: he's good, baby. But you're
dialog: the best I've ever seen.
text: Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car.
scene_heading: IN THE STREET:
text: From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back.
text: His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing
text: second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his
dialog: gun...
text: .and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning,
text: Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a
text: nearby warehouse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves
text: over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing
text: a crouching ASSASSIN to plunge from the roof to the
dialog: street near Wesley!
text: The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross
text: disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald.
text: Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other
text: Fraternity members beat them there, the BELLMAN, the
text: WAITER, and the ELECTRICIAN.
text: Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then
dialog: start inside the building...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: No!
text: The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading
text: dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body
text: falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the
dialog: dock.
text: Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as
text: screaming WORKERS run from the place.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: We need a way in there.
speaker_heading: ELECTRICIAN
dialog: Let's find another door.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: He'll be long gone by then.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: He's got the high ground.
text: Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
text: On the pallet.
text: They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the
text: lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs
text: into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching
text: on the pallet on the front.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING:
dialog: Once inside...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Separate.
text: The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of
text: newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.
scene_heading: WITH THE ELECTRICIAN:
text: The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes,
text: eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of
text: stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't
text: realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,
dialog: just big enough for a --
text: THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits
text: the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him
dialog: around.
text: CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the
text: bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next
text: space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is
dialog: now leaning...
text: .the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the
dialog: flog.
text: Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as
text: Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden
text: beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The
text: rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,
text: allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.
text: Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.
scene_heading: ON LEVEL TWO:
text: Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing
text: up the morning edition.
text: A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the
text: Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.
text: Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring
dialog: machines...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: (to the Waiter)
dialog: Stay here and cover us. There's no angle
dialog: for him to hit you if you stay here.
text: Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the
dialog: machines.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't let him get up there. And stay
dialog: clear of the presses! He'll use them
dialog: however he can.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It's what I'd do.
text: With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the
dialog: machinery.
text: The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a
text: hundred pounds of paper spins through every second.
text: He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that
text: scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until...
text: ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o
text: Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans
text: of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal,
text: until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it
dialog: to explode!
text: The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and
text: stumbles nearer the printing press...
speaker_heading: BAM BAM BAM!
text: More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on
text: the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half.
text: The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a.
dialog: saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf !
text: With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the
text: presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes
dialog: with Wesley...
text: ..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep
dialog: moving...
text: He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a
text: stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically
text: cartwheels away...
text: .but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the
text: press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece
text: of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out
text: of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Fuuuucckkk!
text: Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep goin', baby! Take him!
text: Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to
dialog: chase Cross to level three.
scene_heading: ON LEVEL THREE:
text: Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is
text: already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming
text: and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in
text: the business offices of the paper, and it looks
text: surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass
text: cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere.
text: Wesley jumps up on a desk.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Cross!
text: Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of
text: the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at
text: Cross... who immediately returns fire...
text: .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets
text: in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a
text: COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.
text: The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving
text: over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the
text: Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each
dialog: other from sharp angles...
dialog: Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,
text: but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the
text: same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man
text: using the same techniques at the exact same time.
text: Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the
text: words "Action Items" written on it. He fires at it, and
text: his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them
text: strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!
text: Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to
text: flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely
text: avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby
text: window, smashing the glass out,
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
text: Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the
text: same window and dives through it, guns at the ready
dialog: and...
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:
text: .we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor,
dialog: firing his guns the whole time...
text: .until he lands top of an "L" train moving at ll
dialog: speed.
scene_heading: THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:
text: Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to
text: the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out
text: of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train.
scene_heading: ON THE L TRAIN:
text: Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train.
text: He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley...
text: .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under
text: an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere
dialog: inches.
text: Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars
text: and enter one of the L cars.
speaker_heading: BEHIND HIM:
text: Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the
text: trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his
dialog: wound.
text: Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also
text: swings down between the cars and enters...
scene_heading: THE FIRST L CAR:
text: .where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way
text: down the center of the empty car and out the back door.
text: Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready.
text: He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and
text: immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing
dialog: Cross.
text: They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing
dialog: their guns.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
text: Wesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two
text: new suns in his hand! Wesley is.on him quick though, and
text: SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough
text: to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley
text: takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off...
text: .Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls
dialog: backwards too from the momentum...
text: ..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train
text: before landing on either side of it!
scene_heading: EXT. DIRTY ALLEY - NIGHT
dialog: But the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep
text: firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and
text: realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast
text: between each car in the s it-second the opening passes.
scene_heading: ON THE TRAIN:
text: COMMUTERS ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their
text: papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware
text: of the gunfight raging outside the train.
text: A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a
text: BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite
text: side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the
text: hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?
text: IN THE ALLEY:
text: On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both
text: sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the
text: last train, while dodging each other's bullets...
text: .as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks,
text: ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin!
speaker_heading: CROSS
dialog: Wesley!
text: This takes Wesley aback...
speaker_heading: CROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look into my eyes!
text: Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger... as
dialog: is Cross's.
speaker_heading: CROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: (growls, in pain)
dialog: Look into my eyes, goddammit!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
text: Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees
text: himself reflected in Cross's Dupils.
text: Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards
text: away, and her headlights illuminate them.
text: Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing:
text: he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground. Wesley
dialog: can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless.
text: Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the
text: Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: CROSS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Everything they told you was a lie,
dialog: Wesley.
text: With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills
text: open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder,
text: but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through
text: the train must have found its mark.
text: Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of
dialog: times... then, with his last bit of energy...
speaker_heading: CROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: Find the missing piece. And... don't...
dialog: let them... dispose of the weapon...
text: With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes.
text: Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some
text: meaning there. But Cross just stares blankly back at
text: him, just as Fox comes limping up.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you
dialog: did it. You put down motherfucking
dialog: Cross!
text: Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his
text: hands from their clench. There is also some on the gun
text: he is holding. ar --h d ed crun.
text: Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun
text: from where it dropped and looks over them both.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: What'd he say to you?
text: Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's
text: eyes. He looks back down at Cross's body..
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: He said... he said 'pies on the
dialog: Fraternity...'
text: Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the
text: whole story. Finally, she nods...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of
dialog: you, baby! Let's go lay this on Sloan!
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I think I need.a minute to myself.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (UNDERSTANDING)
dialog: Sure. It's your first kill. I'll wait
dialog: for you...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Naah, that's all right. You need to get
dialog: stitched up. I'll meet you at that
dialog: Korean place.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You sure?
text: But he's already walking off. She watches him go,
dialog: thinking...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: Wesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get
text: out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk.
text: Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket:
text: a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact,
dialog: there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid.
text: Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the
text: cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the
dialog: words: "I left you something."
text: Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a
text: Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
text: Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to
text: its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
text: The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the
dialog: kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run
text: around the neighborhood, playing.
text: ON THE BIKE:
text: Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs
text: off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying
dialog: his book.
scene_heading: SIDE OF THE HOUSE:
text: He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down
dialog: the side of the house...
text: .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar
dialog: because we've seen this place before: it's where he
dialog: lived when he was a foster kid.
text: He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His
text: hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a
text: KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North
dialog: Highbury St.
text: Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the
text: key, and back to the book.
text: Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-
text: year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You live here?
text: The kid.nods .
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Foster home?
text: 4014 The kid nods again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Read this.
text: He tosses the kid the book and heads off.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into
text: his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key.
text: Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N.
text: Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no
text: windows, just a large-iron door in front.
text: Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean.
text: He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he
dialog: doesn't find one.
text: He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then...
text: .the door opens, revealing a woman, ANNA. She takes a
text: look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her
dialog: lips.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Come in, Wesley.
text: He stares at her, trying to figure this out. He steps...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE HOUSE:
text: .and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an
text: attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker.
text: Anna is now trying to hold back tears, but can't.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He's dead, isn't he?
dialog: There's no point lying to this woman...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: She nods knowingly, sadly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He told me if he didn't come back... it
dialog: would be you who pulled the trigger.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: â He killed my father...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
text: Anna looks at him, confused. But then, realization sets
dialog: in...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I think you need to meet someone...
text: she leads Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old
text: boy, plays the floor.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Wesley. This is your brother... Andrew.
text: Wesley's not sure what to make of this.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: My brother?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Half-brother. But both of you, you are
dialog: both 100 percent your.father's boys.
dialog: I've seen that from the beginning.
text: Andrew is busy playing with a couple of BLACK TOY
text: BUILDINGS on the floor. Wesley studies the little guy,
text: still confused.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father... he was with you the whole
dialog: time.
text: Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to. The
text: walls are filled with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and...
dialog: remarkably...
dialog: ...photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was-
dialog: growing u !
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: This was his favorite.
text: She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12,
text: sitting with his back to a tree, reading COUNT OF MONTE
text: CRISTO. The picture has been taken through a windshield,
text: across the street.
text: Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of
dialog: the walls...
text: FLASH: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery
text: store. But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between
text: herself and the shooter. He wasn't trying to hit Wesley,
text: he was trying to separate him from her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
text: Wesley, thinking, remembering...
text: FLASH: Wesley studying Cross's face in the file, seeing
dialog: that there isn't jealousy in those eyes.
text: Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by
dialog: pictures of himself...
text: FLASH: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils.
text: Holy shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at
text: Anna's kind face...
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: When your father and I found each other,
dialog: when we had Andrew, he said he could no
dialog: longer live the way he had been living.
dialog: He said he wouldn't give us up, the way
dialog: he had given up his first eon.
text: Wesley stares at the picture... he can't believe he was
dialog: being watched back when he felt so alone.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: It was his greatest regret.
text: She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother.
text: Wesley watches the kid, trying to process it all.
text: For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks
dialog: down...
text: .but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob
text: down in his throat and blinks back the tears. Goddamn,
dialog: he has a brother.
scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN OF THE SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
text: He walks up behind Anna, who is sipping some coffee at a
text: kitchen table, red eyed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: would you like some coffee?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'm okay.
text: Wesley sets the key down on the table.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know what this opens?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
text: A LONE KEYHOLE in a solid closet door.
text: Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open
text: revealing a LONG BLACK COAT, just like his father's.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I guess it's not much of an inheritance.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
speaker_heading: (STEELY)
dialog: He left me more than this.
text: Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I want you to know that he forgave you
dialog: before you ever pulled the trigger. He
dialog: tried to keep you out of it for so
dialog: long...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Why didn't he just tell me?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: once they had you... he couldn't risk it
dialog: unless you were alone. He knew his one
dialog: shot at telling you might be his last.
text: Her eyes harden a little bit.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to finish what he was doing,
dialog: Wesley. It's the only way any of us will
dialog: ever be free. Especially your brother.
dialog: They won't stop hunting us... your father
dialog: knew that.
text: Wesley nods.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'll be back as soon as this is over.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You have family here.
text: Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him.
scene_heading: INT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - NIGHT
text: Fox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of Koreatown,
dialog: the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the
text: S table tops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
text: The place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean
text: faces both dining and serving. It's the kind of place
dialog: where you can eat and not be bothered.
text: The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of
text: e I URE IN THE DOgJLWM is disturbing, a familiar
text: person in a long black coat...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Jesus.
text: She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as
text: all she can see is a silhouette...
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: For a second there I thought you looked
dialog: just like Cross.
text: Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table
text: as Fox lights up a cigarette.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Skipped the hospital?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: He picked me clean and I don't care much
dialog: for needles.
text: She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises
text: toward the ceiling.

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: You want something to eat, baby?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'm all right.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: They got some good shit. Ostrich,

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Listen, can I ask you a :question?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Baby, you can ask me anything you want.
text: He focuses on her eyes, zeroing in on the pupils.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Did you know Cross was my father?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Did you know?
text: Closer, closer... tight on those pupils...
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: O AW
dialog: What're you talking about Wesley? Cross
dialog: killed your father.
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE-UP:
text: We see her pupil swell, just a tiny bit.
scene_heading: KOREAN BAR-B-QUE:
dialog: He saw it... exactly what Sloan told him to look for when
text: someone is lying.
text: And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Goddammit, Wesley...
text: She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill
text: so that it SIZZLES.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Why'd you have to ask me that?
text: With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge
text: black Smith and Wesson revolver.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: $7.
text: Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by
text: kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils
text: flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets.
text: Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other
text: tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her
dialog: feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we
dialog: wouldn't know it.
text: Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots
text: at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding
text: the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no
text: bullets find their mark.
text: Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously
text: fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she
text: launches off one of the tables...
text: .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a
text: form tackle on to a table...
text: ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH...
text: and his guns go flying across the room as...
text: .the table to starts to burn through his clothes!
speaker_heading: %AW
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Arrrh!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You shoulda known better, baby...
text: But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven-
text: is burning into her back.
text: With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips
text: herself backwards off the table. With another kick, she
text: sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its
text: wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the
text: restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...
text: Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not
text: before it burns his arm as he blocks it.
text: Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a
text: hailstorm of bullets.
text: But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor
text: Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment
text: where his hands come u holSling his weapons.
text: In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM! BAM!
dialog: BAM! BAM! BAM!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: shoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists
text: so they arc over at the open gas nozzle!
text: The bullets strike it, sparking, and then BOOM!!!:
text: fireball b sts from nozzle, while a great Riume of
text: sweltering fire keeps pouring out!
text: Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the
text: opening he was looking for. He FIRES again, and one of
text: his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in
text: the side of the face.
text: She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off
text: her chin. This only seems to enrage her.
text: Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of
dialog: her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea --
text: and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull...
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SCREAMS)
dialog: Aaaaahhhh!
text: She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks
text: this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from
text: where he lies flat on the floor.
text: She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...
text: .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face
text: bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: I gotta admit, baby...
text: She starts to squeeze both the triggers...
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought we might have a future...
text: But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she
dialog: reels...
text: In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her
text: toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like
text: a quick-change artist.
text: Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the
dialog: last expression she'll ever have because...
dialog: BAM! BAM!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: Most of Fox's face is blown clean fr her head, and a

speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.)
dialog: 60 During his life, he was said to have
dialog: killed over four hundred bears and was
dialog: the pride of this small community on the
dialog: Rhine. You want to know how he died? A

dialog: woods.
scene_heading: INT. KOREAN BAR-B-QUE JOINT - LATER
text: The fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the

text: Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but
text: there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest.
text: The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he

dialog: bled to death.
text: Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees
text: beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the
text: blood on the handle.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That's a true story.
text: He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper:

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't know. There was so much he
dialog: wanted to keep away from us...
text: Wesley moves into Andrew's roan... where the boy is still
text: playing with the black model buildings.
text: Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Can I see that for a second?
text: The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is

text: floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know where he got this?
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Anna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's
dialog: basement.
text: Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been
text: made into a model map, similar to the one that the
text: Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings
text: are black, with an occasional red mark.
text: The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of
text: the city, and a BLUE LINE indicates a route through the
dialog: streets.
text: And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry
dialog: Helms.
text: Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his

text: studies the map some more.
speaker_heading: /'" ANNA

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: This is a Fraternity hit. Cross... my

dialog: out.
text: Wesley looks at it some more.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Only he didn't know where on the route

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It's me, Nicole.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: What happened to you?

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I asked you once if you thought I was an

dialog: She doesn't understand... but suddenly we...
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY
dialog: .that meeting room from his old job. In fact, it's a

text: Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the

scene_heading: INT. NICOLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: What name do you go by? The Intern?
text: He points at her tattoo.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Because I know you have the mark.
text: Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a
dialog: switch.
text: Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but

text: She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her

speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's the Henry Helms hit going down?

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yeah? Why's that?

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL SIDE DOOR - DAY

dialog: And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in

speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: She told me that, too.

text: The Butcher's eyes go wide...
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER
dialog: Like I told you... the blade will always
dialog: live on.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I remember some dumb shit like that
dialog: coming out of your mouth.
text: Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out
text: the kniZ2 in his shoulder.
text: They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging
text: off each other as each tries to gain an edge.
text: The fight spills out the front door, and into...

speaker_heading: THE STREET:
text: .the two men slashing, ducking, and moving in the
text: middle of the street. -
text: Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's
text: face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood.
text: The Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming
text: on to his hands. He tries to wipe the blood from his
text: eyes, but it's just getting worse.
speaker_heading: THE BUTCHER
dialog: I can't see!
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: But you can hear. So hear this: To cut
dialog: the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-
dialog: pick style...
text: Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
text: ...and thrust down behind the clavicle,
text: cutting side to side.
text: He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over
text: as his gore spills out into the street.
text: But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new
dialog: predicament...
text: He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end
text: is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make
text: things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is
text: the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.
speaker_heading: THE PHARMACIST
dialog: Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo.
dialog: And you're in a part of the map with no
text: Fraternity stashes.
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: That's what I'd call a real ball ache.
text: For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the
text: situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef
dialog: to the Pharmacist.
text: Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black.,
text: just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on
text: the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block
text: making up a decorative support column in front of it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: Wesley smiles.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'm working off of a different map.
text: With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and
text: he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a
text: Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire
text: relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,
dialog: smashing it to bits... as...
text: . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just
text: as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a
text: small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross
text: and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new
text: pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I
text: As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the
text: guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...
speaker_heading: SPLITSCREEN:
text: ...to follow both of his bullets in flight.
text: ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
text: .THE BULLET from the left gun heads for the Chef. He
text: tries to drop down, but the bullet curves downward, it
text: pierces his body... and...
scene_heading: INSIDE HIS BODY:
text: We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit
text: his side and head for the Pharmacist, while...
text: ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
text: ...the bullet from the right gun heads for the Gardener,
text: who moves fast to fire his own gun, but the bullet
text: catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of his
dialog: hand, and...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE WRIST:
text: . it hits the Gardener's scaphoid bone, ricocheting out,
dialog: also, right at the Pharmacist...
scene_heading: THE SCREEN RETURNS TO NORMAL:
text: .just as the two bullets come together...
speaker_heading: THE PHARMACIST
dialog: Bugger.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: hitting the Pharmacist on both sides of-his head,
text: before he can even react.
text: Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of
text: the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead.
text: But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener
text: and rolls him over.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: THE GARDENER
dialog: Where it started..
text: BAN! Wesley ends it for the Gardener.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
dialog: We've seen this place before. It's the same roof where

text: The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes
dialog: blazing.
text: Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away,
text: holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on
text: Wesley's head.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Can't say I don't have a sense of irony.
dialog: The place I first decided to bring you
dialog: in.
text: Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded
text: hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You once asked why I helped hide you as
dialog: an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'.
dialog: Power to become a head of the Fraternity.
dialog: Power over your father. And ultimately
dialog: it gave me you: the perfect weapon to
dialog: kill your father.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: But now you have to dispose of the
dialog: weapon.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: In some ways it pains me to do so. You
dialog: 460 are like the son I never had.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Sloan's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
dialog: Fine. Keep your worthless dignity.
dialog: You're still just the same loser we
text: plucked off the street six weeks ago.
text: Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs
text: derisively.
speaker_heading: SLOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is
dialog: everywhere. Even if you kill me others
dialog: will come from other cities to take my
dialog: place. You'll be hunted your whole life.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But that's not gonna happen. Like I told
dialog: you before, when we are called, death is
dialog: as certain as the sun.
text: Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men
text: face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge
text: city... an old newspaper even blows through like a
text: tumbleweed.
text: And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the
text: same shot from the opening of the movie.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and
dialog: pathetic.
text: We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his
text: bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: But not today.
text: With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun,
text: the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they
text: both open fire...
text: .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan
dialog: does the same. Just like he did with h' father.
text: .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's
text: mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took
dialog: the knife.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (CONT'D
dialog: Uhhh!
text: He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too
text: damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good
text: hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING!
text: Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts
text: sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets
dialog: out of the air...
text: He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet...
text: ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on
dialog: Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing?
text: But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of
text: Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his
dialog: feet!
text: They go flying right over the edge of the building.
text: Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop
dialog: himself...
dialog: ..but Sloan is going to go over.
text: At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something.
text: anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of
text: Wesley's gun...
text: For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious
text: position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't
dialog: believe he's been bested by this kid.
speaker_heading: SLOAN
speaker_heading: (SNARLS)
dialog: Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like
dialog: you did your old man.
text: Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then
text: he smiles...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: I'm done with this life. Just like my
dialog: father.
text: And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h
text: FROM TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW:
text: We watch Sloan's body fall through the sky...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
dialog: ..down, down, down...
text: .until it SMASHES into the sidewalk, splattering like a
text: grapefruit.
scene_heading: ON THE ROOFTOP:
text: Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the
text: darkening sky.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.O.)
dialog: It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary
dialog: and-pathetic. Just like you.
text: He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: The place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead

dialog: I've learned about the man who made me.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY
text: Cope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley,
dialog: asking pedestrians if they've seen this man.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. POST OFFICE - DAY
text: Patrons stand in line at a post office, but the'CAMERA
text: PUSHES PAST THEM, finding a black and white "WANTED"
dialog: poster of Wesley, describing all the killings he's
text: responsible for. It holds tight on the picture.
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.)
dialog: I've learned that all of us are unique,
dialog: even though sometimes we're too fucking
text: blind to see it.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: The door to the safehouse opens, and Anna, Wesley and
text: Andrew step out into the bright sunlight. Wesley is

dialog: 109.
text: They turn and head up the street, toward the eastern sun.
text: The CAMERA RISES UP, UP, UP, where it hovers for a
dialog: minute... and just when we think it is going to leave the
dialog: planet...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And I learned, the easiest place to hide
text: is in plain sight.

scene_heading: INT. TYPICAL INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY
text: ..Wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another

text: attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE
dialog: ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl"
text: Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties,
dialog: wishing they were anywhere else.
text: A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You're the new guy, huh?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Just started last week.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Where'd you move here from?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: All over the place, really. Nothing too
dialog: exciting.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Well, welcome to the team. Just watch
dialog: out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the
dialog: back first chance he gets.
text: Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.
speaker_heading: BROKAW
dialog: Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes
dialog: to get to?
text: The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.
speaker_heading: BROKAW (CONT'D)
dialog: Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun
dialog: bags, I'll give her that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
text: He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space.
speaker_heading: BROKAW (CONT ' D )
dialog: Jim, right?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: BROKAW
dialog: Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started
dialog: off on the wrong foot here, but we.have
dialog: numbers to make and if we don't make
dialog: those numbers, it's my ass on the line.
dialog: And if my ass gets chewed out by
dialog: regional, I can guarantee.that your ass
dialog: is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm
dialog: not sure how they ran things...
text: Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and--
text: further, until the words become gibberish, just like they
dialog: did with Janice.
text: Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time
dialog: to hear...
speaker_heading: BROKAW (CONT'D)
dialog: .so do we understand each other?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BROKAW
dialog: Good boy.
text: With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up
text: his ass that they look like they may burst at any second.
text: Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads
text: 11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the
text: receptionist's desk. She looks up, bites her lower
dialog: lip...
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You want to take a break with me?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Sure!
text: She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting
dialog: for the doors to open.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, we don't usually get breaks.

dialog: 
text: Just then, the elevator doors DING.
speaker_heading: WESLEY

text: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.O.)
dialog: This life is ours, to make of it what we
dialog: can.
text: .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot
text: of Wesley we started with. And then a sly smile spreads
text: across his mug...
speaker_heading: WESLEY (V.0.)
dialog: I think I'll give it a shot.
text: .and as the doors close, we officially...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
