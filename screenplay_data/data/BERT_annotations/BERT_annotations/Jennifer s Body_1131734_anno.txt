text: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in
text: pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted
text: expression. As she stares out the window, she winds
text: colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
dialog: "god's eye."
dialog: 
text: Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot
scene_heading: SECURITY FENCE.
dialog: 
text: Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
text: casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even
text: creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: Every day, I get letters. I think
dialog: I get more letters than Santa

text: series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: Sometimes the letters are from
dialog: people who say they're praying for
dialog: me. They tell me everything will
dialog: be okay if I just accept Jesus
dialog: Christ into my heart. I say the
dialog: words, but nothing ever happens.
dialog: Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off

dialog: 
text: We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in

dialog: 
text: The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A

speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: Personally, I think they're trying

text: The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by

text: Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone

dialog: 
text: It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - SAME
text: Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her
text: face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her,
text: leaving only a shaft of light.
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: I wasn't always this cracked. I
dialog: used to be normal-- well, as
dialog: normal as any girl under the
dialog: influence of teenage hormones. But
dialog: after the killings began, I
dialog: started to feel, I don't know...
text: loose around the edges or
dialog: something. I was coming undone
dialog: like those jeans I made in Home
text: Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy
text: Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.
text: Dead inside.
text: Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
text: in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life,
text: half eaten. Grimaces of terror.
text: Suddenly, soft music is piped into "the hole," ostensibly
text: to calm the patients in solitary. Needy shudders and

scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAME
text: JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches

text: Then, the sound of cracking near the window.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Huh?

text: Needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on
dialog: different configurations of clothing.
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: "Wear something cool" meant
dialog: something very specific in
dialog: Jennifer-speak. It meant I
dialog: couldn't look like a nerd, but I
dialog: couldn't upstage her either. I
dialog: could expose my stomach, but never
dialog: cleavage. Tits were her trademark.
dialog: 
text: Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her

dialog: bed.
text: CHIP DOVE is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that
text: pink. He raises an eyebrow at Needy's abdomen.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: Those jeans are hella low. I can

speaker_heading: NEEDY

speaker_heading: NEEDY

speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: Thanks a lot!
speaker_heading: NEEDY
dialog: No offense. I mean, she'd probably

speaker_heading: CHIP

speaker_heading: NEEDY

speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: Forget it. He's seminal, but
dialog: whatever...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY
dialog: Anyway, this singer guy is like

speaker_heading: CHIP

dialog: You live in the city, right?
speaker_heading: NIKOLAI

text: CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,

dialog:

text: zombie's. She looks HORRIFYING, especially with that
text: ghastly, clownish grin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY
dialog: Um, Jennifer?

speaker_heading: NEEDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?

speaker_heading: NEEDY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TREMBLING)
dialog: J-Jen?
dialog: 
text: Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM, wailing at
text: the top of her lungs. She vomits a torrent of evil-
text: looking black bile all over herself and Needy and
text: staggers wildly down the hallway.
dialog: 
text: The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed
text: school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in
text: horror as it slides down the wall.
text: The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it,
text: like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by
text: itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the
dialog: corners. It's truly revolting.
text: Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
dialog: mouth.
text: Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to
text: jagged, insane laughter.
text: Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
text: against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her.
text: Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against
text: Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle.
text: Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses
text: her lips against Needy's carotid artery.

scene_heading: EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in
text: the shrubbery. She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and
text: a hungry expression.
text: Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
text: and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her
dialog: yard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: What nobody realized was that I
dialog: was doing a different kind of
dialog: homework. I was watching her every
text: night. Waiting.
text: We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
text: hair with a appraising eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
text: Waiting for her to get weak and
text: dull. Waiting for her to burn
dialog: through the life-force she'd
dialog: stolen from Chip.
dialog: 
text: Needy creeps away from the window.
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: It took weeks, but I finally made
dialog: my move. Remember?

scene_heading: EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We're seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered
dialog: Jennifer.
text: Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing.
text: The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of
dialog: the police.
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
text: Even in her last moments of life,
dialog: she somehow managed to be cooler
dialog: than me.
dialog: 
text: We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile
text: as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. That
text: signature look of mastery and control.

speaker_heading: NEEDY
text: She left an insanely hot corpse.
dialog: 
text: We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming,
text: though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC. Sure enough,
text: Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually
text: draped in her mother's arms. She almost seems to be
text: SMIRKING at us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT
text: We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been
text: narrating the whole sordid tale. She hasn't moved a
text: muscle since beginning her story. Only a single shaft of
text: moonlight illuminates the room.
dialog: 
text: An orderly shoves DINNER through a slot in the door. It's
text: a pile of mystery meat. Needy wrinkes her nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O.
dialog: I don't even know who Needy
dialog: Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a
dialog: different person now. A person who
dialog: uses curse words and kicks
dialog: orderlies and and sees things that
dialog: aren't there. A very bad, very
dialog: damaged person.
dialog: 
text: Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline
dialog: of her shirt...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: But sometimes, change can be good.
dialog: For instance, most occult scholars
dialog: don't know this, but if you're
dialog: bitten by a demon--and you live--
dialog: you just might absorb some of the
dialog: demon's abilities.
text: In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected-
text: looking BITEMARK near her shoulder. She scratches it,
text: wincing.
speaker_heading: NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: You just might get lucky for once
dialog: in your miserable life.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK to reveal that Needy, still cross-legged is
text: HOVERING five feet off the floor. Effortlessly.
text: With visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a
text: narrow WINDOW positioned up near the ceiling. To anyone
dialog: with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: EXT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL - FIVE MINUTES LATER
text: Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers.
text: She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and
text: passes through it after casually mangling the bars. Only
text: a Needy-shaped hole remains.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - TEN MINUTES LATER
text: Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road.
text: The hospital recedes in the background.
text: A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching
text: Needy as she walks past.
dialog: 
text: A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down.
text: "Through the Trees" blasts from the radio.
text: Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEEDY
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: "Through the trees, I will find
dialog: you. Heal the ruins left inside
dialog: you..."

scene_heading: EXT. MURPHY POOL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool,
text: crying. It's a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip. Their faces
text: are weary and sorrowful. Photos of Chip have been
text: arranged around the edge of the fence. We see a picture
text: of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end.
text: Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing
text: along, their voices soaring.

dialog: "...We'll meet again."
text: A small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the
text: road. Needy seems something glinting at the mouth of the
text: creek and stoops to pick it up. It's Nikolai's BOWIE
text: KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's Kettle, never to be
dialog: seen again.
text: Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.
text: A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks
text: her thumb out again.
text: The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
text: a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes
text: Needy lasciviously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Where you looking to go, young
dialog: lady?
speaker_heading: NEEDY
text: East, toward Madison.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: East, huh? Guess I'm headed that
dialog: way. But I'm gonna need you to pay
dialog: me in ass, gas or grass. Got that?
dialog: No free rides in this wagon.
speaker_heading: NEEDY
dialog: I don't have any money or drugs,
dialog: so you'll have to settle for ass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.
text: Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: So why you headed East?
speaker_heading: NEEDY
dialog: I'm following this rock band.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Huh. Must be a hell of a group.
speaker_heading: NEEDY

text: Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into

text: The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the
text: distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT
scene_heading: SHOULDER.
dialog: 
text: We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's
dialog: bumper.
speaker_heading: RADIO DJ
dialog: What a song. Thought we'd play
dialog: that one in honor of Soft
dialog: Shoulder. They're playing in
dialog: Madison tonight. Should be a night
dialog: to remember...
