dialog: Trees.
text: A gentle warm light shines on the face of a 40 year-old
text: looking man, as he walks in what seems to be a grove.
text: His name is SAUL AUSLANDER. He wears a white shirt_under his
text: dark jacket, with a half-hidden number on it: B-7005._On the
text: back of his jacket, a red X is painted. He wears a flat
text: civilian hat. He walks with determination, at a regular pace,
text: his lips tight. The trees around give some shelter from the
text: sun, birds sing amidst the branches.
text: He stops for a while and glances around, at_some older people
text: around taking off their heavy winter coats, sitting on the
text: grass. The voices of children, calling for water, can be
text: heard._A YOUNG BOY stands on the side, carrying a water can.
dialog: 
text: Sounds of branch cracking, of steps on the ground. Footsteps
text: of many more people. Pieces of words can be heard, in a
text: continuous humming of different voices and languages.
text: Behind Saul, children play. Someone comes to him and talks to
text: him, he mumbles something, looks away and moves on.
text: Four other SONDERKOMMANDO PRISONERS pass Saul by. They all
text: start instructing the civilians to get up and leave. The
text: civilians are gathered in rows of 5, and pushed to the road.
dialog: 
text: Three SOLDIERS appear on the side, waiting.
text: Orders are shouted and the group starts advancing on the
text: slight slope of a dusty road.
text: The Sonderkommando prisoners accompany the civilians who
text: carry suitcases, bundles, cans and other objects. Some people
text: carry infants. We only catch glimpses of some of the faces
text: and clothes. These are weary, slightly disorientated faces,
text: most of them in dark-colored heavy clothes.
text: On Saul’s right, a large GROUP OF PEOPLE walks as well,
dialog: quietly.
text: Saul looks in the direction of the people beside him, as if
text: to check. His pace slows down, other people catch up with
text: him. Some of them stare at him. Saul doesn’t engage with
dialog: them.
text: The group comes to a halt. Saul faces them, but keeps on
text: walking quietly. Further down some of the people have taken
text: off their heavy winter coats and sit on the grass.

text: Saul advances in the midst of a CROWD of agitated people, and

text: The road turns to an open range where isolated PEOPLE in gray
text: and green clothes point in one direction, at the chaos of
text: whirling humans in heavy, dark clothes and carrying suitcases
dialog: or bundles.
text: Orders are shouted and repeated, first in German, followed by
dialog: other languages.
text: In the background, civilians get off from wagons of a
text: merchandise train. Smoke rises from afar. Heaps of personal
text: belongings pile up next to the train. OLD and CROOKED PEOPLE
text: are put onto one TRUCK. The truck departs and draws nearer.

dialog: Saul goes on. +
text: Saul walks faster, advancing in the large crowd.
text: Near the crowd, OLD PEOPLE disembark from a military truck. +
text: He passes a group of people undressing.
text: Saul walks down a few steps that lead to a large underground
dialog: hall.
scene_heading: IN THE UNDERGROUND HALL (UNDRESSING HALL)
text: A feeble artificial light replaces the sunlight that fades
text: away. People from behind enter the hall.
text: In a distance, the voice of an SS MAN catches the attention
text: of the people around Saul - a long, quietly uttered monologue
text: in German. Saul remains on the side of the underground, he
text: watches the people. His face barely reflects any expression
text: but tiredness.
text: The voice stops talking. The people next to Saul start doing
text: something. Next to Saul, a MAN puts two fingers on the
text: highest button of his messy shirt and hesitates. Saul looks
text: at the man, who finally undoes his shirt. Saul leans and
text: picks up the man’s clothes on the ground. He gathers more of
text: the clothes lying on the ground and puts them on the side.
dialog: Shooting Draft April 25, 2014
text: A MAN in a jacket with a painted red X over it is helping an
text: ELDERLY WOMAN to remove pins from a shawl. Next to them,
text: other people go on undressing. Naked women pass him by and
text: pudently hide in a corner.
dialog: Reassuring voices speaking in different languages can be
text: heard, but only fragments make their way to him: “hot meal”
dialog: and “hurry up”.

dialog: (in Hungarian)
dialog: You have to remember the number.
text: Saul goes to a corner in the corridor and stands still. He is
text: soon joined by other MEN IN WHITE SHIRTS. They don’t talk.
text: Next to him, naked people walk further down. Saul’s face is
text: blank as we catch a glimpse at the huge crowd passing him
text: by. Voices rise, questions, in various languages, then fade
dialog: away.
text: The last naked people, agitated, are being pushed into the
text: other hall by men in uniform.
text: The sound of a heavy door closing.
text: The men in uniform leave.
text: Saul and the other men in white shirts collect the clothes
text: hanging on the racks and throw them on the ground. Cries
text: surround them.
text: A bald MAN comes near Saul still taking the clothes out of
text: the racks. The bald man speaks in a low voice to the man next
text: to Saul, a strong man in his thirties, LANDESMAN. The bald

text: A low, long noise of a_hea industrial fan, before stopping
text: with reverberation.
text: Saul is hosing the ground mechanically, slowly, directing the
text: hose here and there, his face focused.
text: In the BACKGROUND, human FIGURES come and go rapidly. Some
text: draw nearer Saul, and start pulling backward, and then OFF
text: SCREEN, heavy loads.
text: TWO MEN around Saul seem to struggle with something below.
text: Saul turns off the hose and leans toward the ground. He helps
dialog: the men.
text: The men carry away their load.
text: The figures around Saul move increasingly fast, quietly, as
text: if commanded by invisible fear and discipline.
text: A low whimper can be heard from underneath.
text: Saul tries to look for the source of the whimper.
text: He freezes.
text: A light-haired man comes near him. He is 30 but looks 50, his
text: name is HIRSCH. He wears the same clothes as Saul. His deeply
text: set eyes look down with worry at the source of the whimper.
text: Hirsch waves at someone OFF SCREEN.
text: Another prisoner, who seems to have more authority, draws
text: closer. He is a short but strong young man in his late
text: twenties, and a foreman in the Kommando. He is called
text: FEIGENBAUM. He looks towards the source of the whimper and
text: hurries away.
dialog: 
text: Saul watches as Hirsch lifts up the bruised corpse of an
text: ADOLESCENT BOY with dark-brown hair. Hirsch carries it to one
text: corner of the tunnel and puts it onto a bench that another
text: MAN has grabbed from the undressing room.
text: Saul follows Hirsch with his eyes.
text: Behind the scene, dozens of PRISONERS rapidly carry out their
text: routine, regardless of the agonising boy. Some are pouring
text: water. Some others take heavy loads to a freight-elevator. A
text: WELL DRESSED MAN walks around, stops now and then, writing
text: down information, assisted by a prisoner. A few SS GUARDS, _
text: dressed in green and gray, armed, watch over the scene.
text: Behind them, Feigenbaum comes back with a short man in a
text: white gown, a Jewish doctor called MIKLOS. From closer, his
text: gown looks less maculate: it is full of stains and dirt._
dialog: Shooting Draft April 25, 2014
dialog: +
text: He walks towards the bench, Saul walks closer to them. On the
text: bench lays a boy, around twelve years old. Miklés looks at +
text: the boy with weary eyes.
dialog: +
dialog: 
text: He hardly has the time to put a hand on the boy’s body that +
text: from behind, a tall SS DOCTOR arrives, a white medical gown
text: over his SS uniform. Miklos steps aside. He talks quietly in +

speaker_heading: MIKLOS
dialog: (in German)
text: Still breathes.
text: The SS Doctor takes a stethoscope out of his pocket and
text: coldly examines the boy. He invites the Jewish doctor to

text: The members of the Sonderkommando working behind have
text: somewhat slowed down their pace, some seem to glance
text: furtively at the scene.
text: The SS doctor puts his gloved hand on the boy’s mouth. Miklos
text: looks up at the SS doctor. The hand moves to recover the nose
dialog: as well.
text: The whimper stops.
text: The SS doctor whispers in Miklos’s ear.
text: Orders are shouted behind to accelerate the processes.

dialog: (in German, to Hirsch)
dialog: Back to work, fast!
text: He lifts up his stick, but Hirsch already hurries back to the
text: gas chamber. The guard then turns to Saul, who gets back to
dialog: work.
text: The SS doctor takes off his glove and puts it into his
text: pocket. He looks around, vaguely observing the members of the
text: Sonderkommando who accelerate their work. Lost in his
text: thoughts, as if he had already forgotten the incident, he
dialog: 
dialog: goes away. +
text: Saul looks back at the scene, and draws towards the bench. +
text: His eyes are focused on the body. +
