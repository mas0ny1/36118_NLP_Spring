speaker_heading: WIND RIVER
dialog: Written by
dialog: Taylor Sheridan
speaker_heading: OPEN ON:
text: SNOW COVERS AN ENDLESS PLAIN ON A MOONLESS NIGHT.
text: Clumps of sagebrush, huddled together like angry gnomes, are
text: the only evidence of life in this place.
text: There is no movement.
dialog: No sound.
dialog: Until ...
text: The sound of FEET CRUSHING SNOW. Moving toward us. Fast.
text: A GIRL RUNS PAST US -- SCREAMING.
text: She's in her late teens, wearing a baby blue, down-filled
text: coat. White sweat pants. She runs as though her life depends
dialog: on it ... Which it does.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: There is a meadow in my perfect
dialog: world. Where wind dances the
text: branches of a tree, casting leopard
text: spots of light across the face of a
dialog: pond ...
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: BARE FEET slamming frozen earth. Blood staining the snow with
dialog: every step.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.)
text: The tree stands tall and grand and
text: alone, shading the world beneath
dialog: it.
text: WE RUN BESIDE HER.
text: We take in her pretty face as she sobs, heaves in air,
text: stumbles, and falls out of frame.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: There will come a day when I rest
text: against its spine and look out over
text: a valley where the sun warms, but
dialog: never burns ...
text: She rises, blood drips into her eye from an unseen wound.
text: Takes off again and somehow runs faster -- screams whipping
text: behind her like a cape.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I will watch leaves turn. Green,
text: then amber, then crimson. Then no
dialog: leaves at all ...
text: The faster she runs, the farther the horizon moves from her.
text: As if the earth is tilting to prevent this girl from reaching
dialog: her destination.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: But the tree will not die. For in
dialog: this place, winter never comes ...
dialog: It is here, in the cradle of all I
dialog: hold dear, I guard every memory of
dialog: you.
text: She finds her stride. Crying less. Running harder. Gaining
text: momentum. Pulling away from us. Getting down to the business
dialog: of surviving.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: And when I find myself frozen in
dialog: the mud of the real -- far from
dialog: your loving eyes, I will return to
dialog: this place, close mine, and take
text: solace in the simple perfection of
dialog: knowing you.
text: WE WATCH FROM A DISTANCE: Her white pants match the snow, her
text: black hair matches the night -- all we can see is a baby-blue
text: coat that floats above the plains like a wayward balloon,
text: bouncing above a white desert.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 789 -- CENTRAL WYOMING -- DAWN.
text: Yellow lines whip beneath us. The faded blacktop is a gray
text: blur as we chew road.
text: To our left is an ocean of sage brush and dirty snow,
text: sprawled out before the towering WIND RIVER MOUNTAIN RANGE.
text: A PICK UP TRUCK makes its way down a deserted highway. On the
text: door is an OFFICIAL SEAL and the letters U.S.F.W.S.:
text: THE UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.
scene_heading: INT. PICK UP TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS.
text: A MAN grips the steering wheel. Sips coffee from a travel
text: mug. He’s around 40. Sunken cheeks. Mustache.
text: Cowboy hat on his head. Almost white when it was new --
text: sweat, dirt, and who knows what else, have stained the hat
text: brown and robbed it of its shape.
text: A fair description of the man as well.
text: Through the windshield we see a dirt road that meets the
text: black top. The truck slows, turns onto it.
scene_heading: EXT. SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY.
text: FIVE HUNDRED SHEEP wander through snow in a futile search for
dialog: something to eat.
text: In the distance, we see: TWO COYOTES. They duck behind the
text: sagebrush, then reappear seventy-five yards closer, only to
dialog: disappear again.
text: Farther to the flock’s left, THREE MORE COYOTES approach at a
text: trot. They see no need for stealth -- these sheep have
dialog: nowhere to go ...
text: The sheep spot the killers approaching and huddle into a
text: tight circle -- with the rams forming an outer layer of
dialog: protection.
dialog: If coyotes could laugh, they would laugh at this.
text: The two wary coyotes; however, make no attempt to approach.
text: They raise their noses to the air -- sucking in the wind’s
text: secrets. And just like that, they disappear.
text: The other three move eagerly toward their lunch.
text: THUNDER SHAKES THE VERY EARTH.
text: One of the coyotes is blown backwards, cart-wheeling through
dialog: the snow.
text: The other two stop.
text: MORE THUNDER. A second coyote is driven into the ground like
text: he’s been hit with a giant hammer.
text: The last coyote turns and runs for the safety of anywhere but
dialog: here.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL --
text: The man, dressed completely in white, lays prone -- invisible
text: in the snow. A rifle pressed to his shoulder. He works the
text: bolt -- chambers another round.
text: WE SEE THE LAST COYOTE THROUGH A RIFLE SCOPE.
text: The cross-hairs find the back of the coyote’s head bouncing
text: in and out of view. The scope begins to move with it. The
text: rifle invades the silence again. When the muzzle flash
text: disappears, we see the coyote splayed out in the snow.
text: In the distance, the two coyotes wise enough to never trust
text: the scent of man crest a far rise, and drop out of view.
text: The sheep shriek in terror as they run around in a giant,
text: panicked, pointless circle.
text: The man rises and walks toward the carnage he inflicted.
text: The flock runs right toward the man, who doesn’t stop.
text: Doesn’t even look in their direction.
text: The flock almost runs into him before dividing and passing
text: him on either side. They rejoin, and continue their silly
dialog: circle -- all instinct for survival bred out of them.
scene_heading: EXT. SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY.
text: The man looks at the dead coyotes with no emotion. He removes
text: a rope from a backpack. Begins looping the rope around the
text: back feet of a coyote, then moves to another and does the
dialog: same.
text: All three are now tethered together and he begins the chore
text: of dragging them through the snow and red dirt.
text: He drags them past the flock, which stands idly by, panting
text: like tired dogs.
text: His dark eyes hold no joy. No sorrow either. This is not
dialog: sport. This is his job. This is CORY LAMBERT.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PICK UP TRUCK -- DAY.
text: Cory warms his free hand against the truck’s vent. Grabs his
text: coffee. Takes a sip. The coffee’s cold. Doesn’t matter -- not
text: his first cold cup of coffee. He stares at the road. If the
dialog: truck had a radio that worked, he’d turn it on.
scene_heading: EXT. BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT FIELD OFFICE -- DAY.
text: BLM OFFICER TIM WINTER, late 30's, big coat, bigger cowboy
text: hat, stands beside USFWS ENFORCEMENT AGENT DALE BERTRAM,
text: early 30's. They stare at the coyotes in the bed of Corey's
dialog: truck.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Did you see Wyman’s sheep dogs near
dialog: the flock?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Told me he had six dogs watching
text: over it.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: He don’t have six dogs anymore.
dialog: Those coyotes moved on that flock
dialog: like they’ve been doing it all
dialog: month.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Buggers are bad this year. We'll be
dialog: lucky if there’s a flock of sheep
dialog: standing come April.
text: Tim looks to the STORM CLOUDS that loom over the WIND RIVER
text: MOUNTAIN RANGE like a reckoning.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)
dialog: After this storm, I want you up in
dialog: a chopper. Those mutt’s will be
dialog: easy to spot with a coat of fresh
dialog: snow. When can your boy fly, Dale?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: We'll see what kind of wind follows
text: the storm. Maybe Wednesday.
text: He looks at Cory.
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: I got a call from BIA Police, the
dialog: chief was asking for you. A
text: mountain lion’s working through the
text: flocks east of Boulder Flats.
text: Tim can’t help but laugh.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You’d think folks would learn this
dialog: isn’t sheep country.
text: They all laugh at that.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Tore up a horse and some weanlings
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That sounds like wolves.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Chief says it’s a cat, and they
dialog: ain't had no luck getting it. I
dialog: offered Kenny and his hounds, but
dialog: they don’t want a white man running
text: around on the rez with a firearm.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: They don’t want a white man out
dialog: there period. I’1l call him.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I forget you’re part Indian.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Well ... I’m Indian enough to do
dialog: favors, but not enough to pull a
dialog: check.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Be careful out there. Half those
text: boys are tweaked out of their
dialog: minds.
text: Cory doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Shit, that junk’s everywhere now.
dialog: I’m scared to let my daughter leave
dialog: the house.
text: As soon as Tim says it, he wishes he could have it back.
text: Everyone looks to the ground. To the mountains. To the storm
text: hovering. Anywhere but Cory, who stares at the coyotes’
text: corpses in the bed of his truck. Lifeless eyes stare back.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Okay. Drop those off at Fish and
dialog: Game.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yep.
text: He climbs in his truck and starts it in one fluid motion. He
text: pulls toward the road as the coming storm inches closer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- LANDER, WYOMING -- DAY.
text: Cory drives through the town of Lander. Feed stores, fast
text: food, and a Wall Mart pass by his window. He turns on a side
text: street and pulls up to a small house. Parks. Gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. WILMA LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
text: Cory walks up the driveway past a faded, Silver Subaru.
text: Reaches the door. Rings the bell.
text: The door opens and WILMA LAMBERT, 38, full blood Shoshoni,
text: gives Cory a terse smile.
dialog: She was a beauty two kids and many heartaches ago, but bad
text: food and cigarettes are winning the war against her looks.
text: Still, effort went into her hair, and make-up was delicately
dialog: applied.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: You got blood on your shirt.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I was at work.
text: She nods, but doesn’t approve.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Who was the victim today?
text: Cory knows her well enough to sense her moods, and apparently
dialog: she’s in one right now.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Looks like it’s gonna be me.
text: She stares at him. Her face goes from anger to pity to tired
text: in an instant. She waves him in.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Want some coffee?
dialog: He doesn’t, but:
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Sure. Thank you.
text: He steps in, removing his hat.
scene_heading: INT. WILMA LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
dialog: It is exactly what you would expect from a prefab home owned
text: by a woman with good taste and no money. The place is
text: spotless. Mismatched Lazy Boys and outdated furniture are
dialog: thoughtfully arranged.
text: Wilma disappears into the kitchen, leaving Cory alone in the
dialog: living room.
text: He stares at the ground. Fumbles with his hat. Looks at the
text: ceiling fan. ... Gives up and turns his gaze toward the
dialog: fireplace.
text: Above the mantle is a 16x24, FRAMED YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPH of a
text: TEENAGE GIRL. She wears a basketball uniform. Black hair
text: neatly braided into long pig-tails. Big smile. Bright eyes.
text: His eyes.
text: Sage bundles, Sweetgrass braids, and an eagle feather are
text: arranged around it. It is a shrine.
text: Wilma returns. Hands him a mug. He nods his appreciation.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I gotta go to the Rez tomorrow,
dialog: thought I’d take Casey by your
dialog: folks.
text: She winces at the word ‘Rez’, then nods at the word ‘folks’.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Something killed a yearling in the
text: pasture behind their house.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That's why I’m going.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Probably one of those Littlefeather
dialog: demons. They stole two of Daddy’s
dialog: calves last spring.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Mountain lion, wolf, or demon
dialog: child, they want me to find it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Don’t let Casey out of your sight
dialog: on the Rez, okay?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I was gonna leave him with your
dialog: folks while I scouted. Too cold to
text: drag him through the snow.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: You know what I mean.
text: Cory seems to make eye contact with her for the first time.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yeah, I do. And I won't.
dialog: Beat.
text: Cory sips his coffee. Then yells down the hall.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CASEY!
speaker_heading: CASEY
text: DAD??! OKAY! I’M COMING.
text: Appearing in the hall and bumbling toward Cory is CASEY
text: LAMBERT, 8 years old. Olive skin and short, black hair
text: covered by a weathered cowboy hat very similar to Cory’s.
text: Though the skin and hair are darker, this is clearly Cory’s
dialog: son.
text: The boy labors toward his dad with suitcase, sleeping bag,
text: coat, and BB gun in a noisy, clumsy, ball of energy.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What did I tell you about pointing
dialog: that BB gun at people?
text: Casey freezes. Drops everything but the gun.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Sorry dad.
dialog: iu.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Being careless won’t get you
dialog: anywhere faster.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: CORY
text: Put the BB gun in the truck then
dialog: come back for the rest.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Yes sir.
text: He begins running for the door.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Don’t run with it.
text: Slows to an urgent walk. Pushes through the screen door.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: I’1ll be back Monday afternoon.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Watch yourself on the road.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: He doesn’t need to be missing
dialog: school to go chasing coyotes with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: We'll get all the chase out of our
dialog: system tomorrow ... You be careful.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: This won’t be my first snow storm
text: in a car.
dialog: Beat.
text: Cory walks over to Casey’s things.
speaker_heading: WILMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let him. Needs to learn to do
dialog: things for himself.
text: Cory grabs his things anyway.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I agree, but I’ve stood here as
dialog: long as I care to. Hope the
dialog: interview goes well in Jackson.
dialog: di.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Yep. We’ll see.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: If anyone was born to make a living
text: talking on the phone ...
text: She takes the jab as one of affection, which it was.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s a good school over there. Good
dialog: town.
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: If I get the job, we’re gonna have
dialog: to talk about his child support --
dialog: Jackson’s a lot more expensive.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Get the job. We’ll get the rest
dialog: figured. You got my word.
dialog: Whatever happened to these two, they are unified in their
dialog: desire to find a better life for their son.
text: He pushes the screen door open. Looks back at her.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Take Togwotee Pass. Don’t go
text: through Pinedale. Storm’s coming
dialog: from the south.
text: Wilma’s eyes go dark.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: You couldn’t drag me through
dialog: Pinedale with a rope. I’1l never
text: set foot in that town again.
text: He nods without agreeing, then pushes through the door.
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- DAY.
text: Casey looks at his father, then at the coming storm.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: She’s gonna be a bad one.
text: Cory hides a smile at Casey’s attempt to speak like a man.
text: Looks at his son -- a miniature, if darker, version of him.
text: Looks at his hat -- beaten and filthy, just like his.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You just got that at Christmas.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It’s taken a beating, just like a
dialog: hat should.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Doing what? You've only had the
dialog: thing two months.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I’m in the 4-H barn three times a
dialog: week.
text: Cory draws in a breath to reprimand. Looks at his boy -- so
text: desperate to please -- and swallows it. Gives wisdom instead.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Life dirties things plenty fast on
dialog: its own, don’t need any help from
dialog: you.
text: Casey stares at the floorboard. Gives a submissive nod as the
text: excitement of a weekend with dad drains from him. He looks
text: out the window as the outskirts of town fade into frozen
dialog: fields.
text: Cory regrets saying anything at all.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey.
text: Casey looks up.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: When we get home, I’1l help you
dialog: dust that hat up the right way.
dialog: Okay?
text: The tiniest of smiles crosses Casey’s face.
text: Through the windshield we see storm clouds, black as the
text: coming night, push against the mountains that contain them.
scene_heading: EXT. CORY LAMBERT’S PLACE -- DUSK.
text: Beside a small house is a corral. Four horses huddle
text: together, asses to the wind, wishing like hell it was spring.
text: Cory and Casey emerge from an old barn carrying hay. Cory
text: flips a latch and swings the gate open, snapping the horses
text: from their stupor.
dialog: is.
text: The horses head straight for Casey -- RIPPING HAY FROM HIS
speaker_heading: BUNDLE.
text: Cory tosses his hay bale in a trough, then turns back to
dialog: Casey.
speaker_heading: CORY
text: Push their nose when they rub up on
dialog: you like that.
text: Casey pushes one horse as another reaches over his head and
text: grabs more hay, whipping Casey in the face when it does,
text: knocking him down.
text: Cory steps up and all the horses hurry toward the trough,
text: like a high school fight breaking up when the principal
text: arrives.
text: Cory looks at his son, who has no hay left to hold. He sits
text: on the ground -- face, coat, and hat covered in shredded
text: alfalfa and horse slobber.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Told’'ya I'd get that hat dirty.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: They got the height advantage on me
dialog: is the deal.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: We can fix that.
text: Cory smiles. Most kids would’ve been terrified, but Casey
dialog: stood his ground.
text: Cory walks up behind Casey, lifts him and sets him on a liver-
text: colored mare that is far too busy eating to care about the
text: boy now on her back.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember what I showed you?
speaker_heading: CASEY
text: But she’s eating.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You want that horse to be yours
dialog: some day, prove it. Not to me, to
dialog: her.
text: Casey lets out a breath. Grabs a handful of mane, and pulls
text: back slightly. The mare raises her head, but doesn’t move.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Put those boots into the front of
text: her chest.
text: He kicks into her. She bolts up. Casey grabs on tight.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: I didn’t say kick. Ask her before
dialog: you tell her. Just press your boots
text: into her chest. Gentle.
text: He does, and the mare backs up.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
text: Ease up on the mane, and give her a
text: little nudge in the ribs.
text: He does. The mare obeys, and moves forward.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wherever you look is where she
dialog: goes. Take her to the gate.
text: Casey stares at the gate with the focus of a surgeon.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get alongside and open it.
text: Casey sends cues through his feet and negotiates the mare
text: parallel to the fence. He reaches down to the latch.
text: Casey wrestles with the latch his father flipped without
text: effort. He struggles.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Freezes up quick, don’t it ... Give
dialog: it a good hit.
text: Casey curls his fist and pounds the lever. The gate swings
text: open. Cory pulls Casey off and sets him on the ground, facing
dialog: the mare.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let her know you.
text: Casey stands in front of her. The mare inches closer,
text: pressing her nostril to Casey’s nose, inhaling his exhaled
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
text: Put a hand to her face. Gentle,
text: like a friend.
dialog: io.
text: He does. Then looks back at his father, all smiles once
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That was pretty cowboy, huh.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: No, son. That was Arapahoe.
text: Cory closes the gate and they walk to the little house as the
text: mare hangs her head over the fence, watching the boy --
dialog: forgetting the meal so important a moment ago.
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S HOUSE -- NIGHT.
text: Cory and Casey sit on the couch. Casey eats a sandwich and
text: stares at the TV. Cory looks over A TOPO MAP as he speaks on
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yeah. I’m looking at it. There’s
dialog: drill rigs over there, lions don’t
dialog: like the noise ... You sure it’s
dialog: something and not somebody? ...
dialog: Alright, I’11 check it out in the
dialog: morning. If you got lions, I’m
dialog: gonna have to bring Kenny’s hounds
dialog: in to run ‘em ... Name a Indian
dialog: with lion hounds and I’1l use him.
dialog: Call you if I find anything.
text: Cory hangs up. Looks at his son, lost in the television.
text: Little mouth chewing little bites, stopping for a little sip
dialog: of soda.
text: Cory watches him. Smiles. Sits back quietly. The smile
text: disappears. Worry replaces it.
text: Above the fireplace is the same photograph of a teenage girl
text: dressed to shoot hoops, though much smaller. Cory stares at
text: the photo, then back to his son -- who is staring right at
dialog: him.
text: Casey smiles, then returns to the TV.
text: Cory rubs his eyes. Pinches the bridge of his nose. Hard.
text: Forcing emotion to retreat to wherever emotion comes from.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Lo.
scene_heading: INT. CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- CASEY’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT.
text: The door creaks open. A shadow slinks in. Sits on the edge of
dialog: the bed.
text: A hand reaches out and rests gently on Casey’s chest.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Hey.
text: The sheets move a little.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. Wake up, son. We gotta go.
text: Casey bolts upright.
speaker_heading: CASEY
speaker_heading: I’M UP.
text: The shadow rises, walks to the door. Turns on the light.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I'm making breakfast. Get dressed.
dialog: We gotta feed the horses.
text: Casey rubs furiously at his eyes and yawns.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Waiting on you.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: (Smiles)Yeah ... I can see that.
text: Cory walks out as Casey rises, shaking off the night.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- PRE-DAWN.
text: Cory sips coffee. As they drive down the highway, PRONGHORN
text: ANTELOPE walk parallel to the road. Following a path carved
text: into these plains before man sparked his first fire.
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- DAWN.
text: The sun has crested the horizon behind us. Ahead of us -- the
text: Wind River mountains and the storm clouds that gather above
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: How come the clouds just sit there?
dialog: Why don’t they dump their snow and
dialog: get it over with?
speaker_heading: CORY
text: Mountains hold the clouds back with
text: the winds that blows between ‘em.
dialog: Makes a sort of suction. Sometimes
dialog: they can suck the storm right out
dialog: of the clouds. Sometimes they just
dialog: make it worse, cuz a big storm will
dialog: sit there and gather strength from
dialog: the winds that hold it back ... Our
dialog: ancestors believed the storms hold
dialog: the spirits of vengeance, and the
dialog: mountains are our protector. But
dialog: when enough evil lives in our
dialog: people, the mountains free the
dialog: storm to punish the demons among
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That what you believe?
text: Cory smiles.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: No.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes.
text: Up ahead, we see a small, log cabin with a barn even worse
text: off than Cory’s. TWO HORSES run and kick at the dropping
text: pressure and the storm behind it. Cory drives up and parks.
text: The front door is already open. An Indian man in his 70's
text: stands in long johns and boots with no regard for the sub-
text: zero temperature. This is DAN CROWHEART, Casey’s grandfather.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Re: the horses) Sense the storm.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: Yep. That’s my cue to stick ‘em in
dialog: the barn. But with a lion about, I
dialog: don’t want ‘em stuck in a open
dialog: stall. They gonna have to make
dialog: their peace with the storm. (Opening
dialog: his arms) Come here, grandson.
dialog: 1d.
text: Casey is already doing that. He runs to him and the old man
dialog: lifts him with a strength we didn’t credit him with having.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re Grandma made fry bread. You
dialog: have breakfast?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Just eggs.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: Go get some then.
text: Casey disappears inside. Crowheart looks to Cory.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART (CONT’D)
dialog: Hau, Munape.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: Police chief called you to hunt the
dialog: lion, eh?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: He called me to hunt something. You
dialog: lost a steer?
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: I‘1l show you where. It’s a lion.
text: He grabs a coat from a rack and steps outside. They walk
text: behind the house, past the horses and toward a large, fenced,
text: field completely covered in snow.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART (CONT’D)
dialog: How’s Wilma?
speaker_heading: CORY
text: Headed to a job interview in
text: Jackson. Some hotel.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: Jackson Hole. Gonna go live with
dialog: the millionaires.

text: Crowheart looks back as he walks and smiles.
dialog: iy.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: Save your money. When the wolves
dialog: start eating their Golden
dialog: Retrievers, that land’s gonna go
dialog: for pennies on the dollar.
text: Cory laughs. Crowheart stops. THE SNOW IS STAINED RED. Just
text: beyond is the body of a young steer. Crowheart stands over it
text: and points to tracks in the hard snow.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me what that is.
text: Cory lowers himself to it. Must admit --
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That’s a lion.
text: Cory follows the tracks. Crowheart stays put, watching.
text: Fifty yards away Cory stops. Looks back at Crowheart.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: There’s two.
text: He follows the tracks farther.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Three. She’s got both of last
text: year’s kits with her. They chased
dialog: your steer around for a while, I
dialog: bet.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: That’s what the tracks say.
text: Cory walks back toward him.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: She's teaching them to hunt. And
dialog: she’s teaching ‘em on livestock ...
dialog: (Shakes his head) She just got her
dialog: whole family killed.
text: Cory looks toward the mountains. From here, they tower over
dialog: us like a canyon wall.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
text: They’re tucked up there somewhere.
dialog: I'll go have a look ... You mind
dialog: watching Casey for a few hours?
text: Crowheart smiles.
speaker_heading: ZU.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: You never have to ask that.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Got gas in your snowmobile?
scene_heading: EXT. WIND RIVER RESERVATION -- DAY.
text: Cory drives a snowmobile over the frozen ground, following
text: the tracks. He is far from the cabin. Far from anything. The
dialog: mountains are so close, you could almost reach out and touch
text: them. To the left, the prairie is broken with GAS DRILL AFTER
text: GAS DRILL, all jutting eighty-feet into the air like giant,
text: steel darts fired into the earth.
text: Cory slows, sees something he
text: snowmobile. Looks down. We do
text: HUMAN FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW.
text: THE GROUND AROUND THEM.
text: Cory steps off the snowmobile
dialog: print -- knows instantly this
dialog: didn’t expect. Stops the
dialog: too.
scene_heading: BAREFOOT. FROZEN BLOOD STAINING
text: and places his hand against the
dialog: person was not large.
text: He checks his pistol and his rifle, making sure both are
text: loaded, removes the WHITE CAMO from his backpack. Puts it on.
text: Follows the tracks on foot.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE --
text: From a distance, he is invisible. It is as though the snow
text: itself stood up and walked.
text: WE WALK BEHIND HIM NOW.
text: The mountains are a hundred yards from him. Pine trees lord
text: over the snow. The clouds cast a shadow that is visible just
text: fifty yards ahead.
text: Cory studies the ground. Takes two more steps, then stops --
text: IN FRONT OF HIM IS A PERFECT IMPRINT OF THE GIRL. As though
text: she laid down and made a bloody snow-angel.
text: We see where she stood up and stumbled toward a small arroyo
text: just ahead.
text: Cory slings the rifle over his shoulder slowly. Silently.
text: Pulls out his RUGER BLACKHAWK PISTOL.
text: He hides the pistol under his coat, and cocks the hammer --
dialog: no noise.
dialog: 21.
text: He raises the pistol to eye level and moves forward. Wherever
text: he looks -- the pistol points. He crests the little arroyo
text: and stares down.
text: At first he sees nothing. Then -- A HAND. REACHING FROM THE
speaker_heading: SNOW.
text: He looks around. Nothing. He looks at the ground. No tracks
dialog: except those of the girl.
text: He moves to the hand. Gently brushes the snow away. THE
text: RUNNING GIRL’S FACE STARES BACK. Frozen in a constipated
text: moan. Blood frozen to her face. Blood mixed with the snow and
text: ice around her.
text: Cory stares at her -- almost as frozen as she is.
text: His breath leaves him -- but not from the sight of a dead
text: body. He’s seen plenty in his day. This is a body he knows.
text: A snowflake falls. Then another.
text: Takes off his back pack, pulls out a two-way radio. Turns it
text: to channel 16 -- the emergency channel -- and speaks with a
text: hollow voice.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I need emergency assistance.
dialog: Repeat. Emergency assistance
dialog: requested ... Come back?
text: Static crackles, then a voice filters through.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY (0.S.)
text: Fremont County Sheriff's office.
dialog: What’s your emergency.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I found a body on the Wind River
dialog: Indian Reservation west of Boulder
dialog: Flats, I need Tribal Police to
dialog: respond to the following
dialog: location...
text: We pull back and snow begins to fall. We pull back farther,
text: and Cory fades as the snow falls faster.
text: A STRONG WIND pushes the snowflakes horizontal -- it is
text: snowing sideways.
text: The storm breaks free from the mountains’ grasp with a
text: vengeful howl -- ready to punish this land and her people for
dialog: all the evil they’ve done.
dialog: ZZ.
scene_heading: EXT. DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -— DAY.
text: Cory stands on the little porch with TRIBAL POLICE CHIEF BEN
text: SHOYO, 50, kind, round face and large, heavy frame.
text: They watch the storm throw snow at the earth like shrapnel.
text: Barely visible to the left of the house are THREE TRIBAL
scene_heading: POLICE TRUCKS. EMPTY FLAT-BED TRAILERS ATTACHED TO THE
text: BUMPERS. AN AMBULANCE IS PARKED BESIDE THEM.
text: Two snowmobiles sit in front of the house. Ben lights a
dialog: smoke.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: FBI’s taking a while, eh.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Road’s bad out of Riverton. I hate
dialog: to move her before they’ve had a
dialog: look, but I’m not gonna try to pull
dialog: her out after dark. We gotta get
dialog: this show on the road.
text: Cory steps out into the snow. Kicks at it with his boot.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: We're losing the tracks.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This ain’t letting up. Not for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Oughta let me follow ‘em while I
dialog: still can.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Can’t have you out there without
dialog: the FBI’s okay, Cory.
text: Cory looks back to the men on the porch.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You call her folks yet, Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I want to get her to Lander first.
dialog: It looks like Natalie, but I don’t
dialog: want to call the wrong person. Not
dialog: about this.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: Z5e
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: It’s Natalie.
text: We look out from the porch and can barely make out -- A BLACK
text: SUV, crawling through the snow on the main road.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s your Feds.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK SUV -- CONTINUOUS.
text: FBI AGENT JANE BANNER, 28, struggles to see through the snow
text: as her GPS directs her.
speaker_heading: GPS
text: In seventy-five feet, turn right.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: ... Where?!
speaker_heading: GPS
dialog: Turn right ... Turn right.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where do you want me to turn
dialog: right?? WHERE!!!
text: Dirty-blonde hair falls over a pretty face as she peers
text: closer to the windshield in an attempt to see where the hell
dialog: she’s supposed to go.
scene_heading: EXT. DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -- PORCH -- DAY.
text: Dan, Ben, and Cory look at the SUV -- barely visible through
text: the storm -- PULL TO A STOP on the highway.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: What are these fools doing?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Can’t see the road.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We don’t have time for this.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’ll go get ‘em.
text: Cory walks to his snowmobile.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: INT. JANE’S SUV -- CONT.
text: She can barely make out the house a quarter-mile away, and
text: the police vehicles -- white themselves -- are completely
dialog: invisible.
text: Jane pulls a ROAD ATLAS out and studies it. Looks back out
dialog: the window.
text: Hears what sounds like the whine of a CHAIN SAW.
text: Cory appears from the snow like a wraith, pulls up beside
text: Jane's window. Knocks on it. No idea a gun is now pointed at
text: him on the other side of the vehicle’s door.
text: She cracks the window, leery.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You FBI?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: ++. You Tribal Police?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: No. But I’1l take you to them. This
dialog: thing in four-wheel drive?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Alright, follow me.
text: Cory whips the snowmobile around, spewing snow, then drives
text: toward the house.
speaker_heading: GPS
dialog: In fifty feet --
text: Jane pounds the power button with her fist.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Shut up.
text: Jane puts the SUV in gear and follows. The police vehicles
text: come into view, as does Ben, standing on the porch. His
text: uniform is her first evidence this isn’t an ambush. Cory has
text: already parked and is walking back to the protection of the
text: overhang.
text: She slams the SUV in park and opens the vehicle door.
scene_heading: EXT. DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -- CONT.
dialog: 22.
text: She tosses a coat over a business suit as she stumbles toward
text: them in the shin-deep snow.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m Jane Banner.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Is it just you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Just me.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Ben Shoyo. I’m Tribal Police Chief.
dialog: This is Cory Lambert, works for US
dialog: Fish and Wildlife. He found the
text: body. This is his father-in-law,
dialog: Dan. He don’t do nuthin’.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: We got the same job, eh?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well. Sorry to meet under these
dialog: circumstances. (To Cory) You wanna
dialog: show me body?
text: The men don’t move, just exchange bewildered looks.
text: Jane shivers, hands jammed in her pockets. A half-inch of
text: snow building on her shoulders and the top of her head.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t want to be rude, but I’m
dialog: freezing my ass off here, so...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, that’s gonna get a lot worse
dialog: if you go out there dressed like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm a big girl. Thank you.
text: Cory steps to her.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Body’s a ten mile drive by
dialog: snowmobile. You’d be dead before we
dialog: got there.
dialog: Zo.
text: She looks away from his dark, intense eyes. Feels a little
text: silly as she shivers in place.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I was in court in Riverton when I
dialog: got the call to come here. This is
dialog: what I have --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You should have a winter-gear bag
dialog: in the back there --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: This isn’t a government vehicle,
dialog: it’s a rental. I flew in from
dialog: Denver. I’m just the closest agent
dialog: to the scene ... You don’t think I
dialog: can make it like this?
text: She is already shivering to the point it’s affecting her
dialog: speech.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Come inside. We'll get you fixed
dialog: up.
text: He points toward the cabin. Ben extends a hand to her as she
text: reaches the first step. Crowheart has her elbow by the time
text: she’s on the porch. It is clear none of these men think she
dialog: will live five minutes out here.
text: She should be grateful. She isn’t. Pride makes her shake free
text: of the men cradling her like a wounded bird. She walks into
dialog: the house.
text: Ben looks at Cory, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: See what they send us?
scene_heading: INT. CROWHEART’S CABIN -- BEDROOM -- A LITTLE LATER.
text: The humiliation continues as ALICE CROWHEART, 64, a hundred
text: pounds overweight, and fierce eyes, watches Jane pull a pair
text: of thermal underwear over her g-string.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Thermals can make underwear wedge
dialog: up your bottom, but I guess yours
dialog: are already there.
text: Jane’s smart enough to not respond.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, these should fit. You’re
dialog: skinny.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Alice hands her a pair of jeans. They’re a little tight, but
text: they’1l do. She climbs into a pair of COVERALLS.
text: Alice hands her a wool skull cap.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You got gloves?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No.
text: Alice shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Goodness. What were they thinking
dialog: sending you here.
text: Aside from her cheeks, virtually all of Jane is covered. She
text: looks at herself in the mirror -- feels ridiculous.
text: Alice looks too. Covers her mouth with her hand. Looks like
text: she may cry, then turns back to the bed. Starts folding the
dialog: rejects.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you.
text: While looking down, focused on her folding --
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You return them the minute you get
dialog: back. They ain’t a gift.
text: Alice turns and looks right at her.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: .-. Of course.
text: Jane walks out to the living room -- all the men waiting for
dialog: her. Notices Casey.
dialog: 2B.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I’m ... Bundled. Let’s go.
text: Casey grabs his coat, pulls it on.
speaker_heading: CROWHEART
dialog: You're gonna stay with me, young
dialog: buck.
text: Casey looks up at his father. Cory kneels down. Looks into
text: his eyes as his hand gently cups the back of Casey’s neck.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: A couple more hours, son. I’m
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: A couple. This is our day.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I promise.
text: Casey seems to tighten and deflate at the same time, as his
text: father rises and walks to the door.
text: Ben looks outside.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It ain’t letting up.
text: Cory looks, then turns back to Jane.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: It’s ten below outside. You leave
dialog: that pride on the porch and hug me
dialog: like your prom date, understood?
text: Jane is so offended she almost falls backwards.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m the highest ranking law
dialog: enforcement officer for three
text: hundred miles in any direction.
dialog: Don’t ever tell me what to do
dialog: again.
text: Steps closer to her.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I don’t want to insult you, just
dialog: making sure there’s only one girl
dialog: froze to death out there today.
text: She turns from him and walks out into the storm.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: EXT. SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY.
text: Jane sits behind Cory on the snowmobile. They race through
text: the white at 60 miles-per-hour.
text: Jane presses her face into the back of this stranger -- her
text: hands tucked under his ass -- as she experiences cold ina
text: manner unexplainable to those who haven’t endured it.
text: Up ahead, we see FOUR POLICE SNOWMOBILES, and FOUR OFFICERS
text: huddling around a MOBILE PROPANE HEATER. TWO EMT’S huddle
text: beside the body.
text: Cory and Ben park. Walk toward them. Cory doesn’t wait for
text: Jane to start asking questions.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I picked up her tracks about 300
text: meters to the south.
text: Jane nods as she struggles to shake off the bone-breaking
dialog: cold.
text: They walk past the officers to NATALIE HANSON’S BODY, and an
text: EMT holding a HEAT GUN -- basically a very powerful hair
text: dryer -- that he waves along Natalie’s body where it meets
text: the ice that holds her.
text: Jane kneels next to her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Calls back to Ben)Got a positive
dialog: ID?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not positive, no.
text: Cory, and three of the officers say in unison:
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: It’s Natalie Hanson.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Haven't found any identification,
dialog: no one from the family has
dialog: identified the body, but ...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We'll call that positive for now.
dialog: She live close?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Fort Wakashie. North a ways.
speaker_heading: DU.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What’s ‘a ways’?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Thirty minute drive.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay, she didn’t run from home.
text: Jane studies the gash. Touches the body.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
text: She’s frozen solid.
text: She looks back at Ben.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: No one reported her missing? Her
dialog: parents?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
text: She takes that in.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Makes the parents rather suspect.
dialog: No one likes the sound of that, but they all hold their
dialog: tongues.
text: Jane notices dried blood that has soaked and frozen to the
text: crotch of her sweatpants. Notices her bare feet.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Softly) Who did this to you,
dialog: honey?
dialog: As out of place as Jane is in the wild, and this may very
text: well be her first murder scene -- she ignores the cold and
text: focuses. Patient. Observant. She looks up at Ben.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: How experienced is your medical
dialog: examiner?
dialog: The irony of this girl asking who’s experienced ...
speaker_heading: BEN
text: He stays busy.
dialog: SL.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Order a rape kit, When he’s done
dialog: with his prelim, I want her sent to
dialog: Cheyenne. Make sure her belongings
dialog: go with her. I need them tested.
dialog: I’m listing this as a homicide.
text: One of the officers can’t help but mumble --
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Gee, you think?
text: Jane stands, looks over the land -- covered in a foot of
text: fresh powder. With more falling.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We're not going to find the attack
dialog: site if it’s out in the open. Not
dialog: till spring, anyway.
text: She turns to Cory.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: How well do you know this land?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Like it’s my job. Which it is.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Anywhere she could have been
dialog: running from? Anything close?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Nearest homes are seven or eight
text: miles southeast.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Sam Littlefeather’s house is out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Those boys are worth looking into.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m no survivalist, but that’s too
dialog: far to run in the snow -- she’s
dialog: dressed no better than I was and I
dialog: almost froze to death in your front
dialog: yard.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You’re not from here.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There’s no structures closer?
speaker_heading: CORY
text: Drill rigs maybe five miles from
dialog: here. There’s trailers for the
text: workers. But they shut it down in
dialog: the winter.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So why would a teenage girl be out
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Kids come out here on snowmobiles.
dialog: Have a big party out here in the
dialog: snow.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not barefoot they don’t. (To Cory)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Only thing I can tell you about is
dialog: the tracks.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That’s the only thing we've got.
text: Cory looks at her for a moment, walks a few feet, begins
text: kicking snow -- making a little clearing.
text: He kneels into the snow and very delicately begins using his
text: hands, then leans over and blows the snow away.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Look here.
text: She leans over him. NATALIE’S FOOT PRINT AND FROZEN BLOOD,
text: NOW MIXED WITH SNOW is visible.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: See how the toes twist out? And the
text: front of the track is deeper than
dialog: the back -- almost no imprint of
dialog: the heel?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 33e
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: She was running.
text: He stands. Points to Natalie’s body thirty yards away.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: She ran until she dropped. There’s
dialog: a spot over here where she fell ...
text: Cory walks to the bloody snow angel.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
text: A pool of blood where her face hit.
dialog: Gets down to twenty below out here
dialog: at night. You breathe that cold air
dialog: deep in your lungs -- like when
dialog: you're running, it’ll freeze em.
dialog: Lungs fill up with blood, you start
dialog: coughing it up.
text: He points to the impression of her face and the pool of
dialog: blood.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wherever she came from, she ran all
text: the way here. Her lungs burst and
text: she curled up under that tree. She
dialog: didn’t freeze to death ... She
dialog: drowned.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How far could someone run barefoot
dialog: out here?
text: He looks out over the mountains.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I seen tourists freeze to death in
dialog: these mountains when it was barely
dialog: 40 degrees ... I seen a fur trader
text: caught in his own trap, drag
text: himself six miles to a forest
text: service cabin and radio for help.
dialog: In the dead of winter ... There
dialog: ain’t no gauge for the will to
dialog: live. Some have it. Plenty don’t
dialog: +. I knew this girl. She was a
dialog: fighter. However far we think she
dialog: ran, my guess is she ran farther.
text: Cory looks east.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: I got to get back to my son. I
dialog: promised him a few hours.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Would you be willing to help me? I
dialog: mean, I can’t ... Hell, I couldn’t
dialog: find the way back to my car. I
dialog: don’t know how to investigate this
dialog: without ...(She turns to Ben) Can I
dialog: borrow him for a few days?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He don’t work for me. (To Cory) You
dialog: got a lion to kill, don’t forget.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: There’s three of ‘em. And I didn’t.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: ... What do you do for the Forest
dialog: Service?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’m a hunter.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: «+. A lion hunter??
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I hunt predators.
text: She looks back at the police officers trying to free
text: Natalie’s corpse from a frozen land intent on keeping her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Good. Come hunt one for me.
text: WE PUSH IN CLOSER.
text: Past the officers. Past the heat gun. We rest on her face --
text: watching as she slowly thaws. Watching the ice that sealed
text: her eyes begin to melt and run down her cheeks like tears.
text: Cory looks at her. Says, very softly --
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 3D.
scene_heading: INT. JANE’S SUV -- NIGHT.
text: SNOW pounds the windshield as the wipers work frantically to
text: remove it. Snow swarms in the headlights like locust.
text: Jane leans forward, chin almost resting on the steering
text: wheel, straining to see the road.
speaker_heading: GPS
text: In half a mile, turn left on East
dialog: Main Street.
dialog: The GPS may be right, but there is no way to know -- Jane
text: can’t see ten feet in front of her.
text: She slows down even more -- barely going 30. Turns on her
dialog: hazards ...
speaker_heading: GPS (CONT'D)
text: In three hundred feet, turn left on
dialog: East Main Street.
text: She slows a little more, but still sees nothing -- no road.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn left. Turn left.
text: She looks to the left, then back to her right --
text: A TRUCK HORN BLARES.
text: She slams on her brakes and begins sliding as a SEMI whips
text: by, mere feet from her bumper.
text: She slides to a stop in the middle of the intersection, now
text: facing the direction of the Semi.
text: She struggles to slow her beating heart as she watches the
text: brake lights of the truck that almost killed her.
text: The TRUCK DRIVER gets out, runs back to her. She rolls her
dialog: window down.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry, I can’t see anything.
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
text: IF YOU DON’T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IN
text: THIS YOU SHOULDN’T BE ON THE ROAD.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who the hell knows how to drive in
dialog: this??
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: Pull up behind me and follow me
dialog: close. Don’t slam your brakes. Stay
dialog: in second gear -- and you pull your
dialog: ass into the first motel we come
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That’s where I’m headed anyway.
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: Well I guess it’s your goddam lucky
dialog: day.
text: He turns and runs through the storm back to his truck. She
text: rolls up her window.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (To no one) I’m really sorry we
dialog: never had blizzards in FUCKING
dialog: FLORIDA!!! I’d like to see one of
dialog: you bastards in a hurricane.
text: He begins slowly moving forward. Mad as she is -- she obeys,
text: and pulls up right behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. SILVER SPUR LODGE -- LANDER, WYOMING -- NIGHT.
text: The parking lot is completely empty and covered with snow.
text: The truck driver points out his window at the motel -- wildly
text: gesturing for her to go there.
text: Jane turns into the lot, slamming the curb, and spinning her
text: wheels in a furious attempt to reach the safety of the
dialog: covered entrance.
text: She parks. Draws in a deep breath, opens the door and steps
text: into the fury of the storm.
scene_heading: INT. SILVER SPUR LODGE -- LANDER, WYOMING -- NIGHT.
text: The decor is old west meets late 80’s -- wagon wheels, black
text: leather couches, and watercolors of mountains, cowboys, and
dialog: horses.
text: Behind the counter is INGRED, late 30’s, horribly obese, and
text: watching some version of CSI on a small TV. Jane approaches
text: the counter.
speaker_heading: INGRED
dialog: You look a little frazzled.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Quite a storm out there.
speaker_heading: INGRED
dialog: Yeah, you could've picked a better
dialog: day to travel.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Could I get a room?
speaker_heading: INGRED
dialog: How many nights?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t know. A week, maybe.
speaker_heading: INGRED
dialog: Smoking?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: INGRED

scene_heading: INT. CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT.
text: Cory sits at his dining room table. A CENTERFIRE CARTRIDGE
text: RELOADER in front of him. Beside him is a MARLIN GUIDE GUN --
text: a stainless steel, lever-action rifle chambered in .45-70. It
text: is a rifle for stopping bears. When they are running right at
dialog: you.
text: On a small scale he weighs bullets, choosing only those that
text: weigh exactly 540 grains. He seats a rifle casing in the
text: reloader, places a bullet in the machine’s teeth, pulls a
dialog: lever.
text: When he returns the lever upright, he has a fully formed
text: bullet, almost four inches long.
speaker_heading: CASEY (0.S.)
dialog: Dad?
text: Cory looks up. Casey stands in long johns -- hair messed from

speaker_heading: CORY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Work.
text: Cory seats another rifle casing.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Did she die like Emily?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: She died from the cold.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: So she died like Emily.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yeah, son. I’m afraid she did.
text: Cory pushes back from the table. Sets the rifle on the table.
text: Pulls his son onto his lap.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Is that for the lion?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’m doing some work for the

speaker_heading: CORY

speaker_heading: CORY

speaker_heading: CASEY

dialog: death, half an ounce at a time.
scene_heading: EXT. CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- DAWN.
text: We watch from across the road as Cory walks toward the barn,
text: Casey running behind. Sunlight bounces off the snow. The

text: We watch them disappear into the barn. Watch the horses press
text: against the gate, unable to go another minute without their
dialog: breakfast.
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- DAY.
text: Casey holds his hands up to the heat vents. Cory looks at his

speaker_heading: CORY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: We're studying the presidents.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What about ‘em, birthdays?

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No. The ones on money. Do you know

text: Cory thinks about it.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: President Grant.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That a fact.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Yep. Know who’s on the hundred
dialog: dollar bill ... Ben Franklin?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: «+. I don’t think he was president.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: He got his face on money, I guess
dialog: he’s the president of something.
dialog: How bout a twenty dollar bill?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You know son, most of my experience
dialog: has been with the George Washington
dialog: and Abraham Lincoln variety.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That’s the one dollar bill and the

speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Those I know.
text: Cory pulls up in front of the elementary school.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Are you picking me up?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Your mom. Unless the road from

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I hope the roads are bad.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You don’t ever wish that, son.

text: He doesn’t.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: CORY

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Thursday.
text: Casey opens the door. Steps out.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Good luck on that test.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I love you, dad.
text: Casey closes the door before Cory gets to say it back. Casey
text: runs toward the school through a foot of snow.
text: Cory watches the boy until he steps through the doors and
text: they close behind him. Puts the truck in gear. Cory’s face
text: hardens -- he is a hunter again.
scene_heading: INT. FREMONT COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT.

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I see you found town okay.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Barely. Did the family identify
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They give you a reason for not
dialog: reporting her missing?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Got a boyfriend she stayed with

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever done this before?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Observed an autopsy? Come on ... No
dialog: -.. Is it that obvious?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Anyone who tells you they get
dialog: easier is a goddam liar. Let’s get
text: it over with.
text: They push through the doors.
scene_heading: INT. EXAM ROOM -- CORONER'S OFFICE -- CONT.
text: On a steel table is Natalie. Naked. Chest sawed open like a
text: gutted deer. Jane pretends like it doesn’t weaken her knees.
text: Ben walks toward the body, no attempt to hide his unease
dialog: toward this awful part of his job.
text: A man, dressed in scrubs, runs a centrifuge along a far wall.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Randy, you’re on a clock. I’ve got
dialog: about five minutes of this in me,
dialog: so let’s go.
text: DR. RANDY WHITEHURST turns and walks to the body.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: I'll be quick. (Nods to Jane) Good
dialog: morning, Randy Whitehurst, I’m the
dialog: medical examiner.
text: Jane wants to look anywhere but the body or the man that cut

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Uh huh. I’m Agent Banner.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: FBI --

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you, yes. I’m FBI.
text: He studies her.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: This your first autopsy?
dialog: How the fuck does everyone know that?
speaker_heading: DR. WHITEHURST (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, gotta have a first.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes, it’s my first on an
dialog: investigation, but ... I am trained
dialog: for this, so everyone just ... Can
dialog: we get to it, please?
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: Yes ma’am. As you see here, she
dialog: suffered a deep laceration along
text: her brow line.
text: He points at each act of violence. Waits for nods from both
text: Jane and Ben before moving on.
speaker_heading: DR. WHITEHURST (CONT'D)
text: Two separated ribs. Frost bite in
text: both feet up through her ankles,
text: frost bite on her nose and her left
text: hand -- the frost bite on her feet
dialog: is stage four, you can tell by the
dialog: blueing here, you see that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
text: Vaginal wall is torn. The damage on
text: multiple sides of the wall at
dialog: different depths indicates
dialog: penetration by different
dialog: individuals, and the bite marks
text: along her neck and on the left
dialog: nipple have distinct measurements --
speaker_heading: JANE
text: So there were two assailants.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: At least ... I swabbed her and sent

speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DR. WHITEHURST (CONT'D)
dialog: We should have DNA results in a

text: Jane has found herself next to Natalie’s head, can’t help but
text: gently stroke her hair as though reminding herself this
dialog: carcass had a soul.
speaker_heading: DR. WHITEHURST (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t touch her -- I haven’t combed
text: her hair for forensics yet.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What are you listing as the cause
dialog: of death?
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: You're not going to like it -- she
text: died from a pulmonary hemorrhage.
dialog: When sub-zero air is drawn into
dialog: lungs, it can cause the alveoli --
text: the tiny sacs in the lungs -- to
text: burst. Fluid builds in the lungs,
dialog: and if the air is cold enough,
text: liquid in the lungs will
text: crystallize. Ultimately, the victim
text: either freezes from the inside out,
dialog: or they drown in their own blood
dialog: -.. That’s the cause of death in
dialog: this instance.
text: Jane thinks. Cory was right. Then she realizes --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're not listing this as a
dialog: homicide?
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: Can't.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But ... You have to factor in the
text: circumstances. She was raped.
text: Repeatedly. Beaten. And then --
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: Look, circumstances is your field,
dialog: not mine. Let me show you, come
dialog: here --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t need it explained -- I need
dialog: to find whoever chased her to death
dialog: in this frozen hell and put them in
dialog: prison, and not calling this a...
text: She walks a lap around the room, calming herself, comes back
dialog: to where she started.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: This is very prosecutable as a
dialog: murder -- clearly she wouldn’t have
dialog: been running through the snow if
dialog: she hadn’t been attacked, but I
dialog: can’t list the cause of death as a
dialog: homicide.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The only way I can get an FBI team
dialog: to the reservation is if it’s
dialog: listed as a homicide. I’m not here
dialog: to solve this, I’m here to obtain a
dialog: cause of death and have someone
dialog: sent here who can --
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: Look, present the rape, present the
dialog: assault and I’m sure --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Those aren't federal crimes! Those
dialog: crimes fall to the Bureau of Indian
dialog: Affairs and ... Sorry.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: You keep saying sorry, but you keep
dialog: doing it.
text: She looks at Ben, eyes begging for an alternative.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hey, I’m used to no help.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You have six officers on your
dialog: entire force -- to cover an area
dialog: the size of Rhode Island. No
dialog: offense, but this will have to curl
dialog: up in your lap for you to solve it.
text: He does take offense, but also knows it’s true.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: DR. WHITEHURST
dialog: We all know it’s a murder. Have a
dialog: US Attorney sign off on it. I’m
dialog: happy to corroborate that, I just
dialog: can’t put it on the death
dialog: certificate.
text: She walks off, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
text: She pushes through the double doors to the hall. Ben walks
text: out after her. She leans against the wall, looking at the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I appreciate your passion. Not the
dialog: usual response from Feds ... But
dialog: Randy’s on our side --
text: She turns to him, fierce.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: As soon as my supervisor sees this
dialog: he’s going to want me back in
dialog: Denver. Not that I’m much help, but
dialog: «+. I’m all you’re going to get. We
dialog: have no time ... What’s that

scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- DAY.
text: Cory moves through the reservation town of Wind River. It has
dialog: none of Lander’s conveniences -- no 7-11’s, no motels, no
dialog: chain restaurants.

text: Cory’s cellphone rings.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Hello.
scene_heading: EXT. TROUT CREEK ROAD -- CONT.
text: We watch Cory’s truck -- pulling a small flat-bed trailer

text: in the middle of the road, and head off the other way.
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: INT. HANSON HOME -- FORT WASHAKIE, WYOMING -- DAY.
text: We are inside a house that screams poverty. Furniture is old
text: and broken to the point of barely being functional. Faux-wood
text: siding of the manufactured home is fraying at the edges.
text: Still, extreme care has been given to make it into a home.
text: Photos of Natalie and a handsome TEENAGE BOY are pasted on
dialog: every wall.
text: We hear Ben’s voice as we look over the home.
speaker_heading: BEN (0.S.)
dialog: So you never met him.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN (0.S.)
dialog: And she never talked about him?
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Not to me.
text: The man’s voice is soft, deep, almost soothing. As we push in
text: on a photo of Natalie and the handsome young man, who is
dialog: clearly her brother, we hear --
speaker_heading: JANE (0.S.)
dialog: Why would you let her stay with a
dialog: Man you’ve never met. A man whose
dialog: name you don’t even know. I look
dialog: around, see all these photos --
speaker_heading: MARTIN (0.S.)
dialog: She was an adult.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Barely.
text: We see the man now -- Natalie’s father, MARTIN HANSON, 40's,
text: every bit of 6’2”. Long, black hair pulled in a braided pony
text: tail. Dark, heavy face. But those eyes -- a hawk’s eyes. A
text: warrior’s eyes. Which are burning into Jane. He looks at Ben.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Wyuksa psi wasichu.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: .«-. It’s not good.
text: She looks at the big man, apologizing without backing down.
dialog: Du.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t mean to offend you. I’m
dialog: trying to understand the dynamic,
dialog: Mr. Hanson. I’m trying to help.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Why is it whenever you people try
text: to help, it starts with insults.
text: He steps toward her, furious eyes and all. She resists the
text: temptation to draw her weapon.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know why she wouldn’t tell
dialog: me. But she was eighteen. I chose
dialog: to trust her. I chose wrong.
text: He looks her over.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How about your wife, did your
dialog: daughter talk to her?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Do you talk to your mother?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It’s Annie? Is she here?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: She’s in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'd like to speak to her.
text: His hawk eyes narrow. He says, almost like a dare --
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Be my guest.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you. (Points down the hall)
dialog: Bedroom this way?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Jane.
text: Ben shakes his head ‘no’.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (To Martin) You don’t mind?
dialog: Die
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hey, you don’t need my permission.
dialog: You're an adult. Barely.
text: Point made. She walks down the hall. Comes to a closed door.
text: Knocks softly. No answer. She opens the door and sees --
text: ANNIE HANSON is 50, heavy, and COVERED IN BLOOD. She sits on
text: the edge of her bed, sobbing, mumbling, and rocking back and
text: forth gripping a KITCHEN KNIFE. Cuts run up and down her
text: arms. She never notices the open door. Jane doesn’t give her
text: a chance to -- she closes the door quickly.
text: Jane stands a moment in the hall -- she is in no way prepared
text: to navigate this world, and she knows it. She dreads walking
text: to the living room and facing Martin, but does it anyway.
text: When she reaches the living room, Martin stares hell at her.
dialog: She has it coming.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: There is a knock at the door. Martin opens it. It’s Cory.
text: The two men stare at each other. Don’t speak. Martin’s lips
text: tighten. Cory gives him a sad smile. Martin’s tight lips
text: begin to quiver.
text: Cory steps back onto the porch. Martin follows him. Cory
text: kicks the door and we glimpse Martin fold into Cory’s arms as
text: it closes, shutting us out.
text: Through the door, we hear the man heaving enormous sobs that
text: seem to shake the house’s flimsy foundation.
text: Ben and Jane stand perfectly still, listening to pain echo
text: against the door like a storm.
scene_heading: EXT. HANSON HOME -- WIND RIVER, WYOMING -- LATER.
text: Cory and Martin sit on the porch, looking out over the snow-
text: covered sagebrush.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I'd like to tell you it gets
dialog: easier, but it doesn’t. If there’s
dialog: a comfort -- you get used to the
dialog: pain if you let yourself ... I went
dialog: to a grief seminar in Casper. Don’t
dialog: know why, just ... It hurt so much,
dialog: I was searching for anything that
dialog: could make it go away ...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: DZ.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s what I wanted this seminar
dialog: to do -- make it go away. The
dialog: instructor come up to me after the
text: seminar was over, sat beside me and
dialog: said, “I got good news and bad
dialog: news. Bad news is you'll never be
dialog: the same. You’1ll never be whole.
dialog: Ever. What was taken from you can’t
dialog: be replaced. You’re daughter’s
dialog: gone. ... Now the good news -- as
dialog: soon as you accept that, as soon as
dialog: you let yourself suffer, allow
dialog: yourself to grieve ... You'll be
dialog: able to visit her in your mind, and
dialog: remember all the joy she gave you.
dialog: All the love she knew. Right now,
dialog: you don’t even have that, do you?”
text: Martin finds himself shaking his head ‘no’, even though the
text: question wasn’t directed at him.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: He said, “that’s what not accepting
dialog: this will rob from you”.
text: Cory looks at Martin.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you shy from the pain of it,
dialog: then you rob yourself of every
dialog: memory of her, my friend. Every
dialog: one. From her first step to her
dialog: last smile. You’1l kill ‘em all.
text: Cory puts his hand on Martin’s neck, guides his eyes up to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Take the pain ... Take the pain,
dialog: Martin. It’s the only way to keep
dialog: her with you.
text: Martin drops his head into his lap. Cory resists the
dialog: temptation to do the same.
text: The big man stands up, pulls a cigarette from his pocket,
text: lights it. Walks out into the snow.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I'm tired, Cory. I’m just so tired
dialog: of fighting this life.
dialog: Ds.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What you do now you do for your
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Drugs is his family now ... He’s
dialog: gone too. Lives just down the damn
dialog: road, but ... He’s gone.
text: Martin takes a long drag.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I expect they’1l find he’s involved

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY
text: He stays with the Littlefeather
dialog: boys, doesn’t he.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yep ... You’re driving this Fed
dialog: around so she don’t get lost, that
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That’s what they asked me to do,
dialog: but that’s not what I’m doing.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Martin looks back at Cory.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’m a hunter. What do you think I’m
dialog: doing?
text: Martin walks toward the porch, bores his hawk eyes into his
dialog: old friend.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: If you find who did this ... (His
dialog: eyes burn into Cory) No matter who
dialog: it is. You understand me?
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Right where they stand.
text: Martin nods. Flicks his cigarette into the snow.
dialog: D4.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Then get off my porch and go do it.
text: Cory stands and follows Martin as he heads back into his
text: crumbling house.
scene_heading: INT. CORY’S PICK UP -- DAY.
text: Cory follows Jane’s SUV, who follows Ben’s squad car ... They
text: move down an empty highway. As they drive, Cory looks over,
text: sees two coyotes trotting through the snow to his left.
text: Notices a flock of sheep on the horizon...
text: The sheep form their silly circle as the coyotes move closer
text: at a dead run.
text: Cory doesn’t slow down and doesn’t look back. He’s not
dialog: hunting coyotes. Not today ...
scene_heading: EXT. SAM LITTLEFEATHER’S HOUSE -- DAY.
text: The house is the very essence of dilapidation. An old,
text: burgundy MINIVAN that can’t possibly run, sits beside a
text: lowered TOYOTA TERCEL in the driveway.
text: HIP-HOP pulses the windows of the flimsy house.
text: Cory, Jane, and Ben pull off the road. Get out. Cory looks
text: down -- sees snow-filled SNOWMOBILE TRACKS beside the
text: highway. They disappear abruptly -- as though they levitated.
dialog: Or were loaded onto a trailer ...
text: Cory begins walking through the snow to the back of the house
text: as Jane and Ben head to the front door.
text: Ben draws his pistol.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Natalie’s brother lives here with
dialog: Sam and Bart Littlefeather and a
dialog: real piece of work named Frank
dialog: Walker. Hanson’s kid is bad -- but

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Should we maybe wait for some back-
dialog: up?
dialog: DD.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This ain’t the land of back-up,
dialog: Jane. This is the land of you’re on

text: Jane shakes her head and nods at the same time. Draws her
dialog: pistol.
text: Ben pounds on the door. They wait for an answer.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT.
text: CORY WALKS THROUGH THE SNOW. He stares at the ground, looking
text: for anything that tells a story. Notices SNOWMOBILE TRACKS,
text: almost completely filled in with fresh snow, that run west
text: into the mountains, disappearing into the black timber.
text: He stares at the tracks. Mumbles to himself.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Who goes into the mountains just
dialog: before a storm ...
scene_heading: EXT. SAM LITTLEFIELD’S HOUSE -- CONT.
text: Jane and Ben still stand outside the door. Ben knocks again,

text: The music shuts off. Feet move toward the door. It opens.
text: SAM LITTLEFEATHER is 20, tall, and rail thin. His shaved head
text: is covered in a RAIDER’S SKULL CAP. His wild eyes fueled by
text: three day’s worth of meth.
text: He nods and bounces in place.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Looking for Chip Hanson. He around?
text: Sam shakes his head for an eternity.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not here, brah.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
dialog: Do.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m the FBI, dickhead. You Sam?
text: He stares at her a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Are you high right now Sam -- how
dialog: many times have I arrested you?
text: He stares his tweaked eyes at Ben. A flicker of recognition.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: «+. Chief, wazzup Brah.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Your brother here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He’s in prison. Where you put him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No parole? Look at that, the
text: justice system at work.
text: Sam's wild eyes bore into Ben.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Reminds me, I’m supposed to give
dialog: you this from my P.O. ... Hold on,
dialog: got it in here somewhere, yeah here
dialog: it is --
text: He fishes a small canister of pepper spray from his coat
text: pocket and empties it into their faces.
text: Ben and Jane fall back, coughing and rubbing furiously at
text: their eyes. The door closes. Frantic footsteps and yelling
text: come from the house as Ben and Jane stumble into the snow,
text: gasping for breath.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT.
text: Cory hears the shouting and coughing. Ben yells a warning to
text: him, then -- FOOTSTEPS moving through the house toward the
text: back door. Cory runs toward it, picking up a SNOW SHOVEL on
dialog: the way ...
text: He brings the shovel up, plants his foot, and swings like
text: hell as the back door opens -- a FAT TEENAGER DRESSED LIKE A
text: GANGSTER runs right into the meat of the shovel.
text: He is blown back into the door frame, and into CHIP HANSON,
text: 21, the boy from the photos on Martin Hanson’s wall. Chip
text: falls over the fat one, landing hard in the snow FACE FIRST.
text: He rolls over and sees:
speaker_heading: FROM CHIP’S POV --
text: We are looking up at Cory -- AND HIS BOOT -- coming toward
text: us. Fast. Blocking the sun like an eclipse. Slamming us back
text: into the snow.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- CONT.
text: Jane forces herself to stand, snot and tears running freely
text: down her face. Ben is struggling to stand, fighting the
text: liquid cayenne pepper wreaking havoc on his senses.
text: He stumbles to the ground, vomiting and cursing
dialog: simultaneously.
text: Jane sneezes and spits mucus as she raises her pistol eye-
text: level and enters the house ...
scene_heading: INT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- CONT.
text: It is dark. No electricity. A small fire burns in an oil drum
text: in the living room -- smoke escaping through a hole in the
dialog: roof.
text: WE RUN BEHIND HER, LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER.
text: She stumbles, sneezes, and trips over the ocean of trash on
text: the floor. Notices the open back door and Cory, standing over
text: the two teens sprawled in the snow.
text: She motions for him to stay there and moves deeper into the
dialog: house.
text: She hears the sounds of shells being fed into a shotgun,
text: hears a round pumped into the chamber.
text: She stumbles through the ankle-high trash and falls against
text: the wall, announcing her presence. She strains to see through
text: her tears.
text: A BLACK BLUR MOVES INTO THE HALLWAY.
text: She fires round after round in its direction. The muzzle
text: flash of her pistol blinds us -- the echo of the rounds beat
dialog: into our skull.
text: RINGING IS ALL WE CAN HEAR.
dialog: Do.
text: She stumbles further down the hall. Sees Sam crumpled on the
text: floor -- a shotgun beside him.
text: A bullet has pierced his cheek, another his neck. Goose down
text: protrudes from holes in his coat. Blood pumps from his neck
text: to the rhythm of his dying heart.
text: He looks up at her -- face filled with surprise and hate. He
text: tries to say something, but no sound comes.
text: THE RINGING FADES, REPLACED WITH JANE’S LABORED BREATHING.
text: She leans against the wall. Hears Ben kicking through the
text: trash behind her. She looks back down -- Sam is trying to
dialog: grab the shotgun -- piece of shit to the very last.
text: She reaches down, grabs the shotgun. Steps away, still
text: pointing her pistol at him.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: The other two’s outside with Cory.
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He’s alive, Ben. We need to call
dialog: EMS.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: EMS is an hour away. Leave him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He’s not dead, Ben.
text: Ben walks up to Sam, looks down. Sam’s wild, wired eyes stare
text: back. He gulps for air once, twice ... There is no third
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Like I said. Let’s go.
text: They walk out of frame, leaving us with Sam’s lifeless body
text: on the floor -- beer cans, fast food containers, and filthy
text: clothes scattered around him.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT.
text: When Jane and Ben step out, they see two young men hog-tied
text: with bailing wire, face down in the snow.
text: Cory leans against a small tool shed, holding his revolver.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Skinny one’s Natalie’s brother.
dialog: Dy.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who’s the other one?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That’s Frank Walker.(To Frank)
dialog: Won’t your daddy be proud?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My dad’s in prison, asshole.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I know, I put him there. Prison’1l
dialog: be good for you, Frank. Get you on
dialog: your dad’s exercise plan -- lifting
dialog: weights and selling hand jobs for
dialog: cigarettes. Slim you right up.
dialog: You'll come out of there looking
dialog: like Johnny Depp, I bet.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Tell me what happened to your
dialog: sister, Chip.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: What? What happened to her.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Don’t play dumb.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: About what? What happened to her?
text: Jane and Ben look at him. Is he a criminal and a drug addict?
dialog: Yes. Is he a liar? Sure. Is he lying now -- not a chance.
speaker_heading: CHIP (CONT’D)
dialog: What did those crackers do?
text: No one speaks.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What crackers? Was she seeing a
dialog: white man? Do you know him -- do
dialog: you know who he is?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Do you know his name, Chip?
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: «++. You said was. Why did you say
dialog: was? (Chip looks up at Cory) What
dialog: happened. Why did she say was?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: ou.
speaker_heading: CHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: She just said was -- why did she
dialog: say was?
text: Cory stands up, walks over to him. Kneels close. Speaks
text: softly as he points toward the mountains.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Because I found her raped and
dialog: killed right over there, son.
dialog: That’s why.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: «+. WHAAATTTT?????
text: From across the frozen plains, we look at Sam Littlefeather’s
text: house -- smoke rising through a hole in the roof. Chip’s
text: screams carrying across the white desert -- or perhaps it’s
text: the wind howling.
dialog: In this place they sound the same.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- LATER.
text: Again -- an ambulance and police vehicles. Officers mill
text: about out front. Chip and Frank sit cuffed in the back of
dialog: separate cars.
text: Cory is unloading his snowmobile off the trailer. Jane is
text: pulling on coveralls emblazoned with the BIA POLICE SEAL.
text: She walks up to Cory, who straps a gun case into a rifle rack
text: on the front of his snowmobile. Straps a HEAVY DUFFEL BAG AND
text: SNOWSHOES to the back.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You go. I’m going to get Chip to
dialog: Lander. See if he’ll give me a name
dialog: for this boyfriend. He’s who we
dialog: need to find.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: This is how we find him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No. We go to where he works or
dialog: where he lives, (Pointing to the
dialog: mountains) not out there.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Okay, where’s he live? Where’s he
dialog: work? What’s his name.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: You think that piece of shit’s
dialog: gonna tell you? You keep looking
dialog: for clues, and missing all the
dialog: signs. You see that?
text: He points out over the snow.
dialog: ol.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t -- no. I don’t see
dialog: anything.
text: He shakes his head as he pulls a pair of binoculars from the
dialog: duffel.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Look there.
text: She takes the binoculars. Looks through them.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where?
text: He stands behind her, wraps his arm around her, and points
text: out over the snow.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You see my arm through the binocs?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That’s all I can see.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: When I move my hand, look where it
dialog: was ... You see the tracks? a sled
dialog: track, filled with snow ... Look
dialog: for the shadow in it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Now look straight out -- at the
dialog: base of the mountains, you'll see
dialog: it easy there.
text: In the distance, the slight indentation stands out. The
text: tracks run straight from the house up into the pine trees
dialog: that cover the mountain.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes ... I see it.
text: She looks up at him.
dialog: oz.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Natalie died over there -- seven
dialog: miles(He points north). Those
text: tracks lead to the mountain from
dialog: here -- that’s five miles.
text: He points south to tall drill rigs jutting up from the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s West-Central’s nearest
text: rigs. Six miles. Someone unloaded
dialog: sleds right here and drove way the
dialog: hell out there, but there’s no
dialog: tracks coming back -- why is that?
dialog: (Cory points at the house) Do those
dialog: assholes look like they’re up for a
dialog: trek ten miles into the snow? In
dialog: what -- that minivan? The answers
dialog: are out there.
text: It’s hard to say whether she doesn’t buy what he’s saying or
text: just dreads going into the mountains. She comes clean.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Look ... I’ve never done this
dialog: before, okay?
text: He nods. Appreciates the honesty.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: It’s all I’ve ever done.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Reluctantly) Okay. Let’s go.
text: Cory gets on, fires it up. Pulls a TWO-WAY RADIO from his
text: coveralls, clips it to the front. Jane climbs on and Cory
text: pulls around to the back of the house.
text: TWO OFFICERS are lining the house with police tape. Ben steps
text: from the house.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What channel you running?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Eleven.
text: Cory tunes his radio to eleven.
dialog: os.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to see you back here by
dialog: nightfall -- gives you three hours
dialog: at best.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I'll radio if we come across
dialog: anything.
text: He guns his sled and they shoot off over the snow.
scene_heading: EXT. WYOMING PLAINS -- LATER.
text: WE ARE FLYING OVER THE SNOW -- ALARMINGLY FAST. Again, Jane
text: finds herself pasted to Cory’s back -- hiding from the snow
text: that pelts every exposed part of her.
text: The forest looms over us. We are climbing now. Trees begin
text: whipping past us. Cory doesn’t slow down.
text: We are moving almost vertically up the mountain -- the engine
text: whines angrily as the snowmobile lurches uphill, digging down
text: into the snow then firing out of it like a rocket.
text: They reach a bench -- a level area that cuts into the
dialog: mountain.
text: Cory stops. Cuts the engine, it is instantly silent.
text: Jane dares to look up and is shocked to find the valley floor
text: a thousand feet below them.
text: Cory steps off -- pulling the stainless steel rifle from its
text: case, and levering a round into the chamber.
text: He speaks softly, aware they are both hunter and hunted out
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CORY
text: The tracks move south from here.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Whispering) What are we doing?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Gonna go it on foot for a bit.
dialog: Not what she wanted to hear.
text: Cory pulls the snowshoes free, tosses a pair to her.
dialog: o4.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Step into ‘em, then ratchet the
dialog: strap down till they’re good and
dialog: tight.
text: She does. His are already on by the time she’s strapped one
text: foot in. She steps into the other.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Follow me.
text: They walk through the soft, deep snow of the mountains.
text: The snowmobile tracks cut west, away from the valley into
text: even deeper timber. They follow.
text: Jane pants heavily -- she is in snow to her waist. It is
dialog: grueling work to take even one step, though you wouldn’t know
text: it from watching Cory, who is pulling away from her.
text: She labors forward, looks up at a clump of Aspens and Pines.
text: Looks back down, unable to see her feet through the snow.
text: When she looks up again, the clump of trees silently comes to
text: life, the trunks melting into one giant mass that is walking
text: toward the clearing.
text: She freezes.
text: IT IS A BULL MOOSE stepping through the snow, making no
text: sound. It stands almost eight feet tall, and it is looking
text: right at her.
text: She feels Cory step quietly beside her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Whispers) What the fuck is that.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: (Quiet) Moose, stay still. He don’t
dialog: want any more trouble than you do.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t want ANY.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Then you two have something in
dialog: common.
dialog: oD.
text: The enormous creature moves across the ‘road’ and the barely
text: visible tracks they follow. It is twenty feet from them, and
text: still makes no sound.
text: It slinks into the trees across the road and is enveloped by
text: the forest -- disappearing as quickly as it appeared.
text: Jane's tries to gasp in a silent breath of much needed air.
text: Cory can’t help but smile.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, yeah ... Come to Florida,
dialog: sport. We have alligators on our
dialog: golf courses.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: No, thank you. I’1l stick to the
dialog: world I know.
text: Cory starts moving off. Jane gathers her strength and
text: follows.
text: CROWS can be heard cawing. The trail opens to a clearing, the
text: snow here is so deep, there is no evidence of any tracks.
text: But at the far end of the clearing, A DOZEN CROWS gather
text: around a DEAD SOMETHING.
text: Cory moves toward it, trudging through the snow. The crows
text: scream their frustration at having their dinner interrupted.
text: As Cory and Jane get closer, they relent and fly to nearby
dialog: branches.
text: They stare at the dead animal -- flesh the color of a peeled
text: apple. They are almost upon it before they realize it is a
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Cory steps closer. Looks at the body, which is stripped
text: naked. The crows have been busy, as have the other animals
text: of the forest, though his face has been mostly spared.
text: He is young and white.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: No. Bet I know who he is though ...
text: Cory nods. Looks around. No snowmobile tracks anywhere. He
text: moves into the forest.
dialog: oo.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Stay here.
text: Cory pushes into the timber. Looks at the ground, where snow
text: is unable to cover as quickly.
text: He scans the harder snow. Spots Something. Moves to it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: A SNOWMOBILE TRACK -- clear enough to see the tread pattern.
text: Cory’s face registers surprise. He follows the track a bit.
text: The thicker timber opens up to another clearing and the track
dialog: disappears.
text: He looks up at the sky -- the sun is fading. Looks back at
dialog: Jane -- no chance she is up for or capable of continuing this
text: into the night. He turns back.
text: Jane looks relieved when he reappears from the forest.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: See anything?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: The tracks don’t lead from the
text: house. They lead to it. Someone
dialog: stripped this boy, left him here
dialog: and drove down to Littlefeather’s
text: house, loaded their sleds on a
text: trailer and headed down the
dialog: highway.
text: Jane has no idea how Cory has put this together, but
text: recognizes the truth of it. She looks down. Ashamed. Has to
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are there tracks we can follow?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: For a bit. They went high where the
text: snow’s deeper. Where the tracks
dialog: would get covered.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I need to get a team up here that
dialog: has experience with this area. With
dialog: crimes like these. This was ...
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: This was well thought out.
text: She looks over at the man, half-eaten and frozen in the snow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- NIGHT.
text: The number of police vehicles has grown. FREMONT COUNTY
scene_heading: SHERIFF’S VEHICLES CAN BE SEEN. NUMEROUS SNOWMOBILES LINED
text: UP, PREPARING TO HEAD OUT.
text: Cory speaks with Ben.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: We went on foot the last half mile,
dialog: but we blazed a decent trail
dialog: through the snow ... I’1l run them
dialog: back up there if you need.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'll talk to the sheriff, he may
dialog: want you to.
text: Jane walks up to them.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
text: The security team at West-Central’s
text: rig site has cameras around their
dialog: perimeter. I’m gonna head over in
dialog: the morning, maybe we'll get lucky
dialog: and they caught something on film.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay. The two we have in custody
dialog: say anything?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: These aren’t the talking kind,
dialog: Jane. These kids -- they expect to
dialog: go to prison. It’s a rite of
dialog: passage. Hell, I think they look
text: forward to it. Three hots, a cot,
dialog: and free cable? Beats being here
dialog: doing nuthing, the way they see it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Let’s run their DNA against the
dialog: semen, see what that tells us.
text: Cory looks over at the police car where Chip still sits.
dialog: os.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Can I talk to him?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Cory, anything they might tell you
dialog: would be inadmissable in court, and
dialog: anything you told us would render
dialog: everything that resulted
dialog: inadmissable as well.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What if I talked to him and didn’t
dialog: tell you what he said. I just knew
dialog: it.
text: Jane's cell phone rings. Answers.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Agent Banner. Yes sir, yes we did.
text: Jane steps away. Cory looks at Ben.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’ve known him since he was three.
text: Ben can’t say yes. Doesn’t want to say no.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I gotta canvas the house. The back
text: doors are only locked from the
dialog: inside ...
text: Ben walks off. Cory looks at the squad car. Goes to it.
scene_heading: INT. BEN’S POLICE VEHICLE -- NIGHT.
text: Chip sits, shivering. Looks exhausted. Coming down, maybe.
text: Maybe just tired from crying. Cory opens the door, sits
text: beside him -- leaves one foot outside so he doesn’t lock
text: himself in the car.
text: Chip looks at him, assumes the hard stare of a criminal.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Look at us.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: Look at you. I didn’t do shit.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: All you been doing is shit for
dialog: three years.
dialog: oy.
text: Beat. Chip softens.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: «+. It’s this place. Look what it
dialog: makes you do. What it takes from
dialog: us. What it took from you.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’m not going to sit here and say
dialog: life’s been fair. To either of us.
dialog: This land is all we got left.
dialog: Barely four thousand of us still
dialog: breathing --
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: What are you -- a fucking quarter
dialog: Arapaho? Only thing Indian about
dialog: you is your ex-wife and a daughter
dialog: you couldn't protect. Maybe if
dialog: you'd played detective then --
text: Cory slams his head into the front divider before he can
dialog: finish the sentence.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You gonna lecture me about
dialog: protecting our people? Hmm? While
dialog: you deal the shit that’s killing
dialog: ‘em? You know what you are --
dialog: you're just a ‘hang-around-the-
dialog: fort’ prairie nigger begging for
dialog: smallpox blankets you can sell to
dialog: your friends. That’s what you sell,
dialog: chief -- the smallpox of your
dialog: generation. You had every chance to
dialog: get out if that’s what you wanted.
dialog: Army. College. It was your choice.
dialog: And look what you chose.
text: Cory swings open the car door. Gets out.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: (Small) I met him. Wanted to fight
dialog: his ass. But he just took
dialog: everything I said. Not like a
dialog: coward. Like a man ... She loved
dialog: him ... He works security on a
dialog: drill site ... One of those guards,
dialog: that’s where the smallpox comes
dialog: from.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What’s the boyfriend’s name?
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: Matt something ...
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: He the smallpox dealer too?
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: I doubt it. I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Who does?
text: Chip looks up at him.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: Sam knew. Why don’t you ask him?
text: Cory looks at the criminal that used to be a boy he knew
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You'll be talking to Sam long
dialog: before I do, Chip. Of that I’m
dialog: sure.
speaker_heading: CHIP
dialog: You think this is who I wanted to
dialog: be? I just ... I get so mad, I want
dialog: to fight the whole world. You know
dialog: what that feels like?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I do. I decided to fight the
dialog: feeling instead. Know why?
text: Cory leans back into the car.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Because I knew the world would win.
text: Cory closes the door. Sees Ben and Jane talking. They look at
text: him as he approaches.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What did I tell you -- Did he say
dialog: anything -- never mind, don’t tell
dialog: us. What did he say?
text: Cory’s eyes are steel.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You're going out to the rigs
dialog: tomorrow morning?
text: Cory looks at Jane as he leans into Ben. Whispers --
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Natalie’s boyfriend worked there.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What? Don’t tell me -- Fuck.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hmm ... This thing is solving
dialog: itself. We’ll pick him up in the
dialog: morning and see what he’s got to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: We're picking him up now. From
dialog: three feet of snow --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Chip said that?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I say that.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But you don’t know it. I want you
dialog: with us tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You don’t catch a wolf searching
dialog: where he might be ...
text: Cory looks out over the snowmobile tracks leading through the
text: snow. Shadows fill their slight indentations, and point
text: toward the mountains like an arrow.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: You search where he’s been ... and
dialog: he’s been here.
scene_heading: EXT. WILMA LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT.
text: Cory stands at the door, his breath frosting in front of him.
text: Knocks softly. Knows she’ll never hear that, tries a little
dialog: louder.
text: A light comes on. The door opens. Wilma stands there in a
text: robe. For an instant, she seems worried about how she must
text: look, then remembers issues far more grave surround them.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I been better.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Brings everything back, doesn’t it.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yeah.
text: She shakes her head.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: You and Ben and this little FBI
dialog: girl formed your own posse to go
dialog: solve it all, I hear.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I’m just trying to help.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: You won’t get the answers you’re
dialog: looking for. No matter what you

speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: This isn’t about Em --
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Don’t you say her name.
text: Her venom brings out his.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I didn’t kill her, Wilma.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: Yes you did. We both did ... We
dialog: looked away. We let our guard down,
dialog: and this place snatched her from
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: WILMA (CONT'D)
dialog: We have one chance left at this,
dialog: and I for one will not rest a
text: second until he is grown and living
dialog: very far from here. Where it’s
dialog: never cold and your baby doesn’t--
text: She fights it back. Calms herself.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILMA (CONT'D)
dialog: If doing this gives you some sort
dialog: of closure, I’m happy for you.
dialog: Closure for me will be Casey
text: married and happy with a family of
dialog: his own.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Then what.
speaker_heading: WILMA
dialog: «+. Good night, Cory.
text: She closes the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT.

text: His fingerprints are in the
dialog: database -- he was enrolled at the
dialog: Police Academy in Rock Springs.
dialog: Supposed to begin in April. Worked
dialog: as a security officer for a drill
dialog: station out here.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You wanna come in?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Come on.
text: He turns and walks to the house. She shuts down the SUV and
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- A MOMENT LATER.
text: Jane looks around the living room. Spots reloading equipment
text: on the dining room table. The silver-colored rifle lays on a
text: towel placed over the coffee table -- stretched out like a
dialog: snake.
text: Her hand goes to her sidearm, checking that it’s still there.
text: She sees numerous photos of Casey, and the mini-shrine on the
text: mantle. Looks at the girl’s picture.
speaker_heading: CORY (0.S.)
dialog: I got milk, coffee, and tap water.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Tap water’s fine. Thanks.
text: She steps closer to the photo.
speaker_heading: CORY (0.S.)
dialog: That’s my daughter.
text: She turns, caught.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: She passed on three years ago.
text: She figured as much, buts feigns surprise anyway.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You wanna ask how, don’t you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I do ... But I won’t.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I was working as an outfitter out
dialog: of Pinedale. There was a big snow,
dialog: and I found myself with a night
dialog: off, so I grabbed a motel room and
dialog: told my wife to come up.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just her -- You get precious little
dialog: romance with two kids and a job
dialog: that keeps you in the mountains
dialog: half the year ... Emily was
dialog: sixteen. Casey was five. You could
dialog: trust her ... She was a good girl.
dialog: We lived out on the Rez not far
dialog: from her parents ... Should’ve made
dialog: ‘em stay with Wilma’s folks ... I
dialog: guess word got out that we were out
dialog: of town and some school friends
text: came over. Then more came over.
text: He looks up at Emily’s photo on the mantle.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Then some people came that weren’t
dialog: her friends. Get together turned
dialog: into quite a party, and then, I
dialog: don’t know ...
text: He looks around like he might sit -- might need something to
text: lean on to continue. Decides to tell it where he stands.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: A lot I don’t want to know ... It
dialog: was Natalie that called us the next
dialog: day. Told us Emily was missing.
dialog: They were best friends, so...
text: Natalie was worried. She had a
dialog: right to be ...
text: Can’t go any further on his feet. He sits on the couch. Jane
text: doesn’t move an inch.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: You try to be so careful, try to
dialog: plan for everything. Emily was such
dialog: a good girl, we just ... let our
dialog: guard down ... You’ll have kids
dialog: some day, and let me tell you,
dialog: Jane: you can’t blink. For eighteen-
dialog: years. Not once ...
text: Cory swallows the pain. Looks up at his daughter on the
text: mantle. Then to his feet.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
text: Some guy was moving his sheep near
dialog: Wind River. He’s the one who found
dialog: her ... Twenty something miles from
dialog: our house. How she got there? What
dialog: happened -- I don’t know.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Couldn’t find out much from the
dialog: autopsy cuz the (he sucks in a
dialog: pained breath) Coyotes had been at
dialog: her pretty good.
text: He looks right at her.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: And I've been killing those sons of
dialog: bitches ever since.
text: Jane tries to find something to say -- anything -- but
text: there’s nothing. All she can think to utter is:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Can you point me toward your --
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Yeah, right down the hall.
text: She walks down the hall to the bathroom. Closes herself in.
text: Stares at herself in the mirror -- not a decade older than
text: Natalie was, than Emily would be. Splashes water on her face.
text: Leans against the counter, relishing a moment without
text: tension, terror, or heartache. Steels herself and opens the
dialog: door.
text: She walks out and notices a poem, framed and hanging on the
text: wall. She reads the heading -- A MEADOW IN MY PERFECT WORLD.
text: She reads the poem.
text: Cory walks up, leans beside her.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: She got accepted to a summer
dialog: program for creative writing at
dialog: Colorado State. That’s what got her
dialog: in.
text: Jane looks at him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: She wrote this to you?
text: And for the first time, there is a crack in the steel.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I don’t know who she wrote it to.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: I like to think it was me.
text: He disappears into the living room. She follows. Stands
text: before him.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t know what the Hanson boy
dialog: told you, but I don’t want to
dialog: stumble into something like today
dialog: if I can help it. If he told you
dialog: something I need to know ...
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: He told me one of those guards
dialog: sells ‘em meth. Which one? I don’t
dialog: know. Also told me her boyfriend
dialog: worked security for West-Central.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: You could've called for that.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I wanted to know why you’re helping
dialog: me. What your motivation was.
dialog: (Gentle) Now I do.
text: Cory smiles.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Didn’t trust me.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Didn’t trust how good you are at
dialog: it.
text: She works her way to the door.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it possible to not drive the
dialog: snowmobiles eighty-miles an hour
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Sure, if you don’t mind landing in
dialog: a ditch you could've sailed over.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: «+. Great.
text: She offers him a smile and leaves. Cory returns to the task
text: of making rifle rounds. Places one of the giant bullets on an
scene_heading: ELECTRONIC SCALE. The reading says: 544 GRAINS.
text: He takes a FILE, expertly shaves the bullet down. Places it
text: back on the scale: 540 GRAINS. Perfect.
text: He seats it in the machine, pulls the lever, driving the
text: bullet into the casing. He holds up the round. Studies it ...
text: This bullet has a home, and Cory is close to finding it.
scene_heading: EXT. FREMONT COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION -- MORNING.
text: Cory pulls into the parking lot, snowmobile in tow. Two
text: TRIBAL POLICE VEHICLES are parked by Jane’s SUV and a
text: SHERIFF'S PICK UP TRUCK, two SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES leaning
text: beside it. ALL HOOKED TO TRAILERS CARRYING SNOWMOBILES.
text: Jane, Ben, two BIA POLICE, and two SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES -- CARL
text: and EVAN, stand in a circle bouncing in place, fighting off
text: the cold, their breath rising from their mouths like smoke.
text: Cory steps out. Walks to them.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It’s a cold one today.
text: Cory barely notices.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Below zero, I bet.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Six below. (Points to the
dialog: mountains) Colder out there.
text: Cory studies him.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You're shaking worse than her.
text: Looking at Jane, that’s debatable. Evan walks up to Cory.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: What are you doing here, bud?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: In case you wander off, I’m here to
dialog: track you down.
text: Evan laughs.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We heard from a reliable source one
dialog: of West-Central’s security officers
dialog: may be supplying meth on the Rez,
dialog: we don’t know which one --
speaker_heading: CARL
text: The nervous one.
text: They all chuckle.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Eyes peeled is the point. Everyone
dialog: ready?
text: They move to their cars. Jane looks at Cory.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: If you find anything, radio us.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I will. You do the same.
text: She offers him a smile. It isn’t returned -- he is a hunter
dialog: today, no room for anything else...
text: Everyone moves to their vehicles as the sun crests the
text: mountains, kissing the land that surrounds them.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 789 -- DAY.
text: The procession moves down the empty highway.
text: WE MOVE ABOVE THEM -- PULLING AWAY. The land is white in
dialog: every direction.
text: WE PULL HIGHER, UNTIL THE MOUNTAINS COME INTO VIEW, THE CARS
text: MERE SPECS BELOW US.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE --—
text: Sitting low beside the highway, frostbitten sagebrush blowing
text: in and out of view -- we hear the vehicles approaching.
text: Rubber attacking road. Whining. Humming. Louder. Nothing ever
dialog: sounded less natural ...
text: The vehicles race past us in a blur, snow swirling in their
dialog: wake.
dialog: ou.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY -- CONT.
dialog: Cory pulls
dialog: surrounded
dialog: snowmobile
dialog: highway.
text: He puts on
dialog: road fades
text: over in front of Sam Littlefeather’s place, now
text: in YELLOW POLICE TAPE. He begins unstrapping his
text: as the other vehicles push farther down the
text: his white camo as the whine of rubber on frozen
text: into the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY 789 -- DAY.
text: WE PULL OVER. STOP. EVERYONE GETS OUT.
dialog: In the dis
dialog: miles away
dialog: Snowmobile
dialog: are starte

dialog: She climbs
dialog: He rises oj

text: tance, DRILL RIGS and TRAILERS can be seen. Though
text: , they stand out like blisters in this white world.

text: d. Ben fires his snowmobile, looks back at Jane.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Get on.
text: at him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Getting really tired of these
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, come on. You’re a Florida girl,
dialog: right? Just like those jet-skis,
dialog: ain't it?
text: on behind him.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: If there was an easier way to
dialog: travel snow, we'd be doing it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Let’s get it over with. (Looks at
dialog: her bare hands) Shit. Forgot to
dialog: bring gloves ... You mind?
text: ut of the seat. She places her hands down and he
dialog: em. Smiles.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: See? All sorts of perks to this
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: OL.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: «+. Yeah.
text: She tries not to, but can’t help smiling either.
text: All six snowmobiles take off toward the rigs, blowing smoke
text: and spitting snow.
scene_heading: EXT. -- WEST-CENTRAL DRILL STATION, TWENTY-TWO -- DAY.
text: A DOZEN DRILLS rise from the earth. ENORMOUS GALVANIZED
text: PIPING undulates above and below the snow, like a steel
dialog: serpent.
text: TELEPHONE POLES have been sunk every thirty feet. WIRES criss-
text: cross from them. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted to each.
text: Four MOBILE HOMES are lined one after the other away from us.
text: TWO GIANT, CYLINDER TANKS sit to our left. Beyond them is a
text: larger Mobile Structure -- all wires lead here.
text: A MAN ON A SNOWMOBILE APPROACHES US. As he gets closer, we
text: can see he wears a NAVY PARKA WITH A BADGE ON THE RIGHT CHEST
speaker_heading: POCKET.
text: He stops. His name is CURTIS. 40’s, burly but clean cut,
text: professional and very friendly. He has a large bruise on his
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Good morning. Can I help you?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Matt Rayburn work here?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah, do you know where he is?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: ... Bout to ask you the same
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: He had a fight with his girlfriend
dialog: a few days ago, she ran off and he
dialog: went after her. We haven’t seen him
dialog: since.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: When was that?
speaker_heading: OL.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Three days ago. Heck, we didn’t
dialog: know what to do -- waiting to hear
dialog: back from corporate about whether
dialog: to write up his termination papers
dialog: or call you guys.
text: Jane and Ben look at Curtis who seems genuinely concerned.
text: Another snowmobile pulls up carrying another security
text: officer. He steps up -- we can’t help but notice the
text: scratches that run down his face.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: They’re here about Matt --
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: You find him -- is he okay?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What happened to you guys?
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Pretty torn up.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: Hit a pine branch doing sixty and
dialog: see what happens to you.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: We run the property line twice
dialog: daily. Comes with the territory.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You should try a face shield.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Oh, I requested helmets. My
dialog: supervisor said, “But snow’s soft,
dialog: ain't it?” Corporate’s in Texas,
dialog: what can I tell you.
text: Everyone has a chuckle at that.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Matt bunked here on the property?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yep, we all do.
dialog: OS.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Can we see where he stayed?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: Sure. (Stepping off his snowmobile)
dialog: I’1l1 walk you up.
text: Jane looks over the two security guards -- well dressed, web
text: belts with pistols, flashlights, hand cuffs. And beat to
dialog: shit.
text: They seem professional and courteous. She strains to pick out
dialog: the bad apple.
text: TWO MORE SECURITY OFFICERS WALK UP THROUGH THE SNOW.
text: She looks them over as well, all of their faces torn and
dialog: bruised.
text: The entire group begins moving off toward the trailers ...
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS -- DAY.
text: Cory works his snowmobile through terrain not meant for
text: machines -- he takes it almost vertically up the side of a
text: mountain. We move past the area where Matt’s body was found,
text: surrounded by POLICE TAPE. He drives past, looks for tracks.
dialog: There are none.
text: Continues east, over white powder. Judging from the snow, he
dialog: is the first living thing to traverse this land since the
dialog: storm.
text: Then he stops. Looks down --
scene_heading: LION TRACKS.
text: HE SHUTS DOWN THE ENGINE. STEPS OFF.
text: He pulls his silver-colored bear killer from its case and
text: follows the tracks around a bend.
text: He walks across what looks to be an endless plain of white
text: surrounded by dark pines tasked with containing it.
text: He comes to a rock outcropping that creates something rarely
text: viewed during winter in Wyoming -- an area with no snow.
text: THE CARCASS OF A DEER, almost completely devoured, lays in
text: front of it. He raises his rifle, moves toward the shallow
dialog: cave.
dialog: o4.
text: He stops. Listens. Hears shallow breathing. Cocks the hammer,
text: steps closer.
text: Stares at the black hole nature cut into the side of the
text: mountain. Pulls a flashlight from his pocket, points it
dialog: toward the cavern --
text: THREE SETS OF RED EYES STARE BACK.
text: He lowers the light a bit -- A MOUNTAIN LION AND HER TWO CUBS
scene_heading: STARE BACK.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: This is the end of the road for
dialog: you.
text: He presses his face to the stock. Notices something ...
text: MUD, SPRAYED ALONG THE CAVERN WALL.
text: He steps closer, rifle still at the ready. Looks at the mud
text: spray, then looks down.
text: He walks toward the cavern. The big cat curls her back as
text: Cory kneels down, not ten feet from her. We follow his eyes
dialog: to:
text: A SNOWMOBILE TRACK CUT INTO THE MUD.
text: He stands up, looks out from the track and sees a slight
text: indentation in the snow, leading down the mountain. He
text: follows it.
text: Cory walks to a clearing, pulls his BINOCULARS to his face.
scene_heading: THROUGH BINOCULARS WE SEE:
text: Tracks, barely visible, leading down the mountain to the open
text: plains. Toward a large, DRILL RIG STATION. He glasses the
dialog: station --
text: Jane, Ben, and the officers walking alongside the security
dialog: guards.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no.
text: Cory shakes his head -- knows what they don’t, turns back.
text: Finds himself in front of the lion hole. Looks in and talks,
dialog: loud.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're one lucky bitch it’s today I
dialog: find you.
dialog: oD.
text: The lion responds with a panicked hiss, her kits huddled
text: beside her. Cory turns and pushes down the hill through the
dialog: snow.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST-CENTRAL DRILL STATION -- CONT.
text: Jane, Ben, and the officers trudge through the snow with
text: Curtis beside them.
text: We notice that the other security officers have lagged back,
text: and are now walking behind them.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: So, did something happen? Do you
dialog: know where he is?
text: Jane studies him. As genuine as he seems, she doesn’t want to
text: play her cards, not yet.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That's what we’re trying to find
text: out. His girlfriend filed a missing
dialog: person’s report.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: How can that be, I thought you guys
text: found her in a snowdrift right
dialog: before the storm.
text: She turns to stone.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I heard it go out over the radio
dialog: when you guys found her.
text: Jane stares at him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t remember her name being
text: used over the radio.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Then maybe you weren’t listening --
speaker_heading: EVAN (0.S.)
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?
text: Jane turns to find Evan with his hand on his pistol.
dialog: oo.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Why are you flanking me?
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: What are you talking about --
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Fuck do you think I’m talking about
dialog: -- you got us on three sides,
dialog: dickhead.
dialog: And so they do -- the security team has effectively
text: surrounded the police.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Get your hand off that weapon, this
dialog: is private property --
text: Evan unsnaps his holster and pulls his pistol free.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER (CONT’D)
text: WHOA!! EASY MAN.
text: Evan trains his weapon on the security guard as EVERYONE'S
text: hand goes to their weapon ...
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER (CONT’D)
text: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? PUT IT DOWN.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Evan.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Turn away from me and drop to your
dialog: knees!
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Fuck you, this is a BIA lease on
dialog: reservation land, asshole -- you’re
dialog: breaking the law by being here --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: This is leased land on a
dialog: reservation -- you have no
dialog: authority, deputy--
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: You think I don’t know what you’re
dialog: doing?
text: Curtis steps back, hand on his pistol. One of the security
text: guards holds a MOSSBERG 590 SHOTGUN tucked to his shoulder,
text: barrel inching up from the snow toward the officers.
text: Emotion is overtaking reason.
text: A security guard stands mere feet from a BIA officer, both of
text: their hands gripping pistols.
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 2
text: FUCKING DO IT ASSHOLE, PULL YOUR
scene_heading: WEAPON AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS --
speaker_heading: BIA OFFICER
scene_heading: HOKA HEY WHITE BOY, LET’S GO —-—
text: Jane locks eyes with Curtis, who grips his pistol as well.
text: Her hand moves to her waistband. A SECURITY GUARD unsnaps
text: his holster ...
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: DEPUTY -- You have no authority,
dialog: you are in violation of Federal
dialog: law, lower your weapon --
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: FUCK YOU! YOU’RE PUTTING US INA
speaker_heading: CROSSFIRE --
dialog: Ben, the tribal officers -- hell, all of them -- have their
text: hands on their weapons, stepping back, seeking a clear
text: shooting lane.
text: Evan points his pistol wildly from one security guard to the
text: next -- the security guard with the shotgun points it at
text: Evan, then calls to Curtis for guidance --
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: What do I do??
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hold your ground!! County Sheriffs
dialog: have no authority here, tell him to
dialog: holster his weapon --
text: Jane realizes this misunderstanding is seconds from disaster.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Too small to be heard) I'ma
dialog: federal officer --
dialog: Oo.
text: The men scream and dance in place, hands on their weapons --
text: it’s a mad ballet of aggression and confusion.
speaker_heading: BEN
scene_heading: OKAY EVERYBODY EASY -—
text: Jane draws in a deep breath, then explodes above the chaos.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: FBI!!!! THIS IS FEDERAL LAND AND I
scene_heading: AM THE AUTHORITY HERE. RIGHT NOW,
text: ALL OF YOU. STAND DOWN.
text: Everyone stands with their feet planted wide in the snow,
text: hands on their weapons -- it’s minus twelve-degrees and they
text: are sweating through their coats.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
scene_heading: OKAY. EVERYONE. Slow down. We’re
dialog: all working toward the same goal
dialog: ... Everyone back down and move
dialog: your hands from your weapons ...
dialog: Slowly. Look --
text: Jane demonstrates, removing her hand from her pistol and
text: holding it up.
text: Like molasses, basing their speed off the speed of the man
text: across from them, all hands move away from weapons.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Keep these assholes in check. We’re
dialog: just doing our job, lady --
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: When we show up your job’s over
dialog: asshole --
speaker_heading: BEN
speaker_heading: EVAN.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Every one of you step to your left--
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: No one behind us, you understand?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You got it. (To his men) Guys, step
dialog: my way.
text: The security guards all move left, even with the police.
dialog: oy.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, let’s all just take a deep
dialog: breath.
text: Jane looks back at Evan, still swinging his pistol between
dialog: targets.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Evan ... Deputy. Holster your
dialog: weapon.
text: Evan looks at her, amazed.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: You didn’t see it??
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Right now, or you’re under arrest,
dialog: you understand me?
text: Evan looks over the men as he lowers his pistol.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (Defeated) You didn’t see it.
text: Jane looks over the officers. The security detail. Knows
text: someone must take control before they all kill each other.
text: She turns on Curtis, and makes an even bigger show of laying
text: into him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Make no mistake who’s running
dialog: things here. I don’t give a shit
dialog: what billionaire owns this dump --
dialog: I am the biggest dog on the porch
dialog: and when I say jump, you don’t ask
dialog: how high -- you just start fucking
dialog: hopping. You got me?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yes ma’am.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Take us to Matt’s trailer. Now.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Okay.
text: He starts walking. The whole tense lot of them follow.
dialog: yu.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINS NEAR DRILL STATION TWENTY-TWO -- DAY.
text: Cory has dropped down from the mountains. Stops his
text: snowmobile. Looks through binoculars at the camp. Sees the
text: tension-filled mass ambling toward the last trailer in the
dialog: camp.
text: Cory pulls his two-way radio from his coat.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: (Into the radio) Ben ... Ben, you
dialog: copy?
text: He’s a little more than a mile away. He takes the rifle from
text: his shoulder and steps off the snowmobile. Begins racing
dialog: toward the camp ...
scene_heading: EXT. MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT.
text: Everyone stops before the trailer. No one trusting anyone.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: This is his trailer.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did he bunk with anybody?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah ... Me and Pete Mickens.
text: Cory’s voice filters through Ben’s radio. He steps away as he
text: speaks into it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Is Pete in there now?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: He’s sleeping. He has night shift.
dialog: Beat.
text: Jane steps up on the aluminum steps that rise to the door.
text: She knocks, then steps down.
scene_heading: INT. MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT.
text: WE ARE IN THE TRAILER’S BATHROOM. STEAM FROM THE SHOWER HAS
text: CLOUDED THE MIRROR.
text: We hear knocking. Push open the bathroom door. We move
text: through the trailer, through the kitchen, and toward the
text: front door. A HAND REACHES FOR THE DOOR LATCH. TURNS IT.
dialog: yae
text: The hand pulls it open ...
text: WE ARE IN A FLASHBACK --
text: We look out and see, standing outside the trailer: NATALIE
text: HANSON, DRESSED IN WHITE SWEAT PANTS AND A BABY-BLUE COAT.
text: Her beautiful face smiles back at us.
scene_heading: FROM HER POV WE SEE --
text: Matt Rayburn, 26, handsome, wearing only a towel.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Yes, I’m looking for my knight in
dialog: shining armor. I believe this is
dialog: his trailer.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m a bit short on armor at the
dialog: moment.
text: She snaps her feet out of a pair of SNOWSHOES, climbs up the
text: stairs, and wraps her arms around him.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: I don’t mind.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I didn’t hear your carriage
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Yes, well ... My carriage wanted to
dialog: catch the eight o’clock show in
dialog: Lander, so she dropped me off at
dialog: the turn-out.
text: He drops out of character for a moment.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You walked that far in the snow?
text: She leans into him.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: You're worth it.
speaker_heading: yLe
text: He kisses her. Pulls her inside and slams the door closed.
scene_heading: INT. MATT’S TRAILER -- BEDROOM -- LATER.
text: Matt traces his finger over her breasts. She stares up at him
text: as if nothing else on earth exists.
text: His hand slips out of frame. She cranes her head back --
text: loves the way he touches her. She closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (Soft) No. Look at me.
text: She does. He rolls on top of her. She fights to keep her eyes
text: open as he enters her.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Tell me how you’ll take me away
dialog: from here ...
text: He gently thrusts into her. She moans.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: A little house ... a little porch
dialog: where we sit ...
text: He moves back, then pushes gently into her again.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: I tell you about my day and you
dialog: tell me what I forgot to buy at the
dialog: store --
text: She laughs. Which makes her contract, which makes her moan.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: And you love me, still.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I do.
text: WE PUSH IN CLOSER. CLOSER.
text: Their bodies become one -- he gently moves inside her, and
text: the pleasure of it -- the love that drives it, pushes a tear
text: from her eye. We follow it down her cheek and watch it creep
text: behind her.
scene_heading: INT. MATT’S TRAILER -- BEDROOM -- LATER.
text: Natalie rests her head on his chest. They stare at the
dialog: ceiling.
dialog: ys.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Two more months of this place ...
text: (He looks at her), four months at
dialog: the Academy ...
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Then Cheyenne.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Then Cheyenne.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Six months is so long ...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It’'ll go by in no time.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Time's like everything else on the
dialog: Rez in winter ... Frozen. It’1l be
dialog: an eternity.
text: She lays her head against him.
speaker_heading: NATALIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t forget me, when you’re there,
dialog: please?
text: His hand finds her cheek.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Natalie ... That’s silly.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: No ... That’s what happens once
dialog: people make it out of here. They
dialog: don’t ever look back.
text: We hear the sound of SNOWMOBILES. They pull close. We hear
text: DRUNKEN LAUGHTER. Lonely men violating the night with their
dialog: noise.
text: Matt’s face clouds.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: Shit. The vultures have returned.
dialog: Put something on, babe.
dialog: ya.
text: She hears the sounds of drunken men outside the trailer. She
text: stands, naked, and steps into her sweat pants. Grabs her
text: coat. Puts it over her naked torso.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Where's my shirt?
text: We hear the TRAILER DOOR FLY OPEN.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (Whispers) Just get back in bed,
dialog: they’re gonna bust in here, you
dialog: know it.
text: She climbs back in bed. They listen to the drunk men stumble
text: through the trailer, laughing.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Smells like sex in here!
text: We hear stumbling toward the canvas door -- fashioned like an
dialog: accordion -- that separates them from the rest of the
dialog: trailer.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Guys ... Come on. Leave us alone,
dialog: okay?
text: The accordion door is thrown open. PETE MICKENS, 30'S,
text: skinny, dark eyes, stares drunkenly at them. Behind him we
speaker_heading: see CURTIS.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What’re you two doing?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Come on.
text: Pete stumbles in and sits on the edge of the bed. Bloodshot
text: eyes. Big smile. Looks at Natalie.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hello there.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: .-. Hi, Pete.
text: He looks at her form under the sheet.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wonder what you got on under those
dialog: sheets.
text: The trailer door opens. We hear more men enter.
dialog: yo.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
text: A fluffy, down coat. Not very sexy.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Fluffy sounds good to me.
text: Matt sits up. Pete looks at his bare torso.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Pete. Come on. Go to your room.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You naked, Matt? What have you guys
dialog: been doing?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Get out of here!!!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Whooooo ...
text: Curtis laughs. We see shadows move behind him. TWO MORE MEN
speaker_heading: PEER IN.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Well, well, well. What have we
dialog: here?
text: Natalie is starting to get nervous. Matt is starting to get
dialog: pissed.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Come on. Let me have a little peak.
text: He moves to lift the sheet and Matt slaps his hand. Pete does
text: it again and Matt slaps it again.
text: To Pete, this is rapidly becoming a game. He holds up his
text: hands, gesturing surrender, then yanks the sheet hard,
text: pulling it down below Natalie’s waist.
text: We see flashes of her skin.
text: Matt reaches over and grabs at the sheet as Natalie rolls
text: away from Pete, pulling the coat closed.
text: Her ass hangs half-out of her sweats. The gawking men see it
text: before Matt wins control of the sheet.
text: The look on the men’s faces turns from humor to hunger in an
dialog: instant.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
text: STOP IT! PLEASE.
dialog: yo.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don’t bullshit me girl, you’re
dialog: sticking your little ass out like a
dialog: flag --
text: Matt’s fist slams into his chin, knocking him backwards.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Get the fuck out.
text: Curtis laughs. Pete doesn’t.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Pete, let’s go. He doesn’t want to
dialog: share.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, I can see that ...
text: We look into Pete’s cold eyes.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: But sharing is what friends do --
text: Pete launches himself over Natalie and punches Matt in the
text: face. Doesn’t stop with one. A fight breaks out on the bed --
text: right on top of Natalie -- who screams and struggles to get
dialog: free.
text: Pete has the leverage, punching furiously. Natalie grabs Pete
text: by his hair and pulls back. Hard.
text: Curtis and the others cheer and laugh.
text: Matt slams his fist into Pete’s jaw with such force he knocks
text: both Pete and Natalie off the bed.
text: Natalie’s coat flies open -- exposing her breasts to the men
text: that loom over her.
text: Matt rises and punches, wild. Rocks Curtis with a shot, who
text: yells and hits back.
text: It is quickly escalating to a point of no return.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hey!!!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why didn’t you stop him --
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Pete’s just fucking around --
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: You're acting like a pussy over
dialog: this prairie nigger --
text: And that’s all the insult Natalie can take, she punches and
text: scratches furiously at the security guard.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: FUCK YOU!!!
text: Curtis shoves her back -- his hands touching bare skin. Grabs
text: her breasts as she rakes him with her nails. Pete, still on
text: the ground, reaches up and pulls her sweats to her ankles,
text: yanking her to the ground.
text: Matt kicks Pete in the jaw, knocking him unconscious. He
text: throws a punch over Natalie, hitting Curtis in the face --
text: the other two security guards race in, beating Matt with
text: their flashlights.
text: They punch and kick and pound -- in a drunken, feral, orgy of
dialog: no reason.
text: WE DROP DOWN TO NATALIE -- FEET STOMPING HER, OVER HER, ALL
text: AROUND HER, AS SHE STRUGGLES TO STAND.
text: We hear METAL MEETING BONE. Matt falls down to our eye level,
text: an enormous gash in his forehead. Eyes look at her, but no
text: recognition in them.
text: Natalie screams, tries to fight through this forest of men’s
text: legs-- she looks up and sees Curtis’s flashlight slamming
text: down toward her.
text: The world goes dark.
text: Like a SLOW STROBE, images pulse through the black --
text: WE COME TO FOR A MOMENT, look up. See the ceiling of the
dialog: trailer.
text: The world goes dark, then pulses into --
text: PETE’S BONY ASS moves back and forth, thrusting. Tan legs on
text: either side of him, spread wide.
text: The world goes dark, then pulses into --
text: CHEAP CARPET. So close, we can follow the weave of the
dialog: thread.
text: The world goes dark, then pulses into ...
text: NATALIE’S FACE, PRESSED INTO THE CARPET.
dialog: Yo.
text: Curtis’s face lowers into frame -- ecstasy etched across it.
text: CURTIS IS RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.
text: In a daze, Natalie rolls over. Looks up. Matt blasts past us -
text: - slamming Curtis into the wall, shaking the entire trailer
dialog: with the impact.
scene_heading: MEN LEAP OVER US.
text: Natalie crawls out of the room, pulling her sweatpants up as
dialog: she goes.
text: She crawls through the kitchen area -- chaos leaking from the
text: room behind her. She finds her feet. Uses them.
text: She stumbles toward the door, dizzy. Struggles to zip her
text: coat -- looks back to the bedroom and the men that tear her
text: love apart. She moves toward the trailer door, reaches for
dialog: the handle ...
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT --—
scene_heading: EXT. MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- DAY.
text: Jane climbs up the steps and knocks again.
speaker_heading: JANE
scene_heading: FBI. OPEN UP.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Curtis) You sure someone’s in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: PETE. IT’S CURTIS. FBI IS STANDING
text: IN FRONT OF THE DOOR. OPEN UP.
speaker_heading: BEN (0.S.)
dialog: JANE! !
text: She turns and sees Ben running toward her.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: STEP AWAY FROM THE --
text: A SHOTGUN BLASTS through the door -- blowing Jane off the
dialog: steps.
text: BEN FIRES HIS PISTOL AT THE DOOR AS HE RUNS TOWARD HER.
dialog: yy.
text: At once, everyone pulls pistols and fires into each other --
text: from ten feet away.
text: Pete swings the trailer door open, pumping shells through the
text: shotgun -- spraying the police officers. Ben fires rounds
text: into his chest, knocking him back.
text: Deputies fall, security guards fall -- at ten feet apart, no
dialog: one is spared.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON --
text: Jane, on her back -- desperate to draw a breath. She emits an
text: airless moan, then frantically attempts to suck in air.
text: Buckshot has torn into her neck and face, and blown her coat
text: and vest to shreds.
text: Blood covers her neck like a bib ...
text: TIME SLOWS ...
text: So desperate to breathe, her body convulses -- pulling her
text: upward like a sit-up, then blasts her back into the snow --
text: forcing air into her lungs.
text: She blinks. Feels her senses returning. Looks at Ben, firing
text: rounds above her. Shell casings rain down on her. She watches
text: bullets SLAM INTO BEN’S BULLET PROOF VEST -- thrusting him
text: out of frame.
text: She breathes in again -- sucking in strength-- and adrenaline
text: overtakes her.
text: She turns on her side, firing into a man’s legs. He screams
text: and falls. He looks directly at her and she sends a round
text: into his forehead, rolling him over, dead.
scene_heading: -- A AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE POPS OUT THE TRAILER’S KITCHEN
text: WINDOW, spraying rounds on the police -- They rip through Ben
text: and pound Jane in her shoulder and through her vest.
text: The rounds tear through the officers, cutting them to the
text: ground. The fight is over as quickly as it started.
text: Men lay writhing on the ground. Of the dozen men in the
text: fight, only Curtis still stands.
text: A SECURITY OFFICER pulls himself from the snow, blood pulsing
text: from numerous wounds. He looks over the bodies of the
text: officers. Sees Evan, whose legs have been tattered. Evan
text: struggles to rise, even though his legs were almost amputated
text: by the rounds that cut through him.
speaker_heading: LUU.
text: The security guard stumbles toward Evan, who raises his
text: pistol at the man who now stands over him.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Let's go --
text: THEY BOTH FIRE, sending round after round into each other.
text: A bullet finds Evan’s head, unplugging him.
text: The security officer falls back, then sits in the snow in a
text: bloody daze. Right next to the man he just killed. He places
text: a hand on Evan’s dead chest and pats him with an absent
dialog: affection.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: PETE???
text: Jane looks up at the blue sky. So tired .... She looks across
text: the snow -- it is painted red.
text: She looks to her right -- Ben’s lifeless eyes stare back.
text: Beyond him, all the men she came with. Dead.
text: She hears movement. Talking.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 2 (0.S.)
dialog: I’m hit.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (0.S.)
dialog: Who isn’t? (Yells to the trailer)
dialog: Pete -- you good?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: PETE, drawing in large gulps of air, bullets have torn
text: through his shirt and flattened against his Kevlar vest.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're good. How many we got down?
speaker_heading: CURTIS (0.S.)
text: Two that won’t get up.
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 2
dialog: No ... I’m getting up.
text: But he makes no attempt to do so.
dialog: Lule
text: Curtis walks to a BIA OFFICER who struggles to turn over.
text: When he does, it’s only to see Curtis fire a round into his
dialog: forehead.
text: Curtis turns. Sees Jane looking at him. Starts walking toward
text: her. She breathes heavy -- here it comes.
text: She tries to raise her pistol. His foot prevents her.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: My God, the women out here are
dialog: spunky.
text: He raises his pistol. Something catches his eye. He looks up.
dialog: Sees something.
text: He squints -- it appears the snow itself is standing to face
dialog: him.
text: The muzzle flash from Cory’s rifle shoots five-feet out the
dialog: barrel.
text: The bullet punches a hole in Curtis’s chest we can almost see
text: through. Punches a hole through the trailer behind him.
text: Curtis is thrown back into the trailer, dead before he left
text: his feet.
text: Jane rolls over and crawls underneath the trailer.
text: The one security guard who still stands looks out over the
dialog: plains. Sees nothing.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: You see where that came from?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (Shouting from the trailer) No!
text: The security officer strains to see. Looks to his friend,
text: bleeding in the snow.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Can you stand up?
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 2
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Well, you better figure it out, cuz
dialog: we're not done.
text: The wounded man struggles to his feet. Dizzy. He looks out
text: over the plains. Turns back and sees -- Cory, standing fifty
text: yards from him.
speaker_heading: LUZ.
text: The security guard doesn’t even have the presence of mind to
text: raise his pistol, just points his finger in Cory’s direction.
text: Cory has fired and ejected the second round before the first
text: one hits the ground. Both men are thrown backward into the
dialog: snow.
text: The men in the trailer return fire, but Cory is gone.
scene_heading: INT. MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT.
text: Pete and a security officer peer out through the window.
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 3
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t know.
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 3
dialog: He went behind trailer three --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Curtis! Mike! Curtis!
scene_heading: SECURITY OFFICER 3
dialog: (Drawing calming breaths) Okay,
dialog: okay ...
text: Cory’s bullet punches through the trailer, through the sink,
text: through the security guard and through the wall behind him,
text: knocking a six inch hole that bleeds light into the room.
text: The man is pulled backward in the bullet’s wake, falling flat
text: on the floor.
text: Pete drops to the floor, crawls to the bedroom. He climbs
text: over the bed and kicks out the window. Climbs out.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: JANE. Under the trailer.
text: She empties her gun at Pete as he runs. They punch into his
text: Kevlar Vest, and knock him to the ground.
text: He stands immediately and continues running.
text: She rolls on her back, shivers.
text: Cory kneels down -- offers her a hand. She takes it. Pulls
dialog: her out.
dialog: Lus.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: How bad are you hit?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Through chattering teeth) I don’t
dialog: know.
text: Cory helps her to her feet.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I gotta get you in this trailer.
text: He lifts her up, and carries her inside.
scene_heading: INT. MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT.
text: Cory sets her on a couch. Heads to the bedroom, returns with
text: the bedding. Wraps it around her shoulders.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I need to have a look.
text: She nods and he unzips the coveralls, runs his hand inside.
text: Pulls it out, looks at it -- no blood. Runs his hand along
text: her sides, her belly, feels something warm.
text: Looks at his hand -- blood, but not an alarming amount.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think a few rounds got through,
dialog: but only in pieces. You’re not
dialog: bleeding too bad.
text: He looks at her neck, this wound is more severe.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: This one ain’t great.
text: He takes some of the sheet. Presses it against the wound.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold that there.
text: She does. She looks at him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Give me your radio. (He doesn’t) My
text: best chance is a helicopter flying
dialog: me out of here, you don’t have one
dialog: of those, do you?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: No.
dialog: Lua.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Give me your radio.(He does) Go get
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I won’t bring him back, Jane. You
dialog: need to know that.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I do. Go get him.
text: She gives the tiniest of nods. He stands up and walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS -- DAY.
text: WE RUN THROUGH THE SNOW. We stumble. Breathe heavy. Stand up
dialog: and continue.
text: We hear the whine of an engine in the distance. It echoes
dialog: through the trees -- no way to know where it comes from.
text: WE LOOK AT PETE, STANDING IN THE SNOW, TREES ALL AROUND HIM.
text: He turns in every direction, trying to pinpoint the sound of
text: the machine echoing through the mountains.
text: The sound stops. The forest is silent. Pete pulls a pistol
text: from its holster, and continues marching through the frozen
dialog: forest.
text: He freezes. Hears something -- a gnawing sound. He turns.
text: A PORCUPINE IS CLIMBING A NAKED ASPEN TREE.
text: It chews the bark. Stops. Looks at Pete -- like any animal,
text: the porcupine can sense the hunted. Can smell the fear. The
dialog: porcupine’s button eyes show no sympathy -- better you than
dialog: me.
text: When Pete turns he finds CORY STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM.
text: Pete screams like a startled child. The butt of Cory’s rifle
text: slams into Pete’s chin, knocking him backward.
scene_heading: EXT. GANNET PEAK -- WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS -- DAY.
text: The sun sits low in the Western sky. We are well above the
text: treeline. Ragged mountains cut the skyline in every
dialog: direction.
dialog: Lud.
text: Pete lays in the snow, blindfolded. Hands bound. The
text: blindfold is ripped off. His hands cut free.
text: Cory stands over him.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Know where you are?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: «+. No.
text: Pete shivers in the snow, his breath crystallizing the
text: instant it’s exhaled.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That’s Gannet Peak. Highest
dialog: mountain in Wyoming.
text: We look around. Deep in the land of nothing. Only bitter
dialog: cold.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: On the hottest day in August
dialog: there’s a foot of snow. Today ...
text: Cory looks at him.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
text: It’s too cold to snow.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay ... Okay ... Let’s just --
dialog: let’s talk for a minute.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Alright.
text: Pete’s teeth chatter -- he looks down at his feet -- NO
speaker_heading: SHOES.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wha -- WHAT THE FUCK!? (Sobs) --
dialog: what the, what --
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I give you a minute and this is how
dialog: you spend it -- cussing and crying?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Listen, okay ... I’ve made
dialog: mistakes. I’ve ... I’ve ...
dialog: Luo.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What. What did you do. I’m not a
dialog: policeman -- tell me the truth and
dialog: I'll give you a chance.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Alright. Just ... You know what
dialog: it’s like? Stuck out in this frozen
dialog: hell -- nothing to do? No nothing.
dialog: No women, no fun? Just fucking ...
text: snow and silence.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: My people have been stuck in this
dialog: shit for a century. Snow and
dialog: silence is the only thing that
dialog: hasn’t been taken from us ... You
dialog: took from us too, didn’t you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t -- how did I --
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You have a little taste, did you?
dialog: Got lonely ... Got drunk?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Then what did you get?
text: Pete can barely speak, he is shivering so hard.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: If you did it, be a man and say it.
dialog: Say ‘I raped her’.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: ... I raped her.
text: Cory nods.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Now say, ‘her boyfriend tried to
dialog: stop me, and we beat him to death.’
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Nod won't cut it. Not today. Say
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We-we-we d-d- we beat him.
speaker_heading: LU/.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Fair enough.
text: Cory stands. Grabs his rifle. Slings it over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wha -- wha -- where.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You get the same chance she got.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What did she -- what did she get?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Stand up big boy. I’m a man of my
dialog: word. If you can make it to the
dialog: highway, you’re a free man.
text: Pete stands up. Looks around -- they are so deep in the
text: mountains, so high up, the valley isn’t even visible.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where -- where’s the highway?
text: He looks at Cory, eyes wide.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You know how far it is from that
dialog: drill camp to where Natalie was
text: found -- almost six miles.
dialog: Barefoot. That’s a warrior. (Looks
dialog: the freezing man over) I doubt
dialog: you'll make it six hundred feet.
dialog: Still, we should make this fair ...
text: Cory walks up pulling a large hunting knife from its sheath
text: and slices Pete’s parka open down the middle.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: There we go.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t understand. What do you
dialog: want me to do?
text: Cory steps close to him.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I want you to run.
speaker_heading: LUO.
text: Cory places the muzzle of his rifle beside Pete’s ear. Pulls
dialog: the trigger.
text: The gun is so loud, we expect the mountain to collapse.
text: Instead, it is only Pete’s eardrum that erupts. Pete screams
text: as blood funnels out of it. He covers his ear and runs like
dialog: his life depends on it -- which it does.
text: Cory pulls a ski mask over his face, climbs on his snowmobile
text: and goes after him.
text: Pete runs -- bare feet slamming into snow. He screams, looks
text: for a way down the steep mountain, sees none. Looks back,
text: Cory is right behind him.
text: He runs faster, arms flinging wildly. Suddenly, half of him
dialog: disappears --
text: THE SNOW IS SO DEEP IT COVERS HIM TO HIS WAIST.
text: Pete looks back at Cory, who fires a round right over his
text: head. He shrieks in terror and pushes further into the snow.
text: He breathes harder, deeper. As he exhales, a thin mist of
text: blood spews out.
text: Cory slows down, let’s Pete get distance, gives him hope.
text: WE WATCH PETE FADE INTO THE MOUNTAIN -- The man becoming a
text: speck in a world of white.
text: Pete FUMBLES, weak -- blood is frozen to the side of his
dialog: face.
text: Cory stops. Watches him. Seconds ache by. Sees him slow down,
text: stumble, then fall. He doesn’t get up.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: Pete lays in the snow, coughing -- gasping -- freezing from
text: the inside out. He rolls on his back. The sky is so close, he
text: can almost reach out and touch it.
text: He reaches his arm up, stretching. Stays like this. No
text: breath. No movement. He is gone.
text: Cory turns the snowmobile east and begins the long ride home.
scene_heading: INT. FREMONT COUNTY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT.
text: Jane lays in a hospital bed, IV tubes running to and from
dialog: her.
dialog: Luy.
text: She stares at the ceiling, too tired to cry but knowing it’s
text: coming. She feels a presence. Looks to the door. Cory stands
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You made it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So did you.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I bet this ain’t how they sell
dialog: those bulletproof vests in the
dialog: brochure, is it?
text: She chuckles, and pain runs through her body.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Don’t make me laugh.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Shouldn't joke. It saved your life.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You saved my life.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You're a tough girl, Jane. You
dialog: saved your own life.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Let’s be honest, I just got lucky.
text: He sits beside her.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Luck don’t live out here. Luck
dialog: lives in the city. Whether someone
dialog: runs the stoplight, whether your
dialog: bank’s the one that gets robbed,
dialog: whether someone’s dialing their
text: cellphone when they come to a
dialog: crosswalk ... Luck is winning or
dialog: losing. Out here, you survive or
dialog: you surrender. That’s determined by
dialog: your strength. You spirit. Wolves
dialog: don’t kill unlucky deer, they kill
dialog: weak ones.
text: He leans forward.
speaker_heading: CORY (CONT'D)
dialog: You fought for your life. And now
dialog: you get to leave with it.
dialog: Liv.
text: He sits back. Stretches his legs out, gets comfortable. She
