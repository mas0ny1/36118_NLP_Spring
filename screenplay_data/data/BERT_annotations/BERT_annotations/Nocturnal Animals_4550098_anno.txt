text: Red frizzy hair flies across our screen in slow motion.
text: Glimpses of tinsel, and a transparent peignoir momentarily
text: hide a large pair of sagging breasts swinging from side to
text: side and bouncing up and down. Dead silence as the movement
text: gradually speeds up to real time. We slowly pull back to
text: reveal that our image is that of a giant nude woman dressed
text: in nothing but tiny bits of glitter, white vinyl boots and a
text: small tulle cape. She is gyrating madly and flinging her head
text: around in some sort of windstorm. As we pull back further we
dialog: come to understand that what we are looking at is an art
text: installation: a floor to ceiling LCD screen.
text: The sound of breathing. A close up of a woman’s eyes now
text: fills our screen. SUSAN MORROW, 42, handsome. Sleek. There is
text: a very slight hint of panic on her face as she stares across
text: the crowded, brightly lit room.
text: Abruptly our sound snaps on at a deafening decibel level as
text: we hear what seems like a thousand voices screaming over each
dialog: other.
text: The screens cover the four walls of the gallery and the
text: effect of wall to wall, floor to ceiling breast and ass
text: jiggling is oddly impressive. The obese women on the LCD
text: screens are nude but dressed in bits and pieces of Americana:
text: one is playing the part of a cheerleader with red tinsel pom
text: poms, one a majorette twirling a baton while another wears a
text: beauty queen’s ribbon and waves small American flags. They
dialog: taunt us and tease us.
text: On raised plinths scattered around the room are incredibly
text: life like sculptures of seemingly the same corpulent women on
text: our video screens. These women appear to be dead and are
text: lying face down. Nude except for jewelry, shoes and small
text: bits of tinsel wrapped around their ankles and waists.
text: The room is jammed with people laughing and talking. The
text: crowd is a collection of what passes in contemporary Los
dialog: Angeles culture as the chic and fashionable. Photographers
text: track several of the guests as the flash of their cameras
text: heightens the excitement in the room.
text: OUR CAMERA GLIDES HIGH ABOVE THE ROOM CAPTURING THE CROWD AND
text: THE WOMEN ON THEIR PLINTHS.

text: WE CUT BACK AND FORTH FROM OVERHEAD SHOTS OF THE NUDE WOMEN
text: ON PLINTHS TO OVERHEAD SHOTS OF THE CROWDED FREEWAYS OF LOS
text: ANGLES AS NIGHTFALL SLOWLY OVERTAKES THE CITY.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW GALLERY, LOS ANGELES. NIGHT -- LATER. 3
text: Silence. The gallery is now empty. A small crew of men in
text: white shirts and dark ties clear away the last traces of the
text: party. Susan is sitting on one of the plinths deep in
text: thought. A nude sculpture lying face down is behind her. The
text: women on the screens continue to gyrate on all four walls.
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY, LOS ANGELES - HIGH ABOVE THE TRAFFIC. NIGHT 4
scene_heading: -- LATER.
text: Susan’s car weaves it’s way through the night.
scene_heading: EXT. MORROW RESIDENCE, LOS ANGELES. NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER. 5
text: Susan pulls up to a pair of large stainless steel gates. The
text: glare of her headlights reflects off of the gates and
text: temporarily blinds her as she shields her eyes. She hits the
text: remote and the massive gates glide open. She drives in as the
text: gates close behind her.
text: As the gates lock in place, another car pulls into the
text: driveway. The glare of the headlights blinds us so that we
text: cannot make out anything but the silhouette of the driver. We
text: see clearly however from the large logo on the hubcap that
text: the car is a vintage dark brown Mercedes. The car door opens
text: as the driver lowers his foot onto the gravel drive.
text: We cut back to the house to see Susan’s silhouette as she
text: walks towards the front door. The house is dimly lit and
text: seemingly empty.

speaker_heading: MORNING.
scene_heading: EXT. MORROW RESIDENCE, LOS ANGELES. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS. 7
text: Our camera glides across the surface of a black swimming pool
text: littered with leaves. We pull back to reveal a vast unkempt
text: lawn and a large Jeff Koons “Balloon Dog” sculpture on a
text: plinth. There are tools, equipment and a small crane next to
text: the sculpture. Despite the neglected feeling of the grounds
text: the house is impressive. Long, low, and elegant.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE, LOS ANGELES. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS. 8
text: We move into the living room which is an expanse of grey
text: carpet and low velvet sofas. There are several very large art
text: crates lining the hall. The house is beautiful but cold and
text: empty.
text: Our camera moves down a long corridor towards a door at the
text: end. The hallway seems endless. A large white Calder mobile
text: moves slowly over a fireplace at the end of the hall as the
text: breeze from the air-conditioner stirs it.
text: Susan stands underneath the Calder in front of an enormous
text: television with a remote control in her hand. Pressing it
text: over and over.
text: As we approach the door the sound of the television becomes
text: louder and louder. We can hear two women’s voices as they
text: shriek with laughter.
speaker_heading: TELEVISION VOICE 1
dialog: And all that decolletage of yours
dialog: should get you more dickoletage
dialog: than that dude’s got! And as I can
dialog: recall, you were the one that told
dialog: me that when he came it was as thin
dialog: as coconut water! Honey, that’s a
dialog: deal breaker for me!
speaker_heading: TELEVISION VOICE 2
dialog: It was that thin.
speaker_heading: TELEVISION VOICE 1
dialog: Well I see we're settling for less
dialog: now!
text: The women break into hysterical laughter once again.
text: We cut to Susan’s face. Her mouth literally hangs open as she
text: stands staring at the television and holding the remote in
text: her hand trying to get the television to turn off.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Beyond.
text: She tosses the remote on the bed in disgust and walks out of
text: the room leaving the television still on.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - ENTRY HALL. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS. 9
text: CHRISTOPHER, 38, wearing a dark suit and tie is placing the
text: mail on a small desk.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
text: Mrs. Morrow, a package arrived for
dialog: you. I found it in the mailbox this
dialog: morning. May I ask you who you
dialog: would like on duty this weekend?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Actually, why don’t you give
dialog: everyone the weekend off.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes. We might go to the beach house
dialog: and if not it might be nice to have
dialog: the weekend alone.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I’1ll let everyone know.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Susan stares at the package for a moment. It is a simple box
text: wrapped in plain brown paper.
text: Susan begins to rip the wrapping off of the box. As she does
text: she cuts her finger on the edge of the paper.
text: She winces, looks at the blood and then quickly puts her
text: finger in her mouth.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Damn it. Christopher, I’m sorry but
dialog: could you help me open this? I just
dialog: cut my finger. Paper cut.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Christopher rips the paper off of the package. Inside is a
text: neat grey linen archival box and a hand written note.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: There’s a note.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It’s okay. You can read it.
text: Christopher reads the note aloud.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Dear Susan,
dialog: I've written a novel that will be
dialog: published in the spring. It’s
dialog: different than the kind of things
dialog: that I was writing when we were
dialog: together.
text: Christopher pauses and looks up.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: In the end you left me with the
dialog: inspiration that I needed to write
dialog: from the heart. I wanted you to be
dialog: the first to read it so I am
dialog: sending along a proof.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I will be in LA until Wednesday on
dialog: business and it would be good to
dialog: see you after so long.
dialog: My cell number and e-mail address
dialog: are below.
dialog: Edward.
text: Susan stands stunned for a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Thanks.
text: Christopher places the note back on the box and leaves the
text: room. Susan’s gaze is transfixed as she stares down at the
dialog: note.
text: She picks up the box and carries it into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - KITCHEN. MORNING -- CONTINUOUS.
text: HUTTON MORROW, 44 years old, tall, athletic and well groomed,
text: dressed in a crisp white button down shirt, blue blazer and
text: grey pants, enters the room. Hutton’s face gives away the
text: fact that he has not slept.
text: Susan is washing the cut on her finger at the sink.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It’s a manuscript that Edward sent
dialog: me. He wrote a novel.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Edward who?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Edward, my first husband. Remember
dialog: him?
dialog: Hutton is
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: I didn’t know he could write.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes you did. He was writing a novel
dialog: when you and got together, you just
dialog: don’t remember.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Have you even talked to him in 20
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: 19. No. I tried calling hima
dialog: couple of times a few years ago but
dialog: he just hung up on me. I think he’s
dialog: teaching English at some prep
dialog: school in Dallas. It’s sad really.
dialog: He never remarried.
text: not really listening. He is putting a Nespresso pod
text: into the coffee machine.
dialog: She turns
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Where were you last night? You
dialog: didn’t come by the gallery.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: I’m sorry. Really. By the time I
dialog: left the office I was late for my
dialog: dinner...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It would have taken you 15 minutes.
dialog: 15 minutes and it would have meant
dialog: a lot to me. (Pause) Never mind.
text: away from him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You didn’t come to bed last night.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: I didn’t want to wake you up.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, I wasn’t asleep. I was too
text: wound up from the opening.
text: Hutton tosses his newspaper on the counter and begins to
dialog: read.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: It went well by the way.
dialog: Apparently.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Good.
text: Susan crosses the room to Hutton.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Look. Why don’t you and I go to the
dialog: beach. We can go tonight and come
dialog: back on Monday. Maybe if we just
dialog: spent some time, just the two of
dialog: us...
text: Susan glances up at him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Why are you wearing this blazer on
dialog: a Saturday?
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Because I have to go to the office
dialog: and then I have to go to the
dialog: airport and then I have to go back
dialog: to New York.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You just came from there.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Yes, I know. But I have to go if I
dialog: want to get this deal done. I don’t
dialog: want to have to sell anything else.
text: Hutton is ripping a packet of sweetener open and he spills it
text: on the counter.
speaker_heading: HUTTON (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.
text: Susan begins sweeping it away.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It’s okay.
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
text: Susan looks at crate in the hall.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You know, the strange thing is that
dialog: I don’t really care about all of
dialog: this art.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: That doesn’t sound like you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know. But it’s true.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: I care. It pisses me off.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know you do.
text: She pauses a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t worry, I can fill the walls
dialog: with some new LA artists and people
dialog: will think we’re ahead of the curve
dialog: instead of going broke. You won't
dialog: have to be embarrassed.
text: Hutton glares at her as she walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLT RESIDENCE, BEL AIR CALIFORNIA. THAT NIGHT. 11
text: Susan and Hutton get out of their car. A black vintage
text: Bentley coupe. There are several impressive and flashy cars
text: parked in front of the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOLT RESIDENCE, BEL AIR CALIFORNIA. NIGHT -- 12
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS.
text: We enter the house. It is beautiful and expensive. The art on
text: the walls is staggering and the mix of contemporary art with
text: 18th century furniture and the modern architecture of the
text: house itself is eccentric in the extreme. A butler leads us
text: into a room filled with a small group of people. All know
text: each other well. Susan and Hutton are greeted with cheek
dialog: kisses.
dialog: 10.
text: Susan stands talking with ALESSIA HOLT, 38, dressed in a
text: kaftan and covered in gold and turquoise jewelry. She is
text: tall, pale and her eyes are darkened with heavy liner and
text: even heavier shadow so that she almost has the appearance of
text: a raccoon. She moves her hands wildly when she speaks. She is
text: flamboyant but there is a kindness and gentle quality about
text: her. The two women are clearly close as is evident by their
dialog: easy rapport.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: Are things a little better?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He’s just having a hard time with
dialog: his business right now.
text: They glance across the room at Hutton who is speaking with
text: CARLOS HOLT early 50's, silver hair, tall and elegant.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: Carlos told me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I’m surprised. I thought we were
dialog: hiding it pretty well. Hutton would
dialog: be very upset to find out that
dialog: anyone knew. He just hates not to
dialog: win.
text: She looks over at him.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: Are you sleeping? Did you call my
dialog: psychopharmacologist?
text: She takes a sip of her martini.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you call him? You should
dialog: because he’s a genius.
text: Hutton has pulled away from Carlos and stepped into the hall.
text: He is on his phone. Susan watches him.
text: Alessia reaches out and touches Susan’s arm.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Susan, I’m worried about you.
dialog: 11.
text: Susan is focused on Hutton who is still on his phone.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously, look at me. You scared
dialog: me the last time that we talked.
text: She looks at Alessia and her shoulders droop. She feels
text: comfortable enough with Alessia to let a certain fragility
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm fine. I’m fine. I just can’t
dialog: believe I told you all of those
dialog: things. I feel embarrassed about
dialog: it. What right do I have to not be
dialog: happy? I have everything. I feel
dialog: ungrateful not to be happy.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: As much right as anyone Susan. As
dialog: much right as anyone because it’s
dialog: all relative. You’re just awfully
dialog: hard on yourself.
text: Susan looks across the room at Carlos.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: How do you do it?
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: You mean with Carlos? I’m totally
dialog: cool with it. Having a gay husband
dialog: is not such a bad thing. We’re best
dialog: friends. We love each other
dialog: completely. I’m certainly the only
dialog: woman in his life. And that lasts
dialog: longer than lust doesn’t it? It’s
dialog: forever really.
text: Alessia glances towards Hutton.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hutton and I don’t have that.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: Did you ever?
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I think we just want different
dialog: things. Or maybe I want different
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: ALESSIA
dialog: Do you still love him?
text: She looks up and Hutton catches her eyes and motions to her
text: with his head.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm being summoned. Pardon me. He
dialog: has to catch a plane. I need to say
dialog: goodbye.
text: Susan crosses the room to Hutton and leads him to the door.
text: Alessia stares after her.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLT RESIDENCE, BEL AIR CALIFORNIA. NIGHT -- 13
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS.
text: We are on the front steps of the house. There is a black
text: Mercedes and driver waiting for Hutton.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I hope that this deal works out for
dialog: you. I really do. I know that you
dialog: need it.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: We need this.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, you need this.
text: She leans in to kiss him on the cheek. She watches the car
text: pull out of the driveway and goes back into the house.
scene_heading: INT. HOLT RESIDENCE, BEL AIR CALIFORNIA. NIGHT -- LATER. 14
text: The flamboyant and eclectic guests are seated around the
text: dining table finishing dessert. Conversation at the table is
text: lively, and somewhat loud. Susan is seated next to Carlos.
dialog: 13.
text: At that moment the other end of the table erupts with
text: laughter as CHLOE, 24, a beautiful young actress finishes a
text: story. She speaks with a strong southern accent and has a
text: certain vapid charm. The table is riveted.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: So I said, “well my mother always
dialog: told me if you massage your pussy
dialog: with Pam Cooking Spray for a month
dialog: before the baby comes you won’t
dialog: need vaginal rejuvenation!”
text: The table burst into hysterical laughter. Susan turns back to
dialog: Carlos.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I’ve got to get some Pam. And she
dialog: is going to get a nomination this
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: A nomination? She is going to win!
text: They both look towards Chloe.
speaker_heading: CARLOS (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s talk about your opening. My
dialog: favorite subject.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Not mine.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: The opening was spectacular last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Really? Is that what you thought?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: You didn’t?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: I loved it. I thought the work was
dialog: incredibly strong. So perfect with
dialog: all of this junk culture that we
dialog: live in.
dialog: 15
dialog: 16
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It is junk. Total junk.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Darling, you’re a big success. None
dialog: of us really like what we do.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: So why do we do it?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Because we are driven. And maybe a
dialog: bit insecure. We get into things
dialog: when we’re young because we think
dialog: they mean something.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And then we find out that they
dialog: don’t.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Susan, enjoy the absurdity of our
dialog: world. It’s a lot less painful. And
dialog: believe me, our world is a lot less
dialog: painful than the real world.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BATHROOM. NIGHT -- LATER. 15
text: Susan is dressed for bed. She looks in the mirror for a
text: moment. She opens her medicine cabinet and takes two
dialog: different pills.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BEDROOM. NIGHT -- MINUTES 16
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: One wall of the room is all glass. The view across the lawn
text: and down to the city is dramatic and eerie at the same time.
text: As Susan sits down on the bed, her eyes catch the cover of
text: “Nocturnal Animals” on her bedside table. She pauses, then
text: picks up the manuscript and opens it to the first page.
text: She is momentarily taken aback by the dedication. The clean
dialog: white page reads simply: “For Susan”.
text: She begins to read...
dialog: 17
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: EXT. HASTINGS RESIDENCE, HOUSTON TEXAS. PRESENT DAY -—— 17
speaker_heading: DUSK.
text: We are in the driveway of a modest but well designed ranch
text: styled house. A large oak tree looms over the lawn and the
text: sound of cicadas can be heard.
text: TONY HASTINGS, early 40s, dark brown hair with a full beard,
text: is loading bags into the back of a vintage 4 door brown
text: Mercedes. He is dressed in jeans and a red plaid shirt. INDIA
text: HASTINGS, 16, is helping him. She is tall and slim with long
text: red hair.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Dad, why are we driving this old
dialog: thing to Marfa?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Because I just had it completely
dialog: rebuilt. It’s a classic.
speaker_heading: INDIA
text: It has a terrible sound system.
text: She throws a bag in the trunk.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Well you’ll have to suffer through
dialog: that.
text: He lifts a pair of riding boots into the back of the car.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have two sets of boots India?
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Do we really have to stop tonight?
dialog: I'd rather just get there.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Ask your mother. She’s the boss.
text: LAURA HASTINGS, 40, shoulder length red hair, slim and pretty
text: like her daughter, comes out of the house with a small bag.
text: She gets into the car.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I set the alarm.
dialog: 18
dialog: 19
dialog: 16.
text: The car pulls out of the driveway and into the twilight.
text: Driving out of the sprawl that is Houston and into the
text: country, until the highway stretches out straight ahead.
scene_heading: INT. HASTINGS CAR. NIGHT -- LATER. 18
text: India is texting in the back seat.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: India, you have been doing that for
dialog: hours. I thought you were the one
dialog: who wanted to drive all night.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: I did. But what are we supposed to
dialog: do, sing campfire songs or
dialog: something?
text: The road is even more flat and straight now. The highway is
text: increasingly deserted and has narrowed to two lanes on each
text: side. Every few minutes a car passes them in the left lane or
text: the headlights of an oncoming car can be seen across the
dialog: median.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: How much longer?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: About three and a half hours.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Well dad, you’re going to get your
dialog: wish. My cell service just went
dialog: out. Jesus, can you believe that
dialog: there is no service here? How is
dialog: that even be possible?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Two of the things I love most about
dialog: west Texas; no phones and no
dialog: people.
scene_heading: INT. HASTINGS CAR. NIGHT -- LATER 19
text: Silence in the car. Tony is driving and Laura and India are
text: asleep. Tony is fumbling to find a radio station but none are
dialog: within range.
dialog: 17.
text: Tony looks over at Laura and touches her cheek. She opens her
text: eyes for a moment, smiles at him and kisses his hand.
text: Straight ahead on the highway, Tony sees two sets of tail
text: lights blocking both lanes of the road. Tony has to slow his
text: speed and he gets behind the car on the left and waits. Both
text: cars are now slowing down even more.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Come on.
text: Tony presses his horn lightly. Laura and India wake up. The
text: car in the left lane, an old dark green metallic Pontiac GTO
text: with a dented fender finally pulls ahead and Tony follows. He
text: zooms past the first car, an old dark red Cadillac
text: convertible, and gets back into the right lane as the green
text: GTO speeds off into the distance. The Cadillac falls behind.
text: The GTO in front now begins to slow down as well. As Tony
text: passes the car the driver leans back into his seat and
text: laughs. There are two other men in the car but we cannot see
dialog: their faces.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Total Jerks.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Are we rid of them?
text: India gives them the finger from the rear window.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: India, don’t do that!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What? What did she do?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: She just gave them the finger.
text: The driver of the green GTO now steps on the gas and begins
dialog: to gain on Tony.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: Tony! Speed up.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No. I don’t like this.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s alright.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Just speed up. Tony!
text: The dark green GTO is now honking and roars up beside the
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Just let them go. Let them go.
text: The three men in the car are staring at the family and
dialog: laughing.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: India, don’t look at them. Don’t
dialog: give them any reason.
text: The man in the passenger side of the car is looking at India
text: with a lascivious grin on his face. The other men in the car
text: are laughing.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Why is he smiling like that?
text: Suddenly the green GTO lunges sideways towards Tony’s car,
text: forcing him to swerve. The GTO then pulls in front of the
text: Mercedes and cuts them off.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He's crazy.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Tony pulls out to pass the car but as he does the car in
text: front swings left to block his way and Tony hits his brakes.
text: As Tony swerves back to the right the GTO cuts him off again,
text: preventing him from passing. In a surge of rage Tony steps on
dialog: the gas.
text: A loud metallic crashing noise. He hits them.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Fuck.
text: Tony, shocked at what has just happened steps on the gas, and
text: gets around the other car. As he passes the GTO the driver is
text: waving madly and screaming at him to pull over and stop.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh god, Tony.
text: The lights of the GTO grow distant as Tony speeds away. The
text: car is quiet as the family sit stunned at what just happened.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: India, is your phone working yet?
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: No, but I took down their license
dialog: number.
text: As Tony checks his rear view mirror he sees a pair of
text: headlights beginning to gain on him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
text: Laura looks in the side view mirror and sees the car
dialog: approaching.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh no.
text: The GTO now roars up beside them on the left and the guy in
text: the passenger seat is waving his arms violently at them,
text: shouting, shaking his fist and pointing. The car swerves
text: towards them and tries to force Tony onto the shoulder. Tony
text: keeps his foot on the peddle and keeps his hands gripped
text: firmly on the steering wheel.
text: The green GTO suddenly rams into the Mercedes, pulls back and
text: then rams them again and again forcing Tony to move towards
text: the shoulder of the road as he begins to loose control of the
dialog: car.
text: Another crashing sound against his left fender and he feels
text: the damage. The GTO pushes against him continuously and holds
text: steady. The loud raw grating noise of metal ripping at metal
text: is deafening.
dialog: 20
dialog: 21
dialog: 20.
text: Tony's steering wheel begins to rattle and shake as the other
text: car forces him off of the road and lands in front of him ina
text: cloud of dust and gravel.

scene_heading: CONTINUOUS.
text: Shaken by what she has just read, Susan tries to catch her
text: breath. She turns the page...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY, WEST TEXAS. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS. 21
text: As the dust settles as we can see clearly that the Hasting’s
text: car is blocked in by the other car. Laura looks back to make
dialog: sure that India is okay as the second car, the convertible
text: that was lagging behind, comes into sight. We see the wide
text: grin of the shirtless driver as the car slows and then speeds
dialog: away.
text: The family sits in shock trying to figure out what to do.
text: The driver's side of the old Buick opens and a man, RAY
text: MARCUS late 20s, rough looking yet surprisingly handsome,
text: steps out. Laura reaches for Tony’s arm. The other men in the
text: car are looking on but we do not make out their faces
dialog: clearly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sit still. They’ve probably got a
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Please Tony. Pull out.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: I can’t move. He’s blocked the car.
text: The man walks around to the back of his car to survey the
text: damage. He begins to talk to the man in the front passenger
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s he doing?
text: He then walks over to Tony’s car. Slowly. He is wearing a
text: western shirt, jeans and bright green cowboy boots. He looks
text: at the front of Tony’s car and comes to the window.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don’t get out of the car.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m not getting out of the car
dialog: sweetheart.
text: Ray motions for Tony to roll down his window. Tony does this
dialog: reluctantly.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Good evenin.
text: Ray smiles.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You’re supposed to stop when there
text: is an accident.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Then why didn’t you stop then?
text: The man leans down and looks inside the car at Laura and
text: India. India is trying to get a signal with her phone again.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: That won’t work. No signal here.
text: He looks at Tony again.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re not supposed to leave the
text: scene of an accident. It’s a crime.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: After the way you were driving?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Laura...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 22.
text: Ray’s hand is resting on top of the Mercedes. He is tapping
text: his fingers on the roof of the car over and over. We can see
text: clearly the twinkle of a pink diamond heart shaped girl’s
text: ring on his little finger. His dirty nails are long and that
text: of someone who plays the guitar. He has the swagger of a
dialog: seventies rock star.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Just that the way you were driving
dialog: was crazy.
text: Ray bangs his hand on the roof of the car and spits.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey Turk!
text: The doors on the right side of the Buick open and the two men
text: get out. TURK who is the smallest of the three and LOU who is
text: tall and thin with a dead look in his eyes. Both men wear old
text: baseball hats.
dialog: 
text: Ray puts his hands on the half opened window and leans in.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don’t come any closer.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Alright sweetheart, it’s alright.
text: The other men begin approaching the car.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You know what, please just get back
dialog: in your car. Leave us alone.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Lady, lady, lady... Calm down. We
dialog: got an accident to report, that’s
dialog: all.
text: One of the men shines his flashlight at Laura.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Leave us alone.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s just a flashlight sweetheart.
dialog: It’s just a flashlight. It’s
dialog: alright.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: The other two men are inspecting the front of Tony’s car
text: putting their hands on the hood and leaning down under the
text: car. We cannot see what they are doing.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Okay. All right. Let’s exchange
dialog: information.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Information? Let’s exchange
dialog: information?
text: Ray lowers himself down on his knees and rests his arms
text: across the car door. He smiles.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah. Alright. Open up the glove
dialog: compartment sweetheart.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let's exchange information. Okay.
dialog: I'm a Gemini, my favorite color is
dialog: petal pink, and I like long walks
text: and kittens.
text: Ray breaks into hysterical laughter as he claws with his
text: nails at the window imitating a kitten. The family sits
text: dumbstruck, as the other men laugh along with Ray.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know what, we should call the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh? It’s a great idea. It was your
dialog: fuckin fault, right?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It doesn’t matter whose fault it
dialog: was Tony.
text: The two men in front walk around to the side of the car.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Hey Ray, this guy’s got a flat
dialog: tire.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh come on!
text: Ray goes around to look. The men all start to laugh.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Well what do you know? Well sure
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What?
text: Someone kicks the tire and the car rocks a bit.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Don't believe it, dad.
text: The three men come to the driver’s window.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yep. Your left tire is flat, sure
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Flat as a pancake.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You must have busted it when you
text: was shoving us off the road.
text: Someone cackles.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We did not shove you off the road!
dialog: You shoved us off the road!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Shhh. Be quiet.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: (Quietly) It’s a lie.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You think I’m a liar?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She's just a child.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You think I’m a liar!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No. She’s not saying that man.
dialog: She's just a child.
text: He waves the other guys back.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You don’t got a flat, go on and
dialog: drive. Start the engine and drive.
dialog: Drive on it asshole, drive away.
dialog: Nobody's stopping you.
text: Tony starts the car and rolls it forward. It is evident that
text: the tire is flat. He turns off the engine.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: God damn it!
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh god! Oh god! What are we going
dialog: to do Tony? What are we going to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s alright. It’s okay.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It’s not okay. We’re in the middle
dialog: of nowhere. What are we going to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Tell you what. We’ll fix it for
dialog: you. Won’t we, guys?
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Yeah. Sure.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, just to show you we're okay
dialog: we'll fix it for you, you won't
dialog: have to do a thing, and then we’1l
dialog: go to the cops together, you and
dialog: me, and report your accident.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: You got tools, mister?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don’t get out of the car. Please.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No need. Use ours. Come on, let’s
dialog: get going.
text: The three men go to the trunk of their car while Tony and his
text: wife and daughter watch with their doors locked. They watch
text: while the men bring out their tools, the jack, the tire iron.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: You got a spare tire man?
text: Tony pauses. He is not sure. The men start to laugh. All but
text: Ray who is lighting a cigarette.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You cain’t change a tire without a
dialog: spare.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: You wanna give me the keys to the
dialog: trunk?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: No, dad.
text: Turk looks at India for a long time. Staring. Looking her up
dialog: and down.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Who the fuck do you think you are?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Just pop the trunk open for me
dialog: Laura.
text: Tony gets out of the car and lifts out the suitcases and
text: boxes in the light of the flashlight held by Turk, until they
text: get at the spare tire.
dialog: 27.
text: Ray taking a drag off of his cigarette begins dancing next to
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Get the women outta the car.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Come on, get em out.
text: Tony stares blankly at Ray as he weighs this in his mind. Ray
text: is becoming irritated.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on man! We gotta lift your car
dialog: up on a jack so get um out.
text: Tony looks around surveying the situation.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude! We gotta lift your wife and
dialog: your child and your car? Get your
dialog: women out of the car!
text: Tony looks at his wife and daughter. He clocks the man with
text: the crowbar and the other with the wrench.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s all right honey. They just
dialog: want you out while they fix the
dialog: tire.
text: Laura and India get out and stand near the door of the car.
text: The men begin raising the car and loosening the flat tire.
text: Ray is kicking the luggage around at the back of the car
text: inspecting it with the toe of his cowboy boot. He looks up at
dialog: Tony.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Come over here.
text: Tony walks towards him .
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT’D)
dialog: You seen what you did to my car?
dialog: You think you’re fuckin hot shit
dialog: don’t you?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They definitely think they’re
dialog: fuckin hot shit.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Are you serious. Your bitches man,
dialog: who else? You too. You think you're
dialog: somthin special, you can bump a
text: guy’s car and then leave the scene
dialog: of an accident.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Listen, you were playing some kind
dialog: of crazy game with us on the road.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah?
text: The flashing blue lights of a police car suddenly appear. The
text: car is moving at very high speed, clearly on a call. Tony
text: steps towards the road and waves his arms. Laura and India
text: run towards the road screaming. They are too late and shout
text: frantically into the night as the police car speeds off into
text: the distance. Ray holds his breath for a moment and then he
text: and the other two men start laughing.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: There goes your cops. You should
dialog: have tried harder to stop them. But
dialog: that’s okay. We’ll take good care
dialog: of you.
text: The men continue to work on the car. They seem to enjoy it
text: and laugh and talk. Ray is not laughing.
text: Ray paces back and forth while the other two men finish
text: changing the tire. Ray looks periodically over at Laura and
text: India tapping his feet and murmuring under his breath.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: (Murmuring) Fuckin bitches. Fuckin
dialog: god damned uppity bitches. Fuck
dialog: you. I’1l teach you a thing or two.
dialog: Fuck you...
dialog: 29.
text: Tony is watching Ray pace back and forth. He hears what he is
dialog: saying.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you looking at? Hot shot.
text: He is muttering to himself and becoming more agitated.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT’D)
dialog: What were you trying to do there on
dialog: the road?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: We are just trying to get to where
dialog: we are going.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And where’s that?
text: Tony says nothing.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, where are you going.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Marfa.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And what exactly is in Marfa?
text: Tony looks at the ground. The man moves closer to Tony and
text: brings his face level with his. Tony takes a step backwards
text: and Ray closes the gap. Ray leans forward forcing Tony to
dialog: lean back.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, what’s in Marfa? Hey mother
dialog: fucker.
text: Ray takes hold of Tony’s crotch and shoves him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hey, let go of me.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Leave my dad alone, asshole!
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: India...
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Fuck you, baby.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: She didn't mean that. She’s just a
dialog: kid.
text: Ray strolls over to where India and Laura are standing. They
dialog: are terrified.
text: Turk grabs Tony and pushes him backwards as Ray shoves India
text: up against the car.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What’s in Marfa? Your daddy won't
dialog: tell me so why don’t you.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: What is it to you anyway?
text: Tony is now fighting to get to India as Turk pushes him back
text: with a crowbar.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Come on baby, we're nice guys.
dialog: We're fixin your tire.
text: Ray begins to dance in front of India, trapping her at the
text: door of the car.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wanna dance? Wanna dance?
text: Ray looks towards Tony who is still struggling with Turk to
dialog: get towards his daughter.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Let her go!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Look at him. Your daddy thinks he’s
dialog: so much better than me. What do you
dialog: think?
text: India looks him straight in the eyes.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Well he is.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Look at him. He’s a wimp. A total
text: pussy.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Get your hands off of her!
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: You’re scum, you know.
text: Ray takes a step towards India. Laura steps in between but he
text: pushes her aside. He puts his hands on the girl’s shoulders.
text: Instantly Laura is on him hitting and kicking and pulling at
text: him from behind until she is flung to the side.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Bitch!
text: Tony moves in but before he knows it Ray knocks him back.
text: Tony falls to the ground. His nose is bleeding. Ray faces all
text: three of them.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch it you fucking assholes. You
dialog: got no fucking right to talk to me
dialog: like that!
text: The men by the tire stop to watch.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ sake, we're fixin your god
dialog: damned tire!
text: He walks around to the other two men. Laura wraps her arms
text: around India and tries to calm her down. Tony struggles to
text: get up from the pavement, his nose bleeding profusely.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Tony) You all right over there?
dialog: Need a tissue?
text: Ray walks over to Tony who is now standing holding onto his
text: nose as the blood runs down his face.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: God damn! That looks bad!
text: He turns towards Laura and India.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey honey! You got a tampon? Your
dialog: nose looks like shit!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I mean it looks like shit.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m fine.
text: The men have finished with the car. Ray looks over at them.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Are we good? We’re good. We’re set.
dialog: We're good to go.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Alright. How far up the road until
dialog: we can get a phone signal?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: And why do you want to get further
dialog: up the road? So you can leave the
dialog: scene of an accident again?
text: Ray moves closer to Tony.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Leave him alone!
text: Ray looks over at India and stares at her for a moment. He
text: then turns back to Tony.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: There’s service up by Bailey. How
dialog: do you think we’re gonna get there
dialog: though?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: In our cars.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Which car?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Both cars.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Naw, mister. Don’t try no fuckin

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You heard me. I know what you’re
dialog: doin. I know what your plan is.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What is the matter?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Don’t try no fucking shit with me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What is the matter? What the fuck
dialog: is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: How do I know that you ain’t gonna
dialog: just floor the gas and leave me in
dialog: the dust.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Alright fine. Get in your car and
dialog: we'll follow you there.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Fuck you! No way! You go in my car.
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No. No way.
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No. I’m not going to do that.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay fine. You drive your car and
dialog: the girl comes with us.
text: Ray starts to move around the back of the car towards Laura
text: and India. Lou moves towards Tony to hold him back. Laura
text: tries to push Ray away from India but is blocked by Turk who
text: throws her to the ground. Ray picks India up and begins to
text: carry her to the front of the car. The two women begin
text: screaming as the situation becomes more violent. Tony finally
text: breaks free from Lou and moves in towards the car only to be
dialog: held back once again.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Stop! What are you doing! Stop! Get
dialog: your hands off of them!
text: India breaks free and runs down the road as Ray stands
text: catching his breath. He calls after her as he rubs his
dialog: crotch.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Bye bye sweetheart. I love you!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: India!
text: Laura is still struggling with Turk as Lou releases Tony.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your hands off of her!
text: Laura breaks free and runs towards India. Ray looks towards
text: Tony who is now slowly wandering down the road towards Laura
text: and India. He is dazed.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Look what you gone and did!
text: He looks towards Laura.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is she the boss? Is she the boss of
dialog: your family?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Laura!
dialog: 35.
text: As Tony moves towards his wife and daughter Ray follows and
text: drops down to his knees in front of Tony.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Have you got a vagina? Have you got
dialog: a fuckin vagina there?
text: Ray flattens himself on the road and begins fucking the
dialog: pavement.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, vagina boy! Vagina boy!
text: Tony finally snaps, moves quickly to Ray and screams at the
text: top of his voice.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Stay away! Stay away! Stay the fuck
dialog: away!
text: Ray is now right in Tony’s face as the two men stand
text: screaming at each other. Laura runs to the car and shouts at
text: Tony and India to get in the car.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Tony! Tony! Get in the car!
text: There is a rush of motion, the men are startled, India runs
text: to the car and makes her way around to the rear door and into
text: the backseat, slamming and locking the door behind her. Laura
text: also jumps into the front seat and locks the door.
text: Ray has now moved away from Tony and towards the Mercedes.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey! Here we go! Go in both cars!
dialog: Hey Lou!
text: Ray runs around to the driver's side of the Mercedes and
text: starts to jump in just before Laura realizes too late what is
text: happening and is not able to reach across and lock the door.
text: He braces the door open with his foot as Laura scratches and
text: claws at him as he tries to get in.
text: As Tony looks up, he sees Turk reach around and unlock the
text: back door as India bites him and screams. He fights her off
text: and pushes his way into the car as Ray slams the driver's
text: door and starts the car.
dialog: 22
dialog: 23
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: INDIA
dialog: Dad! Dad!
text: Tony stares at what is happening in complete disbelief. He
text: freezes and stands for a moment paralyzed. India’s scream
text: pierces the silence of the night and finally pulls him back
text: to reality. He snaps to and moves towards the car but
text: immediately Lou is upon him.
dialog: 
text: With a violent roar the car pulls onto the highway and speeds
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No! No!
text: Tony sees the horrified faces of his wife and daughter as the
text: car rushes away. India’s tear streaked face staring back at
text: him from the rear window. The sound of the car fades and the
text: red tail lights grow fainter and then disappear all together.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: No! No! No!

text: Tony hangs his head.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: You gonna cry now?
text: Tony slowly raises his head, and steps on the gas. As their
text: car makes the turn the lights illuminate the brush for just
text: an instant. There is an old trailer off of the side of the
text: road. A dark colored car is parked in a turnout next to the
text: trailer, partially hidden behind a cluster of mesquite trees.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But that’s my car we just passed!
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: It ain’t your car man. Keep goin.
text: Tony continues to drive.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think you need to worry
dialog: about your wife and kid. Like I say
dialog: you don’t need to worry about them.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What do you mean I don’t need to
dialog: worry about them? What the fuck
dialog: does that mean?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Calm down. He ain’t never killed
dialog: nobody yet. That’s all I mean. At
dialog: least as far as I know he ain't.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Killed! Why are you talking about
dialog: killing!
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: I said he AIN'T killed nobody yet.
text: His voice is very quiet.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: If you’d listen to me you would
dialog: hear what I was saying.
text: They come to a clearing were the tracks disappear into the
text: grass. The site is littered with beer bottles and a few
text: shotgun cartridges. Tony comes to a stop.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, looks like we run outta road.
dialog: They ain’t here. Wonder if I made a
dialog: mistake. It’s time for you to get
dialog: out now okay?
text: Before he knows it, Lou jumps out of the door, comes around
text: to Tony’s side of the car and flings the door open.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: GET OUT!
text: Lou grabs Tony by the arm, yanks hard and in one motion
text: throws him on the ground.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll get killed if you don’t
dialog: watch it.
text: He gets into the car, slams the door, jerks forward, and
text: starts back up the deserted road. Tony chases after the car
text: and bangs on the door as Lou kicks the dust up in Tony’s
dialog: face.
dialog: 26
dialog: 41.
text: Tony watches the red lights disappear. Except for the light
text: of the vast sky and the sound of coyotes in the distance the
text: night is completely black.
text: Tony sits down on the ground and starts to cry. He pounds his
text: fists into his legs.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT, WEST TEXAS. NIGHT -- LATER. 26
text: Tony hears a faint but steady whooshing sound in the
text: distance, and then the far away cry of what could be the horn
text: of a large truck. The sounds come from the opposite direction
text: of the dirt road. Tony stands up, thinks and starts walking
text: in the direction of the sound.
text: As he does we see lights coming along down the dirt road. The
text: car stops at the clearing where Tony was kicked out. Two men
text: get out. Although it is not completely clear, the car looks
text: like Tony’s Mercedes.
text: Tony sees the beam of a flashlight and flattens himself
text: reflexively behind a large boulder and a clump of brush at
text: the edge of the arroyo.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What did you fuckin leave him out
dialog: here for?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Hey mister! Your wife wants you!
text: Tony holds still.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Get back in the fuckin car.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Mister? Your wife wants you.
text: Silence. Footsteps in the brush very close by.
speaker_heading: LOU (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister! Ah Shit!
text: The men get back in the car and slam the doors. The lights of
text: the car illuminate the top of the grass and brush like a
text: movie stage. After a moment the car turns back down the dusty
dialog: road.
dialog: 27
dialog: 28
dialog: 29
dialog: 30
dialog: 42.
text: Tony stays flat against the ground. Silence. The sounds of
text: the desert. In the distance the whooshing sound seems louder
dialog: than before.
text: Tony pulls himself up and starts walking towards the sound.
text: As Tony walks through the desert brush the sky begins to
text: lighten a bit to a deep violet.
text: Tony climbs down an arroyo and crawls under a barbed wire
text: fence. As he does he falls to the ground and twists his
text: ankle. The sky is beginning to turn a light pink.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY, WEST TEXAS. DAWN -- LATER. 27
text: Tony wanders along the highway signaling and waving his arms
text: to get someone to stop but no one does. He keeps walking and
text: puts his arm out as every car passes. Screaming at times for
text: cars to stop. Finally, on the side of the road, Tony sees a
text: small adobe house. He rushes up to the door and begins
text: banging on the door furiously. A woman in shorts answers. We
text: hear a baby crying in the background.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: May I use your phone?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, WEST TEXAS. LATER THAT MORNING 28
text: Tony sits in a glassed in room starring into space.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE SUSAN’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 29

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I was afraid of that.
text: Tony, bleary eyed, stares off in the distance.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GRAVES
text: There’s a motel across the street.
dialog: Have you got any money?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have credit cards.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GRAVES
dialog: It’s still early Mr. Hastings.
dialog: We'll call if we get anything.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL, WEST TEXAS. DUSK. 31

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL, WEST TEXAS. TONY'S ROOM - BATHROOM. NIGHT. 32
text: Tony is attempting to lie comfortably in the tiny tub of his
text: motel room. He is washing the blood and dirt off of his face.
text: The steam from the water rises. The light is a harsh glow.
text: The tub is dingy with green tiles and a plastic shower
text: curtain. He begins to cry softly.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 33
text: Susan lies in her tub with her eyes open. Thinking. There is
text: only a dim light in the room coming from the open door.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING. 34
text: Susan lies on her bed motionless, staring at the ceiling. It

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL, WEST TEXAS. TONY’S ROOM. DAY. 35

text: The phone rings.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hello.
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GRAVES
dialog: This is Lieutenant Graves. They

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What about my wife and daughter?
scene_heading: LIEUTENANT GRAVES
dialog: Still no news. They weren’t in the

text: Tony flinches.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GRAVES (CONT'D)
dialog: We're turning this case over to

dialog: up in a few minutes?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’m ready now.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT, WEST TEXAS. DAY -- LATER. 36
text: A police car sits in front of the motel office. A tall slim
text: man in a western jacket and a cowboy hat is standing at the
text: back of the car smoking. This is BOBBY ANDES, late 40s,
text: weathered face, faded brown hair, with a mustache. He is
dialog: imposing.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Glad to meetcha. I’m Bobby Andes. I
dialog: look into things around here.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You found my car?
speaker_heading: ANDES
text: They found it in a creek bed.
text: He takes a drag of his cigarette as he surveys Tony.
dialog: 37
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell you what. If we take you back
dialog: to the house where we picked you up
dialog: from could you back track from
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I could try.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Okay then, you try. Let’s go.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR, WEST TEXAS HIGHWAY. DAY -- MINUTES LATER. 37
text: The man in uniform drives fast. Clearly used to driving like
text: a cop. No one speaks. Bobby Andes is sitting in the passenger
text: seat and Tony in the back. The loudspeaker chatters with
text: radio police voices. Bobby turns the sound down.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: It’s my understanding that these
dialog: fellas didn’t have any guns.
text: Tony looks down.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
text: Andes stares at Tony for a moment.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Alright. Let’s get some things
dialog: straight. You say this fella named
dialog: Lou drove you into the brush and
dialog: left you there?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He made me drive.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: And when you started to walk out
dialog: you saw them coming in again.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Which car was it?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I think it was my car.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The look of it. The sound of it. It
dialog: sounded like my car.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Could you see them in the dark?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Not very well.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: What did they say?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: They said, “Mister, your wife wants
dialog: you”.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Why didn’t you go to them?
text: Tony looks down at his lap.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t know why I didn’t go.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Do you think they were with them?
text: They drive by an old red billboard, glowing brightly in the
text: harsh sunlight.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t know. I didn’t think so
dialog: then. I thought if they were she
dialog: would have called out. I don’t know
dialog: why I didn’t go. Something held me
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Well, I think we had better find
dialog: that road, don’t you?
dialog: 38
dialog: 47.
text: They drive for quite a while and then stop in front of the
text: small adobe house just off the highway where Tony was picked
text: up. Bobby Andes lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay. Can you take it from here?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I came down the highway. I walked
dialog: for a long time. No one stopped for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ANDES
text: Sargent, back up slowly down the
dialog: shoulder. Put your signal lights
dialog: on.
text: They move against the traffic for only a few minutes.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Stop the car! Stop the car! I came
text: out of that barbed wire fence.
text: Right there, next to the reflector.
dialog: I remember that.
text: The officer stops the car.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Let’s get out and walk. You said
dialog: you walked out here, right?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY, WEST TEXAS. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 38
text: The men get out of the car and crawl under the barbed wire
text: fence. Tony surveys the desert landscape. Bobby puts out his
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I came up this way because I walked
dialog: along in that arroyo over there.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: This is part of the old Valdes
dialog: place. There’s a cattle station
dialog: down that way a bit next to where
dialog: they burn their garbage. This road

scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BEDROOM. MORNING -- 39
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS.

text: nervously fondling the gold cross around her neck.
scene_heading: EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - OLD VALDES PLACE, WEST TEXAS. DAY -- 40
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: Tony is standing stunned. His eyes are wet. In the distance
text: there is a three sided concrete pen filled with what is left
text: of burned garbage. In the middle of the garbage is a charred
text: and_ ripped red velvet sofa that someone has thrown out. Lying
text: on the sofa we see what seems to be a pair of naked lovers
text: intertwined. They do not move. Their white skin gleams in the
text: hot sun.
text: Tony begins to move slowly towards the lovers and lowers
text: himself to his knees in front of them.
text: The two of them look small. Like children. White and naked in
text: the bright daylight. Bobby lifts the girl’s head gently in
text: his hand. Tony sees her face from the side, her long red hair
text: tangled in the blood across her mouth.
text: Tony is in shock and can’t speak. Bobby lowers India’s head
text: carefully back onto the arm of the sofa and climbs over
text: slowly to the other side. He pushes the other body back
text: gently by the shoulders. Tony stares at the dark red hair.
text: He sees Laura’s mouth open like she is crying out, her cheeks
text: and eyes contorted with pain. Bobby Andes holds her head up
text: for him to see. Her small gold cross dangles from her neck
text: and catches the sun.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Is this your wife?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Is she all right?
text: The woman's face is white. The eyes fixed. Bobby does not

dialog: answer it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mom? Is that you? Is everything all
dialog: right?
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN'S BEDROOM. MORNING -- 43
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm fine. I just wanted to hear
dialog: your voice. I miss you.
text: A rustling sound as Sam drops the phone and then picks it up
text: again. We hear movement in the background and a muffled
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You woke me up. I’m still in bed.
dialog: It’s Sunday morning mom. Can I call
dialog: you later?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yeah. I’m sorry sweetheart. Go back
dialog: to sleep.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: FLASHBACK - EXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK. NOVEMBER 1996 -- 44
speaker_heading: EVENING.
text: Susan at 22 is coming out of the door of Bergdorf’s and turns
text: to walk uptown. There is a young man lingering in the next
text: doorway watching her. He steps out just ahead of her and
text: walks in the same direction she is walking. He walks slower
text: than she does and they are now only a few feet apart. She
text: realizes that she knows him, or thinks she knows him. She
text: quickens her pace.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Edward? Edward!
text: Edward turns around. He is handsome, beautiful in a boyish
text: way. It is striking how much Edward looks like Tony from
text: “Nocturnal Animals” although he has lighter hair, is younger
text: and clean shaven. It is beginning to snow and starting to get
dialog: dark.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Susan! God it’s good to see someone
dialog: I know.
text: He looks her up and down.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You look beautiful. As always.
text: They kiss on the cheek. As they do, Edward pulls her close.
text: We see him breathe in deeply and close his eyes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are you doing in New York?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I am here for a scholarship
dialog: interview at Columbia.
dialog: 45
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Columbia? I thought that you were
dialog: at the University of Texas,
dialog: becoming a great writer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I am. Becoming a great writer? I
dialog: don’t know. Are you still at Yale
dialog: becoming a great artist?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Columbia graduate school. Art
dialog: History.
text: They look silently at each other for a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know anyone here?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Just you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Would you like to have dinner?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Walk me home and I’11l drop these

speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you. I miss Texas men.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. MR. CHOW RESTAURANT, NEW YORK. LATER THAT 45
speaker_heading: EVENING.
text: Susan and Edward are finished with dinner and are having
text: drinks. It is clear that they have already had a few as the
text: atmosphere between them is warm and intimate.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You know, you were my first crush
dialog: when we were at Hastings. I really
dialog: only spent so much time with your
dialog: brother to be around you.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And you were his first crush.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What? I had no idea Cooper was gay.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don’t think he did either. Then.
dialog: But he was obsessed with you. If I
dialog: hadn't caught you looking at me all
dialog: the time I would have thought the
dialog: two of you were sleeping together.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I feel terrible that I haven’t
dialog: spoken to him in a few years. I
dialog: haven't been a very good friend. I
dialog: hope that I didn’t hurt him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You’re good you know. Most guys
dialog: would be freaked out to find out
dialog: that their best friend had been in
dialog: love with them. Call him, he’d like
dialog: that. My parents have basically
dialog: disowned him. They don’t really
dialog: speak anymore.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Are you kidding? You know my
dialog: parents. Religious, conservative,
dialog: sexist, racist, materialistic,
text: Republican, narcissistic.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What do you really think Susan?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It’s true. They’re pretty narrow.
dialog: They look at us as just an
dialog: extension of themselves. They can’t
dialog: accept Cooper for who he is. I’m
dialog: not sure how I will fare.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Aren’t you being a little hard on
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No. I don’t think so. They have a
dialog: pretty antiquated idea about how I
dialog: am supposed to live my life. My
dialog: mother especially.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’ve always loved your mother. She
dialog: was great with me when my father
dialog: died.
text: Edward looks at her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You both have the same kind of
dialog: sadness in your eyes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You and your mother.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What a weird thing to say.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’m sorry. I hope that doesn’t
dialog: offend you. But she has always
dialog: seemed sad to me. She has sad eyes.
dialog: I’ve thought that since I was a
dialog: little boy. You have the same eyes.
dialog: They're beautiful.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Please don’t say that. I don’t want
dialog: to be like my mother.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I always envied your family. I felt
text: like a complete imposter at school.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I thought I was the only one that
dialog: felt that way.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I tried so hard to seem perfect.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: And you don’t feel that way?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No.
text: Edward looks at her. He smiles.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: But that’s exactly what makes you
dialog: so perfect.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You'll definitely make a great
dialog: novelist. You’ve created a
dialog: completely fictitious character in
dialog: your head.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No. I don’t believe that.
text: He looks into her eyes.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did you give up on becoming an
dialog: artist?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I’m too cynical to be an artist. I
dialog: think to be good, you have to
dialog: create from some sort of place
dialog: inside that I’m not sure that I
dialog: have.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You really underestimate yourself
dialog: you know.
text: Susan stares directly into Edward’s eyes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Would you come home with me?
dialog: 46
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Wow. That’s is a bit forward. Not
dialog: what I’d expect from a Texas
dialog: debutante.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You know debutantes are all sluts.
dialog: (Pause) And you know, you were my
dialog: first crush too.
text: Edward smiles at this.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I know.
text: She smiles at him. He smiles back.
text: Edward's face slowly morphs into that of Tony’s as our
text: flashback dissolves.
speaker_heading: END FLASHBACK
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, WEST TEXAS. LATER THAT DAY. 46
text: As Edward’s smile fades in our flashback, Tony’s stunned face
text: becomes clear as he sits alone in the glass room.
text: Bobby Andes walks into the room.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: We got a report from Ozona. Someone
text: else harassed on the highway last
dialog: night just like you.
text: Bobby hesitates. He puts his hand on Tony’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: If you don’t mind, we’1ll need your
dialog: finger prints.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Mine?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: No offense, it’s just that we found
dialog: some prints on the trunk of your
dialog: car.
dialog: 56.
text: Bobby pauses.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s somethin else.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: We got a cause of death.
text: Tony slumps in his chair.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Your wife had a fractured skull.
text: She appears to have been struck
text: with a hammer, or baseball bat.
dialog: Only once or twice. Your daughter
dialog: had a harder time. She was
text: suffocated.
text: He waits for Tony to take this in.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
text: She also had a broken arm.
text: He watches Tony. He pauses.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: And they had both been raped.
text: Tony stares blankly ahead.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You were also right about that
dialog: trailer.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: I mean your friends took your folks
dialog: there just like you thought.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: How do you know that?
dialog: 47
dialog: 48
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: We found your wife’s finger prints
text: on the bed post.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Whose trailer is it?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: He’s clear. Guy who lives in El
dialog: Paso. The place had been broken
text: into. Someone’s been living in it.
dialog: We got other prints too in the
dialog: trailer. We’ll have to check them
dialog: against the owner’s and see if we
dialog: can separate them out. But I’m
dialog: hopeful. The owner hasn’t been
dialog: there since last fall. (Pause) It
text: looks promising.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Promising?

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me this before?
text: Susan’s mother sits quietly fuming. She speaks calmly but

speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: You are actually going to leave New
dialog: York and move to Austin to go to
dialog: the god damned University of Texas?
dialog: I thought you loved Columbia.

speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to their “great art

text: She pauses a moment.
dialog: Susan, why are you doing this? I
dialog: mean, where is this going to go?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What do you mean where is it going
dialog: to go? I’m going to marry Edward.
dialog: That’s where it’s going to go.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: This is a ridiculous conversation.
dialog: You're too young to get married.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh really? Didn't you try to
dialog: convince me just last summer that I
dialog: should marry Bass?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: That was different. Bass is your
dialog: equal.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh my god, did you just say that?
dialog: You really just said that? That
dialog: came out of your mouth?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Why do you always think the worst
dialog: of me? That is not what I meant.
dialog: What I meant is that you are very,
dialog: very strong willed and as sweet as
dialog: he is, Edward is just too weak for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Weak isn’t the word I would use to
dialog: describe Edward. Sensitive is the
dialog: word I would use and that’s
dialog: certainly not a word that I could
dialog: ever use to describe anyone in this
dialog: family, except maybe Cooper.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Don’t bring Cooper into this. Come
dialog: on Susan. You may not think that we
dialog: care about the same things but
dialog: you’re wrong. In a few years, all
dialog: these “bourgeois” things as you so
dialog: like to call them will become very
dialog: important to you. Edward won’t be
dialog: able to give them to you. He has no
dialog: money. He’s not driven. He’s not
dialog: ambitious. And if you marry Edward,
dialog: I can promise you that your father
dialog: is not going to give them to you
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, he’s not driven in the way that
dialog: you want him to be, but you’re
dialog: wrong. He’s strong. Stronger than I
dialog: am in a lot of ways. He just has a
dialog: different kind of strength.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: A different kind of strength? And
dialog: what kind of strength is that?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The strength to believe in himself.
dialog: To believe in me.
text: Anne collects herself and leans into the table.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Susan, keep seeing him if you have
dialog: to. Live with him. I don’t care,
dialog: but don’t marry him. I understand
dialog: what you see in Edward. I get it.
text: Susan starts to turn her head away
speaker_heading: ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: No wait. I do. He’s the opposite of
dialog: your father. He’s a romantic, but
dialog: he’s also very fragile. I saw that
dialog: when his father died.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: When did you become so
dialog: compassionate and understanding.
dialog: 49
dialog: 60.
text: Anne glares at her.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Don’t do this. You’1ll regret it and
dialog: you'll only hurt Edward in the end.
dialog: What you love about him now, you'll
dialog: hate about him in a few years. You
dialog: may not realize it but you and I
dialog: are a lot more alike than you
dialog: think.
text: Anne spots a piece of lint on Susan’s sweater. She reaches
text: forward and pulls it off. Susan watches her mother do this
text: and recoils slightly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're wrong. You and I are nothing
dialog: alike.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Really? Just wait. We all
dialog: eventually turn into our mothers.
text: Anne turns away from Susan and takes a sip of her martini.

scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 49
text: Susan is sitting on the small sofa in her room, staring out
text: into the LA night.
text: She flicks open her computer, looks at the note from Edward
text: and types in the e-mail address.
text: She rapidly types out a note to him but then deletes it and
text: starts again. After a bit of deliberation she writes:
dialog: Dear Edward,
dialog: I am reading your book. It’s devastating. I am deeply moved.
dialog: It is beautifully written. I would love to meet on Tuesday
dialog: evening. Let me know if you are still free. Much to say.

speaker_heading: EVENING.
text: Tony is on his computer. He is wearing a pair of boxer shorts
text: and an old tee shirt. There is a bottle of Jack Daniels and a
text: glass next to him. He looks rough. He checks his e-mails.
dialog: There is one from Bobby Andes.
text: Tony opens the attachment and takes a deep breath. He looks
text: at a photo of a clean shaven man. Tony looks carefully.
text: Covers the bottom half of the face with a piece of paper.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes. I did.

scene_heading: EVENING -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s like the whole thing is a
dialog: blur.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: This guy’s finger prints were on
dialog: your car. They were also found at
dialog: the trailer. His name is Steve
dialog: Adams. He has a record in
text: California, a stolen car with an
dialog: acquittal on a rape charge. We've
text: put out an A.P.B. for him. He is
dialog: our only lead right now. No one has

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Fuck. What's wrong with you man!
dialog: Don’t you want these guys put away?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Of course I do! It’s all just a

scene_heading: INT. HASTINGS RESIDENCE - TONY’S BEDROOM. LATER THAT NIGHT 53

dialog: 63.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, HOUSTON TEXAS. WINTER. DAWN. 54
text: A bleak hillside. Brown grass and bare trees as Tony appears
text: over the hill in his running clothes. He has on a light
text: jacket and long tight running pants. He is clean shaven. He
text: looks thinner. It is remarkable how he now looks almost
text: exactly like Edward. Dark circles ring his eyes and a certain
text: dead quality is evident in his expression.
speaker_heading: TONY V.O.
dialog: I know it was him!
speaker_heading: ANDES V.O.
dialog: Well, that may be but nobody’s seen
dialog: him around here lately. Now listen,
dialog: I’ve got to be honest with you.
dialog: Right now it’s not looking good.
dialog: Sometimes these cases go for months
dialog: or even years without a break. You
dialog: need to prepare yourself for that.
text: Tony stops running and catches his breath.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. HASTINGS RESIDENCE - TONY’S BATHROOM. EVENING. 55
text: Tony stands still in the shower. Just letting the hot water
text: run over him.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BATHROOM. EVENING. 56
text: Susan is in the shower leaning against the wall, just letting
text: the water run over her face and body. She is deep in thought.
text: CUT AWAY SHOTS OF TONY. LYING IN BED. DRINKING. HOLDING HIS

text: the water washes over her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN V.O.

speaker_heading: EDWARD V.O.

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION, WEST TEXAS. DAY. 58
text: Bobby Andes is standing outside on the curb smoking. He is
text: thinner and his complexion is sallow. Tony walks towards him
text: and the two men shake hands.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You look different.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No beard. Thinner. You look
dialog: different too.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Yeah.
text: He takes a drag off of his cigarette.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: I’1l tell you what we've got. We
text: have an attempted hold up of a
text: supermarket in the mall just before
dialog: closing time. We caught one fella
dialog: and one got killed but one got
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What do you want me to do?
dialog: 59
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: See if you recognize the fella we
dialog: caught. You might also take a look
text: at the dead one too, although it is
dialog: not really necessary. We know who
dialog: he is.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Steve Adams, the one that you
dialog: called “Turk” and that I e-mailed
dialog: you about last year.
text: Andes takes another long drag from his cigarette and gestures
text: towards the door.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on in.
text: He flicks his cigarette onto the pavement and turns to lead
text: Tony into the station.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, WEST TEXAS. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 59
text: Tony follows Andes down the hall. We pass a bathroom with an
text: open door and a prisoner handcuffed to the sink.
text: Tony and Andes are now in the same glass room that Tony sat
dialog: in before.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Are you afraid of looking these
dialog: fellas in the eyes? Lettin them see
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Good. I think it might help this
dialog: fella talk.
text: He nods at the officer by the door. Four men are sent in.
text: Tony stares at one of the men. The man’s eyes pass over Tony
text: without recognition. Tony turns to Bobby Andes.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes. (He whispers)
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Yes. Yes what?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: That’s him. The one on the left.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s Lou. The one who made me
dialog: drive into the brush and left me
dialog: there.
text: Andes motions to the officer at the door to lead the others
text: out. He nods at Lou to stay back. Lou begins to sweat.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: This fella? He don’t seem to
dialog: understand. Lou, hey you. Is your
dialog: name Lou?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: You know my name. I told you.
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You ever see this man before, Lou?
dialog: Think carefully. You ever seen him?
text: Lou is staring at Tony.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: No. I don’t know him. Who is he?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Tell him Tony, tell him who he is.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Last summer, this man Lou and his
dialog: friends forced us off the road on
text: the Interstate. Then two of them
dialog: forced their way into my car with
dialog: my wife and daughter and then this
dialog: man—
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: This man here? Lou?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes. Lou made me drive his car and
dialog: took me into the desert where he
dialog: made me get out. Later my wife and
dialog: daughter were found dead at the
dialog: same place.
text: Andes now leans up against the wall and gets his face very
text: close to Lou’s.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: What do you say to that, Lou? What
dialog: do you know about this man’s wife
dialog: and daughter?
text: Lou looks afraid.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: I don’t know what you are talking
dialog: about. I never saw him in my life.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: What do you know about Ray and
dialog: Turk?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Who? What are you an owl? Are you
dialog: an owl Lou?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: I never heard of them.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You never heard of them?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: No sir.
text: Andes leans back against the wall and stares intently at Lou.
text: Lou begins to tremble.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Officer, you can take him out.
text: An officer leads Lou out. Tony, relieved, sits down.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you sure this is the man?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Absolutely. Yes.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Would you swear it in a court of
dialog: law under penalty of perjury?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Good. We’ve got Lou now. We will
dialog: charge him with Murder.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You have enough evidence?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Oh you bet. We got you and his
text: prints on both the car and the
dialog: trailer.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Then he went back to the trailer
dialog: after leaving me?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Looks like it. Probably he went
dialog: back and told them where he left
dialog: you, and that’s why they went back
dialog: with the bodies. They were going to
dialog: kill you. I’m betting your friend
text: Ray is the third guy in the holdup.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You’1l have to come back for the
dialog: trial. Meanwhile, I’m gonna find

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You didn’t sleep again did you?
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You know me. I never sleep. My ex
dialog: husband used to call me a
text: “nocturnal animal”.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Your ex husband? What ex husband? I
dialog: didn’t know that you had an ex
dialog: husband. Since when?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: When I was in graduate school. It
dialog: was only for a couple of years.
dialog: It’s weird, I’ve been thinking
dialog: about him a lot lately and then a
dialog: few days ago he sent me a book he’s
text: written. It’s violent and it’s sad.
dialog: He called it “Nocturnal Animals”
dialog: and dedicated it to me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Did you love him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes. I loved him. He was a writer.
dialog: I didn’t have faith in him. I
dialog: panicked and I did something
dialog: horrible to him. Something
dialog: unforgivable. Really.
dialog: 61
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You left him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I left him. In a brutal way, for
text: the handsome and dashing Hutton.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Who is indeed very handsome and
dialog: dashing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes. Do you ever feel like your
dialog: life has turned into something that
dialog: you never intended?
text: She looks at her and pauses a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: No. Of course you don’t. You just
dialog: started living your life.

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You really didn’t get any sleep did

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM EXHIBITION SPACE, LOS ANGELES. THAT AFTERNOON. 61
text: Our screen is filled with the image of a Damien Hirst calf
text: floating in formaldehyde. The calf has been shot with arrows.
text: Our camera pulls back and we see that Susan is standing
text: staring quietly at the sculpture.
text: The space is gigantic and white. A show is being installed.
text: There are graphic abstract paintings on the walls.
text: As Susan turns to walk away, a painting catches her eye and
text: she stops dead in her tracks. It is a large black and white
text: painting that says REVENGE.
text: SAGE ROSS, 38, walks over to Susan. She is the museum’s
text: director and is tense and tight in her manner. She is dressed
text: in an absurd “conceptual” top and flat men’s shoes.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where did this come from?
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: What do you mean where did it come
dialog: from? You bought it for us. Don’t
dialog: you remember. It was part of the
dialog: series we showed about 8 years ago.
dialog: Great isn’t it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Sage is holding a phone with a black and white image on the
text: screen and the loud sound of breathing coming from it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: Oh my god, it is so cool. It is an
dialog: app that let’s me watch Willow
text: while she is sleeping in her crib!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Really? Do you not trust your
dialog: nanny?
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: No, I do, but I hate her. And I
dialog: like to be more involved with
dialog: Willow during the day. Here, look.
text: There she is in her crib. The sound
dialog: is amazing. I can hear her breathe
dialog: and even talk to her if I want to.
text: Sage hands the phone to Susan, who stares at the black and
text: white image of the little girl in her crib. As she watches
text: she sees someone move behind the crib, and then for a quick
text: second she sees Ray look directly into the camera.
text: Susan gasps and drops the phone to the ground, shattering the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh my god, I’m so sorry.
dialog: 62
dialog: 63
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I thought I saw someone.
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: Of course you saw someone. It’s
text: Willow. She’s asleep in her crib.
text: Sage bends down to the floor and picks up the phone. It is
text: still working and the little girl is sleeping peacefully in
text: her crib.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I’m sorry about the screen.
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: It’s all right, the new ones come
dialog: out next week.
text: Susan is still shaken.
speaker_heading: SAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we? Everyone is waiting in
text: the conference room.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM CONFERENCE ROOM. AFTERNOON -- MINUTES LATER. 62
text: We are viewing the scene from behind glass. A group of people
text: sit around a table. They are talking and looking over
text: financial statements. Susan stares into space. She sits at
text: the head of the table. She is deep in thought.
text: CLOSE-UP SHOTS OF TONY/EDWARD. WE CAN'T TELL WHICH. HE IS
text: LYING IN BED DISTRAUGHT. WE ARE INTIMATE WITH HIM AND CAN
text: ALMOST FEEL HIM BREATHE.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM CONFERENCE ROOM. AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS. 63
text: Our camera moves into the room.
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: Anyway, I think we have to cut her
dialog: loose. She’s not what she sold
dialog: herself as when we hired her.
dialog: 73.
text: Another member of the group LINDA ADDISON, 50 speaks up. Her
text: breasts are oddly oversized and squeezed into a tiny top.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I disagree. I think we should keep
dialog: her for now.
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Because she’s great. Because we all
dialog: like her. She just needs our
dialog: support. And a bit of time.
text: SAMANTHA VAN HELSING, 45, interrupts Linda. Her face fills
text: our screen. She is stretched and pulled to the extreme. Her
text: lips are swollen and her general appearance is close to that
dialog: of a burn victim.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: But it’s not working. We need to
dialog: fire her. There’s an awesome
dialog: candidate that we could steal from
dialog: the Hammer if we move fast.
text: Susan is all of a sudden alert.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I agree with Linda. We hired her
dialog: and we need to support her.
text: The room is surprised by Susan’s response.
text: Susan looks at Samantha. She is taken a back and looks at her
text: almost as though she has never seen her before.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: New doctor?
text: Samantha glares at her.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No. New haircut.
speaker_heading: SAGE
dialog: But Susan, you were the one who
dialog: brought this up last week. You
dialog: wanted to make a change.

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, now I think we should keep

speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Sometimes maybe it’s not a good
dialog: idea to change things quite so
dialog: much.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW RESIDENCE, LOS ANGELES. THAT EVENING. 64
text: Susan walks into the house. Dead silence. She places her bag
text: in the entry hall. She stares out at the lawn. It is dusk and
text: the city lights are just becoming visible through the mist.
text: The large plinth that held the Koons is now empty and the
text: lawn cleaned up. She walks through the living room which is
text: now immaculate but bare. Susan pours herself a drink. The

scene_heading: EXT. RAY’S MOBILE HOME. AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS. 66
text: The two men walk through the scruffy trees until they can see
text: a mobile home and an old wooden deck about a hundred feet
text: away. Ray is sitting on a toilet that has been installed
text: outside on the deck. There is a beer beside him. He is
text: shirtless, his pants are down around his ankles and he is on
text: a cordless phone smoking a cigarette.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: His name is Ray Marcus and someone
dialog: named him as a frequent companion
dialog: of Lou Bates and Steve Adams.
text: Tony stares harder. Clearly agitated.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Part time electrician. Part time
dialog: plumber hence the clever toilet
dialog: facilities. Not a bad match to both
dialog: your description and the fella in
dialog: the holdup. No fingerprints but we
dialog: knew that before.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I wonder why there aren’t any
dialog: finger prints.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: His hands were probably on your
dialog: wife.
text: Tony winces.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: His record is clean except for a
dialog: rape charge that was dropped. I got
text: out of the barman at a place called
dialog: “Line Camp Bar” that he lives here
dialog: with a girl called Leila and that
dialog: he keeps another place to pick up
dialog: women that she doesn’t know about.
dialog: Probably your murder trailer before
dialog: it got notorious. Does he look like
dialog: he could be the guy?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah. That’s him.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Good. Let’s go talk to him.
text: Andes walks out of the brush.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Ray.
text: Ray looks at him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What the fuck man! Who the hell are
dialog: you. Get off my property.
text: Ray speaks into the phone and then hangs up.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l call you back.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: I want to ask you some questions.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Fuck you. I’m occupied at the
dialog: moment.
text: Bobby Andes holds up a plastic case with a badge in the
text: window. His other hand is in his jacket.
text: Ray squints.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: A few questions, that’s all. We
dialog: need you to come with us.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What for? I ain’t done nothin.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Didn't say you did.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Ask me here.

dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Naw. We need you to take a little
dialog: drive with us. Finish what you’re
dialog: doin and let’s go.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You mind turnin around?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Believe me I wish I could but I

text: Andes tosses Ray’s shirt to him from the back of a chair.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on. Get dressed.
scene_heading: INT. TONY’S CAR, WEST TEXAS. AFTERNOON -- MINUTES LATER. 67

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Why yes, that’s what we’re doing
dialog: ain't it?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You ain’t read me my rights.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You know your rights, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY

dialog: You're helping me out. I haven’t

text: Ray looks out the window.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Aw come on man, you don’t need to

dialog: questions, ain’t I?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Well I don’t know. Seems like I
dialog: don’t know no more about that
dialog: holdup than I knew before. Tell you
dialog: what. There’s somthin else I'd like
dialog: to ask you about. You recognize
dialog: this car?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What car?
text: Andes bangs his fist against the headliner of the car.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: This car. The one we’re in.
text: Tony takes a deep breath. Closes his eyes for a second.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This car? Why should I recognize
dialog: this fucking car?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: It ain’t familiar to you? It don’t
dialog: remind you of nothin? Take you
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No man. Why should it? It may be
dialog: taking me somewhere but damned if I
dialog: know where.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You don’t remember driving it?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: How about the driver?
text: Tony’s heart begins to pound.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: The guy driving. My friend Tony
dialog: here. You remember him?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I can’t see him. Make him turn
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Stop the car, Tony.
dialog: 79.
text: Tony slows and stops on the dusty road. He feels the heavy

speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Turn around and look at this piece

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: ANDES

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: You remember him, Tony?
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Refresh his memory.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Last summer on the Interstate.
text: Ray looks at him, staring. Waiting.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Tell him what you remember he did.
text: Tony looks directly at Ray.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You killed my wife and my daughter.
text: His voice is trembling. Ray’s eyes enlarge.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're crazy man. I never killed
dialog: nobody.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Tell him the whole thing.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You and your buddies on the
dialog: Interstate. You forced us off the
dialog: road.
text: His voice is quivering and his eyes are filling with water.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Tell him who his buddies were.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Lou and Turk.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Remember that Ray? Remember horsing

dialog: chicken with other cars?
text: Ray’s voice is very soft.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You’re crazy man. That’s crazy.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You made us stop and we had a flat
text: tire. Lou and Turk fixed it. Then
dialog: you and Turk got into my car with
dialog: my wife and daughter and forced me
dialog: into your car with Lou.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: What then Tony?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Lou took me out into the brush and
dialog: kicked me out. Then you came back
dialog: in my car. You called me and tried
dialog: to lure me into a trap. You went to
dialog: where Lou had left me.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: What did you go back there for Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're fucking crazy man.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Tell him what we found there Tony.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You tell him.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Do I need to? Don’t you know Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You’re crazy man. I don’t know what
dialog: the hell you are talking about.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The bodies of my wife and child,
dialog: which you took back there and
dialog: dumped.
text: A slight smile on Ray’s face. Almost imperceptible.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're the one. I know you.
text: While this conversation has been going on, Andes has slipped
text: the gun out of his pocket and is holding it in his lap
text: pointing toward Ray.

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Whaddaya say Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're crazy man.
text: Andes points the gun at Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're making a big mistake man.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: I don’t think so Ray. Put your arms
text: out slowly.
text: Andes slaps a pair of hand cuffs around Ray’s wrists.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You ain’t got no right.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Speaking of rights, I want you to
dialog: know that I’m recording this
dialog: conversation.
text: He holds up a small recorder.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: There. All clear?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: We're going back to a place you may
dialog: remember. You can help by telling
dialog: me about it. If you don’t remember,
dialog: Tony does.
text: He looks towards Tony. Tony pulls back onto the dirt road.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I’m sorry you lost your folks man,
dialog: it’s a shame. But I didn't have
dialog: nothing to do with it.
text: They pass the old adobe church. They drive until the trailer

dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s this place?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know this place.
text: Ray looks at Tony with a deep long stare.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Honest to God, I don’t.

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Wanna get out Tony?
text: Andes opens his door.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Care to look inside Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Let's just take a look.
text: They get out of the car. Tony lags behind.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER, WEST TEXAS. AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS. 68
text: Bobby Andes kicks the door open and shoves Ray inside. The
text: walls are blank and weathered. There is a small stove and
text: fire tools by the door and a bed with metal bedposts and a
text: trash box full of old newspapers.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Raped them on the bed I presume.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I never raped nobody.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Come on Ray, we got your record. We

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Fuck that. The charges were dropped
dialog: man. I ain’t never raped nobody.
text: Tony stands in front of Ray next to the bed.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I want to know Ray, the exact story
dialog: of what you did to them.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You’1l have to ask somebody else
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I want to know what they said. I
dialog: want to know what my wife said and
dialog: what my daughter said.
text: Tony stares at Ray in silence.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to know how you killed them.
dialog: I want to know if they knew what
dialog: was happening to them. I want to
dialog: know if they hurt. I want to know
dialog: what they felt. Answer me, you
dialog: fucking bastard!
text: Shot of Ray’s eyes, his teeth. A slight grin through the

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You'll take this the wrong way but

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: But no one ever writes about

text: Edward looks down at the ground.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know. But I don’t know what else

text: Edward is clearly devastated.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Maybe I need a break from it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Maybe you do.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I don’t know what to do. Maybe I
dialog: don’t have a book in me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Get some space from it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Please don’t start that again. It
dialog: makes me feel like you don’t
dialog: believe in me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I didn’t say that.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No, but your face says it. Your
dialog: little “sighs” say it. The way you
dialog: keep telling me that I should go
dialog: back to school says it.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I do think you should go back to
dialog: school. I think you need to be
dialog: realistic. I mean come on, you’re
dialog: really smart. A part time job ina
text: book store and writing a novel is a
dialog: romantic idea but is this really
dialog: our life? Is this what it’s going
dialog: to be? For how long?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You sound just like your mother.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, you always said I was so like
dialog: her. That’s why I hate reading your
dialog: work. You always get so fucking
dialog: defensive about it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Of course I’m defensive. Do you
dialog: know what it’s like to put yourself
text: out on a limb creatively and then
dialog: to have someone you love read what
dialog: you've written and not understand
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, I don’t because I’m not
dialog: creative, Edward.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That’s because you’ve chosen not to
dialog: be!
text: She glares at him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: The DA says there is not enough

dialog: He needs corroboration.
text: Tony is silent.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m real sorry Tony. It’s a god

text: Tony looks at Andes.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s this fella called Jenks. He’s
dialog: the lawyer that the court
dialog: appointed. Smart ass from Dallas.
dialog: He and the DA made a deal and Ray
text: gets off. Politics.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: When did you tell me that you were

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: They want to push me out. They have

dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t understand what you are
dialog: talking about. Would they drop a
dialog: murder case to do that?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Gives them the reason. They said
dialog: the case wasn’t well prepared, was
dialog: a sloppy job, slapdash, no
dialog: evidence, evidence gathered
dialog: improperly, won’t stand up in
dialog: court. The DA is too much of a
dialog: chicken shit to take on a case that

text: Tony mulls this over.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: They're not dropping Lou.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It’s no fucking good if they don’t

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Good. That's what I was hoping

dialog: that.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You never told me about the cancer.

speaker_heading: ANDES

speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyway Ray claims that he was with
dialog: Leila whatever her name is and she
text: backs him up, and her aunt backs
dialog: her up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So what are we going to do?
text: He looks at Tony for a long time which makes Tony nervous.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: It’s a question of how serious you

dialog: get me?
text: Bobby can’t eat his food.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Can’t eat. Might throw up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: How do you get along if you can’t
dialog: eat?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: It depends. Sometimes I can eat,
dialog: sometimes I can’t. This place

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I need you to eat something.

speaker_heading: ANDES

dialog: I thought you said-
text: Andes coughs.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Look, I’ve got nothin to loose, and
dialog: I can’t let this ass-hole DA fuck
dialog: up my last case. I also can’t stand
text: by and watch a murderer go free.
dialog: I’ve watched too many sick fucks
dialog: like Ray Marcus get off over the
dialog: years. Are you willing to go
dialog: outside of strict procedure on
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes.
text: Andes's cell phone rings. He answers.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Ray is at “Line Camp”. I’m going to
dialog: let that little idiot get nice and
dialog: liquored up and then I’m going to
dialog: go grab his ass and take him out to
dialog: my camp. I want you to come too. I

dialog: for each other? We’re perfect for

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No Edward. We're not. We might be

dialog: live in the real world. I need a

dialog: need a future that is more
dialog: structured. I want to be the person

dialog: can’t.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: But you are, you are. Just stop.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I really wanted to be this person

dialog: did, but I’m just not that person.
dialog: I just don’t have your kind of

speaker_heading: EDWARD

dialog: Weak. I’m weak. That’s what you

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That is not the point.

speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey man. This ain’t legal. If this

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: It’s all the legal we need boy.

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You lied to me. There ain’t no new

text: the shadow of the bedroom he sees Bobby coming back into the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Shoot him Tony!
text: Ray moves towards him as Tony panics, hesitates and moves

dialog: for the door.
text: Andes rushes into the room and grabs the gun from Tony as the
text: men rush out the door. Andes follows.
text: There is a shot. Then two more. Lou lies wounded on the path
text: and Andes stands with the gun in his hand as Ray escapes into
dialog: the desert.
text: Transfixed, Andes walks over to Lou and shoots him in the
dialog: head.
text: We hear a loud pop.
scene_heading: INT. MORROW HOUSE - SUSAN’S BEDROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS. 80
text: There is a loud pop on the large plate glass window.
text: Susan is startled. As she walks over to the window she sees

speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'll live to regret this. I regret

speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You know, I don’t even believe in

speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: I’m so sorry, Susan. I feel
dialog: useless.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're anything but useless. You
dialog: always seem to know exactly what to
dialog: do. Thank you.
text: Hutton reaches across and clenches Susan’s hand.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t think I can ever look at

text: Susan begins to cry. Hutton reaches across and holds her.
speaker_heading: HUTTON
dialog: He’s never going to know about it.

scene_heading: EXT. ANDES CABIN, WEST TEXAS. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS. 83
text: Our camera is on Tony’s face as he stares down at Lou’s body.
text: He stands still, seemingly in a trance. Andes walks over to
text: him. Tony places his hands up to his face as he begins to
text: breathe erratically. The sounds coming from deep within his
text: body are guttural and animal-like as he cries out. His
text: sobbing becomes hysterical. Out of control. He is gasping for
dialog: alr.
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: Tony. You know I had to shoot him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t give a god damned fuck that
dialog: you shot him! I’m glad that you
dialog: shot him! I’m glad that he’s dead!
dialog: I should have done it when I had

dialog: I should have stopped it! I should
dialog: have stopped it.

speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: It’s okay, it’s okay. You're okay.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I should have stopped it Bobby!

speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on. Get up. We have to go. If
text: Ray gets to the road he’1l
dialog: hitchhike. We need to catch him
dialog: before he gets a ride. When you get
text: to the fork in the road turn left.
dialog: That goes back towards where he
dialog: took your folks. He might hide
dialog: there although I doubt it. I
dialog: suspect he’s headed towards the
dialog: highway. I'll go that way.
text: He hands Tony a gun.
speaker_heading: ANDES (CONT’D)
dialog: Here. Take this. I have another one
text: in the car.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Are you in trouble for all of this?
speaker_heading: ANDES
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t give a shit.
dialog: I'm dying, remember?

text: Tony drives down the dark road. As his lights illuminate the
text: brush on either side of the road we see the trailer ahead.
text: Tony slows down for a moment and stares at the trailer. It is
text: dark, unlit. After a few minutes he stops the car and thinks.
text: He turns off his lights and backs the car slowly down the
text: road and eases it into a small clearing.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD, WEST TEXAS. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS. 85
text: Tony quietly gets out of the car and slowly starts towards
text: the trailer. He silently slips up the steps and inside the
text: unlocked door.
dialog: 86
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER, WEST TEXAS. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS. 86
text: In a sudden move he pushes the door open. There on the bed is
text: Ray, who sits up on his elbows shocked. Tony points the gun
text: directly at him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Christ. You. Where’s your pal?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: He’s on his way.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Your cop friends?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: They’re around.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Are they here?
text: Ray sits up and looks out of the window. Tony flicks on the
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Just me for the moment.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You and that fucking gun that you
dialog: don’t know how to use. What
dialog: happened to Lou?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: He’s dead.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What? That son of a bitch killed
dialog: him! That’s big trouble for your
dialog: friend, you know that?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Oh you don’t think so? And so just
dialog: what do you want. You and that
dialog: silly gun. I’ve seen how handy you
dialog: are with that thing.
text: Ray stands up. Tony cocks the gun.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sit the fuck down! Sit down or I
dialog: will fucking kill you!
text: Ray is stunned by the tone of Tony’s voice and backs up to
text: the bed and sits back down.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Listen man. Why does a nice guy
dialog: like you hang out with a guy like
dialog: Andes. He kills people.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You kill people.
text: Ray looks at Tony in disgust.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They had it coming to them. Your
dialog: fuckin wife. That kid.
text: Tony is livid. He is invigorated.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: But you got me wrong man. It was an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Accident! It was an accident!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I got a certain pride in how people
dialog: talk to me and there are certain
dialog: things I don’t put up with. Let me
dialog: tell you man, when someone accuses
dialog: me of something, that’s an insult.
dialog: It gives me the right. If my woman
dialog: accuses me of fucking somebody
dialog: else, then I go fuck somebody else.
dialog: If your fucking daughter thinks I’m
text: a rapist, then she gets raped.
text: Tony is livid.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nobody gets away with what you did.
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They don’t?
dialog: 105.
text: Tony is pointing the gun directly at Ray and closes his eyes
text: for a moment as he squeezes the handle of the gun. He is
text: almost in a trance.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: So why don’t you just kill me? Come
dialog: on man, you don’t know nothin. It’s
dialog: fun to kill people. You of all
dialog: people ought to try it sometime.
text: Ray is quietly sliding his hand under the pillow on the bed.
text: He has hidden a metal rod of some kind there and we see his
text: fingers slide around the handle.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Fun! Did you have fun killing my
dialog: wife and daughter! Get up. It’s
dialog: time for you to go.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go. Go on.
text: Ray surveys Tony and the room. He stands up slowly. One hand
text: is holding the fire poker behind his back.
text: Ray looks Tony in the face. He begins to grin.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Your wife. Yeah, I remember your
dialog: fuckin wife. I remember fuckin your
dialog: wife, but you’re too weak. To
dialog: fuckin weak. You’re too weak to do
dialog: anything about it.
text: Tony pulls the trigger and the gun goes off. It misses Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Son of a bitch!
text: Tony pulls the trigger again. Ray is hit and grabs at his
text: chest but is now moving towards Tony with the fire poker in
text: his hand. He swings it towards Tony’s face as our screen goes
text: dark. Absolute silence.
text: CUT TO BLACK.

scene_heading: INT. TRAILER, WEST TEXAS. DAY. 87
text: Our sound returns as we hear flies buzzing close by. Our
text: screen is black but begins to shift to a warm brown as murky
text: daylight starts to illuminate the image.
text: Tony is lying on the floor of the trailer. His head is
text: covered in blood that has began to crust over. As a fly
text: crawls across his face he slowly reaches up in pain to fan it
text: away. We see that there is a bloody gash across his face. His
text: eyes are covered in dried blood and as he claws at them we
text: realize that he has been blinded. Tony realizes this too.
text: He feels around and finds the gun. He holds onto it and finds
text: a chair and pulls himself up. Light is now pouring into the
text: room. He manages to get to his feet.
text: As he begins to stumble around the room he walks into
text: something. Someone. It is Ray. He is dead and lying in a pool
dialog: of blood.
text: Tony bends down and runs his hands over Ray’s face and lifts
text: the deadweight of the arm. He still holds the fire poker in
dialog: one hand.
text: Tony finds his way out of the trailer. As he does he falls to
dialog: the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER, WEST TEXAS. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 88
text: He drags himself into the brush and towards the road. He
text: struggles to reach into the air and fires the gun then drops
text: to the ground.
text: He tries to lift the gun back up in the air in an attempt to
text: fire it once again. As he rises to his knees he falls back to
text: the ground and onto the gun.
text: A loud gunshot. He has shot himself in the stomach. He is
text: still alive but begins to loose consciousness.

text: The sound of Tony’s heartbeat becomes louder and louder and
text: overtakes all other sound as our camera settles on his face.
dialog: With each beat we cut back and forth from his face, to that
