speaker_heading: MAHMOOD
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: OMAR

speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Right, so Simba & Pumba were out
dialog: on their own when all of a sudden

dialog: it is!’ — the big evil vulture
dialog: coming right at them!
dialog: (pauses — lost in thought)
speaker_heading: MAHMOOD
dialog: And then what dad?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Well Simba had to bring it down
dialog: or otherwise it would kill them —
text: so he grabbed a stone and chucked
text: it at the bird only he chucked it
dialog: so hard, it was such a strong
dialog: powerful throw that his arm went
dialog: all the way round and the stone
text: went right behind him — he threw
dialog: it so hard it went a mile behind
dialog: him — and it — hit Mufasa — wise
dialog: strong Mufasa, Simba’s dad — it
text: hit him accidentally on the head
dialog: and killed him.
speaker_heading: MAHMOOD
dialog: But didn’t Scar kill Mufasa?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: Yeah, in the film - but this is
dialog: real life I’m talking about? So
dialog: Simba had a choice. He could
dialog: either tell all his friends what
dialog: had happened and agree a
dialog: confusion or he could keep it a
dialog: secret and lead all his friends
dialog: in a big fight against Scar. What
dialog: do you think he did?
speaker_heading: MAHMOOD
dialog: He had to tell the truth?
speaker_heading: OMAR
dialog: (bit impatient) But he’s got to
dialog: fight Scar, hasn’t he? Telling

dialog: Simba give up?
speaker_heading: MAHMOOD
dialog: Simba would never give up.
dialog: 36

scene_heading: 4 LIONS SCRIPT at 31.10.09
