speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: ADONIS "DONNIE" CREED. SLOW MOTION - Stylized, backlit. All
text: muscles and sweat, ADONIS stands in a shaft of light. He
text: appears ready to explode into action. The MUSIC is a long,

speaker_heading: ROCKY (V.O.)
dialog: It's only a three step climb up

speaker_heading: ROCKY (V.0.)
dialog: "Cause the ring is the loneliest
dialog: place in the world where nobody can
dialog: help ya an' all ya dreams are

text: ADONIS'S eyes are fixated on on his unseen OPPONENT.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (V.0.)
dialog: ».-. Ya ask yaself, am I in here to

scene_heading: INT. RINGSIDE
text: BIANCA'S HEARING AID sharply dips in SOUND as the thunderous

scene_heading: INT. RING
text: ADONIS catches WHEELER with a PERFECTLY STRAIGHT right and

speaker_heading: BIANCA.
dialog: ADONIS has never smiled so broadly.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: Well, Adonis, it wasn't an epic
dialog: battle, but it was a hell of a beat
dialog: down - This is the first time, at
dialog: least in the heavier divisions,
dialog: that there has ever been father and
dialog: son undisputed title holders - Your
dialog: thoughts?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: I'm blessed with really good people
dialog: around me - You came to see
dialog: fighting and that's what you always
dialog: get with me and more!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: Now what?
scene_heading: INT. ARENA HALLWAY
text: ROCKY has a little bag with him, all his fight corner stuff,
text: swabs, gels. Tape.
text: ADONIS and BIANCA walk about twenty feet ahead of him.
text: ROCKY pauses in front of:
text: WHEELER'S DRESSING ROOM.
text: WHEELER sits COMPLETELY ALONE on a metal folding chair, eyes
text: red, tearing. A sad sight.
text: NO MUSIC. NO REVELERS. He's ALL ALONE except for LIL DUKE,
text: who packs equipment up. ADONIS steps into view...
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: ++. C'mon, what's up?
text: ROCKY and WHEELER make eye contact. ROCKY knows all to well
text: this special pain. He gives a sympathetic nod. ADONIS is
text: effected by the bleak realities of the dark side of this
dialog: sport.
text: They move off.
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - MGM GRAND
text: A huge suite back at the MGM GRAND. An ICE SCULPTURE made of
text: the name "Creed". The PARTY is in full swing. MUSIC. Girls.
text: Food. They cheer when ADONIS enters the room. ROCKY smiles.
text: Pulls him close.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: You earned it, kid.
text: Everywhere ADONIS moves, someone has their hands out, as if
text: reaching for the hem of his garment. We hear SNIPPETS of
dialog: overlapping conversation like:
speaker_heading: PRODUCER
dialog: When you get to LA, I gotta hook
dialog: you up with -
text: Very attractive GIRLS give very suggestive looks as ADONIS
text: passes through the well-wishers.
text: FLASHES go off as people take selfies. Some make SNAPS. It's
text: a frenzy.
text: ROCKY stands in the corner. PEOPLE around him taking selfies.
text: ADONIS poses for a selfie with a few HIGH END FANS. He sees a
text: MAN (ANTHONY), ten years his senior, staring at him.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (to Bianca)
dialog: Be right back.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: My brother.
text: ROCKY looks over and notices BIANCA'S confused expression.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Anthony?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Be right back.
text: ADONIS nods and moves off. This is unexpectedly emotional.
text: ROCKY goes to BIANCA, they talk.
text: ADONIS goes up to his BROTHER.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (energetic)
dialog: You looked great, brother, like our
dialog: Pops.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Didn't expect to see you, Anthony.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Well, I was around an' it's ‘bout
dialog: time... We're blood and you've done
dialog: something great tonight and I've
dialog: been acting the fool too long - I'm
dialog: real with that, I just had to get
dialog: over "myself" - Hasn't been easy
dialog: for me, man, the better you do, the
dialog: worse I felt about myself. It's
dialog: tough for an older brother to feel
dialog: like the younger brother, know what
dialog: I'm saying?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Mom know you're here?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: "Course, she wants this, too -
dialog: Look, man, I'm sorry for the ego
dialog: bullshit, it's over, right, I just
dialog: want to be part of it again, part
dialog: of where you're going, and I bring
dialog: something to the party, I've got
dialog: angles and ideas. You want me
dialog: around? Last time I looked, there
dialog: ain't many Creeds left.
text: ADONIS studies his BROTHER'S almost pleading expression and
text: they shake.
text: BIANCA sees the BROTHERS approach.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Bianca, this is Anthony.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Hey, heard a lot about you.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: And my "Unc", Rocky, who helps get
dialog: me through this.
text: ANTHONY is a little COOL with ROCKY.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Do you want to go?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Oh, yeah. Catch up with y'all
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Thank you, brother.
text: They move off.
text: ANTHONY and ROCKY lock eyes.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember me? Met me and my sister a
dialog: long time back at Pops funeral. Our
dialog: sister passed a few years back,
dialog: only me and him now - So you the
dialog: "White Daddy" runnin' the show?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (offended)
dialog: Nobody runs nothin' - Yo, where
dialog: were you when he needed somebody?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: - No offense, but we're real blood,
dialog: you're not -
dialog: (moves off)
dialog: Stallion, thanks for taking better
dialog: care of him than ya did our Pops...
text: ANTHONY walks off into the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MGM GRAND SUITE - NIGHT
text: Floor to ceiling windows, with an expansive view of the Las
dialog: Vegas Strip.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
text: It's a madhouse out there.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Crazy, right? Let ‘em enjoy it. My
dialog: victory's right here.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Your brother just shows up -
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Yeah, but hold that conversation
dialog: later, it's our time.
text: They share a kiss. She looks around the room. There's a room
text: service table with a CHAMPAGNE BUCKET in the middle.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look inside.
text: BIANCA sees TWO PINTS of ICE CREAM inside the bucket.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd that come from?
text: ADONIS sits on the bed. Takes his shirt off. Exhausted.
text: Bianca sits next to him. She takes the chocolate ice cream
text: with her.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Babe. How do you feel?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Like "Champion of the world"?
text: ADONIS smiles.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (tongue in cheek)
dialog: Nah, I feel empty and sad inside.
text: ADONIS looks at her and leans back.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: So could ya feed the champ some ice
dialog: cream?
text: BIANCA looks at him.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: C'mon, I've had a rough night.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I had a "rougher" night than you
dialog: had tonight.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: -.. There's injuries everywhere.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Sure there are.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: C'mon, can't you feed your man some
dialog: ice cream?
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Why don't you get one of those
dialog: bimbos out there to do that?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: That ice cream looks very good -
text: Gonna melt soon.
text: BIANCA shakes her head and opens the pint. She covers her
dialog: mouth.
text: Stuck in the center of the ice cream is a 5 carat DIAMOND
speaker_heading: RING.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Oh my God!
text: ADONIS smiles.
speaker_heading: BIANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: Donnie.
text: ADONIS takes the ring out of the ice cream and gets on one
dialog: knee.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Bianca -
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: --. Yes.
text: BIANCA smiles. Tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: ++. Love you, baby, more every
dialog: minute.
scene_heading: EXT. ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A dank, cold night on the outskirts of the city.
text: A DARK SEDAN pulls up to a low-level FIGHT CLUB.
text: Out of the car steps fight promoter BUDDY "KING" CHARLES and
text: his BODYGUARD.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
text: BUDDY is guided past the dank rooms and cubbyholes that serve
dialog: as places for fighters to get ready for their matches...
text: Depressing as it gets. BUDDY passes a half dozen BRAWLERS of
text: different weights. None are special. A GYM RAT converses with
text: BUDDY and points to a room at the end of the corridor.
text: BUDDY approaches a HULKING FIGURE with sharp features
text: standing in the shadows. The BIG MAN studies another LARGE
text: YOUNG MAN with a menacing aura, in boxing garb, facing away,
text: warming up in the corner.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ivan Arloff?
text: DRAGO ignores the well-dressed entrepreneur.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: ».. Who are you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I have a business proposition might
dialog: be interested in.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Buddy "King" Charles, boxing
dialog: promotions. I'd like to think
dialog: there's a great opportunity for you
dialog: both to capitalize on the Drago
dialog: name that you and your son haven't
dialog: used for years.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: About you and your name.
text: The YOUNG FIGHTER continues to warm up, ignoring them.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know your history, the "history"
dialog: with that family and I know the
dialog: public likes a great story and
dialog: great stories sell, very simple -
text: DRAGO looks hard at him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You were used, you took the blame
dialog: for a man's death when it wasn't
dialog: your fault - You basically were
dialog: thrown out of your country after
dialog: you gave everything you were asked
dialog: to give, ashamed to even use your
dialog: real name and he, whose real name
dialog: is not even Creed, gets glory.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Feel sorry for me?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Of course I do. A man only has his
dialog: pride to stand on and I think it's
dialog: time for you to get a little
dialog: payback - Why should Adonis Creed
dialog: come out of nowhere and get all the
dialog: acclaim and respect when you and
dialog: your son get none? Your son is
dialog: tough, I followed his record, tough
dialog: fights but no promotion leads no
dialog: where. He should be where Creed is,
text: not here, but on a world stage.
dialog: Your son in the ring with the son
dialog: of Apollo Creed is more than
dialog: boxing, it's an event! Take your
dialog: name back - Creed did, now it's
dialog: your time to take back what you
dialog: lost. What goes around, comes
dialog: around. This is an event... A life
dialog: changer.
text: DRAGO glares at him.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: Nothin' will change my life - Maybe
dialog: his.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Vitor "Drago" - You want to do
dialog: this?
text: VITOR ignores him and exits, heading to the ring.
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT:
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
text: BELL RINGS. BUDDY "KING" CHARLES watches VITOR DRAGO rapidly
text: charge forward and unleash a SAVAGE KICKBOXING beating on his
text: MIDDLE EASTERN OPPONENT. The low life CROWD screams for
text: blood. It's FERAL ASSAULT.
text: VITOR is a vicious predator. BUDDY has never seen such
scene_heading: FEROCITY.
text: BONE CRUSHING COMBINATIONS batter the opponent helplessly to
text: the fitly canvas... VITOR mocks the fallen opponent.
text: BUDDY glances at DRAGO and locks eyes with him. BUDDY's found
text: a gold mine. VITOR exits and speaks as he passes the
dialog: promoter.
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: Let's do this.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN NUYS AIRPORT - DAY
text: The DOOR opens and ADONIS, BIANCA, ANTHONY and ROCKY
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Hey, Cali.
text: ADONIS turns to BIANCA.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You sure you don't want me to drop
dialog: you off?
text: BIANCA looks at ADONIS.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: No, I want them to see and hear me
dialog: for me. Not you.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: All right, you go - I'm not,
dialog: throwin' shade on you.
text: ROCKY picks up his bag.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Coming with us, Unc?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Nah - I gotta few things to do.
text: ADONIS nods.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Cool - Come by the house for
dialog: dinner? He's got the address.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Sure, kid.
text: An ESCALADE pulls up for ADONIS and ANTHONY. Another
text: Bianca and another one for ROCKY.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I coulda grabbed a cab.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
text: It's Uber. No one takes cabs
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: See ya's later.
text: ADONIS shields his eyes as he looks at BIANCA.
dialog: 13.
dialog: step
dialog: one for
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Can't see you with all that bling.
text: BIANCA laughs and gets in the car. ANTHONY and ADONIS get in
dialog: their SUV.
text: All pull off in different directions.
scene_heading: EXT. AGENCY - DAY
text: ADONIS and ANTHONY walk inside the large building people in
dialog: Hollywood call The Death Star.
scene_heading: INT. AGENCY
text: A beautiful view of Century City and a long ass marble table
text: with bottles of FIJI and FOLDERS that say CREED INC. TREVOR
text: and JELANI, two handsome, well dressed AGENTS work their
dialog: magic.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Nike, we can re-negotiate. Under
dialog: Armour wants to do business in a
dialog: major way.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: And Reebok and Adidas don't even do
dialog: boxing and they just want you too,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: JELANI
dialog: True.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Sounds good - Creed, Inc. Gyms - 24-
dialog: Hour Fitness situations, explore
dialog: that?
dialog: (to Anthony)
dialog: You, too.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: We'll explore it. Oh, yeah - Ever
dialog: think about investing in an app?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (CONT'D)
dialog: That Silicon money is serious,
dialog: brother.
text: ADONIS smiles.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: I've thought of a lot of things -
dialog: I'm gonna have my brother get
dialog: involved in the day-to-day
dialog: operations, so when something has
text: potential, reach out to him.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I have three fights I want,
dialog: including the rematch, which won't
dialog: be a long way off - And I've got a
dialog: lot on my mind and I think it's
dialog: relatable, so I want to get
dialog: involved in public speaking, online
dialog: education - I want to get a message
dialog: out, goals and dignity and how to
dialog: pursue both - Sound like a mouthful
dialog: but I mean it. First topic: "Life's
dialog: a fight everyone has to fight."
text: While he speaks, we see ANTHONY'S eyes flash with envy.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: When are you going to sleep?
scene_heading: EXT. APPLE OFFICE - SANTA MONICA - DAY
text: We're outside the offices of what has become the world's
dialog: largest record company.
speaker_heading: AVA FISHER (0.S.)
dialog: Your voice is sexy - It pulls you
dialog: in.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: BIANCA is sitting across from AVA FISHER, a record executive.
text: Two ASSISTANTS are present.
text: BIANCA'S MUSIC is playing. Her newest composition. Everyone
text: is liking it a great deal. AVA smiles at her ASSISTANTS, who
text: nod back. BIANCA looks encouraged. The song is wonderful and
dialog: loud.
text: The SOUND begins to FADE in BIANCA'S EARS. She subtly touches
text: her hidden HEARING AIDS. The music gets lower and she tries
text: to SUPPRESS her fear. Her nails dig into her palms.
text: The SOUND slowly begins to ebb back and BIANCA puts on a
text: brave face. The music ends and so does the emotional roller
dialog: coaster.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: You want to sign me?
speaker_heading: AVA FISHER
dialog: I don't do general meetings, I only
dialog: do business and we want to be in
dialog: business with you, love that Philly
dialog: thing you got going - Sexy.
speaker_heading: BIANCA is silent.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: AVA FISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not excited.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: I am - Excuse me.
text: She nonchalantly removes one of her hearing aids.
speaker_heading: BIANCA (CONT'D)
text: "Show time" - The battery's dying -
dialog: I don't hide it, I just deal with
dialog: it -
text: AVA and the JUNIOR EXECS are taken aback. BIANCA begins to
dialog: insert the battery.
speaker_heading: BIANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: I could feel them going down in
dialog: Vegas. The higher frequencies are
dialog: the first to go. Imagine hearing
text: someone arguing on the other side
dialog: of this wall. You hear the voice
text: but can't understand the words.
text: The battery is in and she replaces the hearing aid.
speaker_heading: BIANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: All better - Still interested?
speaker_heading: AVA FISHER
dialog: ... Of course we're interested - I
dialog: want you on the road, performing
dialog: your songs - First we'll set up a
dialog: showcase in Philadelphia then bring

scene_heading: EXT. CREED MANSION - NIGHT
text: The UBER pulls up and ROCKY exits.
text: He looks anxious... Out front is the BLACK MUSTANG that
speaker_heading: ADONIS won back.
text: The front door opens and MARY ANNE CREED steps out. Her

speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: Hello, Rocky.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: How ya doin' Mary Anne?
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: ++. I heard you were coming.

text: ROCKY is incredibly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Few things - the restaurant.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: People like seeing it, don't they?

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (very uncomfortable)
dialog: Sorta - We're not so busy...
dialog: Y'know, I shoulda called ya more.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: Nobody's blaming you.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Me - I'm blamin' me... Sorry I

speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: And say what? Apollo was his own

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (looks moved)
dialog: If I could turn the clock back...
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: The clock stopped the day you let

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I know -
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: ++. You loved your wife?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ++. Course.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: And you got to spend many years
dialog: with her, the way it is suppose to
dialog: be. What if that never happened, it
dialog: would have been hard.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: oe. Very.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE
dialog: Apollo was not perfect and what
dialog: happened, but he loved you,
dialog: respected you and now here we are
dialog: again. I know he came to you and
dialog: all I ask is to never let something
dialog: happen again, because he will push
dialog: it an' push it, like his father. He
dialog: can't help it -
text: ROCKY stares at the floor.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm over accusing, the blaming,
dialog: does no good anymore, but what if
dialog: it happens to him... Because it
dialog: could. You had one man die in your

speaker_heading: ROCKY

speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Left? Was there a problem?
speaker_heading: MARY ANNE

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (walking off)
dialog: Man's got a restaurant to run.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: We were supposed to be celebrating.
dialog: He helped make everythin' happen.

speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: You helped him just as much.
speaker_heading: ADONIS reflects.
speaker_heading: BIANCA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: Maybe one of the most hated men in

dialog: fighter, who was formally defeated
dialog: by American boxer Rocky Balboa in
text: 1986, is back in the picture with
dialog: his son, also a heavyweight who has
dialog: been fighting under a different
dialog: family name for many years... Why?
dialog: Why come out of the "shadows" now?
speaker_heading: BUDDY (ON TV)
dialog: Drago feels this "young" Creed has
dialog: a life he does not deserve, did not
dialog: earn.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (to Anthony)
dialog: This man's a thief - He's been
dialog: trying to promote me.
text: ANTHONY takes this in.
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: Why would you want to open old
dialog: wounds?
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV)
dialog: They never closed.
text: Drago and Vitor remain silent.
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: Are you haunted by the former
dialog: champion's death?
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV)
dialog: - Not at all.
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: You feel no responsibility?
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV)
dialog: ».. It was fight. He lost, what
dialog: more is to say?
text: DRAGO stares emotionless at the crowd and interviewer.
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV) (CONT'D)
dialog: I was a great fighter and I had to
dialog: leave my country like a dog -
dialog: Politics - I live in other
dialog: countries like a dog, ashamed of my
dialog: name, my son had to live like this,
dialog: too -
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: So do you want revenge through your
dialog: son?
speaker_heading: VITOR (ON TV)
dialog: We want what is owed.
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: What exactly do you think you're
dialog: owed?
speaker_heading: VITOR (ON TV)
dialog: Everything - What they have - What
dialog: is fair.
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: And what are your feelings about
dialog: Balboa, since it was your fight?
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV)
dialog: I don't want to talk about him.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Why are we watching this?
text: MARY ANNE exits the room. ADONIS turns it off.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That old man an' his punk are

dialog: 22.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: So what is it exactly you want?
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV)
dialog: They bring me to this country,
dialog: dishonor me -
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER (ON TV)
dialog: Dishonor? Apollo is the one who
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: DRAGO (ON TV)
dialog: Not my fault - He was not strong
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Turn it off - It's a stupid
dialog: publicity stunt, money grab.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: So what? It's an amazing
dialog: opportunity. D, you would tear the
dialog: muscle-bound punk up - Bullshit
dialog: kickboxer, what's that? You'd mess
dialog: him up and make a statement, man,
dialog: and the money. Creed Inc. He's a
dialog: bum, no skills, brother.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (ON TV)
dialog: Drago's son deserves some respect -
dialog: Life is supposed to give second
dialog: chances - This man has lived a real
dialog: life, Adonis Creed took the easy
dialog: route. He got a break he didn't
dialog: deserve. If his father didn't break
dialog: down barriers, if he wasn't a real
dialog: warrior, Adonis Creed would not
dialog: exist. Without "the name" who is
dialog: he, really?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: C'mon, D - Let's do this.
text: ADONIS rises and exits.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: (exiting)
dialog: I'm asking you nicely to stop

scene_heading: INT. CREED MANSION - NIGHT

text: We see ADONIS beating a half dozen opponents... ANTHONY
text: enters.
text: He PACES in front of ADONIS. He holds up his IPAD.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: This shit is trending already - You
dialog: didn't start this but you can
dialog: finish it, you should. It's a
dialog: chance to throw down, make a
dialog: statement, everything's on your
dialog: side and I want to contribute, be
dialog: part of it. You got a chance to do
dialog: something big. This fight would
dialog: make "the statement", son of the
dialog: greatest boxer ever -
text: This word "ever" digs at ADONIS.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (CONT'D)
dialog: - Against the man who beat the life
text: out of him.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides being the "right" thing to
dialog: do, ya got a family on the way,
dialog: this is "generational" money. Pops
dialog: would say do it for your family,
dialog: for that kind of cash, he'd come
dialog: back from the dead - I know you'll
dialog: beat this big punk easy, he's got
dialog: no real skills - If I had what you
dialog: had I'd be on it tomorrow.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. EUROPE - EARLY MORNING
text: It is cool, miserable, misty weather.
text: We see VITOR DRAGO jogging in a crappy, mostly deserted, old

text: His hood is pulled tight as SWEAT and RAIN pour down his

text: Following close behind is IVAN DRAGO. His countenance is
text: cold, pitiless.
text: He flashes the LIGHTS indicating to pick up the pace.
text: VITOR does not. IVAN BLASTS THE HORN! Still, VITOR remains
text: defiant.
text: IVAN brings the car closer, so close in fact, that he nearly
text: brushes up against the back of his son's legs.
text: VITOR suddenly leaps to the side and POUNDS THE HOOD with a

text: IVAN SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and slowly gets out. He matches his

speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: (in Russian)
dialog: Run - You are me - I am you.

speaker_heading: ROCKY

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: If the signs and symptoms stay

dialog: And I remember when I looked down
dialog: from that window that I almost fell
dialog: out of because you were so damn
dialog: handsome - I loved you at first
dialog: sight and it's only gotten
dialog: stronger. Nobody is going to love
dialog: you more than me, except the child
dialog: I'm carrying. Do you really want to
dialog: bring the "past" into our life?
dialog: Really? When you don't have to? We
dialog: got so much ahead - Let's make our

dialog: a family the way we wished we were
dialog: raised - You don't need this, "we"
dialog: don't need this - Move on, D, if I
dialog: can give up something that I wanted
dialog: my whole life, you can sacrifice a
dialog: little, too. I believe you can do

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: The joint's old, but don't leak

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (at a loss)

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: For what you 'did' and 'do' it's a

text: ROCKY shifts uneasily.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever see the way you look at him,
dialog: at Adonis?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Like he's part of you.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: No, just looks that way, maybe -
dialog: You're my only son.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I know, but face it, I couldn't
dialog: live up to whatever makes you
dialog: "you", maybe he can, but I don't
dialog: want my kid going through that.
dialog: Growing up was tough enough without
dialog: him being in your "shadow", too.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: My shadow's gone - I'm old.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: It's never gone - Y'know, I tried
dialog: to get your attention all the time,
dialog: an' I even tried fighting, but I
dialog: wasn't very good, so I stopped
dialog: trying, and you know what you said?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ».. I forget sometimes.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You said "Don't worry about it. You
dialog: can't be better than you are".
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: It's just words.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Yeah, but did I need to hear it?
dialog: Not living up to what you are,
dialog: that's a tough pill to swallow.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Just be "you", how hard is that?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Try telling that to other people.
dialog: It's not so easy living with this
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Could be harder livin' without it.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You just live in a different world.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: «+. Yeah.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: It's harder to make it now.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Well, it was never easy, son -
dialog: Y'know, I think maybe, when things
dialog: have gotten a little too hard for
dialog: you, you looked around for a soft
dialog: spot to lay down.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You're calling me a quitter now -
dialog: It's all right, Adonis would never
dialog: quit, would he?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: He's someone else's son - You're my
dialog: only - One hundred percent,
dialog: everything I could do, I did for
dialog: you and ya beautiful mother, I even
dialog: didn't mind takin' a beatin' so so
dialog: ya could have nice things - I
dialog: thought I did pretty good.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Yes, you did, but you expected so
dialog: much —-
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: What? Maybe a "thanks" now and then
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I could never live up to what you
dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I never thought I was ya
dialog: competition, just ya father.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Fathers and son, it can't be helped
dialog: - It's the way it is.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Don't have to be.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: It's the way it is, you don't get
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I don't wanna get it.

speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm never seein' ya again, aml...
dialog: It's okay, don't answer - I don't
dialog: wanna know, ‘cause then maybe
dialog: anythin' can happen, right?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: «+. Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Y'know, it's sad, each of us thinks
dialog: we're right an' the other is wrong
dialog: an' the truth is flyin' around
dialog: somewhere - If I could be somebody
dialog: else an' make things good between
dialog: us, I'd jump in but I'm just this -
dialog: Y'know, I never lied to a friend,
dialog: never hurt nobody who didn't
dialog: deserve it -
text: ROCKY steps a few PACES forward.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: An' I only gave you the best I
dialog: could ever give until I had nothin'
dialog: left.
text: ROCKY pauses, points to the gym.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: (gestures toward the gym)
dialog: Gotta go... They need me in there -
text: He starts to move off.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: ».. Please visit ya mother before
dialog: ya go.
text: ROBERT nods and moves away. He enters the car. ROCKY steps
text: into view.
text: LOGAN puts his hand up in a BOXING POSE. ROCKY does likewise.
text: The vehicle pulls away. The sound of a pounding SPEED BAG
text: swells.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - DAY
text: A LATINO MIDDLEWEIGHT FIGHTER pounds away on the SPEED BAG.

text: As he pauses to collect his thoughts, ANTHONY arrives and
text: energetically ascends the steps.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (passing by)
dialog: You okay, Stallion?
text: He angles past.
text: ANTHONY sees ADONIS in the ring. He passes.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Got two companies bidding for the
text: ring mat.
text: He enters the office.
text: ROCKY wills himself out of the doldrums with each ascending
text: step. He arrives at the top of the steps, looking like his
text: old self. He heads toward ADONIS.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (to fighters)
dialog: C'mon, let's see some good
dialog: sweatin'! Shake an' bake!
text: ADONIS glances at him while he pounds away. ROCKY seems to be
text: pushing his enthusiasm a little too hard.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, kid - There's nobody better
dialog: than you! Hit those things - Go for
dialog: it! That's it!

speaker_heading: BUDDY (0.S.)
dialog: Adonis Creed!
text: ADONIS pivots towards the voice. BUDDY makes his way forward.
text: The VIDEO CAMERAS' OPERATORS now swing in front of him.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You did not respond to my many
dialog: calls and invitations, so we
dialog: thought we'd publicly drop by -
text: DRAGO and VITOR clear the steps of the staircase.
text: ROCKY lays eyes on DRAGO for the first time in over 30 YEARS.
dialog: It is very INTENSE.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: What're you lookin' at?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Why don't you move?
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: Make me.
text: ANTHONY drifts out of the office. He appears anxious.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You fight for money, right, then
dialog: keep fighting for it, because you
dialog: certainly don't fight for honor!
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Better get out of here.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I got this -
dialog: (to Drago)
dialog: Nobody wants you here.
text: DRAGO smiles and moves forward.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: I do.
text: ANTHONY looks up at ADONIS.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Adonis, nobody wants to see that
dialog: Wheeler re-match. They want
dialog: something better - Is this
dialog: challenge too much for you, Adonis?
text: ROCKY leans over to PADMAN and whispers. PADMAN pulls out a
dialog: phone.
text: The other GYM FIGHTERS now CONGREGATE near the front of the
text: ring, providing a type of buffer zone.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: Why are you afraid of my son?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (to Adonis)
dialog: Don't talk -
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Not afraid of anybody.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Good, because there's the chance to
dialog: make things right - You know what
dialog: I'm talking about, everyone does.
dialog: So take it, what are you waiting
dialog: for? You know what this man did to
dialog: your father. You can live with
dialog: that?
dialog: (to Rocky)
dialog: Can he?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Why don't you shut your mouth an'
dialog: get out.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Yeah, get out.
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: Or what are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: Control your dog before I whip his
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: What'd you say?!
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (to Buddy)
dialog: You heard me.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: This dog'll kick your ass!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Not yet!
dialog: (to Adonis)
dialog: When are you going to face this
dialog: man?! You just scared? Is he too
dialog: big? Rocky fought big men, didn't

speaker_heading: DRAGO
text: He is now.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Let's go -

speaker_heading: VITOR
text: The pussy turns his back -
text: ANTHONY glances over at BUDDY, who nods.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: What's your problem man?
dialog: (gestures toward Drago)
dialog: How much shit you put in his head?
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: Hey, I'm the real nigger here, who
dialog: lived like shit when you were
dialog: havin' ya ass kissed an' usin' a

speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: You know nothin' -
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: Your ol' man fucked up his life,
dialog: now I'm gonna fuck up yours!
text: That does it!! ADONIS CHARGES at VITOR but is held back by
text: ROCKY, the CORNERMAN and several SPARRING PARTNERS!
text: Several GYM RATS and BOXERS-IN-TRAINING attempt to stop
text: VITOR'S forward charge. VITOR RIPS FREE and EASILY SHOVES the
text: smaller boxers aside. He WAVES AT ADONIS.
speaker_heading: VITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya shit, boy - You're shit -
dialog: Nothing!
text: DRAGO gets into the brawl, dropping two fighters with a HOOK
text: and RIGHT HAND. Everyone backs away from the lethal Russian.
dialog: 50.
text: The CAMERA CREWS are getting their money's worth.
text: The POLICE arrive. ADONIS struggles to free himself. POLICE
dialog: move forward.
text: ADONIS looks at BUDDY "KING" CHARLES and steps out of the
text: ring, heading to the locker room.
text: ROCKY locks stares with DRAGO, who returns a dead eye
text: expressions, then exits.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: ROCKY follows ADONIS into the room, followed by ANTHONY.
text: ADONIS is strangely composed.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Didn't expect that.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: What you expect, them to go away?
dialog: You said it was over.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: That's not happening, even if I
dialog: wanted it to.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Thought you didn't want it to.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: It's here now, isn't it? Forget
dialog: boxing. This is beyond. World wants
dialog: this.
text: ADONIS holds up his IPHONE.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: That kid was raised in hate, that's
dialog: not how you were.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: You think you know all that?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: You want revenge, then take it out
dialog: on me, ‘cause I'm the reason ya
dialog: father ain't here, not him!
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: You went after him and that was all
dialog: good but I want to make it right
dialog: and it's all wrong. Do you think
dialog: you had more right to do it than
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ROCKY and
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: No, but it don't look like you're
dialog: doin' it out of respect for him -
dialog: This ain't about defendin' ya
dialog: father, ‘cause he had no idea who
dialog: ya were, kid. He couldn't pick ya
dialog: out of a line up - But years later,
dialog: ya this son, defendin' a
dialog: relationship that never was - Why?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You don't need to hear that shit -
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Then tell me something different!
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Everything I do is to make him
dialog: proud. Every time I do something
dialog: good, I look up in the sky and say
dialog: "Proud yet? Good enough yet?" But
dialog: it isn't.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Why do you put that on yourself?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: I made this happen.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I wanted it to happen.
text: ANTHONY are stunned.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You made what happen?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: I paid that promoter. I wanted this
dialog: to happen... I'm not my father, I'm
dialog: using what I have while I have it.
dialog: I want to get their real respect,
dialog: people not be the victims anymore.
dialog: Not get beat up anymore ‘cause of
dialog: their skin, killed anymore, no
dialog: power to change things because they
dialog: look different, think different.
dialog: That shit can't fly anymore - A
dialog: champion's gotta be more than just
text: another black man hitting things,
dialog: so I'm taking
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: that anger back in the ring an'
dialog: remindin' people that they let a
dialog: man get beat defenseless 'til he
dialog: died and nobody cared and nothin'
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Time moved on but now they're going
dialog: to see what it's like when things
dialog: are reversed.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I ain't saying I know what ya goin
dialog: through -
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: No, you don't. You know I respect
dialog: you more than anybody and you know
dialog: I'm not doin' this 'cause of ego, I
dialog: want to leave something behind that
dialog: means something - My father didn't,
dialog: but I do.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: You still got to keep ya mind right
dialog: - Anything can happen.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Don't put that in his head.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: The way you feel about that, he
dialog: feels about you -
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That bum won't know what hit him.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: So it's impossible to lose?
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: You think I'm going down and not
dialog: get up? This isn't yesterday - You
dialog: don't have to worry about throwin'
text: a towel.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: You should have Lil Duke train you.
dialog: I think he'll cover you best an' ya
dialog: know him.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: What about you? What's the problem?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I been through this -
speaker_heading: ANTHONY

dialog: So you're out?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: For this. Outside the ring, fight
dialog: for whatever ya want, but inside,
dialog: the only thing ya should be
dialog: fightin' for is ya life - Good
dialog: luck.
text: ROCKY exits.
scene_heading: INT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
text: ROCKY pulls the CHAIR out of the TREE and places it in front
text: of ADRIAN'S HEADSTONE. He simply stares off into the sinking
dialog: grey light of the day...
text: Slowly rising up in VOLUME is the GRAND THEME of the next
dialog: scene.
scene_heading: H.B.O. SPECIAL
text: The dramatic special appears to show a high traveling
text: DRAMATIC shot of LAS VEGAS at night. DRAMATIC MUSIC.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: (dramatic)
text: In the desert is a crown jewel of
text: many lights that serve as a beacon
dialog: for travelers all over the world to
dialog: explore, be entertained and try
dialog: their luck. But several miles
text: beyond the glamorous oasis, across
dialog: barren desert, lies some of the
text: most grand and foreboding land in
dialog: the world. It's called simply
dialog: "Death Valley".
text: We see a shot of ADONIS running through the parched earth at
dialog: sunrise.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: Like the man who is Adonis Creed,
text: the landscape is hard, resilient
dialog: and always challenging.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER DEATH VALLEY LOCATION
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: As one of the best light
dialog: heavyweights in the world, Adonis,
dialog: in a career that has seen him
text: struggle to emerge from the shadows
dialog: of the legendary Apollo Creed, is
dialog: putting his next title defense on
text: hold. He has chosen to avenge his
text: father's tragic death at the hands
dialog: of the infamous Ivan Drago.
text: Scene shifts to an OLD GYM where VITOR works out with IVAN
text: DRAGO in the background. He looks pumped and brutal.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: An ocean apart and like out of a
dialog: Shakespearean drama, it is not the
dialog: patriarch but the son, Vitor Drago,
text: a bull of a man who will defend the
dialog: Drago name -
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Outdoor scenes of VITOR running.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: The young Drago feels like the
dialog: family has unjustly suffered
dialog: because of an untimely tragedy and
dialog: Adonis Creed has not earned what he
dialog: has and should not be champion.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ADONIS shadow boxing up a jagged, steep hillside with charred
text: rocks spread before him.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Adonis calls this personal and
dialog: wants to put the insults and
dialog: disrespect to rest no matter what
dialog: the cost, and with his superior
dialog: skills end this nightmare.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: VITOR training in the gym.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: His opponent thinks his nightmare
dialog: is just beginning...
text: VITOR faces the camera.
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: I'm a bad man and will beat ‘em
dialog: worse than his father got.
dialog: 55.
text: More cuts of VITOR outside in a tank top running with a PIT
text: BULL who bites a stick and VITOR hurls him into the air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ADONIS as he runs across the desert, we cut to clips of his
dialog: fights.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: Adonis Creed, proving to be a
text: fearless fighter who has tested his
dialog: metal -
text: ADONIS is seen knocking out SEVERAL MEN in dramatic slo-mo
dialog: style.
text: We see VITOR in much cruder surroundings, knocking MEN out.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: - Will pit his skill and pride
text: against a hostile unknown with
dialog: nothing but personal retribution on
dialog: his mind.
text: We see ADONIS running in dramatic fashion towards the highest
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Life is a Circle and History and
dialog: Time often do not hide the scars
dialog: and erase the ferocity of the past.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: VITOR standing between two classic Greek columns looking like
text: a modern Hercules.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: Alongside the glory, the unknown
dialog: danger is ever present, the paths
dialog: they take will never run parallel
dialog: for each man but their personal
text: histories are forever star-crossed.
text: ADONIS arrives at the top of the cliff and stares out at the
text: hostile territory.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: Like the hellish landscape that has
dialog: often proven invincible, Adonis
dialog: Creed plans to conquer this
dialog: personal challenge and move on with
dialog: his blessed life.
speaker_heading: ADONIS (V.O.)
dialog: "... I will destroy him, I
dialog: promise."
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: The Boxer and the Beast, a brutal
dialog: reconvening, a deeply personal
text: journey, pulling two men from

dialog: rivalry and their future and
dialog: family's legacy will be determined
dialog: by their skill and in the power of
dialog: their fists.
scene_heading: INT. MGM GRAND - ARENA
text: The CROWD is brimming with expectation. Several groups are
text: wearing "REMEMBER APOLLO" t-shirts and several hold up signs
text: that read "VENGEANCE IS MINE - ROMANS 12:19".
text: This is a very animated crowd, extremely vocal in their hate
text: for Drago AND the SOVIETS as well.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR#1
dialog: Welcome one and all to this
dialog: evening's unusual event. The huge,
dialog: relatively unknown European with
dialog: the familiar last name, Vitor
text: Drago, is set to go against Light
dialog: Heavyweight Champion Adonis Creed
dialog: in what could be called a special
dialog: event, but this has a real
text: undercurrent of a ‘vendetta’ or
dialog: ‘payback'. Earlier in the day, we
text: caught up with the belittled yet
dialog: unapologetic man himself, Ivan
dialog: Drago.
text: CUT to FOOTAGE of DRAGO.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: Why now?
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: (Russian accent)
dialog: Why not? This is something that has
dialog: been building long time - This
dialog: country was bad to me, having me
dialog: fight an' old man instead of the
dialog: champion. Then, in Russia, I was
dialog: embarrassed, cheated. But all will
dialog: be over soon and we'll have the
dialog: respect we deserve.
scene_heading: INT. ADONIS'S DRESSING ROOM
text: BIANCA, who is VERY PREGNANT, sits watching Adonis SHADOW
text: BOXING in the mirror. Anthony is present.
text: ADONIS moves around, slowly JABBING.
dialog: 57.
text: From the group: YELLING OF ENCOURAGEMENT.
speaker_heading: LIL DUKE
dialog: Stay inside his reach, okay? Can't
dialog: stay on the outside - Side to side,
dialog: then inside, got me?
text: ADONIS smiles at BIANCA and uses a "Hand Sign".
speaker_heading: ADONIS

text: PUNCHES into punch mitts held by DRAGO himself.
text: VITOR throws again.
speaker_heading: DRAGO
dialog: Remember what they did to me.
text: VITOR throws with UNBELIEVABLE FORCE. It CRACKS against the
text: pad, sounding like a shotgun blast.
text: DRAGO picks up VITOR'S HUGE BOXING ROBE. From the angle, we
text: cannot read what is on the back. VITOR'S EYES show
dialog: disapproval.
scene_heading: INT. RINGSIDE
text: The COMMENTATORS stand up facing the camera.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: This is the first time in several
dialog: years Balboa will not be in his
dialog: corner. Why do you think that is?
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: Maybe he just isn't on board with
dialog: this "fight" because of what
dialog: happened years ago when things went
dialog: tragically wrong...
text: The CAMERA pans the crowd.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
text: Tonight, the "past" catches up to
dialog: the "present" and sets the
dialog: future...
dialog: 58.
text: ROCKY takes his seat directly behind Adonis's corner.
text: The LIGHTS DIM. A BLUE HAZE BACKDROP provides a dramatic
text: display as the DRAGOS enter the arena. The building resonates
text: with BOOS. HEAVY METAL MUSIC blares from the speakers.
text: Stepping into view is VITOR.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Vitor has fought all his life under
dialog: a different name, tonight is the
dialog: first time he will be announced by
dialog: his real name -
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
dialog: Said they were embarrassed by what
dialog: happened years ago.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
dialog: That may change tonight - Vitor
dialog: Drago is a very powerful looking
dialog: man but will his ability keep up
dialog: with Adonis Creed's ringmanship?
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
dialog: Good question, but he looks hard
dialog: core.
text: Many of the CROWD taunt DRAGO with FOUL LANGUAGE. One bold
text: ANTI-FAN attempts to grab hold of VITOR'S SHOULDER.
text: DRAGO GRABS the anti-fan BY THE CHEST and SHOVES him back
text: roughly into the crowd.
text: Tough as VITOR is, he is disturbed by the growing level of
text: hatred as he moves towards the ring... He did not expect this
scene_heading: INTENSITY.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
text: One unruly fan just got manhandled
dialog: by Drago.
text: VITOR reaches the ring and enters. IVAN stands besides his
text: son, soaking up the energy of being in the limelight again.
text: The MUSIC is very intimidating, vicious.
text: The crowd BOOS. DRAGO calmly MOCKS the crowd with an upraised
dialog: fist.
text: Turning around, we see embroidered on the back of Vitor's
scene_heading: robe: "APOLLO R.I.P."
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: robe)
dialog: That's in really bad taste.
text: Actually, appalling.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
dialog: If he wanted to mess with Creed's
dialog: head, that'll do it.
text: The MUSIC changes.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA
text: The crowd cheers as ADONIS appears on the SCREEN. His music
speaker_heading: BLARES.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
dialog: Adonis Creed now making his
text: entrance. Definitely a crowd
dialog: favorite.
text: ADONIS, game face on, CLIMBS into the ring. The crowd LOVES
dialog: HIM!!
text: VITOR immediately steps to the center of the ring and gives
text: the THROAT SLITTING gesture.
text: As VITOR turns, ADONIS sees the back of the ROBE: APOLLO
dialog: R.I.P.
text: ADONIS LOSES IT! Tries to RUSH FORWARD as VITOR stands like
text: an intimidating statue. Lil Duke BLOCKS HIS PATH.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (pointing to Vitor)
dialog: +.. Gonna beat your sick ass!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
text: Adonis Creed is enraged and
text: attempts to get to Vitor Drago, who
dialog: mocks him!
text: ADONIS'S anger is glowing but LIL DUKE, along with CORNERMEN
text: and official RING SECURITY manage to separate them.
text: DRAGO is enjoying the mayhem.
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: You're goin' be under my foot!
scene_heading: INT. RINGSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER
text: In the blue corner, with a mixed

speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: 26 professional boxing fights, this
dialog: being his debut in America,
dialog: weighing 235 pounds, Vitor "The
dialog: Hammer" Drago!
text: A few RUSSIANS in the audience applaud but are drowned out by
text: the pro-American crowd. It only inflames DRAGO.
text: BIANCA, very much on edge, takes her seat. She eyes Buddy
text: "King" Charles... She's not happy. ANTHONY sits next to her.
speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
text: In the red corner, weighing 199
text: pounds, the newly crowned Light
dialog: Heavyweight Champion of the World,
dialog: Adonis "Speed" Creed!
dialog: The crowd EXPLODES!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: Certainly has the support of this
text: crowd behind him!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: They want Vitor Drago demolished
dialog: but that's a big task if Vitor has
text: a "jaw" to match his size.
text: The REFEREE motions of the COMBATANTS to come to the center
dialog: of the ring.
text: The BELL RINGS and DROWNS OUT the last curse word.
text: ADONIS goes straight forward and LOCKS EYES with the huge
text: man. IVAN DRAGO exchanges DAGGER EXPRESSIONS with ROCKY, who
text: he has detected sitting behind Creed's corner.
text: As the REFEREE gives instructions, the two fighters overlap
text: one another with VULGAR INSULTS.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: I want a clean fight. Protect
dialog: yourself at all times and when I
dialog: say ‘break', break. Good luck -

speaker_heading: LIL DUKE
dialog: Control that shit! Stay inside his

speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Ring the bell!
text: BIANCA sits nearly frozen in apprehension.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (to Adonis)
dialog: You got this! You got it!
text: The BELL RINGS and Adonis CHARGES the Big Man with bad
dialog: intentions.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
text: Adonis wastes no time attacking the
dialog: much larger Vitor Drago! No
dialog: ‘feeling out' round, folks!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
dialog: What a surprise - The smaller man
dialog: has Drago backing up!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
dialog: Creed's making a statement early
dialog: on!
text: VITOR pushes the smaller fighter away and then is FURIOUSLY

text: the beating that was given to APOLLO.
text: WE CUT BACK AND FORTH FROM THE OLD
scene_heading: FOOTAGE TO THE PRESENT
text: DAY... THE COMPARISON IS EERIE.
text: Adonis comes in straight ahead and gets caught with a
text: THUNDEROUS BLOW which delights Drago.
speaker_heading: VITOR
dialog: Hit me. That's it?
text: VITOR turns to the CROWD and gives ADONIS a THUMBS DOWN
dialog: gesture.
text: ADONIS starts to rapidly CIRCLE and JAB. They are barely
text: reaching the target, but Vitor is starting to WALK THROUGH
text: the punches.
speaker_heading: VITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, gimme somethin' - Gimme
dialog: somethin'.
text: ROCKY sits. He is feeling every emotion a fighter would feel
text: who was in the ring.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Back off!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (0.S.)
text: Adonis is still going after his
text: opponent but falling short.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
text: Vitor's big right hand is locked
dialog: and loaded!!
text: Sure enough, ADONIS throws a LEFT HOOK and VITOR counters
text: with a thudding RIGHT, which badly ROCKS ADONIS.
text: ADONIS rapidly backs up against the ROPES. ADONIS tries to
text: lay him up and VITOR SMASHES ADONIS in the JAW with a
text: flagrant illegal elbow! CROWD boos. The REFEREE admonishes

dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: ROCKY

text: Adonis FIGHTS ON and CATCHES Vitor with a BODY-PUNCH to his
speaker_heading: LIVER.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yes!! That's what I'm talking
dialog: about!
speaker_heading: LIL DUKE
dialog: That's it! More of the same! Bust
dialog: him up!
text: But VITOR is too powerful and smiles at him - Telling him to
text: hit him again, harder.
text: BIANCA leaps to her feet.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: (yells)
dialog: You got to stop this!!
scene_heading: INT. RING
text: VITOR, hands at his side, sticks out his JAW. ADONIS hits it.
speaker_heading: NO EFFECT.
text: Then, like a BOLT OF LIGHTNING from hell, Vitor EXPLODES with
text: a brutal OVERHAND RIGHT that clubs ADONIS behind the ear and
text: sends him CRASHING TO THE CANVAS!!
text: The AUDIENCE IS STUNNED.
text: FEAR fills Rocky's eyes. HE ALMOST WANTS ADONIS TO STAY DOWN.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Take the count!!
dialog: 64.
text: VITOR says something unintelligible to the fallen fighter,
text: then RAISING HIS FIST, he strolls to a neutral corner.
text: ADONIS goes to ONE KNEE. We see a moment of DOUBT creep into
text: his eyes. EVERYTHING IS OUT OF FOCUS.
text: VITOR disdainfully wipes the BLOOD way from his NOSE and
text: glances at this father.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #3 (0.S.)
dialog: This is the advantage of a full-
dialog: blown super heavy weight -
text: incredible hitting power. One punch

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (to Lil Duke)
dialog: He's done! Call it!
dialog: ROCKY's point of view:
dialog: We go to SLOW MOTION as --

text: Adonis DRIFTS HELPLESSLY towards the ropes.
text: LIL DUKE desperately reaches for the TOWEL.
text: IVAN DRAGO rises to his feet, his face flushed, SCREAMING for

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (0.S.)
