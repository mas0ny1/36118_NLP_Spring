scene_heading: OVER WHICH WE HEAR A SLOW, RHYTHMIC CLACK-CLACK-CLACK, HARD AND INSISTENT
text: AS THE BEAT OF A PETRIFIED HEART. AND SUDDENLY FLUORESCENT LIGHT INVADES
text: OUR SPACE, HARSH AND UGLY, AND WE FIND OURSELVES IN A FEATURELESS WHITE
text: CORRIDOR THAT SEEMS TO STRETCH TO INFINITY. SOFT AND MUFFLED, AS IF COMING
text: FROM SOME HIDDEN DIMENSION, WE HEAR CRAZED LAUGHTER, PATHETIC WHIMPERING,
scene_heading: WILD CANINE YELPING: THE SOUNDS OF MADNESS EMANATING FROM THE WALLS...THEN
speaker_heading: FOOTSTEPS.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (OVER)
dialog: Sometimes, when I'm up here late at night, I think of the
dialog: tunnel, you know, the one you're supposed to see when you

dialog: (a beat)
dialog: In my mind...it's this door.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON A DOOR

speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE #2 (OVER)
dialog: Um. Dr. Howard said five milligrams Zyprexa twice a day.
dialog: Or was that Dr. Fein?
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE #1 (OVER)

speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE #2 (OVER)
dialog: Right. Why's she here?
scene_heading: Int. SaNITARIUM - night
text: Two nurses walk down the hall, pushing a medicine cart, their uniforms as
text: hard white as the fluorescence. The first voice belongs to HEAD NURSE
text: WELLES, the other to NURSE PHILLIPS, a young newcomer to the facility. The
text: CLACKING sound, everpresent, grows LOUDER.
speaker_heading: NURSE WELLES
dialog: Extreme dissociative disorder. Hasn't said a word in two
dialog: years. At least to anyone you or I can see.
speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS
dialog: Why's she in lockdown?

speaker_heading: NURSE WELLES
dialog: You've never heard of Laurie Strode?

speaker_heading: NURSE WELLES
dialog: The Halloween murders? Michael Myers?
speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS
dialog: I...just moved here from Wisconsin.
speaker_heading: NURSE WELLES

speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS
dialog: My God. Decapitated?
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: THE COUNTRYSIDE

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Over here!
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON TWO COPS
text: STANDING OVER THE SEVERED HEAD, WHICH STILL WEARS THE WHITE MASK. ONE OF

speaker_heading: COP

dialog: Oh, no. Oh, God....
speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS (V.o.)
dialog: Why'd she do it?
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT
text: as the two nurses approach the door at the end of the hall.
speaker_heading: NURSE WELLES
dialog: I don't know, does insanity run

dialog: way?
speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS
dialog: Um, we didn't really study that
dialog: in --
speaker_heading: NURSE WELLES
dialog: I guess those are philosophical questions, not psychiatric

dialog: room.
speaker_heading: POV INSIDE ROOM
text: WHERE WE SEE THE PERFECTLY-ARRANGED ITEMS, AS IF SOME ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE

speaker_heading: LAURIE STRODE
text: SITTING IN A STRAIGHT-BACKED CHAIR, TILTING IT BACK AND FORTH AS IF IT WERE

speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT
text: Michael Myers is lying on the floor. We hear SIRENS in the distance...the

speaker_heading: TWO POLICE OFFICERS

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: See if he's still breathing. I'll secure the floor.
text: The other cop steps over, looks at the body, the blood.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #2
dialog: No way, man. This guy is chum.

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: LAURIE SITTING

speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT
text: as Michael GRABS the cop from behind, bringing him down quickly, wrapping
text: one big hand around the man's throat and CRUSHING his windpipe -- then

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE SANITARIUM ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Ron? Where the hell you going?
text: Then he looks back down at the body on the floor, wearing the bloody

speaker_heading: BACK TO:

speaker_heading: FLASH TO:

speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: THE SEVERED HEAD

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: LAURIE'S EYES
text: as we are sucked into the enormous black pupils until we suddenly REVERSE
dialog: ourselves and are LOOKING
scene_heading: THROUGH LAURIE'S EYES
text: AND OUT THE WINDOW OF THE SANITARIUM AND INTO THE WOODS SURROUNDING THE
scene_heading: FACILITY -- WHERE WE GET JUST THE FAINTEST GLIMPSE OF A DARK SHAPE, WHITE
scene_heading: FACE, MOVING, MOVING --
text: THEN WE HEAR THE DOOR OPENING AND THE TWO NURSES ENTERING. THEY MOVE
text: AROUND IN FRONT OF US, WHEELING THE MEDICINE CART ALONGSIDE THE CHAIR. WE
scene_heading: NOTICE THE DIFFERENT BOTTLES OF MEDICINE, SEVERAL HYPODERMIC SYRINGES.
speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS
dialog: Does anyone come by to visit her?
dialog: Nurse welles
dialog: Her son used to, but then he just stopped.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: AS NURSE WELLES GENTLY PLACES A PILL ON LAURIE'S TONGUE, THEN WASHES IT
text: DOWN WITH A PAPER CUP OF WATER. SHE STRAIGHTENS.
text: BUT SUDDENLY LAURIE'S BODY STARTS TO CONVULSE VIOLENTLY, KNOCKING OVER THE
scene_heading: MEDICINE TRAY. HER CHAIR TOPPLES TO THE FLOOR BESIDE THE SPILLED MEDICINE
text: BOTTLES AND SYRINGES.
text: THE TWO NURSES STRUGGLE TO GET HER CALM AGAIN, FINALLY RIGHTING THE CHAIR.
text: LAURIE SEEMS OVER IT. NURSE PHILLIPS BENDS TO GATHER UP THE MEDICATIONS.
speaker_heading: NURSE PHILLIPS
dialog: Jesus. Has she ever done that before?
speaker_heading: Nurse wELLES
dialog: Not on my watch. I'll talk to Dr. Howard in the morning

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT
text: The MAIN FLOOR, where a bored night-duty staffer, FRANKLIN MUNROE, is

text: He gets up, moves to the hallway.
speaker_heading: FOLLOW FRANKLIN
scene_heading: AROUND A CORNER. HE STOPS.
scene_heading: POV DOWN THE HALL
text: HE SEES NOTHING. IT'S SILENT AGAIN.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON FRANKLIN
text: AS HE STARTS TO TURN BACK -- WHEN SUDDENLY A SHAPE COMES OUT OF THE
text: DARKNESS OF A DOORWAY. FRANKLIN JUMPS BACK, ALMOST SLAMMING INTO A WALL,
text: CATCHING HIS BREATH.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Jesus Christ, Harold! You trying to give me a heart attack?
text: The figure moves into the half-light and we see it's one of the patients,
text: walking with the stiff movements of neurological disorder. He's wearing a
text: bright red-and-white clown mask.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: How the hell you get out this time?
text: Franklin takes the man's arm and walks him down the hall.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Who you supposed to be today?
dialog: (nodding at the mask)
dialog: Oh, yeah, I get it. Gacy, right?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (savant monotone)
dialog: John Wayne Gacy. Born in Chicago, Illinois on March 17,
dialog: 1942. Killed thirty-three people and buried them under his
text: house. Executed on May 14, 1994.
text: His voice trails off as they disappear down the hall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT
text: We find another staffer, WILLIE HAINES, sneaking a smoke just inside the
text: facility's gates. He watches the smoke curl lazily in the night air. Then
text: something CRUNCHES in the bushes just beyond the steel fence. Willie turns
dialog: and looks.
speaker_heading: POV INTO WOODS
text: BORDERING THE WELL-TENDED GROUNDS. IT'S DARK AND QUIET.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON WILLIE
text: AS HE TURNS AWAY AND TAKES A DEEP DRAG OF HIS CIGARETTE. THEN WE HEAR THE
text: CRACK OF A BRANCH. WILLIE SNUFFS OUT HIS CIGARETTE AND GOES OVER TO THE
text: GATE AND OPENS IT. HE STEPS OUTSIDE THE SANITARIUM GROUNDS. HE PULLS HIS
scene_heading: FLASHLIGHT FROM HIS BELT AND SURVEYS THE NEAR WOODS. SUDDENLY THERE'S A
text: SOUND, AND HIS FLASHLIGHT BEAM SWINGS UP TO
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON FIGURE
text: STANDING THERE IN THE DARK, JUST IN FRONT OF THE TREES. THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: MOVES UP THE FIGURE...TO THE DARK JUMPSUIT...THE WHITE MASK.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON WILLIE
text: LOOKING AT THE FIGURE STANDING THERE. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Damn, Harold, you like to scare the shit out of me. How
dialog: many times I tell you I'm the one gets stepped on every time
dialog: you get out?
text: He turns toward the gate, then back to the figure in the mask.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Well? Come on.
text: And the figure follows him onto the sanitarium grounds.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (looking at the mask)
dialog: Who you supposed to be today? Hmm. White mask, white
dialog: mask....Don't think I know that one.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT
text: Franklin Munroe looks up as Willie enters with the other man.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: God damn. He get out again?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Don't know how he does that shit.
dialog: (to figure)
dialog: You stay right the fuck there.
text: Willie sidles over to the security desk, looks at Franklin.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: We really got to write this up?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You like your job?
text: But Willie isn't paying attention. He is looking at
scene_heading: THE SECURITY MONITORS
text: WHICH SHOW THE DIFFERENT FLOORS OF THE FACILITY. AND ON ONE OF THEM WE SEE
text: HAROLD WANDERING AROUND IN HIS CLOWN MASK....
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: FRANKLIN LOOKING AT THE MONITOR, THEN BACK AT WILLIE, THEN OVER AT THE HALL
text: WHERE THE FIGURE WAS STANDING -- BUT HE'S NO LONGER THERE.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Shit!
text: And both men are up and moving.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Check outside, I've got the floors.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The TOP FLOOR. A dark shape, in silhouette, MOVES down the white corridor
text: as if following some sense only he possesses.
speaker_heading: POV DOWN HALL
text: WHERE WE SEE THE SINGLE DOOR...AND WE BEGIN TO HEAR THE STEADY RHYTHMIC
scene_heading: CLACK-CLACK-CLACK FROM JUST BEYOND IT.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER FLOOR- NIGHT
text: We find Franklin running down the hallway till reaching one of the doors
text: and quickly OPENING it -- and INSIDE we find Harold, now in a Ted Bundy
text: mask, sitting in bed with a Detective magazine. The walls are covered with
text: novelty masks of infamous serial killers. He looks at Franklin and blinks.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Ted Bundy, born November 24, 19 --
text: But Franklin is already out the door and moving down the hall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOP FLOOR - NIGHT
text: as Michael approaches the door at the end of the hall with utter
text: unstoppable determination. The CLACKING gets louder.
text: POV THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: LOOKING INTO LAURIE'S ROOM. LAURIE IS SITTING IN HER CHAIR, ROCKING BACK
scene_heading: AND FORTH. SUDDENLY WE MOVE
text: THROUGH THE GLASS
text: TO SEE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDOW AS MICHAEL'S FACE STARES BACK
text: AT US FROM JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
scene_heading: BROTHER AND SISTER STARING AT EACH OTHER FOR ONE INTERMINABLE INSTANT --
text: THEN MICHAEL THRUSTS HIS BODY INTO THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Franklin reaches floor after floor, pokes his head into the hall, sees
text: nothing, then ducks back in, continues the search.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOP FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Michael POUNDS at Laurie's door with desperate animal ferocity, until one
text: of the hinges BURSTS free of its housing. He is about to hit the door
text: again when he notices something:
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: THROUGH THE LITTLE WINDOW -- AND THE ROOM APPEARS EMPTY.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MICHAEL
text: AS HE GIVES ONE LAST MIGHTY THRUST OF HIS SHOULDERS AND THE DOOR BURSTS
speaker_heading: OPEN --
scene_heading: INT. LAURIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Michael charging blindly inside --
speaker_heading: AS LAURIE LUNGES
text: AT HIM FROM THE SIDE, A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE RAISED HIGH IN HER HAND -- AND
text: SHE PLUNGES IT INTO MICHAEL'S NECK AND SQUEEZES THE AIR INSIDE HIM.
text: HE DROPS TO HIS KNEES AS THE EMBOLISM HITS HIM. SHE STARES INTO HIS EYES
text: AS HIS BODY CONVULSES.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Did you really think I wouldn't be waiting for you?
text: He reaches out to grab her but she runs through the door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Laurie running down the hall as Michael staggers to his feet, starts coming

scene_heading: INT STAIRWELL - FOLLOWING
text: Laurie ducks inside, barrels up the flight of the stairs and through the

scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS
text: Laurie runs across the roof, turns to looks back at
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: -- AS MICHAEL COMES OUT AFTER HER. HE'S IN NO HURRY: THERE'S NOWHERE FOR
dialog: HER TO GO.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON LAURIE
text: AS SHE TURNS TO FACE HIM, UNAFRAID.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Just you and me, right? Isn't that the way it needs to be?
text: She takes a step backward. Then another.
text: HE MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY, THEN HESITATES.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's the matter, just hate to see it end?
text: They look at each other across the roof.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You tried to turn me into you, but you failed. And you'll
dialog: never find my son. Never.
text: He just stares at her through empty eyes.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You can kill me, but you can't take my soul -- it's not mine
dialog: to give.
text: She takes another step backward.
speaker_heading: ANGLE TO SEE
text: SHE IS STANDING ALMOST AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE ROOF.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MICHAEL
text: AS HIS HESITATION LEAVES HIM. HE STRIDES PURPOSEFULLY FORWARD UNTIL THEY
text: ARE STANDING ONLY A FEW FEET APART.
text: HE HAS A KNIFE IN HIS HAND. SHE LOOKS AT IT, AT HIM.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: I'm not afraid to die...
text: He looks into her eyes with a weird curiosity.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...and I'm not afraid of you.
text: And he THRUSTS the knife up into her stomach --
text: BUT SHE CLASPS BOTH HANDS AROUND HIS WRIST IN AN IRON GRIP --
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Come with me, Michael....
text: And she steps backward and OVER the edge of the roof, PULLING Michael,
text: who's still gripping the knife, over with her....
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON THEM
text: AS MICHAEL CATCHES THE EDGE OF THE ROOF WITH ONE HAND, HIS OTHER STILL
text: GRIPPING THE KNIFE IMBEDDED IN HER BELLY AS SHE HOLDS ONTO HIS WRIST,

speaker_heading: CLOSER ON THEM
text: AS ONCE AGAIN, AND FOR THE LAST TIME, THEIR EYES MEET, THIS TIME ONLY
scene_heading: INCHES SEPARATING THEM --
dialog: HE LETS GO OF THE KNIFE --
scene_heading: AND LAURIE FALLS, FREE OF HIM FOREVER --
scene_heading: THROUGH MICHAEL'S EYES
text: WE SEE HER BODY HIT THE DARK ROCKY HILLSIDE FAR BELOW.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MICHAEL

speaker_heading: SUDDENLY HIS IMAGE

speaker_heading: VOICE (OVER)
dialog: My guest tonight is Internet entrepreneur Freddie Harris,
dialog: whose latest venture seems to have captured the imagination
dialog: of Net surfers everywhere.
dialog: int. newsroom studio - nIGHT
text: where an INTERVIEW is ON THE AIR. Host BARRY FISHER sits across a desk
text: from tonight's guest, FREDDIE HARRIS.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Well, Barry, to succeed you have to keep your finger on the
dialog: pulse of America. The Net is real, it's immediate.
dialog: Anything can happen -- and we hope it does.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: To those viewers who may not know, tomorrow night,
text: Halloween, live on the Internet, five college students are
dialog: going to enter the childhood home of infamous mass murder
dialog: Michael Myers.
dialog: Freddie
dialog: Barry, we are going to explore the heart of darkness, the
text: enigma inside the conundrum in the center of the riddle:
dialog: the childhood home of the most brutal mass murderer in
dialog: history.
dialog: Barry
dialog: Well, I don't know if it's really --
dialog: Freddie
dialog: This is the house where Michael Myers was born, where he
dialog: spent his formative years. If there are any secrets to be
dialog: learned about why he did what he did -- they're in that
dialog: house. And tomorrow night we'll uncover them.
dialog: Barry
dialog: I've read where you've promised the five students free
dialog: college tuition through graduation.
dialog: Freddie
dialog: All they have to do is spend the night in the house and
dialog: discover the truth behind the killer.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: This is be the first Internet production of its kind, isn't
dialog: that true?
dialog: Freddie
dialog: (selling it)
dialog: This is where it's all heading, Barry. Put down the remote
dialog: and pick up your mouse -- this ain't TV, it's real life.
dialog: The Net as a source of entertainment is an unstoppable
dialog: force. Or, as I call it...Netertainment!
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Well, that's quite the sales pitch, Freddie. But do you
dialog: have any concerns for the safety of the six students? I
dialog: mean, the house hasn't been entered in how many years?
dialog: Freddie
dialog: We're not looking to get anyone hurt, Barry, just uncover
dialog: the truth behind a legend.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: What do you think it says about a society that so many of us
dialog: are willing to sit back and watch other people do things, on
dialog: TV, and, now, on the Net?
dialog: Freddie
dialog: See, Barry, I believe reality is he biggest illusion of all.
dialog: Did you know I'm a practicing Buddhist? Who's to say that
dialog: virtual reality is any less real that real reality?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Well, I'm not really sure I --
dialog: Freddie
dialog: Besides, doesn't everyone have just a little of the voyeur
dialog: in them?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Well, I'll let that be a rhetorical question. How were the
dialog: students picked?
dialog: Freddie
dialog: They were chosen from among the student body of Braddock
text: University just outside Haddonfield. They represent a cross-
dialog: section of America. We've got Jim Douglas....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
text: The room is in an astonishing state of disarray, books and half-written
text: term papers co-mingling with beer cans and bongs. JIM DOUGLAS is talking
text: to an unseen INTERVIEWER. The sequence is shot in STREAMING VIDEO.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
dialog: What about the publicity? The loss of privacy?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Privacy? That's a joke, man. Who's ever private anymore?
dialog: Anywhere you go -- the bank, 7-Eleven -- there's a camera.
dialog: You can't even screw your girlfriend in an elevator anymore
dialog: without winding up on "America's Most Outrageous
dialog: Copulations." Privacy is an antiquated notion, man.
speaker_heading: Freddie (V.O.)
dialog: Donna Chang....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER DORM ROOM - DAY
dialog: This one couldn't be more different from Jim's. It's neat and ordered; the
text: walls are covered with posters of Gloria Steinen and Eleanor Smeal. DONNA
text: CHANG, bright, intense, is being interviewed in STREAMING VIDEO.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don't know why I sent my name in. In many ways it's
dialog: against everything I believe in. I mean, the sensationalism
dialog: and everything. But I'm fascinated by the narratives that
dialog: inform our culture. This is just one of those narratives.
speaker_heading: Freddie (V.O.)
dialog: Jenna Cartman....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Where we find JENNA CARTMAN, pretty and pouty in jeans and sweatshirt,
text: working a waitress shift.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Well, we're all, like, different people. Donna is real, you
dialog: know, political. She's all like, you shouldn't buy into
dialog: this whole Madison Avenue paternal media whatever. Like I
dialog: give a shit that some fat chick burned her bra fifty years
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: Freddie (V.O.)
dialog: Rudy Johnson....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: At the university's Home Economics program, where we watch RUDY JOHNSON in
text: STREAMING VIDEO as he prepares a soufflé.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: A group of people is like the ingredients in a recipe. You
dialog: have to nurse them along, be attentive, and everything will
dialog: blend just perfectly. If you don't -- disaster.
text: He flashes a smile as he slips the soufflé in the oven.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (V.O.)
dialog: Bill Woodhouse....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY
text: We FOLLOW student BILL WOODHOUSE, in STREAMING VIDEO, as he takes a lap
text: around the track.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah, Rudy's got this whole peace-out thing going, like
dialog: we're this little microcosm of America, our own little
dialog: melting pot. But it's a fantasy. Nothing ever really
text: melts, it just burns.
speaker_heading: Freddie (V.O.)
dialog: And Sara Mercer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY
text: Where we find SARA MERCER, attractive in an unassuming way, intelligent
text: eyes looking earnestly at us in STREAMING VIDEO.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Actually, I'd never even heard of Michael Myers before the
dialog: drawing.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's just, my scholarship runs out this year and, well, I
dialog: could really use free college tuition and housing till
dialog: graduation.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
dialog: No interest in uncovering the mystery of the Halloween
dialog: murders?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Well. Everyone likes a good mystery.
speaker_heading: HER IMAGE TRANSFORMS
text: ...FROM STREAMING VIDEO INTO REALITY AS WE GO TO
scene_heading: INT. SARA'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara is tossing some books in her backpack when we hear the familiar
text: "You've Got Mail," and she goes to her desk.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON COMPUTER

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON SARA
text: SMILING AS SHE READS THE MESSAGE. SHE TYPES HER RESPONSE.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (as she types)
dialog: This isn't fair. You know everything about me and I don't
dialog: know anything about you.
text: She is about to post, then adds:
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I don't even know if "Deckard" is your real name.
text: She clicks on "send."
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Chat room romance?
speaker_heading: ANGLE TO FIND
scene_heading: SARA'S ROOMMATE, JANE, IN THE OPEN DOORWAY. SARA TURNS.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yes, that's so like me. Just meet some stud online and

text: Jane nods to Sara's backpack brimming with books.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're not even going to be gone a day.
dialog: Sara
dialog: You know, for the ride over.
speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: -- wow, that would be torture.
speaker_heading: Male voice (O.S.)
dialog: Don't do it.
dialog: Angle to find
text: ARON, a geeky guy in a Michael Myers t-shirt, standing in
dialog: the doorway.
dialog: Aron
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Some things you just don't fuck with. Michael Myers is one
dialog: of those things.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Don't you have a letter to write to Charlie Manson or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's just a house, Aron.
dialog: Aron
dialog: It's the house where it all started.
text: He comes further into the room.
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: (continuing)
text: He walked its hallways, played in its rooms, dreamed in bed
text: at night. He kept his mother company in the kitchen, watched
text: TV in the living room with the family....
text: His eyes are lit with the intensity of a zealot.
speaker_heading: ARON

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Turn of the century Russian. His enemies poisoned him but

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: White guy?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah. Then they burned the body and buried it.
speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: DONNA

dialog: It's just...I don't want this thing to be, well,

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Jeez, a live-on-the-Net tour
dialog: of the home of the worst serial killer in history. What
dialog: could be exploitational about that?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don't want this to be seen as glorifying violence.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I thought Ted Bundy killed the most people.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nah, man, Bundy is nowhere near the record. Henry Lee Lucas

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: Myers has entered the dark mythology of America, my friends.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Dark mythology. I like that.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (hamming it up)
dialog: He's become part of the horror that's been the underside of

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ghosts of revenge? You just make this shit up? Out of your

scene_heading: BRIAN JUMPS BACK IN FRIGHT -- BUT THE FIGURE SIMPLY PULLS THE CHEAP NOVELTY

dialog: Brian
dialog: I'm here to do a fucking job, okay?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Sorry, it was just a joke. Don't go Oliver Stone on me.
dialog: Brian
dialog: Look, just check out the control room and make sure we're
dialog: going online tonight, okay?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: You got it.
text: Charley turns away and heads down the stairs and we
speaker_heading: FOLLOW BRIAN
text: BACK TO THE CABINET. HE LIFTS THE CAMERA AND POSITIONS IT. THEN HE HEARS
text: SOMETHING BEHIND HIM. THIS TIME HE JUST IGNORES IT, SIGHING. HE REACHES

scene_heading: THROUGH THE CAMERA

speaker_heading: WE

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE/CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

text: position at a MIXING PANEL with an array of dials, levers, and switchers,

text: of wires and electrical cables feeding the system.
text: CHARLEY SETS A GIANT CUP OF STARBUCK'S MOCHACCINO AT THE EDGE. HE FLIPS A
text: SWITCH ON THE CONSOLE AND SEVERAL MONITORS LIGHT UP. HE REACHES TO TAKE A
text: SIP OF HIS COFFEE, NEVER NOTICING THAT ON ONE OF THE MONITORS MICHAEL MYERS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: So, tell us, tough guy, what are you going to do if Michael
dialog: Myers decides to come home tonight?
dialog: Bill
dialog: Hide behind one of the women?

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No, I think you remembered.
speaker_heading: DONNA

scene_heading: INT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Finished up and took off. I haven't seen him since this
dialog: afternoon.
dialog: Freddie
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Don't need him. Once we're up the system pretty much runs
dialog: itself.
dialog: Freddie
dialog: Gear 'em up and let's get rolling.
text: Charley hands each of them a large, police-style flashlight, then pulls out
text: what looks like a baseball-style cap, puts it on his head. He turns to the
dialog: students.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: This is a hat-cam. Whatever you see, we'll see. I've also
dialog: got some mini clip-on cameras.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE HAT-CAM

scene_heading: EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: outside.
text: FREDDIE CHECKS HIS WATCH.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: All right, guys, two minutes.

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: FREDDIE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE/CONTROL ROOM - FOLLOWING

speaker_heading: CHARLEY

text: Freddie scowls at Charley's giant cup of Mochaccino.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE

speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Let me guess. A lot?
dialog: Freddie
dialog: That shit'll kill you.
speaker_heading: ChaRLEY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The students poke about with FLASHLIGHTS: the furniture all appears to be

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let's keep an eye on each other, this place is old, might

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Did you think I was planning on wandering around here by
dialog: myself?
dialog: Donna
dialog: Looks like nothing's been moved in years.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: After the murders the family just sealed the place off and

speaker_heading: JiM

dialog: anyway.
scene_heading: Int. KITCHEN - nIGHT
text: The five students enter, their flashlight beams casting about the old

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I love these old stoves. Call me crazy, but I just don't
dialog: think electric burners allow flavors to meld the same way.
dialog: Donna
dialog: Not a big fan of the microwave, I take it.
text: He looks at her with disdain.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And it's so quick.
text: Rudy goes over to examine an old spice rack, pulls a jar out.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Wow, wonder what twenty-year-old fennel tastes like.
dialog: Jim
dialog: What are we going to find in the kitchen? Unless you think
dialog: his diet turned him into a killer.
dialog: Jenna
dialog: Wasn't there that serial killer who ate all those Devil
dialog: Dogs?
speaker_heading: DonnA
dialog: That was Twinkies.
dialog: Sara
dialog: And he wasn't a serial killer.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Check this out....
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: BILL, OVER BY THE KITCHEN COUNTER. HE IS LOOKING AT AN OLD KNIFE RACK.
text: SLOWLY HE PULLS A LARGE BLADE OUT OF ITS SLOT.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You don't suppose that's the one he used to....
speaker_heading: JiM
dialog: No way, cops would've kept that in an evidence locker
dialog: somewhere.

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: So, why do you think he did it?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Population control.
text: They wander about in the semi-dark.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I have a theory.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Let me guess. TV violence.
text: He moves over to an ancient console television, sits on it.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I mean, they didn't have video games back then, so it must
dialog: have been Saturday morning cartoons that turned him into a
dialog: killer.
dialog: Donna
dialog: I think he just liked it.
text: Jim moves over to her, looks at her face in the half-light.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What, no abuse excuse? No Freud? Don't tell me that

dialog: Makes me want to see what other doors of mystery you might

dialog: Donna
dialog: Does that half-ass Jim Morrison shit work with the chicks in

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Man, I don't even have an opinion.

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Maybe she'll find a man-size dress in there.

speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: JeNNA

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Actually, I think I'll stand.

speaker_heading: SARA

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE/CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Mind if I grab a smoke?
dialog: Freddie

speaker_heading: CharLEY

speaker_heading: FREDDIE

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - FOLLOWING

speaker_heading: FOLLOW HIM

speaker_heading: BEHIND THEM
text: WE SEE A LARGE SHAPE COME UP IN THE DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CHARLEY

text: STARTLED, BUT NOT SURPRISED.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: What the hell are you doing out here? I thought you were
dialog: supposed to --
text: But he is cut off in mid-thought. His mouth opens but nothing comes out.
text: He looks down at his stomach -- and sees the gardener's trowel imbedded in

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Jim playfully swings around in front of Donna, blocking her.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Come on, when are you going to admit you like me?
dialog: Donna
dialog: That's a double bind question. Kind of like, "Have you

text: But suddenly she grabs his shirt and pulls him to her.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: So tell me -- have you stopped beating your dog?
scene_heading: TIGHTER ON THEM

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You suppose they've got cameras down here?
text: He points to the lapel cam she's wearing.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Afraid of losing your standing in the sisterhood?
dialog: Donna
dialog: Don't flatter yourself. Screwing a poetry major would
dialog: practically be lesbianism.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I can get behind that.
text: He folds her sweater back to BLOCK the lapel cam, then kisses her again and
text: they fall back against an old door -- and SUDDENLY the ancient wood of the

dialog: dresser.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This must've been his room.

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: SARA AS SHE FINALLY GETS THE ANCIENT TRUNK LID OPEN -- AND A SMALL HEAD

text: BILL LOOKS OVER FROM THE DRESSER.
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Check this out.

dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What do you think's back there?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I don't know, black magic shrine? Maybe his parents were

speaker_heading: MICHAEL SPINS
text: TOWARD THE CONTROL PANEL AS HE HEARS HER.
speaker_heading: SARA DUCKS
text: BACK DOWN BEHIND THE CONTROL PANEL WITH THE CABLE. SHE PEERS BACK THROUGH
text: THE MASS OF WIRES AND CONNECTORS AS THE SHAPE MOVES TOWARD HER, HOMING IN
text: ON HIS TARGET LIKE A SHARK.
text: SHE LOOKS AROUND FRANTICALLY, NOTICING:
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: CHARLEY'S GIANT CUP OF MOCHACCINO, AT THE EDGE OF THE PANEL.
speaker_heading: SHE REACHES
text: ONE HAND QUIETLY UP TO GRAB THE CUP, THEN DUCKS BACK DOWN AS
speaker_heading: MICHAEL MOVES
text: AMONG THE CABLES AND HARDWARE, KNIFE GLINTING IN HIS HAND.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON SARA
text: AS SHE QUIETLY SPILLS THE COFFEE IN A PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR, THEN TRIES TO
text: HIDE BACK BEHIND THE CONTROL PANEL AS SUDDENLY
speaker_heading: MICHAEL APPEARS
text: ABOVE HER AND HIS KNIFE SLASHES VICIOUSLY DOWN TOWARD HER BUT HIS ARM GETS
text: CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF CONNECTING CABLES.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: AS SARA TRIES TO SLIP BY HIM IN THE NARROW SPACE AS MICHAEL THRASHES ABOUT
text: IN THE CABLES, GETTING ENTANGLED, SPARKS FLYING AS HIS BLADE SLASHES
text: THROUGH WIRES AND CONNECTORS.
text: SARA POKES AT HIM WITH THE PRONGS OF THE ELECTRICAL WIRE, CATCHING HIM IN
text: THE TORSO AND CAUSING HIS BODY TO SPASM EVEN MORE VIOLENTLY AS THE KNIFE
text: SWINGS DOWN AT HER, MISSING HER BY INCHES.
text: FINALLY MICHAEL FREES HIMSELF AND COMES AFTER HER....
text: SARA BREAKS FOR THE DOOR, DROPPING THE CABLE INTO THE POOL OF COFFEE -- AS
text: MICHAEL LUNGES AT HER...THEN STIFFENS AS WE HEAR A CRACKLE. SHE TURNS BACK
text: TO THE SIZZLING AND SPUTTERING.
text: MICHAEL STANDS STIFFLY IN THE POOL OF BLOOD, HIS BACK ARCHING RAMROD
text: STRAIGHT AS THE VOLTAGE COURSES THROUGH HIS BODY. SMOKE POURS FROM THE
text: MASK EYEHOLES, UNTIL IT STARTS MELTING, MERGING WITH HIS FACE.
text: SARA WATCHES IN HORROR AND RELIEF AS FINALLY MICHAEL SLUMPS AS THE
text: ELECTRICITY SHORTS OUT IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS, HIS BODY HELD UP BY THE
scene_heading: CABLES IN AN EERIE TABLEAU, ARMS SPREAD CRUCIFORM LIKE A DARK MESSIAH OF
text: THE NEW MILLENNIUM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - NIGHT
text: The PLASMA SCREEN goes BLACK and everybody moans.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Hey! Ripoff!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE/CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The hot electrical wires suddenly BURST into FLAME and quickly IGNITE the
text: ancient try timbers of the garage.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON SARA
text: TRYING TO RUN THROUGH THE OBSTACLE COURSE OF CABLE AND ELECTRONICS AND OLD
speaker_heading: JUNK AS
speaker_heading: ALL AROUND HER
text: FLAMING CHUNKS OF WOOD ARE FALLING AND BURSTING INTO NEW OUTBREAKS OF FIRE
dialog: --
text: THE DOOR IS BLOCKED BY A HEAP OF BURNING RUBBLE --
scene_heading: SHE LOOKS AROUND FRANTICALLY, TRAPPED UNTIL --
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY A FOOT
text: CRASHES THROUGH THE BURNING WALL AND A HAND REACHES INSIDE --
speaker_heading: MYLES (O.S.)
dialog: Sara!
text: She reaches for the hand --
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE/CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Myles PULLS her through the crumbling burning wall to safety and they fall
text: to the lawn. In the distance, we finally hear the police and fire engine
speaker_heading: SIRENS.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GARAGE
text: NOW FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES, POPPING AND CRACKLING.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: SARA AND MYLES WATCHING AS
speaker_heading: THE GARAGE
scene_heading: FINALLY ERUPTS IN ONE FINAL SPASM OF FIRE -- THEN COLLAPSES IN ON ITSELF,
text: ON MICHAEL MYERS, IN A CONFLAGRATION SENDING FLAMES LEAPING HIGH INTO THE
speaker_heading: NIGHT SKY.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: SARA AND MYLES, AS SHE TURNS TO HIM, STILL OUT OF BREATH.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I got one question.
speaker_heading: MYLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: MyLES
dialog: Well. Um. That might require some explaining....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: AERIAL VIEW
text: LOOKING DOWN ON THE MYERS HOUSE FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A NEWS
text: HELICOPTER. BY NOW POLICE, FIRE, AND EMS VEHICLES ARE ALL AROUND,
text: ASSESSING THE CARNAGE. WE MOVE DOWN TO
speaker_heading: GROUND LEVEL
text: AND MOVE PAST DONALDSON, WHO'S LEANING AGAINST A POLICE CAR. HIS SHIRT IS
text: UNBUTTONED AND WE SEE THE BULLETPROOF VEST UNDERNEATH. ONE OF THE
text: HADDONFIELD COPS NODS AT THE VEST.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: We were supposed to get those.
speaker_heading: DonaldSON
dialog: I highly recommend them.
speaker_heading: CONTINUE MOVING
text: UNTIL WE FIND SARA, WRAPPED IN AN EMS BLANKET SITTING ON THE GROUND BESIDE
text: MYLES. HE LOOKS AT HER, SHRUGS.
speaker_heading: MYLES
dialog: I guess you were probably expecting somebody, you
dialog: know...taller.
speaker_heading: SaRA
dialog: Well, I was accepting somebody who shaved.
speaker_heading: MYLES
dialog: It's not like I won't. Eventually.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Actually, it's pretty funny.
speaker_heading: MYLES
dialog: It is?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: My roommate said you were probably fifty and bald.
text: He grins, rubs his head.
speaker_heading: MYLES
dialog: Got lots of hair.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MyLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You still haven't told me. Is Deckard your real name?
speaker_heading: MyLES
dialog: You'll think I'm lame.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, I won't.
speaker_heading: MYLES
dialog: He's the hero in "Blade Runner." It's my favorite movie.
dialog: My real name's Myles. Berman.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, Myles Berman, I think I owe you a Mochaccino.
text: Their voices slowly FADE OUT as we start MOVING AWAY from the
text: backyard...and edge up into the deep black night sky.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MYERS YARD - PRE-DAWN
text: Firemen sift through the SMOKING rubble of the garage.
speaker_heading: A SMALL CROWD
text: OF ONLOOKERS WATCHES FROM BEHIND POLICE BARRICADES, AMONG THEM PARENTS WITH
text: KIDS STILL DRESSED IN HALLOWEEN REGALIA.
speaker_heading: WE FIND DONALDSON
text: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RUINS, SEARCHING, SEARCHING.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: ONE OF THE FIREMEN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: Nothing here....
text: Donaldson looks over at him.
speaker_heading: DONALDSON
dialog: Is it possible there's nothing left of him? That he just
dialog: burned up?
speaker_heading: FireMAN
dialog: No way. Takes three hours at fifteen hundred degrees to
dialog: cremate a body, and you'll still find bone fragments.
speaker_heading: DonalDSON
dialog: Then he's got to be in here.
speaker_heading: GO CLOSER
text: TO DONALDSON AS HE CONTINUES THE SEARCH WITH INTENSITY, MOVING AMONG THE
text: CHARRED RUINS. HE LIFTS ONE FRAGMENT OF WOOD THEN ANOTHER, FINDING
text: NOTHING. WITH A STRANGE DESPERATION HE SQUATS DOWN TO PRY A BLACKENED BEAM
text: LOOSE -- BUT THERE IS NOTHING UNDERNEATH BUT MORE EMBERS.
text: SUDDENLY HE HEARS A CRUNCH FROM BEHIND HIM AND TURNS --
scene_heading: AND MICHAEL MYERS
text: IS STANDING BEHIND HIM WITH KNIFE UPRAISED --
speaker_heading: DONALDSON FALLS
text: BACK INTO THE ASHES AS WE GO
scene_heading: WIDER TO REVEAL
text: IT'S JUST A KID IN MICHAEL MYERS COSTUME WHO SOMEHOW GOT PAST THE POLICE
scene_heading: LINE. HIS FATHER GRABS THE RUBBER KNIFE OUT OF HIS HAND AND SCURRIES HIM
speaker_heading: AWAY.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON DONALDSON
text: STILL CATCHING HIS BREATH, SPOOKED.
text: THEN HE LOOKS OVER AND FINDS
scene_heading: ANOTHER MICHAEL MYERS
text: STANDING BEHIND A POLICE CAR.
speaker_heading: AND ANOTHER ONE
scene_heading: STANDING NEAR A TREE.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DONALDSON
text: AS HE LOOKS THIS WAY AND THAT AS
scene_heading: SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE
text: WE SEE MICHAEL MYERS, ALL AROUND US, A SERIES OF MASKS, WHITE FACES AND
text: DARK JUMPSUITS IN THE CROWD, ON THE STREET. IS ONE OF THEM REAL? IS HE
text: ESCAPING IN A SEA OF IMITATORS?
speaker_heading: A WIDENING CIRCLE
text: FINDS ONE FACE. THEN ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER.
scene_heading: ALL AROUND US.
text: THEN SUDDENLY NOTHING. NOTHING.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT
text: TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
