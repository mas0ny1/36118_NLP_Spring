text: From the bathroom comes another sound: a male GRUNT.
text: Still half asleep, and unsure of what is happening, Helen’s

text: She hears FOOTSTEPS walking tot he bedroom. Helen watches

text: Then the sound of BREATHING, deep, male, terrifying.
text: Suddenly, in the gloom, she sees the figure of a MAN, lunging

text: Helen finds her voice and screams. The man grabs her. Helen

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY 29
text: Helen is driving, Bernadette is next to her. Both are

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: BERNADETTE
dialog: We look like cops.

scene_heading: INT. CAR ~ DAY 31

speaker_heading: BERNADETTE
dialog: No... no need... go straight.

speaker_heading: HELEN

dialog: hall.
scene_heading: INT. PROJECT BUILDING - DAY 33
text: Helen and Bernadette stand in the small entrance hall.
text: Shattered mail boxes opposite steel elevator doors. Every
text: available surface is covered in graffiti; multiple layers of
text: designs, names, incomprehensible scrawl. An explosion of
dialog: discordant primary colors. i
text: Inside the building seems so derelict and unwelcoming that no
text: human being could inhabit it. Helen and Bernadette walk to
text: the elevators and push the call button. The Gangbangers
text: watch. There is a long pause. Bernadette feels eyes boring
text: holes in the back of her neck. Then one of the Gangbangers
text: gives a short laugh. Helen calls the elevator again. It is
text: clearly not working. Helen turns determinedly and leads :
text: Bernadette to the stairwell. They start to walk upstairs. i
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 34
text: The windows are boarded and there are no lights. We follow
text: Helen and Bernadette as they climb the stairs, which twist az

scene_heading: INT. RAMP - PROJECT BUILDING - DAY 35
text: Helen and Bernadette emerge onto a ramp. A grille is fixed
text: across the balcony like a prison. As they walk along, a
text: giant message is revealed, painted in extravagant colors on
text: the opposite wall. It reads:
text: SWEETS TO THE SWEET
text: Helen reaches into her bag and produces a camera. She begins
text: to photograph the graffiti. It is far too large for a single
text: shot so she moves along the design taking a composite
dialog: picture.
text: A door, completely camouflaged by the graffiti, opens ona
text: chain. Helen is startled. She sees a Rottweiler growling at
text: her, held back on a chain. A young woman stares out from
text: behind the door. She is small and vulnerable: her name is
scene_heading: ANNE-MARIE.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hello... I’m sorry if I-
text: Anne-Marie slams the door shut, leaving Helen and Bernadette
text: alone on the ramp again. Helen continues to photograph the
text: design. The graffiti seems to converge, perhaps even point
text: to a battered door at the other end of the ramp. Taking
text: pictures all the way, Helen is inexorably drawn towards the
text: door. Bernadette follows, increasingly uncomfortable. The
text: door bears the number 404.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Here it is...
speaker_heading: BERNADETTE
dialog: Someone could be in there.

speaker_heading: BERNADETTE
dialog: Jesus, it stinks!
text: They move past a disemboweled couch, deeper into the gloom.
text: Their feet squelch on the sodden carpet. The walls are

dialog: the bathroom.
speaker_heading: HELEN .
dialog: See... I was right. The layout is
dialog: identical... This must be the
dialog: bathroom...
text: The door is shut. Helen goes to open it.

dialog: Helen!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What’s the problem?

speaker_heading: BERNADETTE

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It’s okay... there’s nothing to

text: We see the broken, soiled bathroom fittings. The layout is
text: the same as Helen’s.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Wait a minute...

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BEYOND THE HOLE - DAY 37
text: Helen moves cautiously through the next door apartment. It
text: is in a similar state of dereliction. She takes photos,
text: using the moment of light from the flash on her camera to
text: guide her way through the sordid piles of garbage. In the
text: far wall of what must once have been the living room, a large
text: hole has been sledgehammered. The thin cinderblock smashed
text: through with ease. Helen clambers through lead deeper and
dialog: deeper into this labyrinth.
scene_heading: INT. BEYOND THE. SECOND HOLE - DAY 38
text: We PULL BACK with Helen as she scrambles through the second
text: hole. The CAMERA reveals something she has not yet seen:
text: A VAST HEAD has been sprayed onto the bare cinderblock around
text: the hole, which is placed centrally like a mouth. Cheekbones
text: jutting through the dark skin; teeth sharpened to irregular
text: points, all converging on the hole. It is a face filled with
text: ruined beauty, at one terrifying and perversely attractive.
text: A nightmarish vision, to be sure, but somewhere in his eyes
text: is a melancholy.
text: Helen turns and sees the painting. His eyes fix mercilessly.
text: She raises her camera. There is a whirring sound as she has
text: come to the end of a roll of film. Her bag with the
text: replacements, she left with Bernadette.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Idiot.
text: Her feet stumble against a squalid mattress on the floor.
text: She glances down. Something glistens in the light.
text: Helen beds down to look more closely. It is a handful of

text: She opens one and jumps. Something has pricked her finger.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE CANDY

speaker_heading: HELEN
