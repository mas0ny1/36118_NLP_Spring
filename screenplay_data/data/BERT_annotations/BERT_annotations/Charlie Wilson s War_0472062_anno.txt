dialog: Part I:
dialog: A Hot Tub in Vegas
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FANTASY SUITE, CAESAR'S PALACE - NIGHT
dialog: We'll get to the hot tub in a second. The first thing we need
text: to know is that there's a large television nearby that's on
text: but that no one's paying attention to. At the moment it's
text: showing a commercial for a shampoo called Gee, Your Hair
text: Smells Terrific. Men are passing women on the street and
dialog: telling them that, "Gee, your hair smells terrific."
text: We don't care, 'cause the rest of the room is populated with
dialog: hot women who'll be having sex with strangers tonight. The
text: sound of the shampoo commercial is easily overtaken by The
text: Fine Young Cannibals. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows we
text: can see the lights of the Strip and a couple of room service
text: WAITERS are wheeling in another table of booze, ice and
dialog: glasses.
text: In the large jacuzzi are PAUL BROWN, 40 and wants to be
text: younger; LIZ WICKERSHAM, a recent Playboy cover model; two
text: STRIPPERS who may or may not be wearing any clothes right now
text: and our star, CHARLIE WILSON.
text: Joints make their way around the room, as do small mirrors
dialog: with lines.
text: PAUL BROWN isn't a real player and CHARLIE knows it, but he'll
dialog: do his best to humor the guy for LIZ's sake.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: It'd be like Dallas.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That's xight.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tell me when to watch, I'll make sure I'm
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You don't think I can make it happen?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know anything about how any of
dialog: that works.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: LIZ
speaker_heading: (to CHARLIE)
dialog: You said you'd listen to him, that's why
dialog: we're here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do they routinely give starring roles on
dialog: network programs to people who've never
dialog: acted professionally before?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: She was just on the fucking cover of
dialog: Playboy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I guess that's the same thing.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Would you take this seriously, please.
dialog: Will you hear the whole pitch and take it
dialog: seriously?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE:
dialog: I do take it seriously, honey, but can I
dialog: ask y'all somethin’? What the fuck is Dan
dialog: Rather wearing right now?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE:
dialog: Dan Rather.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED),
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: CHARLIE's talking about the TV, which no longer has a shampoo
text: commercial on it but instead that night's edition of 60
text: Minutes. DAN RATHER's delivering a report from Afghanistan and
text: he's dressed in traditional Afghan tribal clothing.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You're watching TV?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE \
dialog: And he hasn't shaved. i
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Who gives a damn?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: (calling to a guy near the TV)
dialog: Excuse me, could you turn that up?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You said you were gonna take this meeting
dialog: seriously,
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I am.
dialog: (to the GUY)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: @ The GUY looks at CHARLIE...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you. mind turning up the volume on
dialog: the TV?
dialog: Guy
dialog: I'm completely high.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, well, still, if you could just grab
dialog: that remote, there should be a button
dialog: that says--Nope you turned it off. That
dialog: was the power button.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Charlie, are we gonna do business?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dan Rather's wearing a turban, you don’t
dialog: want to know why?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It was a thing from India.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: @ Afghanistan.
dialog: {to the GUY)
dialog: There you go, you're on it. Now the

speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: 'Preciate it.
text: We're watching and listening to snatches of the 60 Minutes
dialog: report——
speaker_heading: DAN RATHER
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: Does he have ammunition for this? He has
dialog: three--but does he have ammunition? A lot
dialog: ammunition?
speaker_heading: CHARLIB
text: He's talking about the Mujahideen.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Priests?
speaker_heading: @ CHARLIE
dialog: Mujahideen means freedom fighters.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Priests?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: How the hell am I supposed to know?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: These guys are fighting the Red Army with
text: sticks and stones.
text: We'll stay on CHARLIE and the TV while we HEAR LIZ and BROWN
text: in the background.
speaker_heading: LIZ
speaker_heading: (to BROWN)
dialog: Do you think that instead of my money
dialog: coming from my father that I should be a
dialog: widow? That I was married to a Washington
text: power bxoker who gets killed in an
dialog: accident and that that’s where I have my
dialog: money from and not my father? Or would
dialog: that make me seem old?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED;
dialog: (5)
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: That's interesting, let me think on that
dialog: for a second.
speaker_heading: DAN RATHER
dialog: {on TV)
dialog: is he worried about these helicopters
dialog: back here? I hear that bombing sound in
dialog: the background.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to the TV)
dialog: Yes, Danny, he's worried.
speaker_heading: LIZ
speaker_heading: (to BROWN)
dialog: You know what I mean? When I say widow?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: That your husband died.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: AFGHAN FIGHTER
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: Without arms and ammunition, you cannot
dialog: fight. And no country is providing arms
dialog: to Mujahideen.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: You think it would make you seem old?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Possibly.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Because—~
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Because I was already married to someone
dialog: who, you know, was now dead.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: But if he's killed--
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That's right--
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: In a car crash--

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I'm an idiot.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: {from TV)
text: America seems to be asleep. It doesn't
dialog: seem to realize that if Afghanistan goes--
dialog: and the Russians go over the Gulf--that
dialog: in a very short time it’s going to be the
dialog: turn of the United States as well.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's a pretty gloomy fucking way to
dialog: look at it.
text: And now one of the two STRIPPERS in the hot tub speaks up--
speaker_heading: STRIPPER
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes ma'am.
speaker_heading: STRIPPER i
dialog: We were just wondering what you do for a
dialog: living?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm not a police officer if that's what
dialog: you're asking.
speaker_heading: STRIPPER #2
dialog: No, we just don't see a lot of guys up
dialog: here who both know about the world and

speaker_heading: CHARLIE:

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: In particular the periodic national and

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh bullshit, stay another night.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's very important to one of my
dialog: colleagues that liberal democrats show up
dialog: for this vote and this colleague is
dialog: important to me 'cause he's gonna put a
dialog: half-million dollar Paper Industry
dialog: International Hall of Fame in Appleton,
dialog: Wisconsin.
speaker_heading: BROWN

dialog: kind of thing that could be on the show.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No they make a lot of paper products in

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And they get a Hall of Fame?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But what I get is authorizing language
dialog: stricken from a pilot program in Denver
dialog: that would prohibit discussing birth
dialog: control in health education classes and
dialog: once I do that I can get the liberals and
dialog: the women to sign a non-binding
dialog: resolution declaring pretty much

dialog: out for her and due respect but I've
dialog: never heard of anyone seeking private
dialog: investors for a TV series so I'm gonna
dialog: ask around a little but finally, I'm from
dialog: Lufkin, Texas. I'm the son of an
dialog: accountant for a timber company, I take
dialog: home about 700 bucks a week and I pay
dialog: alimony, so the idea that I have $29,000
