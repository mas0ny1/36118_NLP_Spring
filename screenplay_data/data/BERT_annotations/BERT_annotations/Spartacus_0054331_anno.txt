text: Utter silence. A nightmare landscapsof dead animals, dead
text: men, dead women, thousands upon thousands of them, extending
text: as far as the eye can see in this dim light -- the field of
text: death, silent, lost, breathless. Although historians differ
dialog: on the number of slave and Roman dead at the Battle of the
text: Silarus River, it seems clear that between fifty and a hundred
dialog: thousand lay on the battlefield. It is a field of death, ex~
text: tending as far as the CAMERAS eye can penetrate.
text: Amidst the awesome litter of war we observe smashed baggage-
text: wagons, tattered remnants of tents, shattered arms and snielids.
text: The arms and iegs of dead horses, males, men, women, children,
text: convulsively up-thrust like columns of cacti against the low
text: horizon, impart a grotesque sense of unreality. It seems that
dialog: no breathing thing can possibly exist in this land of death,
text: nor hear amidst this silence. Abandoned by the world, lost and
text: forever forgotten, frozen in the positions at which death found
text: them, the vanquished have at last achieved their dream of
dialog: freedom and of peace.
text: In the immediate foreground a slave soldier sits erect, his
text: head bowed forward as if in prayer. The shifting balance inside
text: his congealing body causes him abruptly to topple over sidewise
text: with a shocking THUMP. At this moment our CAMERA begins to
text: TRUCK FORWARD. We see the body of David the Jew, transfixed
text: by a. spear through his chest. CAMERA MOVES FASTER -- then more
dialog: and more ewiftly, giving us the impression of passing upstream
text: through a swift-flowing river of corpses.
text: SOUND of a GROUP walking o.s. CAMERA PAUSES, seems almost to

text: body, as if to spare it the glance of Crassus, Her face has
dialog: been made up according to Roman fashion of the time: base
text: powder, cheek and lip rouge, black carbon shading beneath her
text: eyes, beaded leshes, arched brows. She wears a golden tiara
text: in her heir, glistening with rubies, Sapphire earrings set
