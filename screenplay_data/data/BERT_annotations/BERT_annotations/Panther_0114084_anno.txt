dialog: 1995
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT
text: The SCREEN stands BLACK, like a chalkboard... or a grave.
text: A SOUND builds, like a RADIO surfing channels. Snippets of
text: SONGS -- Joan Baez' "Blowin' in the Wind," James Brown's "I
text: Feel Good." The music of a different time.
speaker_heading: FOOTAGE
text: IMAGES hit the screen: ROSA PARKS, Peace Demonstrators
text: stuffing FLOWERS in the barrels of National Guard rifles.
text: Protesters in Birmingham, rallies on the White House Lawn.
text: Mixed in with the MUSIC comes NEWS BITES -- quick catchwords
dialog: of 60's turmoil -- "More troops to Vietnam," "Bus Boycott,"
text: "Sit ins," "Draft Dodgers," "Malcolm X speaking."
dialog: 
text: Then a SINGLE PHOTO settles on screen -- a ROW of BLACK
text: PANTHERS, fists raised, standing defiantly together.
text: The IMAGE FREEZES.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (over)
dialog: The Black Panthers.
dialog: 
text: As the PHOTO FADES, LIGHTS APPEAR. A SHAPE takes form. The
text: BAY BRIDGE arcs over silent water, spanning two worlds.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (over)
dialog: People still ask me how it all
dialog: started? How things went so far? And
dialog: like a lot of questions about the
dialog: Panthers, there are different answers.
dialog: Different beginnings...
text: Rising behind the voice, the noise of a CROWD can be heard.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (over)
dialog: What became the Black Panthers really
dialog: started with just two guys -- Bobby
dialog: Seale and Huey Newton -- saying two
dialog: words: “Defend Yourselves..." Legend
dialog: has it they met at some coffee house

text: where Bobby was running down a
dialog: xhyme...

scene_heading: TITLE: MARCH 17, 1965
text: BOBBY SEALE -- a skinny, kinetic black man sporting an Afro --
text: teeters on a chair in front of a small CROWD. He reads from
text: a crumpled sheaf of papers.
text: At the side of the crowd, HUEY NEWTON -- well-built, magnetic
text: watches, grooving on the rhythm of the words.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh yeah. Yeah it's easy to see right
dialog: on your black and white TV. Black
text: man. Blue cop. Red blood. Niggers
dialog: watch other niggers die. That's right
dialog: Niggers watching niggers die. That's
dialog: the American way...
text: A COMMOTION starts at the rear of the crowd. TWO UNIFORMED
text: COPS roughly make their way to Bobby. They pull him off his
text: chair, cracking his head against the ground.
text: The cop over Bobby raises his NIGHTSTICK...
text: A BLACK HAND grabs the club, stopping its arc.
text: Shocked, the cop turns. It's HUEY. With honed precision, he
text: DECKS the cop with his free hand.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR (BLACK/WHITE) - 1966 - DAY

speaker_heading: VOICE

scene_heading: TITLE: OAKLAND 1967
text: Teeming with life on a bright day, the Ghetto moves to its
text: own unique cadence. A YOUNG BOY, no older than ten, pedals
text: down the street on his BICYCLE.
text: A gust of wind brushes a SHAPELY WOMAN. She GRABS a HAT and
text: holds tight, ignoring her DRESS rising in the wind. The BOY
text: ogles her juicy thighs.
speaker_heading: SHAPELY WOMAN
dialog: Shucks I see you staring, but I ain't
text: letting go. Them hips is almost forty
dialog: years old but the hat is brand new!
text: AFRAID, the boy PASSES an OAKLAND POLICE CAR, cruising slowly
text: down Market. A WHITE COP scans the street.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
text: Continuing his ride, the BOY passes TYRONE (20's) -- a TOUGH
text: YOUTH -- who GLARES at the cop car, LEAFLETS in his HANDS.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
text: BLACK HANDS pour a CAN of LEMON JUICE into a BOTTLE of cheap
text: WHITE PORT. Shaking the mixture, then swigging it, ROSE (30's)

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes indeed, that Bitter Dog...

dialog: What's up little brother?

scene_heading: EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
text: Eyes downcast, the BOY passes REVEREND SLOCUM (50's) -- a

scene_heading: EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
text: On the street corner, SABU (20's) -- a Superfly young hustler
text: with a fast mouth -- trying to sell cigarette lighters to a
text: couple of HARD HATS heading off to work.
speaker_heading: SABU
dialog: I'm telling you, man. The perfect
dialog: gift for the sophisticated lady in
dialog: your life. Light up her flame with
dialog: some solid gold satisfaction and get

dialog: cy
dialog: Sabu, why're you still tryin’ to
dialog: sell these raggedy ass, non workin!
dialog: Korean lighters man?

scene_heading: END TITLE SEQUENCE:
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - 55TH AND MARKET STREETS - DAY
text: Suddenly a HORN blares, BRAKES screech.
text: Brutal, fast, a CAR plows into the child, sending him and

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - 55TH STREET - DAY
text: JUDGE (20's) -- an intense young man wearing a FATIGUE JACKET
text: STARES numbly at the child in the street. Neighborhood people

text: A WOMAN, perhaps the boy's mother, WAILS next to the body.
text: Judge's Mom, RITA (50's) -- raw boned and sharp eyed --
text: stands, drawn toward the tragedy.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh lord... not again...
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY
text: A CROWD -- including Reverend Slocum, Cy and the DRINKERS --

dialog: cy
dialog: God damn... Kid never had a chance...
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
text: The CAR backs up, trying to leave the scene.
text: Market street regulars SWARM around the retreating vehicle,

text: together, their faces contorted with RAGE.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (over)
dialog: People were pissed off. Neighborhood

scene_heading: EXT. CLOSE UP: BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT
text: A BASKETBALL bounces off the cement, SNEAKERED FEET scramble
dialog: past.
scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT
text: JUDGE drives in for a basket, pursued by CY. It's a friendly
text: three on three street game. The MARKET STREET DRINKERS --
text: including ROSE -- fill out Cy and Judge's teams.
text: Young neighborhood MEN watch the game and shoot the shit.
text: One of them, JAMAL, sports a beard and a DASHIKI.
text: Somewhere a RADIO plays James Brown's "Say it Loud"
scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT
text: Gliding around Cy, Judge sinks a basket. ROSE retrieves the
dialog: ball.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You supposed to be a wounded vet,
dialog: Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam
dialog: anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: All of the above, man...
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: And then some.
text: Shaking off the memory, Judge takes the ball in, PASSING it
text: to a teammate. The BALL arcs through the air...
scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL GAME - NIGHT
text: HANDS grab the ball before the teammate can. TYRONE'S hands.
text: The GAME stops dead. Tyrone holds the ball, eyeing the players
text: with contempt. At his side stands LITTLE BOBBY (16) hyper,
text: childlike.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Tell me, don't you fine black men
dialog: got anything better to do than play
dialog: games?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Sure I do, but your sister's busy.
dialog: Gimme the damn ball.
text: Tyrone passes the ball HARD to Rose.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Here... Take it. I thought some
dialog: righteous brothers like you might
dialog: help us out, but I guess that ain't
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: JAMAL
dialog: (stepping forward)
dialog: Help who? With what?
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Your community! That's who. Maybe
dialog: you didn't know but a kid died today.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: That's three this year... same spot.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Damn straight. And old Reverend
text: Slocum's having a vigil on that
text: corner, trying to get a stoplight
dialog: put in.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (to Cy)
dialog: My Mom's at that.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Funny you don't look like church
dialog: folk to me.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Oh I ain't. But it seems The Man's
dialog: getting uptight about black folk
text: standing in the street, causing a
dialog: fuss. What I'm asking for, is some
dialog: of your able black asses to come
text: down and be "Observers" on the cops.
dialog: Take down badge numbers. They don't
dialog: like pulling shit with too many eyes
dialog: on tem. So that's how you can help,
dialog: not by praying but by watching.
speaker_heading: DRINKER #1
dialog: Not me. This able black ass ain't
dialog: fucking with no cops.
text: Others MUMBLE in agreement, moving away from Tyrone.
speaker_heading: JAMAL
dialog: Look, I understand but if some Blacks
dialog: insist on trying to interact with
dialog: the white man, that's not our concern.
dialog: We are African, "brother." Mother
dialog: Africa is the only...
text: Anger FLASHES in Tyrone's eyes. His voice turn knifelike.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: No, you look, you phony ass boojie
dialog: nigger. We ain't in Africa, we're in
dialog: Oakland. And in Oakland we got police
dialog: brutality. We got the white man
text: interacting his billy club up against
dialog: the black man's head. Now if that
dialog: don't bother you, then take your
dialog: skirt wearing ass back to Africa...
dialog: "Uncle."
text: Jamal -- very angry -- takes a step toward Tyrone. Tyrone
text: backs him down with one fearsome look.
speaker_heading: TYRONE,
dialog: Try it.
text: Jamal backs away, joining Rose and the exiting drinkers.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: (watching them go)
dialog: Chickenshit boojie...
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: (to Judge and Cy)
dialog: What about you two? You were there,
dialog: you saw that kid?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I saw... but...
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: But nothing... you do live here don't
dialog: you?
text: Judge glares evenly back at Tyrone, sizing him up.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Yeah, I do.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: (to Judge and Cy)
dialog: Well, act like it. Come on.
text: Tyrone and Little Bobby leave the court. After a beat, Judge
text: and Cy follow. ROSE calls after them, BAITING.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You young niggas crazy. The Man ain't
dialog: gonna let us have no say in running
dialog: shit! Keep it up and he's gonna come
dialog: down on our ass like a ton of
dialog: bricks...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: Taking confident strides, Tyrone and Little Bobby lead Cy
text: and Judge down the street.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Don't let the cops provoke you. We're
dialog: there to watch and take badge
dialog: numbers...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: And who is we?
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: Brother where you been?
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: We're the Black Panthers.
text: Cy and Judge register the name.
dialog: cy
dialog: The Panthers...
dialog: (to Bobby)
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: Sixteen.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Shit, we made him get his moms to
dialog: give permission before he could sign
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Just a kid.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out
dialog: of kids too.
scene_heading: EXT. 55TH AND MARKET - NIGHT
text: A CIRCLE of church folk hold flickering CANDLES in the middle
text: of the intersection. Slocum's there as well as RITA. Their
text: faces are silent, passive in the candlelight.
text: POLICE CARS can be seen parked at the curbs. A small CADRE
text: of cops stands watching the congregation.
text: Tyrone, Judge and Cy approach the vigil. Looking around,
text: they spot other YOUNG BLACK MEN staked out at the four corners
dialog: of the intersection.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I thought you said all the Panthers
dialog: were gonna be here.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: What you see is what you got.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That's' Bobby Seale.
text: Judge's eyes pick BOBBY out, skinny, notebook at the ready.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Carter... buddy of mine from way
dialog: back... And Gene...
text: CARTER -- enormous, terrifying -- comes into view, then GENE -
text: a wiry street tough.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: And that... that's Huey...
text: Judge strains to focus on HUEY NEWTON -- who's just a
text: SILHOUETTE against a streetlight. There's a BOOK in his right
text: hand and an aura of power surrounding him.
dialog: cy
dialog: Ain't too many of you is there?
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: (a slight smile)
text: Only takes a single grain of sand to
dialog: move the world...
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOBBY
dialog: (spotting something)
dialog: Heads up!!!!
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT
text: A PATROL CAR floats to a quick stop at the curb. White haired,
text: red-faced, SERGEANT SCHRECK bounds from the car.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHRECK
dialog: What in the Sam Hell is this?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
text: A vigil for some pickaninny got hit
dialog: here.
scene_heading: SGT. SCHRECK
dialog: Vigil my ass...
text: Schreck GRABS a BULLHORN from the car.
speaker_heading: SCHRECK
dialog: (through the bullhorn)
dialog: Listen up, you all have 30 seconds
dialog: to disperse and return to your homes.
text: The LINE OF COPS takes a small step toward the black folks.
speaker_heading: SCHRECK
dialog: Failure to do so will result in your
dialog: immediate arrest...
text: The churchgoers flail a bit. Suddenly, with HUEY in the
text: background, SLOCUM steps up and with a look of defiant piety,
text: begins SINGING "We Shall Not Be Moved."
text: With gathering force the CONGREGATION joins in the song.
text: Schreck ROLLS HIS EYES and makes a MOTION with his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT
text: COPS wade into the crowd, herding them away. A patrolman
text: pushes a MIDDLE AGED MAN, with his NIGHTSTICK.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Go on get your black hide outta
dialog: here...
text: The MAN STUMBLES. By reflex, the cop RAISES his nightstick.
text: TYRONE -- on instinct -- PUSHES the cop away.
text: CHAOS erupts. BILLY CLUBS snap up. Terrified, the congregation
speaker_heading: RUNS.
speaker_heading: BULLEORN
dialog: You are resisting arrest!...
text: Police slap and snatch Black folks right and left. Judge
text: bounces around in the confusion. Bobby Seale can be seen
text: trying to get badge numbers.
text: Judge's eyes widen as he sees RITA running toward an alley,
text: a COP right on her ass.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Oh shit Mom...
text: Judge runs toward her.
text: The cop lifts his BILLY CLUB over Rita... Boom!! Carter
text: PUNCHES the cop straight off his feet.
text: A PAIR OF COPS have thrown Tyrone down on the ground --
text: PISTOLS pressed against his head.
text: Judge moves to Tyrone's aid. A RIFLE BUTT flashes out,
text: cracking across Judge's temple, sending him into DARKNESS.
scene_heading: INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT
text: Judge slowly comes to on the filthy floor. Cy, a few nasty
text: bruises on his face, kneels next to him protectively.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (amazed, in pain)
dialog: Jesus...
text: Disoriented, Judge sees TYRONE and the other PANTHERS. They're
text: a rag tag little group, battered, locked down. SLOCUM'S there
dialog: too.
text: Coming fully awake, Judge realizes SOMEONE is speaking. It's
text: HUEY, his voice powerful and arresting in its urgency.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: (over)
text: The power structure locks the black
dialog: man up. That's right. We move from
text: chains to bars and locks. Kangaroo
dialog: courts put brothers in jail. No jury
dialog: of our peers. No jury of black folks.
dialog: How do we stop this insanity? It's
dialog: simple. Organization. That's the
dialog: key. We must organize. We must
dialog: maintain discipline
dialog: 
text: Judge peers through the bodies and sees HUEY.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: That's right brother... listen and
dialog: learn.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: The white power structure wants us
dialog: to act like savages.
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: But we're a different kind of animal
dialog: altogether. We're Panthers. And The
dialog: Black Panther Party for Self Defense
dialog: is very painfully aware that America
dialog: has historically reserved its most
dialog: barbaric treatment for non-white
dialog: people since the beginning of the
dialog: country. So we need to organize, we
dialog: (a charismatic smile)
dialog: keep our shit correct! And effect
dialog: revolution. We revolve the power
dialog: into the hands of the people. Where
dialog: it belongs.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Power to the people baby...
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Power? Shit, old folks can't even
dialog: sing without getting their asses
dialog: kicked.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Well, then like the man said... Maybe
dialog: it's time we stop singing and start
dialog: swinging.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, but they got the guns.
text: Something -- some inexplicable mixture of mirth, raw
text: intelligence and fierce willpower -- crosses Huey's face.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: We can change that. We got the right
dialog: to bear arms, so I'd say it's time
dialog: to exercise that right. Like Comrade
dialog: Mao says, "Justice through power,
dialog: Power through guns."
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY
text: Blinking in the sunlight, the Panthers descend wearing a
text: collective grin of relief.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Chickenshits, just harassing our
dialog: ass, we weren't breaking any law.
scene_heading: REV. SLOCUM
dialog: But at least we're free! God has
dialog: delivered us from the lion's den.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Free? We're back where we started.
dialog: Shit we still don't have a stop light.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Well as the Rev says, God helps those
dialog: who help themselves.

dialog: We'll be our own stoplight.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY
text: Huey marches into the middle of the street. Amid swerving

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Judge and Cy split off as the other Panthers march into the

dialog: cy
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Check it out... Great huh? I tell

dialog: Man I'm with that...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I don't know. Look around man.
dialog: cy
dialog: C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting
dialog: on my feet. Working on things from
text: inside the system.
dialog: cy
dialog: Inside ain't in the system.
dialog: (poking Judge)
dialog: It's right there inside you!! I'm
dialog: joining up.
text: Judge's face cracks into a wry SMILE. Suddenly his smile
text: fades when he spots RITA staring at him from her stoop.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I... I gotta go...
text: Judge crosses the street, heading over to his mother.
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: Concern searing her face, Rita regards her son warily.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (touching his head)
dialog: Yeah... cop hit me...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I saw. I saw that big one
dialog: (pointing to Carter)
dialog: hit that police man. Saw 'em drag

dialog: (a beat)
dialog: They take you to jail?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Lord, never thought I'd live to see
dialog: my boy in prison.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Mom! It wasn't like that. It was
dialog: bullsh... They were just harassing
dialog: us. No charges were filed. It's
dialog: alright.
text: Worry in her voice, Rita stares across at the Panthers.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You meet those friends of yours in
dialog: jail too?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Yes... No... Mom it's not like you
dialog: think. They're alright. There out
text: there trying to do something.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I hear them boys, those Black
dialog: Panthers, they're communists. They
dialog: don't even believe in God.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Mom, black folks been praying to God
dialog: for four hundred years. Maybe it's
dialog: time we tried something else...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I don't know. I really don't.
text: A moment passes, Rita notes her son's confusion.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'll tell you one thing Judge...
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY
text: Following Huey's lead, the Panthers move traffic through the

text: slippery glasses. He's FBI down to the shine on his shoes.
speaker_heading: DORSETT
dialog: Don't I know it. Come on in Agent
dialog: Rodgers. Sit down. Always a...
dialog: pleasure to see you. How can I be of
dialog: help?
speaker_heading: RODGERS
dialog: It's a bit more like how can we help
dialog: you. Bay Area's become quite a
text: hornet's nest in terms of subversive
dialog: activities. And... well Mr. Hoover
dialog: wants to reiterate that the FBI will
dialog: be happy to assist local authorities
dialog: in any way we can. On a strictly
dialog: advisory basis... of course.
speaker_heading: DORSETT
dialog: Of course. Well, I appreciate your
dialog: offer, but we got things pretty well
dialog: under control. Same bunch of kooks
dialog: you guys already have under
dialog: surveillance. They're still doing a
text: lot of yelling and pot-smoking but
dialog: nothing to worry about.
speaker_heading: RODGERS
dialog: (cocking an eyebrow)
dialog: I see. What about the Black Panther
dialog: Party for Self-Defense?
speaker_heading: DORSETT
text: Heh, bunch of shines running around
text: in dark caps waving their fists about
text: some streetlight. They're loud, but
dialog: they aren't dangerous,
speaker_heading: RODGERS
dialog: Can you make a deal with them?
speaker_heading: DORSETT
dialog: Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists.
dialog: They actually think they're for real.
speaker_heading: RODGERS
dialog: Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and
dialog: Mr. Hoover -- is particularly
dialog: "sensitive" to anything that might
dialog: agitate or solidify the coloreds on
dialog: the left.
text: Dorsett pauses for a second, trying to read the angle.
speaker_heading: DORSETT
dialog: You want me to put a man on it?
speaker_heading: RODGERS
dialog: That would be an excellent start.

speaker_heading: BRIMMER

speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: El Rage what's with all the Zulu
dialog: shit?
speaker_heading: ELRIDGE
dialog: We can no longer let the white media

speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: That's what our newspaper will do.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: But lots of our people don't read,

speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: Yeah... then shouldn't this be all
dialog: of us together.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: (propping up a shield)
dialog: Trust me Huey, this picture will be
dialog: worth a thousand words. Now have you
dialog: given any thought to that Peace and
dialog: Freedom Party thing. They really
dialog: want to hook up with us. Do a rally
dialog: together. Hell it'd broaden our base
dialog: of visibility.
speaker_heading: HUEY
text: Yeah, but aligning with white
dialog: organizations. I'm not sure now's
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: The time, my friend, is what Sartre
dialog: called, "the moment the match is
dialog: being put to the fuse." Question is,
dialog: is the hand holding that match gonna
dialog: be black or white.
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: ...no full fledge alliance. But I

dialog: Show that there's some common ground

speaker_heading: APPLAUSE.
speaker_heading: HUEY

text: dying there. Yellow men are dying
dialog: there. We're told they're dying in
dialog: the name of freedom.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Freedom. Well, now if their blood's

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION - DAY
speaker_heading: HUEY
dialog: So, when you think about it. The
dialog: question we have to ask is... Why
dialog: should the Black man go fight the

dialog: that simple. The answer's simple
dialog: too.

speaker_heading: RODGERS

speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: We say that Huey P. Newton is a
dialog: prisoner of war. Many people say
dialog: that that's not true. Or that the
dialog: Party is exaggerating. I think it's
dialog: clear, it's crystal clear that the

text: The Crowd ROARS in approval, raising Black FISTS.

dialog: Now of course, she never came out

dialog: Final Solution.
speaker_heading: TRAFFICANTE
dialog: Well put. As you and Agent Rodgers
dialog: know, my organization has moved into

text: Another BARRAGE of bullets rips through the walls. One GRAZES

text: over it at Tyrone. Their eyes LOCK.
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: Go...
text: Click! Clack! Faster than a thought, Alma checks, clears and

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (over)
dialog: The community got the streetlight...
dialog: finally. But the way I see it...
