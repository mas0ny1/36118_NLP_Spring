scene_heading: INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: COLE is twelve years old and losing his mind.
text: He stands with his back against the wall, hands raised.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don’t need it! I’m telling you.
text: The SCHOOL NURSE is not convinced. And also not happy.
speaker_heading: SCHOOL NURSE
dialog: Cole. Just because you don’t feel
dialog: sick right now doesn’t mean you
dialog: don’t need the shot.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I never get sick. So you can take
dialog: that-
text: He points to the DISPOSABLE SYRINGE she’s holding.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: And give it to Barry. His nose is
dialog: always running-
speaker_heading: SCHOOL NURSE
dialog: There’s nothing to be scared of.
text: Cole freezes.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I am not scared.
scene_heading: INT. BOY’S STALL - TWO MINUTES LATER
text: Cole tries his best not to cry while he inspects the little
text: band-aid on his arm.
dialog: His best is not good enough.
text: He’s in that perfectly awkward stage between being a cute kid
text: and a handsome teen.
text: SOME ASSHOLE bangs on his stall door-
dialog: Cole jumps hard-
speaker_heading: SOME ASSHOLE (0.S.)
scene_heading: PUSSSSAYYYY.
text: And the asshole walks out of the bathroom laughing.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY
text: Cole is waiting for the school bus beside MELANIE, another
text: twelve year old. Also his neighbor.
dialog: Also definitely not a potential love interest for Cole so
dialog: whoever told you that is an idiot and a liar and loser and a-
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Did you know that only one baby was
dialog: born on the Mayflower? How crazy is
dialog: that shit. His name was, literally,
dialog: Oceanus. He didn’t even have a
dialog: nationality. He was a citizen of
dialog: the sea, I guess.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What class did you learn that in?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: No one learns anything in class,
dialog: Cole. That’s why we have the
dialog: internet.
text: A new SUV pulls up and Melanie waves to her ANNOYING DAD.
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We just got it. It’s pretty sweet.
dialog: Has DVDs in the back, and like, a
dialog: million horse power.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Cool.
text: She climbs into the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Dad, can we give Cole a ride too?
scene_heading: MELANIE’S ANNOYING DAD
dialog: Cole, are your parents expecting
dialog: you to take the bus?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: I guess so.
text: Melanie’s Annoying Dad shrugs back annoyingly.
scene_heading: MELANIE’S ANNOYING DAD
dialog: Then you gotta take the bus, sport!
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I didn’t even ask to-
text: They start pulling away. Melanie waves bye and-
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: Cole walks home alone from the bus stop.
text: He turns around when the familiar sound of bicycles emerge
text: from behind him. THREE KIDS on bikes.
dialog: He hates these jerks, but what are you gonna do.
text: JEREMY is the leader. He’s fourteen. So he’s cool as shit.
dialog: Don’t even worry about his friend’s names. They’re not
dialog: important, because they’re not Jeremy.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Colenoscopy! How’s it hanging?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I dunno. Okay.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Speaking of hanging, have your
dialog: balls dropped yet?
text: No-name Kids cackle. Cole mumbles something.
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry man, I didn’t catch that.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I said why are you so interested in
dialog: my balls.
text: One of the other bikers slaps Cole upside the head. He was
dialog: expecting that.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Dude, the last thing I care about
dialog: is balls. On Saturday, I hooked up
dialog: with Shelly MacEntyre.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: ...The sophomore?
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: The sophomore. But in many ways,
dialog: she was a senior.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don’t believe you.
text: Cole gets smacked upside the head by a different biker.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: It doesn’t matter if you believe
dialog: me. It’s not like your belief in me
dialog: will validate what happened to my
dialog: dick. Ya wanna know how it was?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (kinda)
dialog: No, not really.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I won’t lie. As a fourteen year
dialog: old, in that kind of situation with
text: a sixteen year old that looks like
dialog: Shelly MacEntyre, it was
dialog: overwhelming. I mean, she’s a
dialog: woman. Fully. Developed. I really
dialog: had to focus so as not to
dialog: disappoint, ya know what I’m
dialog: saying.
text: The other bikers apparently know what he’s saying. Cole’s not
text: quite sure, so he doesn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I said do you know what I’m saying.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I guess.
text: Jeremy blocks Cole’s path with his bike.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I guess isn’t good enough. I feel
dialog: like you're doubting me and I find
dialog: that insulting.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: But you just said it didn’t matter
dialog: if I believed you-
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I changed my mind, bitch.
text: Cole stares at his shoes sheepishly.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Jeremy, I’m not trying to insul-
text: Jeremy suddenly pushes Cole in the chest.
text: He falls on his ass, his palms catching the road. He winces
dialog: as-—
text: Jeremy and his friends laugh until-
text: A BLUE JEEP stops near them.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE
dialog: Hey!
text: From the ground, Cole stares up as-
text: THE GIRL blocks out the sun for a moment as she squares off
text: with Jeremy, staring down at his pimply little face.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Did you just touch Cole?
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: (acting tough)
dialog: (scared though)
dialog: So what if I did.
text: She turns him around real fast, reading his sewn in name tag
text: on his back pack. She’s maybe a full foot taller than Jeremy.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Jeremy. Check it out.
text: The Girl raises up her keys and starts flicking through them.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: You so much as think about Cole
dialog: again, I will-
text: She leans in and whispers for a very long time to Jeremy. His
dialog: expression goes from cocky-
dialog: To nervous-—
dialog: To terrified.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL (CONT’D)
dialog: (out loud)
dialog: And then I’m going to burn your
dialog: house down. Cool?
text: With a pointy key, she stabs his bike tire, popping it.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL (CONT’D)
dialog: Now get out of here before I run
dialog: you over, you little pap smear.
dialog: 6.
text: Jeremy obeys, trying to ride his flat-tired bike, the no-name
text: kids close behind.
text: In the middle of the street, The Girl sits beside Cole.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, Coley.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hey, Bee.
dialog: Now is a good time for you to know that as far as Cole is
dialog: concerned, God made women and then God made BEE.
text: She is a knock out senior who actually listens to him when he
dialog: talks.
dialog: She is better than STAR WARS.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You skin your palms?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It doesn’t hurt.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yes it does. C’mere.
text: She grabs his hand and tenderly picks out some of the gravel.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: They bother you a lot?
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ya gotta just punch ‘em in the
dialog: dick. Don’t hit them in the face,
dialog: cuz then if you leave a mark their
dialog: parents are gonna call your parents
dialog: and it’s just the worst. And if
dialog: they’re chasing you, wait until
dialog: they’ve almost got you. Then drop
text: like a bag of rocks. And then when
dialog: they trip over you and are on the
dialog: ground... kick ‘em in the dick.
text: She finishes his hand. Smiles at him.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Can I help you burn down his house?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Like I would ever do that without
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. BEE’S JEEP - DAY
text: Bee is laughing. The windows are down. The radio is up.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: The sophomore?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That’s what he said.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Screw that guy. The closest he’s
dialog: come to getting laid is HBO. The
text: closest she’s come is a tampon.
dialog: Also, she’s totally gay. And I
dialog: don’t mean that disparagingly. I
dialog: mean she dates chicks. So don’t
dialog: worry about it.
text: Cole smiles to himself, no longer worrying about it.
dialog: says is God’s gospel, after all.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: How the folks?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Better I think.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Hotel therapy is working! That’s
dialog: great for all of us. They stay
dialog: happy, we get to hang out, I get
dialog: paid.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’m like your little prostitute.
text: Bee bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Like, I have to pay you to hang out
dialog: with me.
text: Bee laughs harder.
dialog: What Bee
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: No, that would make me a
dialog: prostitute. And your parents the
dialog: client. That’s a terrible analogy.
dialog: That’s maybe the worst one ever.
text: Cole is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Oh. I’m sorry.
text: Bee notices and smiles.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Besides, I'd hang out with you
dialog: either way.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: One hundred percent. I got maybe
dialog: two years tops before you’re too
dialog: cool to hang out with me.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That’s not true. You’ll be in
dialog: college by then.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Whatever. You’1l still be too cool.
text: Cole smiles and looks out the window.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’1l never be too cool.
scene_heading: EXT. COLE’S HOME - DAY
text: Bee’s blue jeep pulls up outside Cole’s home.
text: bedroom place in a neighborhood full of them.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Tomorrow night. You. Me. Party.
dialog: Cults will be formed over nights
dialog: like the night we will have.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Sounds good.
dialog: It’s a cute two
text: They reach their pointer fingers out to each other, E.T.
text: Poster style. They make electric buzzing noises when they
dialog: touch.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: See ya, Cee.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ba-bye, Bee.
text: She drives off and Cole heads into his house-
text: As Melanie and her Annoying Dad pull up to the house next
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: No one seems to be home. Cole walks through the living room,
text: passing the stairs that lead to the second floor.
text: He goes into the kitchen, where a note is taped to a fridge
dialog: that says:
text: IN THE CRAWL SPACE.
speaker_heading: AGGGGHHH.
text: Cole scrunches up his face.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY
text: Cole chews a fruit roll-up as he makes his way through their
dialog: cluttered garage that dad always promises to clean and never
dialog: does.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOME’S CRAWL SPACE - DAY
text: Cole’s MOM is under the crawl space beneath their house. The
text: small gate unscrewed and put off to the side.
text: Cole hands her mouse traps, which he hears her setting.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Do you like it under there?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: No, Cole, I don’t like it under
dialog: here. It’s pretty much the worst.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Thennnnnnn why are you under there?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well, sometimes being a grown up
dialog: means doing things that suck.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Thennnnn why isn’t Dad under there?
text: A different kind of laugh from Mom.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He says he doesn’t fit under here.
text: Cole surveys the opening. It definitely looks like he could
dialog: fit under there.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Buuuuut it’s really because he’s
dialog: scared. That, or, he really doesn’t
dialog: care if we get rats. Which I guess
dialog: is possib-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Do you think I’m a pussy, Mom?
text: Mom has no reaction for a moment.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Do you know what that word means,
dialog: Cole?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Like, afraid of everything.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Um. I think you're at a time in
dialog: your life where a lot of things are
dialog: scary. And as you get older, those
dialog: things will stop frightening you as
dialog: much.
text: She pulls herself out of the crawl space. Her face is a
text: little dirty. There are webs in her hair.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Like a crappy haunted house
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Like the warm up creeps they have
dialog: outside before you actually get in?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Pretty much.
dialog: 11.
text: She picks up a power drill from him and starts drilling the
text: gate back over the space.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Get me a drink, buddy?
text: He nods and starts to walk away. But stops.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mom. I know a pussy is also a
dialog: vagina. I’m not retarded.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Cole! Don’t say retarded!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: But I can say pussy or vagina?
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Lemonade!
text: He smiles and moseys into the home.
scene_heading: INT. DAD'S CAR - NIGHT
text: They are in a mall parking lot. It’s after hours, so
text: completely empty.
text: Cole is in the driver’s seat. DAD in the passenger.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: How them windows looking?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Looking good.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Roger that. Radio distracting?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It’s not on.
speaker_heading: DAD
text: Then it’s distracting.
text: He turns it on. Looks for the perfect sound track for his
dialog: son's driving lesson.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Parking brake?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hands?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ten and two.
text: Dad holds up a Picard hand.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Engage.
dialog: 12.
text: And Cole begins to drive around the empty lot. He loves it,
dialog: going all of twenty miles an hour.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are you and mom going to get a
dialog: divorce?
text: Dad stops trying to find the perfect song and looks at Cole.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You waited until you started to
dialog: drive to ask that question?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: If I don’t like the answer I’11
dialog: just drive us into the
dialog: Bloomingdales.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: At least drive us into JC Penney.
dialog: It’s so much cheaper.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You don’t get a say. I’m behind the
dialog: wheel. I have the power.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I've created a monster. Multiple
dialog: times over. And no, we’re not
dialog: getting a divorce.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Then why do you keep going away
dialog: together for the weekends?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Marriage takes a lot of work. And
dialog: sometimes routine can be... I don’t
dialog: know. Your mom likes hotels.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what it is? Marriage is a
dialog: fire and you gotta, ya know, keep
dialog: it going. And sometimes the weather
dialog: changes and you're like, aw crap,
dialog: it’s raining! And you just gotta
dialog: work harder so the fire doesn’t go
dialog: out. Make sense?
text: Cole shrugs. The answer is no.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What do you even do there?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: At the hotels? Oh. Huh. We go out
dialog: to eat. Sometimes they have spas.
dialog: Your mom likes musicals, so I pay
dialog: my dues.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Besides, you get to hang out with
dialog: Bee. I can’t wait until you're
dialog: thirty and we can talk about how
dialog: lucky you are.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Do kids make fun of you for still
dialog: having a baby sitter?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I’m sorry. You know, we don’t have
dialog: to call her that-
speaker_heading: COLE
text: But then they see her and they get
dialog: really jealous.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hell yeah they do!
text: Dad raises a hand for a high five. Cole lets go of the wheel
dialog: to hit it.
text: The car swerves. Dad grabs the wheel in a panic.
text: They laugh. It’s a good night.
scene_heading: INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Cole walks into his parent’s room to find them watching TV.
text: Mom is working on bills. Dad is watching.
dialog: 14.
dialog: They’re not really connected.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What’re you watching?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Mad Men. You wouldn't like it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It’s on HBO?
text: Mom tries not to laugh.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Nah, it’s not dirty. It’s just
dialog: dense. It would go over your head.
dialog: We'll rewatch it together in a few
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Oh. Alright.
text: Cole stands there awkwardly.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Need anything buddy?
text: Cole shrugs and moseys on back to his room.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER
dialog: Cole's bedroom is your typical twelve year old’s bedroom.
dialog: Movie posters. Monsters toys. YA books.
text: His window overlooks the woods and Melanie’s house next door.
text: He sits on his bed with a hand-me-down laptop. He watches a
dialog: stream of Mad Men.
dialog: He pays more attention than any twelve year old has ever paid
dialog: to Mad Men. He will unlock the secrets of-
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Cole wakes up. Laptop slumped beside him on the bed, out of
text: battery. He tries grinding the sleep from his eyes.
dialog: He’s learned nothing.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING
text: Cole sits beside Melanie on the way to school.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: So I think they go to have sex but
dialog: it just makes me feel like they go
dialog: to get away from me.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: They are definitely having sex. But
dialog: they probably have sex when you’re
dialog: at home too.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: They don’t. They just watch TV.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Hotels have TVs.
dialog: Cole had never thought of this.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I never thought of that.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Besides, I bet Bee has boys over at
dialog: your place all the time. Doing it.
dialog: This makes Cole much more uncomfortable than the previous
dialog: topic.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No way. Not a chance.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Dude, that’s what babysitters do!
dialog: They put the kids down, sneak their
dialog: boyfriends in. Doing it. I mean
dialog: seriously, have you ever been awake
text: after she’s fallen asleep.
text: Cole thinks about this. The answer is NOPE.
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear that Jeremy told
dialog: everyone that she threatened to cut
text: his mom’s throat and force feed him
dialog: her spleen?
text: Cole is blank for a moment.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That’s the best thing I’ve ever
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: I know, right!
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
dialog: 16.
text: Cole eats a sandwich by the school gate. Across the street is
dialog: the high school.
text: He glances up and sees Bee with a group of fellow students.
text: Even from across the street, Cole can see that her head is
text: suspiciously resting on a NERDY GUY’S SHOULDER.
text: Cole tries to mask how much this upsets him.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’
speaker_heading: DAD (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my Goddddd.
speaker_heading: S HOME - DAY
text: Dad anxiously waits by the door as Mom parks
text: inside. Cole watches TV behind him.
dialog: Mom walks
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We said we were gonna leave at
dialog: five, didn’t we?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Please don’t involve me.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It’s almost five thirty. This is
dialog: the problem!
text: in. Sees Dad's WIF face.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Uh oh.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Five thirty!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We were supposed to leave at five!
dialog: and heads
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Five!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: If we were leaving at five, where’s
dialog: Bee.
text: Bee is nowhere. Dad notices this. Sighs.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Well this trip’s off to a great
dialog: start.
text: The door bell rings.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S HOME - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER.
dialog: 17.
text: Cole hurries to the door. Before he opens it, smooths out his
dialog: hair and-
text: Opens the door to reveal BEE.
speaker_heading: BEE
scene_heading: WHAT UP, DAWG.
speaker_heading: COLE
scene_heading: WHAT UP, GEE.
text: They do their E.T. Finger move and Bee comes in.
text: Mom and Dad bustle out, ready to leave.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hiya, Bee.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Johnson. Mr. Johnson.
dialog: Where you guys heading tonight?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It’s a surprise!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: The Hyatt.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh. Well, there will be more
dialog: surprises!
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Probably not. You guys be good!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Oh, we will.
text: Mom kisses Cole’s head goodbye. He hates it.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Bye, buddy.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Bye, Mom.
text: Dad holds out his hand for a manly handshake. Cole hates it.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Remember son, you’re the man of the
dialog: house. Protect her from all
dialog: enemies.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Okay, Dad.
text: Mom and Dad walk out to the car. They get in. Bee and Cole
text: wait by the door.
text: Mom and Dad drive off. Beeping a few times. Cole and Bee look
text: at each other.
text: IT’S ON, BITCHES.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
scene_heading: DOUGH. PIZZA SAUCE. PEPPERS. ALL THE MEATS. ALL THE CHEESES.
text: COOKING.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: So you're basically saying,
dialog: intergalactic dream team.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah, so like, there’s an epic
dialog: villain, right? And using time
dialog: travel-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: From Terminator or Star Trek?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Terminator’s not intergalactic. Not
dialog: yet, anyway.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: But it’s science fiction so you can
dialog: make your own rules up.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: That makes sense.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: So using time travel, you have to
dialog: fill a starship full of the best
dialog: people or aliens or robots to take
dialog: down the villain.
text: Bee contemplates.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: How many seats do I have?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Five.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Five!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Fine, six, if you need like, a duo.
dialog: And you can’t have like, Predator
dialog: and the Xenomorph together, because
dialog: they'd fight and the mission would
dialog: be futile.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: No, I get it. Hmm.
text: She counts out her squad.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: One, Kirk. Two, Picard. Three, Will
dialog: Smith and Jeff Goldblum from
text: Independence Day. Five, Ripley and
dialog: six, are you ready for this shit? A
dialog: xenomorph egg, so here’s the plan.
text: Kirk and Picard team up to captain-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Why do you need both?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Because a girl’s got needs. They
dialog: team up to get us to the big bad,
dialog: because you know he’d have like,
dialog: obstacles.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: BEE
text: Then when they get close, they send
text: Goldblum and Will to get inside the
dialog: lair. They have experience with
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Fair.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Now this whole time Ripley’s been
dialog: bitching about the Xenomorph egg
dialog: and shit, cuz that’s her move. But
dialog: she knows she’s gotta do this
dialog: because it’s the only way to save
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The universe!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yes! So Will and Goldblum get her
text: inside. Ripley personally drops off
text: the egg, the facehugger attacks the
text: big bad. Ripley makes it back to
dialog: Goldblum and Will, the big bad
text: attacks, they narrrrrrowly escape,
dialog: Kirk and Picard supply cover as the
text: scout craft returns home, they
dialog: peace out of there, then the big
dialog: bad starts feeling like shit and-
text: She shoves her hand through the inside of her shirt, chest-
dialog: burster style.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s out!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Who said he was a he?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Shut up. A woman just saved the
dialog: galaxy.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are facehuggers female?
text: Bee contemplates this too.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I don’t think so, right, cuz they
dialog: got dicks?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: So you're saying it took a dick to
dialog: save the galaxy.
text: Bee stares at him.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I wanna do over.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No do overs!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Aliens don’t abide by our primitive
dialog: gender stereotypes!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What’s done is done.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You suck. You suck and I hope you
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You couldn’t live without me.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: It would definitely effect my
dialog: income. So you’re probably right.
text: The oven dings.
speaker_heading: PIZZA TIME.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bee and Cole are watching an R-rated movie that he’s probably
text: not allowed to watch. Cole sits close to Bee, pretending he’s
text: not as scared as he is.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Do you think my parents are gonna
dialog: get a divorce.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I don’t know man. I hope not.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Melanie’s parents got divorced. Now
text: her mom lives with her boyfriend.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Gross. That’s the cute chick next
dialog: door right?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mrs. Dryer is not cute. She’s
dialog: gross. Her boyfriend's like, twenty-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Not her! Melanie.
text: A brief pause.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I wouldn't say she’s cute.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I would. I would say she is
dialog: extremely super duper cute.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I know what you’re trying to do,
dialog: and it’s not gonna work.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Whatever. You want your tongues to
dialog: touch.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No I don’t.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yes you do.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Nope. No way.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You’re in denial.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You’re in... asshole.
text: Bee laughs.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: That was great.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: But you’ll be okay if they break
dialog: up. It happens. This is America.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit stinks. You can’t trust anyone
dialog: you love to be there for you for
dialog: the rest of your lives. Unless you
dialog: die really young. In which case you
dialog: got a better shot.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Do you ever think about how like,
dialog: when I’m fifty, technology will
dialog: probably have advanced and I could
dialog: like, download my brain into a
dialog: super robot and live forever?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I think about you at fifty becoming
dialog: a super immortal robot literally
dialog: all of the time.
text: Bee sees the time.
dialog: She looks
dialog: Bee tries
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Shit, dude, it’s late.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’m not tired.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I know you’re not, but I am.
text: at him.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: If I give you a shot, will you go
dialog: to sleep.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: A shot of what.
dialog: to determine what he might want to drink.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Vvvvvvooooooginnnnnnrrummmabbbbbbss
dialog: siiiiiinntthbbbbaaaileys! Baileys!
text: Cole can’t help but agree.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You my man. I’1l be right back. You
dialog: wanna clean up?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Thanks, babe.
text: She skips away to the kitchen, leaving Cole. He smiles and
text: walks over to close the blinds when-
text: He looks outside the window and sees-—
text: Across the street-
text: A CAR PARKED.
text: But full of people. He can’t make out much more than that.
text: He eyes them for a moment, the wheels in his head turning-
text: When Bee returns with a shot glass, yawning.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Here you are, my good sir.
text: He takes it. She holds on.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: And remember, you don’t say a word
dialog: of this to your parents. Ever. Even
dialog: when you're a fifty year old super
dialog: immortal robot.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: My dad lets me drink Mike’s all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I’m sure he does.
text: She smiles and skips back to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: One sec!
text: Cole has this one moment.
text: He stares at the Baileys...
text: And suddenly DUMPS IT in a nearby plant.
text: Bee returns with a shot glass. Bummed.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You drank it without me!
text: Cole shrugs. Trying to be cool.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MELANIE (V.O.)
dialog: She's totally getting LAID.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Cole is facetiming with Melanie.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’m gonna find out.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You're such a little perv, watching
dialog: people do it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I am not a perv. I just wanna know
dialog: what happens after I go to sleep.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Way to throw away the whiskey. They
dialog: give that stuff to babies to knock
dialog: them out.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I never said it was whiskey.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Then what was it?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: ...Stronger shit.
text: He hears Bee coming up the steps.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I gotta go.
text: He closes the laptop unceremoniously as Bee knocks.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Speak friend and enter!
speaker_heading: BEE (0.S.)
dialog: (Ian McKellan voice)
speaker_heading: MELONNN.
text: She pushes the door open and enters, checking out the room as
dialog: if it were the Mines of Moria.
dialog: 26.
text: Cole laughs and Bee smiles. Sits on his desk. She’s wearing
text: short shorts, and Cole’s eyes flicker to her legs.
text: This is not lost on her.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Feeling bout ready for bed?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah I’m-
dialog: (big yawn)
dialog: Really tired.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: It’s the Baileys, man. Like a
dialog: gentler ambien.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What’s an ambien.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Adult candy. You need anything?
text: Cole shakes his head and wraps himself up in blankets.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Cool. Night, dude.
speaker_heading: CO1E
dialog: Bee?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yup?
text: Cole, slightly worried the love of his life will soon know
text: the touch of a different, obviously lesser man, chooses his
text: words with care.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Thanks for... knowing me and...
dialog: treating me like I was okay.
text: She leans against the door frame.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You don’t think you’re okay?
text: Cole shrugs.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I feel weird most of the time.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Well, I like weird all of the time.
dialog: And I’m hot, so if I like it,
dialog: imagine how all the girls will like
dialog: you when you’re a senior.
text: Cole can’t help but blush.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: See you in the morning.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Good night.
text: She winks at him and turns off the light.
text: When Cole hears her walk downstairs, he sits up.
speaker_heading: IT’S ON.
text: FIVE MINUTES GO BY.
text: Cole is playing a game on his cellphone in the dark. Music
text: off. He hears Bee moving stuff around downstairs and listens.
text: FIFTEEN MINUTES GO BY.
text: And he hears the soft steps of someone coming up the stairs.
text: He pockets his phone under the covers and pretends to be
dialog: asleep as-—
text: Bee checks on him. She says nothing.
text: She walks into the room and looks closer at him. He seems to
text: be conked out.
text: Satisfied, she leaves.
text: Cole opens his eyes. That was definitely a little weird.
text: TWENTY MINUTES GO BY.
text: And Cole listens as Bee greets HER FRIENDS at the door.
dialog: Most confusing of all though is the fact that they’re not
text: whispering. They’re talking in their normal voices.
text: Clearly not afraid they could wake Cole up.
text: He texts Melanie.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They're here! There's a bunch of
dialog: people!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: omfg orgieeeee
text: Cole’s not sure what that word means. He tosses the phone on
text: the bed and creeps closer to the door to eavesdrop.
text: The voices are still muffled. There are definitely boys.
text: Cole creeps his door open just a touch. He can hear a little
dialog: better.
text: Oddly, it sounds like everyone is walking on plastic.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: So the Spocker is the live long and
dialog: prosper hands, doing the good work.
text: Everyone downstairs laughs.
speaker_heading: NERD (0.S.)
dialog: And they like that?
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: The nasty one's do. Bee knows what
dialog: I'm talking about.
text: Cole hears a peck on the cheek. His eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: BEE (0.S.)
dialog: Don't pay attention to Max. And
dialog: don't ever, ever do that to me.
text: Everyone laughs.
speaker_heading: NERD (0.S.)
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: It was... I was never thinking of
dialog: doing that to you.
speaker_heading: BEE (0.S.)
dialog: Or anyone.
speaker_heading: NERD (0.S.)
dialog: Or anyone!
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER (0.S.)
dialog: I'm boorrrrred let's draaaank!
text: The group cheer and proceed to probably go do shots.
dialog: 29.
text: Cole closes the door and rushes back to his phone. He texts.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They're talking about Star Trek!
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: That's really disappointing!
dialog: You should go down there!
dialog: Film them!
text: Cole scrunches up his face.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Perv.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Lol.
text: Cole puts the phone in his pocket and goes back to the door.
text: He opens it a crack-
text: They are back in the living room.
text: So he sneaks out the door.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Cole gets down to his hands and knees and peers over the
dialog: second floor balcony-
text: Where he sees THEM sitting in a circle in the living room.
text: There are SIX of them, including BEE.
text: MAX. The Man. Dreadlocks. Football. Fast Five.
scene_heading: ALLISON. Pixie. School paper. Network.
text: JOHN THE BAPTIST. Preacher kid. White boy. Chariots of Fire.
text: SONYA. Peppy. Cheerleader. Beauty and the Beast (not the
dialog: Disney one, the French one, you know with oh nevermind).
dialog: And finally:
dialog: SAMUEL. The Nerd. Doesn’t fit in. Especially with these guys.
dialog: Which is weird, considering Cole's pretty sure this is the
text: guy Bee had her head resting on earlier. Upstream Color.
text: The entire living room floor is covered in PLASTIC WRAP.
text: The group sit around, passing a bottle of liquor and
dialog: and generally being teenagers.
text: A bottle sits in the middle of them. And naturally-
text: That bottle is spinning.
speaker_heading: It points at MAX (0000000000h) -
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Truth or dare.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Truth me.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Who would you want to sleep with
dialog: the most here.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sonya.
dialog: 30.
dialog: laughing
text: The group laugh and cheer. Except for the nerdy kid, who just
text: kinda sits there awkwardly.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: You didn’t even have to think for
dialog: that!
dialog: This is all the most fascinating thing that Cole has
dialog: seen.
text: The bottle gets spun again and-
text: Lands on BEE.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Truth or dare.
text: Bee stares straight at Samuel.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Dare.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Make out!
text: Bee smiles, leans forward but-
text: Poor Samuel stands up.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I’m, I’m sorry, this is kinda weird-
dialog: ever
text: Bee stands up too.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Stop being a pussy Sam.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I’m not! I just, it’s weird, with
dialog: all you guys staring-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Sam.
text: He looks at Bee, now standing in front of him.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Just close your eyes. Pretend
dialog: they’re not here.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Closing my eyes doesn’t mean
dialog: they’re not here.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Do you trust me?
dialog: 31.
text: After a moment, he nods. She wraps her arms around his neck.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Then don’t stress. Just relax. This
dialog: is fun. This is not weird. Okay?
text: He reluctantly agrees.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: C’mere.
text: She kisses him.
text: And Cole's heart breaks. He can’t look away. Try as he might-
dialog: But wait.
text: As they kiss, Max and John hand something to Bee.
text: She takes it behind Samuel’s head and Cole sees-
text: That she has TWO KNIVES IN HER HANDS.
text: Which she plunges into Samuel’s poor skull.
speaker_heading: WHAT
speaker_heading: THE
speaker_heading: FUCK
dialog: 33.
text: Cole slams back against the wall in terror.
text: He doesn’t know what to do. His hands shake. His mouth hangs
dialog: open. He doesn’t understand-
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shhh. Shhh. It’s alright.
text: Cole forces his shaking body to peer down again-
text: Samuel’s body is trembling. He keeps trying to breathe, but
text: can’t seem to exhale.
dialog: Only inhales.
text: He stares at Bee with understandably confused eyes.
text: His body goes slack, but Bee holds him up with the knives in
text: his head.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Shhh. Just let go.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Let it go-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Shut up, Sonya! Show some respect.
text: Bee looks back at the almost-dead Samuel.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You are helping fulfil a great
dialog: purpose. Know this.
text: Samuel stutters.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: ...I don’t wanna be a great
dialog: porpoise-
text: And with that said, his eyes fade out.
text: And he dies, being held up by the knives sticking out of his
text: head, held by the last girl he’1l ever kiss.
text: Cole's brain is exploding a million times a second.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Did he say porpoise?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: I think he did.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: That’s so shitty.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: He didn’t even get to understand.
dialog: She says this kind of sadly.
text: Sonya and John have two urns. They hold them up by the
dialog: knives.
text: Max wraps his arms around Samuel's chest.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Ready ready.
text: With a gross squelch, Bee pulls the knives from his head.
text: His leg twitches as she does as-
text: Blood slowly leaks out on Sonya’s side while-
text: A small geyser shoots John in the face.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
speaker_heading: Gasdfgasdfg
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Don’t laugh. John, relax.
text: John closes his eyes and mouth obediently, but still freaks
text: out internally.
text: Bee pushes his hands up, so the urn starts collecting the
text: blood instead of his face.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: There you go.
text: He exhales.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You look like Carrie.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: Allison, what are you even doing? I
dialog: forgot you were here.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I’m documenting it.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: My brain. I’m obviously not going
dialog: to write down a live account of how
dialog: we sacrificed Samuel.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: Well clever you, get me a paper
dialog: towel and wipe sacrificed Samuel
dialog: out of my darn eye.
text: Allison gets up to get the paper towels-—
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Don’t throw them out. Take them
text: home, burn and then bury them.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Bury them where?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I don’t care. It’s tradition, so
text: probably in the earth.
text: Allison stomps into the kitchen-
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Great, so I’m just gonna carry
text: bloody rags around.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No different than usual for you
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Oh snap.
text: The group laughs. Except Allison.
text: And except Cole, who is literally trembling.
dialog: And not part of their group.
speaker_heading: YET.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Bring me the case.
text: The group suddenly become VERY EXCITED.
dialog: Like, quiet excited.
text: Sonya hurries out of sight, and returns with a RED METAL
speaker_heading: SUITCASE.
text: She hands it carefully to Bee, who undoes a combination and
dialog: opens it-
text: A BROWN LEATHER JOURNAL sits protected inside.
text: Some of the group gasp.
text: Cole doesn’t get it.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh calm down.
text: But she barely means it as she gently picks the book up out
dialog: of the case.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Is that really it?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yeah, it’s really it.
text: John the Baptist peers over Bee’s shoulder as she opens it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: What language is that?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: The best language. Alrighty, babes.
dialog: Let’s get started. Take his blood
dialog: into the kitchen, and we'll get
dialog: 1il’man’s next.
speaker_heading: SHIT.
dialog: Time to go.
text: Cole looks up to his bedroom door.
text: Takes a few very deep breaths...
text: And starts to slowly crawl inside.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Cole very, very, very, very gently closes the door-
text: And dashes for his phone.
text: He ignores all the texts from Melanie and goes straight for-
speaker_heading: 911
text: He waits anxiously as it rings.
text: Through his window, we see a light come on at the house next
text: door, and see Melanie eagerly trying to get his attention-
text: Wanting the scoop on all the sex she presumes is happening-
text: Until she sees how utterly terrified he is. And becomes
dialog: utterly terrified herself.
speaker_heading: 911 (CONT'D)
dialog: 911, what is your emergency?
text: He speaks very softly.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hi, my name is Cole Johnson and
dialog: a.a.a. guy was just murdered in my
dialog: living room? He, uh, the address is
dialog: 2455 Bigby Drive. Can, can you
dialog: please send someone?
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: You're doing great, Cole. Can you
dialog: speak a little louder?
text: Cole shakes his head.
speaker_heading: 911 (CONT'D)
dialog: Cole, are you shaking your head?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Y.yes.
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: That's okay. We're sending some
dialog: help over right now. Can you answer
dialog: some more questions for me?
text: He nods.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: 911 (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I can guess you're nodding so
dialog: I'll continue. Was the victim a
dialog: family member?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No he was a high school student
dialog: boyfriend person.
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: And the attacker is still in the
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: COLE
text: Yes. They are downstairs and having
text: a blast.
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: How many are there, Cole?
text: Cole tries to remember.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Too many. Can you get my mom? She’s
text: at the Hyatt in the city.
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: Of course Cole. Now listen to me.
dialog: It's important that you stay hidden-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What if they come for me?
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: Then don't-
text: A DING goes off in Cole’s twelve year old head.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I gotta protect myself. Thanks.
speaker_heading: 911
dialog: Nonono-
text: He hangs up the phone and takes a deep breath.
text: Scans the room.
text: Quietly as he can, he begins searching the room for
dialog: something.
dialog: In drawers.
text: Under the bed.
dialog: 39.
dialog: Behind books.
dialog: Until-
dialog: He finds it-
text: THE POCKET KNIFE.
text: He opens it up quickly and tests it for sharpness on his
dialog: finger.
text: It barely breaks the skin.
text: His cellphone rings back silently. 911.
text: He answers it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I found a knife.
text: And hangs up again.
text: He quickly throws on a pair of jeans. Socks. Shoes.
text: Pockets the knife in his... pocket.
text: Then goes over to the window. He pushes it open as quietly as
dialog: he can.
text: Melanie opens her window as well.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: WHAT’S GOING ON?!
speaker_heading: COLE
speaker_heading: (FREAKING OUT)
dialog: SHHHHH! !!!
dialog: She gets it.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (silently, subtitled)
dialog: WHAT’S GOING ON?!
text: Cole doesn’t answer her. He looks out the window-
dialog: It’s a long way down.
speaker_heading: FUCK.
text: Cole looks up at Melanie.
text: She moves her arm up and down: LADDER?
dialog: 40.
text: He looks around his room...
dialog: And that’s when-
text: Cole hears a bunch of FEET ON THE STAIRS.
text: He looks at Melanie, waving her away from the window.
text: He throws the curtains closed and-
text: And dives on top of the bed.
text: He roles over so he is facing the wall-
text: Pulls the blanket over him so his jeans and shoes aren’t
dialog: visible as-
text: Bee, Max, Sonya and Allison enter the room.
text: Again, they don’t particularly talk quietly.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Ohmagod, this room is ADORABLE.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: He’s so cute. You have no idea.
text: Max flips through some of Cole’s books.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh man, Jules Verne! I read some of
dialog: this shit!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Won’t he hear us?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: With the amount of drugs I gave
dialog: him? Haillll no.
dialog: And this might be the most heartbreaking moment of the
dialog: evening so far for Cole.
text: He faces the wall, his big eyes darting around.
text: Bee sits on the bed. Cole does his best not to tense.
text: He closes his eyes lightly.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s been my biggest project. I’ve
dialog: been watching him for two years.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: 41.
dialog: Damn girl. That’s some sadistic
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: It’s not sadistic. It’s an honor.
text: She turns back to the others.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you have the needle?
text: COLE’S EYES GO WIDE THE FUCK OPEN.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Yup!
text: She hands Bee a small box. Bee opens it and pulls out the
dialog: container.
dialog: And from that container-
text: Pulls out the HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT’S A SYRINGE.
dialog: Cole is doing his very, very, very best to not have a full
text: blown panic attack.
dialog: And to keep pretending to be asleep.
text: He tries not to tense up-
dialog: But—
dialog: It’s-
dialog: Really-
dialog: Fucking-
dialog: Hard-
text: Bee pets his head with her free hand.
text: His eye closest to her is shut-
dialog: But the other is freaking the hell out-
dialog: It would leave his skull if it could.
dialog: And then BEE-
text: PLUNGES THE SYRINGE INTO HIS ARM-
text: Cole's teeth grit as hard as they can as
dialog: he stops breathing-
dialog: 42.
dialog: Trying his best not to give himself away as-
text: Bee takes a vial of his blood and then-
text: She twists it off-
text: Replacing it with a SECOND VIAL.
text: Which quickly fills up.
text: AND THEN A THIRD.
text: And A FOURTH.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Ya know, there’s a faster way to
dialog: get all that blood.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You know what happens when you kill
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: They die?
speaker_heading: BEE
text: They STOP MAKING MORE BLOOD. So
dialog: this is basically a faucet for us.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: What about Samuel?
dialog: Bee sighs, the way you sigh when someone’s being a fucking
dialog: idiot.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Sonya, you have a listening
dialog: problem.
text: Bee ties off the fourth and puts it carefully in the
dialog: container.
text: She then slowly leans down to his arm-
text: And kisses the pinprick wound.
text: She leaves her lips there for a long second.
text: Before whispering, as if he could hear her.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Good boy.
dialog: 43.
text: As she stands to leave the room, she sees the curtain
text: flapping lightly in the breeze.
text: She pauses, fixing her eyes on it.
dialog: Wondering... was that window open before?
dialog: And does it even matter?
text: She shrugs it off and heads for the door with the others.
text: And in bed, Cole waits.
text: He hears the door open.
text: And the door shut.
text: And the feet on the stairs.
text: And he waits until they are all downstairs.
text: And then slowly exhales.
text: He quietly crawls out of bed.
text: He pulls off the sheet.
text: Carries it to his desk by the window.
text: He does not notice Bee watching him.
text: She is crouched by the door, watching him with absolutely no
dialog: expression.
text: Cole exhales, throws open the curtains.
text: No Melanie in the other window yet.
text: He kneels and ties one end of the sheets to the desk leg.
text: Bee watches.
text: Cole finishes the knot. Tries it a few times.
text: Bee watches.
text: He stands up and throws the sheet out the window.
text: He peers out to see how far down it goes.
dialog: Not far enough but... it can work.
text: He shakes out his hands, trying to psych himself up.
dialog: 44,
text: And that’s when he starts to get a little light headed.
text: He blinks rapidly-
text: Reaches out for the desk-
dialog: Misses-
text: Falls to the floor-
text: Out cold.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - 14 MINUTES LATER
text: Cole wakes up.
dialog: The situation is... well... totally fucked.
text: He quickly discovers that he’s tied to a chair. His hands in
text: rope behind his back.
text: The gang of high-schoolers all watch him.
dialog: Including Bee.
text: But Cole’s mostly focused on MAX.
text: Because Max is pacing back and forth, stretching his arms in
text: front of him.
dialog: Shirtless.
text: So Cole asks the obvious.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Why is he shirtless?
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: That's your first question?
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: How can you even ask that? Look at
dialog: him!
text: Max stretches out his arms so Cole can look at his chiseled
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I still don’t get it-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Give him a cookie.
text: Cole looks at Bee. Her eyes burn into him.
text: But he holds her gaze.
text: Sonya walks towards him with some cookies. She holds
text: front of his mouth.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: ...-No, thank you.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Eat the cookie.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You eat the cookie.
text: Sonya replies by taking a big bite out of the cookie.
text: Chewing.
text: Swallowing.
dialog: 45.
dialog: it in
text: She opens her mouth in front of his face so he can see that
dialog: she really did swallow.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Now eat it.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: .--I just... don’t really like
dialog: cookies. Bee knows that.
text: Everyone looks at Bee.
text: She sighs. He’s right. But.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You'll feel better if you eat the
dialog: cookie.
text: Cole doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You fainted, Cole.
text: Some of the group laugh. Cole tries his best to not let on
text: that the cool kids laughing at him hurts his feelings.
dialog: His best is not good enough.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No I didn’t.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yes, you did. I know this because
dialog: after I took four vials of blood
dialog: from you, I waited in the room
dialog: because something felt... off. I
text: crouched by the door, and a few
dialog: seconds later, you got up, tied a
text: sheet to the desk, threw the sheet
text: out the window... And fainted. So.
dialog: Your blood sugar is low, eat the
dialog: cookie. Please.
text: She says all of this fairly monotonously.
dialog: But Cole can’t help feel like-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are you mad at me?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Cook. Key.
text: Cole reluctantly looks at Sonya.
text: And opens his mouth.
text: She lacklusterly shoves it in there.
text: And walks back to the others.
text: Max keeps pacing.
text: Cole keeps chewing.
text: He swallows.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I probably... can’t ask for a
dialog: drink, right?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Why are you awake, Cole.
text: His eyes go back to Bee.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Mhmm?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mhmm.
text: Cole fidgets nervously in the chair.
text: His fingers reaching for his back pocket...
scene_heading: POCKET KNIFE, BITCHES!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I don’t believe you.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well... I don’t believe this. So.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Touché.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Wanna try again?
text: HE OPENS THE KNIFE, BITCHES!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Okay, okay, fine. I was gonna go...
dialog: I was gonna go smoke in the woods.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You were gonna go smoke in the
dialog: woods.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah. Like, ya know. Marijuana.
text: Bee raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You smoke pot?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah. Of course.
text: The group silently stare at him.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, jeeze, it was gonna be my
dialog: first time smoking pot.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Why didn’t you drink the Baileys?
dialog: 48.
text: HE STARTS CUTTING THEM ROPES, BITCHES!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Why is he shirtless?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Cole.
text: Again, it’s almost painful for Cole to look her way.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Why’d you take my blood?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Why are you still lying to me?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Why am I tied up?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Why didn’t you drink the Baileys?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don’t like Baileys I only drink
dialog: it because I wanted you to think I
dialog: was cool, so, I don’t know, why do
dialog: you give a twelve year old alcohol?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Because I put shit in that alcohol
dialog: that should make them konk out for
dialog: a solid eight hours, what else did
dialog: you see?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I just see you! And these assholes,
dialog: who I don’t know, in my house!
text: Cole looks at them. At blood-stained John.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why is that dude covered in blood!
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
text: BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD LET ME BORROW
text: A SHIRT.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: THAT’S NOT EVEN AN ANSWER!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Does he not realize there's a
dialog: mirror behind him?
dialog: 49,
text: Cole freezes and realizes:
text: Everyone can see him trying to cut the ropes because of the
text: decorative mirror on the living room wall behind him.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Well, he does now.
dialog: Cole doesn’t know what to do...
text: So he gives them the finger.
dialog: And keeps cutting.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Why are you cutting the ropes?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Because I don’t like being tied up?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Why do you have a pocket knife?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It was a gift.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don’t know anything!
text: Bee looks at Max.
text: He smiles.
text: Steps towards Cole.
text: Cole starts cutting the rope faster.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: I love that he’s still cutting the
dialog: rope.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You're not... you’re not gonna hit
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: How do you explain that to a kid’s
dialog: parents, huh?
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Dude, how do we explain any of this
dialog: to your parents?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I won’t say anything! You know me!
dialog: I’m really good with secrets. I
dialog: won't tell my parents that you were
dialog: having an orgy and needed my blood
dialog: to do it.
text: The whole group burst out laughing. Even Bee can’t help but
dialog: smile.
dialog: This really hurts Cole.
dialog: The group
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Do you even know what an orgy is?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’m guessing it’s something sad
dialog: people do because they want other
dialog: sad people to like them and they
dialog: can forget for a few minutes how
dialog: sad they are in general.
dialog: don’t respond at first.
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: That's... actually a solid answer.
text: They look to Bee.
dialog: Bee looks
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: It was for a science project, okay?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The orgy?
speaker_heading: BEE
text: The blood. An orgy is when a bunch
dialog: of people all have sex together. We
dialog: probably wouldn’t need your blood
dialog: for that.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You coulda just asked.
text: at him.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I woulda let you have some blood
dialog: for science.
dialog: 51.
text: Bee smiles. Kinda moved by this.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I knew you were scared of needles.
text: And that’s when the familiar lights of a COP CAR illuminate
text: through the curtains outside.
text: Everyone looks towards them.
dialog: Including Cole.
text: Who starts cutting way faster.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Cole. Why is there a cop car
dialog: outside?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I... I don’t know-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Did you call them?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No! You said you were in the room!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Which makes me think you were awake
dialog: before then. Which makes me think
dialog: you saw something that scared you
dialog: enough to call the cops. Right?
text: Cole stares at her.
text: And she is angry.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Right! Answer me!
text: He flinches when she raises her voice at him.
text: Stares at her with his broken, twelve year old heart-
text: His watery eyes blink.
text: And he becomes a fucking ANGRY twelve year old.
text: He scrunches up his face and screams.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: HELP! HELP! I’M TIED UP INSIDE!
text: The room freaks out as-
dialog: 52.
text: The cops begin banging on the door.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
text: THERE ARE FIVE HIGH SCHOOLERS AND
text: THEY ARE PROBABLY ARMED! THEIR
speaker_heading: NAMES ARE BEE-
text: Max KICKS Cole in the chest-
text: His chair goes backwards and-
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: OOF!
text: BREAKS.
text: Cole remains on the floor, out of the way as-
text: Two cops KICK OPEN THE DOOR-
dialog: Guns raised as-
text: JOHN THE BAPTIST THROWS A FIRE POKER AT A COP-
text: It strikes him dead in the face, throwing him back out the
dialog: door-
text: His gun FIRES-—
text: Hitting ALLISON.
speaker_heading: LIVING COP
scene_heading: HOLY SHIT-
text: When Bee steps up from behind the cop and calmly-
text: Cuts his throat.
text: And he drops to the ground.
dialog: Dead.
speaker_heading: OBVIOUSLY.
text: Cole watches in terror from the floor.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: OH MY GOD! YOU KILLED THEM!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Your fault, bro.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: WHAT?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
text: Allison starts SOBBING.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: He... he shot me... in the boob!
text: The group all sprint over to their friend.
dialog: 53.
text: Cole watches, slowly getting his hands free of the ropes as-—
speaker_heading: ALLISON (CONT'D)
dialog: They weren't even finished growing.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Aw hunny, they were totally
dialog: finished.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It really hurts! Ahh!
speaker_heading: JOHN THE BAPTIST
dialog: Should we call an ambulance?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: NO?! MY BOOB!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Your boob was shot by a now dead
dialog: cop. Have fun explaining that.
text: They have, for the moment, forgotten about Cole.
dialog: So this is his moment.
text: They are huddled around Allison to his left.
text: The stairs to his right.
text: He eyes the front door beside them.
text: The crumpled bodies of the two cops blocking it.
text: So the stairs seem like the only option.
text: All their backs turned to him, as they argue how to best
text: extract a bullet from a breast.
dialog: So Cole GOES FOR IT.
dialog: SLOW MOTION, BITCHES!
text: As Cole launches himself from the ground-
dialog: For the stairs-
text: It takes the group a minute to realize as he-
text: Leaps over the dead cops-—
text: Crashing onto the stairs.
dialog: The group freak out-
dialog: John’s first off the mark-
dialog: Sprinting to catch up-
text: But Cole is already scrambling up the stairs.
text: He spots John coming after him.
dialog: Closing-
dialog: Knows he can’t make it too far before he’s caught-—
text: Cole reaches the tops of the stairs-—
dialog: Turns right and-
dialog: Stops—
dialog: Turns-—
text: John’s almost at the top of the steps when-
scene_heading: COLE SCREAMS-—
speaker_heading: CHARGES—
speaker_heading: HANDS OUT-
speaker_heading: HEAD DOWN-
scene_heading: AND PUSHES JOHN THE BAPTIST-—
text: RIGHT THE FUCK OVER THE BANNISTER.
text: Everyone downstairs looks up.
text: Cole looks down.
text: John The Baptist flails in the air and-
dialog: 54.
text: SMACKS INTO THE WOODEN FLOOR.
text: He does not move again.
text: Everyone is still for a moment-
text: Until they look away from John-
dialog: And up to Cole.
text: He looks straight at Bee.
text: She looks straight at Cole.
dialog: And she is not happy.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Get him.
text: Cole glares at her-
text: And sprints away.
text: He hears the others give chase-
text: But doesn’t have time to stop.
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Cole runs into his room-
text: Throws the door closed and locks it.
text: Kicks and pushes anything he can in front of it and-
text: Goes to the desk.
text: The sheet still out the window.
dialog: 55.
text: Cole grabs hold of the sheet and gets on top of the desk.
text: He takes a deep breath and-
text: Goes out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. COLE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: He begins scaling down the house when he hears others break
text: into his room.
dialog: He knows he’s gotta go quick.
dialog: 56.
dialog: He starts moving faster as-
text: The sheet is PULLED UP SUDDENLY.
dialog: The surprise jerks Cole-
text: He slips and slides down the sheet-
speaker_heading: COLE
speaker_heading: AHHHH-
dialog: He grasps and-
text: GRABS THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET.
text: His weight brings the sheet back down hard and-
text: There’s a shout from upstairs as they lose hold.
text: He’s about six feet from the ground.
scene_heading: GOOD ENOUGH.
text: He lets go and tumbles to the ground.
text: The woods in the backyard.
text: He starts heading for them when-
text: He hears the back door swing open-
text: FUCK THAT.
text: He turns and runs back towards the front.
text: To the garage.
text: He grabs the handle and-
speaker_heading: IT’S OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Cole runs inside-
dialog: Smacks the garage door opener-
text: But instead of running outside he slides under his dad’s car.
text: He’s small, so he makes it under there before-
text: MAX explodes into the garage and-
text: Seeing the garage door almost fully opened-
dialog: Assumes Cole went that way and-
text: Runs out of the garage.
text: Cole remains motionless for a second before-
dialog: Quietly-
dialog: Slowly-
text: Crawling off the ground.
text: He gets to his feet and comes face to face with-
speaker_heading: SAMUEL.
text: Dead eyes and blood stained head.
text: Cole almost screams but stops himself.
text: He stares at this poor, nerdy kid.
text: It kills him.
text: He tears himself away and-
text: Surveys the garage quickly.
dialog: What is here that he can use.
text: He looks in cabinets and boxes for anything.
text: A large can of BUGSPRAY.
text: Squeezes that into his back pocket.
text: A LIGHTER.
text: He flicks it a few times to see if it works.
dialog: Eventually, a flame!
text: Pockets it.
text: An old BLANKET.
text: Wraps it around his shoulders.
text: His Dad’s POWERDRILL.
text: Wields it heroically.
dialog: 58.
text: And finally, he sees something that makes the twelve year old
dialog: very, very excited because of how very, very wrong this is.
text: An OLD FIREWORK.
text: He digs it out of a box carefully.
text: Holds it like a precious Indiana Jones artefact.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hell yeah.
text: In giant block letters, and with a chorus of angels singing
text: the words, the words slam on the screen.
speaker_heading: HELL
speaker_heading: YEAH
text: SHIT SOMEONE’S COMING.
text: No time to celebrate finding a firework.
text: Cole’s plan is hatched and-
text: He runs back outside the garage.
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
text: Cole slides down the back yard to the CRAWL SPACE where-
text: He quickly unscrews the first screw-
dialog: The second-
text: He hears someone coming-—
dialog: The third-
dialog: Almost there-
dialog: The fourth-
dialog: He drops the screw!
dialog: No time to search in the dark-
dialog: 59.
text: He pulls the gate off and drags it and the old blanket-
scene_heading: INT. THE CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
text: INSIDE with him.
text: He shines his iphone light carefully so he avoids the MOUSE
text: TRAPS his mother set earlier.
text: He makes his way deeper inside while-
text: He hears someone outside the crawl space.
text: He reaches the back wall and quickly covers himself with the
dialog: blanket...
dialog: And waits as-
text: SONYA peers inside.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: Are you shitting me with this tomb
dialog: raider crap?
speaker_heading: MAX (0.S.)
dialog: Dibs on the forest! Have fun, baby
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: I hope you get impaled. And
dialog: disemboweled. I hope both.
text: Max laughs off screen, as Sonya begins crawling her way
text: inside the crawl space.
speaker_heading: SONYA (CONT’D)
dialog: You better not be in here, Cole. My
dialog: manicure cost twenty bucks.
text: But Cole does not answer. Instead, he waits.
text: He watches through the thin blanket. Laying low to the ground
dialog: when-
text: A dark shadow passes over the blanket and as he focuses on it
dialog: he realizes...
dialog: It’s a really, really big SPIDER.
text: He freezes. This complicates things as Sonya crawls closer
dialog: and closer.
text: It crawls down over his blanketed face slowly.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: S-1l-o-w-l-y-
text: Cole doesn’t breathe as Sonya gets closer.
dialog: And closer.
text: When she flashes her iPhone light towards him-
text: All she sees is a big-ass spider crawling over an old
dialog: blanket.
text: She shivers.
speaker_heading: SONYA (CONT’D)
dialog: This is such bullshit.
text: She begins to try and turn herself around and-
text: Trembling, Cole reaches back and-
text: Pulls out the FIREWORK.
text: He quietly pokes it out from underneath the blanket-
text: Aiming it directly at her.
text: The spider keeps crawling down the blanket-
text: And then onto the firework.
text: Cole regards this with twelve year old fascination.
text: As he pulls out the lighter.
dialog: Takes a deep breath and-
dialog: Flick. Flick. Flick.
speaker_heading: SPARK.
text: Sonya hears it.
text: Turns her head back and sees the tiny flame of the lighter.
dialog: Grins.
speaker_heading: SONYA (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are!
text: And the firework lights.
text: She doesn’t realize what she’s looking at until-
speaker_heading: IT FIRES.
dialog: 61.
text: SHOOTING STRAIGHT AT HER!
text: She shrieks as it BLASTS past her.
text: She goes down on her stomach, screaming as it ricochets with
text: a loud BOOM in the small crawl space.
text: Cole seizes her distraction to crawl as fast as he can out of
dialog: the crawl space.
text: As he passes Sonya-
text: She sees him-
text: Reaches out to grab his ankle when-
speaker_heading: SNAP!
speaker_heading: SONYA (CONT'D)
dialog: AIII!
text: Sonya lifts her hand, which has been caught in the mouse
dialog: trap!
text: Freaked out, she scrambles in pain and-
speaker_heading: SNAP!
text: She screams again as her other hand hits another mouse trap.
speaker_heading: SONYA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, YOU LITTLE
dialog: SHIT!
text: The firework comes to a stop as-
scene_heading: EXT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS
text: Cole quickly begins screwing the screws back on the fence.
dialog: One screw-
text: She's crawling towards him quickly-
text: Two screws-—
speaker_heading: SONYA
dialog: We're going to hang you upside down
dialog: and watch your blood leak out of
dialog: your eye sockets!
dialog: Three screws!
dialog: 62.
text: Cole searches the ground for the fourth as Sonya is almost
dialog: there-
dialog: HE FINDS IT!
dialog: Screws it in as-
dialog: BANG!
text: She begins hitting the fence! Pushing it! Breaking it!
dialog: He screws it all the way in and-
speaker_heading: SONYA (CONT'D)
dialog: And then we’re gonna-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Shut up.
text: He holds out the giant can of bug spray right at her face and-
speaker_heading: SPRAYS!
text: She screams and tries to get out of the blast-
dialog: Coughing harder and harder-
dialog: We hear more
speaker_heading: SNAP! SNAP!
dialog: Of mouse traps and her subsequent gasps as-
dialog: She can’t breathe-
text: Cole screams as he unloads the entire can into the crawl
dialog: space until-
text: Sonya is quiet. And there is no movement inside.
text: Triumphantly, Cole sits back, gathering his breath.
text: He almost smiles.
text: He stands up, only to reveal-
speaker_heading: MAX.
text: Standing a few yards behind him.
text: Cole slowly turns around and looks at the Quarterback.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Did you just lock Sonya under there
dialog: and spray an entire can of bug
dialog: poison in her face?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: .--No.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I mean. I’m not even mad. That’s
dialog: just so messed up. What was the
dialog: loud banging sound?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: -..a firework.
text: Max bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Oh shit! Oh shit! That’s horrible!
text: And then he pulls the knife out of the back of his pants.
dialog: (BTW, still shirtless.)
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: So, you want like, a head start?
text: Cole’s shoulders slump.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: C’mon man, you’re the quarterback.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Life’s not fair, dude.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You guys suck!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You just Auschwitzed our friend!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What does that mean!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Like, the gas chambers, from World
dialog: War 2? Haven’t they taught you that
dialog: shit ye-
text: Cole CHUCKS THE BUG SPRAY at Max’s face-
text: Clocking him dead in the forehead.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Son of a bitch!
text: And by the time he’s done rubbing his head-
text: Cole has already started sprinting towards the trees.
text: Max grins and gives chase as if his college football career
dialog: depended on it.
text: It takes him barely three seconds to catch up to the twelve
dialog: year old.
dialog: Cole knows he won’t make it-
text: He sees the trees coming-
text: Hears Max right behind him-
text: And when Max stretches out his free hand to grab Cole-
text: Cole DROPS like a bag of rocks.
text: Wrapping his head in his arms and hitting the ground so-
text: Max TRIPS over his body hard-
scene_heading: FLYING FORWARD-
dialog: Sending Cole tumbling as Max-
text: HITS A TREE TRUNK FACE FIRST.
text: Cole stumbles to his feet and watches Max slide grossly down
dialog: the tree with his face-
text: Until he finally rolls over-
dialog: Revealing all the ways Max will never be photogenic ever
dialog: again.
text: Max groans lightly, missing teeth and swollen eyes and a
dialog: smashed nose as-—
text: Cole quietly picks up the knife.
text: He stands over the quarterback, victorious.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Of course I know what Auschwitz
dialog: was! I’m not retarded, you pussy!
dialog: Your joke was in poor taste!
text: He angrily KICKS Max in the dick. Max groans.
text: Cole waits a moment and then just because tonight is
dialog: horseshit-
text: Kicks him in the dick again.
text: And that’s when a BULLET rips out bark from the tree
dialog: Cole.
text: Cole drops to the ground.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: OH SHIT!
text: He looks towards the house but-
dialog: Can’t see anyone.
text: He whines to himself.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are there gunssss-—
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: COLE!
text: Cole looks up and sees-—
speaker_heading: MELANIE!
text: At her back door, waving him over.
text: Cole waits for a moment-
dialog: Looking at his house-
text: Before he starts crawling soldier-style to her when-
text: ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT.
speaker_heading: COLE
speaker_heading: GAH!
text: He gets to his feet and full on runs to Melanie-
text: Diving through the door-
text: Landing ON TOP OF HER.
text: He kicks the door closed with his foot.
text: Melanie looks up at him.
text: Cole looks down at her.
dialog: 65.
dialog: such
dialog: beside
dialog: 66.
text: Embarrassment ensues.
text: He roles off and catches his breath.
dialog: (I’m so sorry for that line).
dialog: Everything they say is a WHISPER.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: WHAT IS GOING ON.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I got the white boy, the shirtless
dialog: guy and the asian girl. I don’t
dialog: know their names. The glasses girl
dialog: got shot in the boob. So I think
dialog: it’s just Bee-
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: WHAT?! IS?! GOING?! ON?!
text: He looks at her. Realizes she didn’t see what he saw.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: High school kids are bad. Murdered
dialog: the geek. Took my blood. Tied me
dialog: up. Killed the cops-
dialog: He remembers.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: The cops!
text: He gets to his knees and runs to their front window.
text: All he sees is Melanie’s Dumb Dad’s Dumb SUV in their
dialog: driveway.
text: But he can see enough to tell that the cop car is NO LONGER
text: in his driveway.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Cole!
text: Cole turns and sees Melanie behind him. Shaking.
speaker_heading: MELANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're really freaking me out.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm... I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Bee is bad?
dialog: Cole thinks on this.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah. Bee is bad.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: And... we... we can’t call the
dialog: cops?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I did that. And now they’re dead.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Should I get my dad?
text: Cole sighs.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Melanie, no offense,
dialog: is kind of a prick.
text: Melanie can’t help but agree.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: That's true. I just..
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Pray?
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I was kidding.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: but your dad
dialog: - what do we
dialog: But it’s probably a great idea-
speaker_heading: MELANIE
text: When Cole sees a SHADOW come over the window.
text: Cole grabs Melanie and pushes her down to the ground.
dialog: We keep getting on the floor
dialog: together-
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: COLE
speaker_heading: SHH!
text: Cole waits.
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: Until-
text: The front door knob turns.
text: Locked.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
speaker_heading: OH MY GOD.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Come on!
text: Cole grabs her hand-
dialog: IT’S A MOMENT!
text: And leads her back to the kitchen where they-
text: Hide behind the island.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Do you think she can get in here?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Not if it’s locked-
text: The door creaks open behind them.
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: (silent, subtitled)
dialog: We shoulda prayed.
text: Cole nods.
dialog: They wait.
text: They hear very soft footsteps.
text: One after the other.
text: Coming deeper into Melanie’s home.
dialog: They wait.
text: Pressed against the island.
text: Melanie looks to Cole for guidance.
text: AND HE STEPS UP TO THE TASK.
text: As the steps come closer on their left-
text: Cole leads Melanie silently around the island-
dialog: 69.
text: Timed so when the intruder rounds the island, they are on the
dialog: side.
text: Cole slowly, slowly, slowly peaks and-
dialog: He can’t tell who it is-
text: Because they’re walking towards them OH SHIT-
text: Cole scrambles as quietly as he can, pushing Melanie the
dialog: other direction.
text: She crawls and he waits there, ready to spring and fight
dialog: do something really stupid when-
text: The legs beside him stop-
text: Cole holds his breath-
text: For what seems like forever.
dialog: Until the figure turns-
dialog: And goes back the way it came.
text: Cole quickly grabs Melanie and-
dialog: or
text: They round the island until they are back where they started
dialog: as-
text: The figure walks down a hallway to investigate the rooms
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well. We’re back.
text: Melanie nods.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Now what?
text: Cole looks out the back door.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I shouldn’t have gotten you into
dialog: this.
dialog: down,
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: You were being shot at!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Especially because I was being shot
dialog: at. You're my best friend, and I’m
dialog: sorry. I’m gonna take care of this.
text: He moves to go out the back door, but Melanie holds him back.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Are you crazy?!
text: Cole looks at her simply.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’ve had a really bad night.
text: Suddenly, Melanie grabs his neck and KISSES HIM on the lips.
scene_heading: REALLY GODDAMN HARD.
text: Cole keeps his eyes open the whole time.
text: When the kiss ends, Cole tells her the truth.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: The last boy I saw get kissed got
text: stabbed in the head. By two knives.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Just because she’s a psychopath
dialog: doesn’t mean women are evil.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I know that.
text: He turns to the door.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: It just means high school is gonna
dialog: suck ass.
text: He quietly opens it when-
text: He notices THE SUV KEYS sitting on the counter.
text: He looks back at Melanie and POCKETS THEM.
text: She nods, approving.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Make sure she can’t see you when
text: she comes back.
dialog: 71.
text: Melanie nods.
text: And then Cole kinda blushes.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m really excited we kissed.
text: Melanie beams.
speaker_heading: MELANIE
dialog: Let’s make out next time.
text: This might be the scariest part of Cole’s night.
text: He awkwardly nods and runs out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MELANIE’S HOUSE / COLE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: As he runs as fast as he can, he bangs on the side of
text: Melanie’s house.
speaker_heading: COLE
text: AHHHHHHH COME GET ME DICKHEADS
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHHH!
text: He gets back to the garage and-
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Enters the side door. Notices that Samuel is GONE.
text: Cole is disgusted.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Sick sons of bitches.
text: And heads slowly into the house-
scene_heading: INT. COLE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: The lights are all off as Cole enters the kitchen where-
dialog: On the table-
text: A very bizarre STONE SCULPTURE sits.
text: The size of a desktop computer.
text: It has TUNNELS looping every which way inside.
text: It doesn’t look Mayan or Egyptian or Satanic.
dialog: 72.
text: It just looks WEIRD.
text: Cole gets a closer look and sees that-
text: There are entry points in it.
text: Covered by strange SYMBOLS.
text: He touches them softly with his finger to confirm his
dialog: suspicions:
speaker_heading: BLOOD.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Ewwww.
text: He wipes it off on his jeans and notices-
scene_heading: THAT LEATHER JOURNAL.
text: Up close. Old as hell.
text: He turns the pages and-
dialog: Those same damn symbols again.
dialog: No English.
text: Illustrations of the SCULPTURE.
dialog: A manual.
dialog: But what it does is anyone’s guess.
text: Not giving a shit that it’s crazy old, he rolls it up and
text: shoves it in the back of his pants-—
text: A HAND GRABS COLE’S LEG FROM UNDER THE TABLE!
text: It pulls Cole down and he goes crashing to the floor where-
scene_heading: ALLISON AWAITS.
dialog: She looks as terrible as you think a girl that got shot in
dialog: the boob would look.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: C’mere you little shit-
speaker_heading: COLE
speaker_heading: AHHHH!
text: She crawls on top of him, hitting him with both hands-
dialog: 73.
text: He covers his face from the blows-
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE
speaker_heading: DONE! ?
text: Cole looks up at her through his guard-
text: Sees her blood stained top and-
text: Begins PUNCHING HER BOOB OVER AND OVER.
text: She shrieks in agony and falls backwards as Cole scrambles
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (CONT'D)
dialog: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! You’re so
dialog: gross, you pervert!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What?! Screw you! You can’t make me
dialog: feel bad that I defended myself!
text: Allison holds her boob and starts to cry.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I feel so abused. You molested me!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: ..-WHAT?! YOU WERE TRYING TO KILL
dialog: ME!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I WASN'T TRYING TO KILL YOU BY
dialog: TOUCHING YOUR DICK!
speaker_heading: COLE
text: THIS IS THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: BUT I AM GOING TO KILL YOU.
text: She starts pushing away the chairs she was hiding under-
text: Giving Cole just enough time to dive into the kitchen
dialog: cabinets.
text: He throws porcelain wedding gift plates at her-
dialog: Crystal wedding gift wine glasses-
dialog: Everything.
dialog: But she really doesn’t give a shit anymore.
dialog: 74.
text: He dives into the kitchen drawers and pulls out-
dialog: Not a knife but-
text: A long candle lighter.
text: He flicks it on and the flame is disappointingly small.
text: Allison rises to her feet-
text: Clutching the shard of a plate and-
text: Begins walking towards him.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (CONT'D)
dialog: You think fire scares me? My breast
dialog: is ruined. My life is basically
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That’s a really shallow way of
dialog: looking at the world!
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I mean, you’re still super hot! And
dialog: like, what are you majoring in when
dialog: you get to college?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: ...Journalism.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: And smart! So it’s like, you’re
dialog: hot, you’re smart, obviously you're
dialog: driven, I don’t know, I could be
dialog: wrong, but I think you won’t have a
dialog: hard time having a cool life.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Wow, you really think so?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Totally! I-
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I DON’T CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
dialog: SAYING, YOU IDIOT.
text: She rushes towards him with the shard and-
dialog: 75.
text: Cole closes his eyes and-
speaker_heading: BAM.
dialog: Allison SLAMS into
scene_heading: SHE’S BEEN SHOT IN
text: Her body slumps to
text: Staring at BEE.
text: Bee tosses the gun
text: the kitchen cabinets violently as-
text: THE HEAD.
text: the floor, as Cole slowly looks up-
text: on the table and sighs.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: She was so annoying. She never ever
dialog: did anything to help. She probably
text: has a secret tumblr all about it.
dialog: You know what it is? She was the
dialog: kinda girl that still listens to
text: Smashing Pumpkins.
text: She smirks at Cole.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: So tonight, huh.
text: Cole leans his head back against the cabinets.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I want to throw up.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You and me both. Now I have to move
dialog: and shit. Do the whole “new girl at
dialog: high school” for the hundredth
dialog: time. You've really done a number
dialog: on us.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well. You shot her.
speaker_heading: BEE
text: Her boob was ruined. She wanted to
dialog: die. Sonya?
speaker_heading: COLE
text: Crawlspace.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Max?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Woods. Samuel's body?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: BEE
text: Ditched it with the cop car.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: When?!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: It’s like, 5am bro. We’ve been
dialog: doing this dance of ours for about
dialog: six hours.
text: Cole can’t believe this. He looks at the clock and what she
dialog: says is somehow true.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Holy crap. I thought it was all
text: continuous and in real time.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: That’s just the adrenaline.
text: An awkward pause.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Yeah. So. This is the part I’m not
dialog: really excited about.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are you gonna shoot me?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: No! I was only shooting around you
dialog: because I was hoping you’d just put
dialog: your hands up and shit.
text: She sighs.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Plus I’m out of bullets.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hooray.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: But, I mean, two cops are dead.
text: She nods to Allison.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Couple high schoolers. I gotta skip
dialog: town. And that leaves you, and what
dialog: to do with you. Any suggestions?
text: Cole is silent.
dialog: Then-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What is that thing anyway?
text: Bee looks at the weird stone sculpture-
dialog: And instantly notices-
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Where is the-
text: She turns back to Cole-
text: To find him holding the book.
dialog: So old.
dialog: So weathered.
dialog: So dry.
text: And in his other hand, he still holds the CANDLE LIGHTER.
text: Its flame ready and hungry.
text: Bee loses her breath.
dialog: She looks
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Cole, listen to me.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Cole, listen to me-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: NO, BEE! YOU LISTEN TO ME!
text: at him, hands raised, surprised at his outburst.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I have been hunted for I guess six
dialog: hours now! You’ve stolen my blood,
dialog: killed people, shot at me and just
dialog: been general assholes all night!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: So I wanna know what the hell is
dialog: going on!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Cole. Seriously. You’re too young
dialog: to understand. Trust me.
text: Cole stares at her blankly for a moment.
dialog: Before saying:
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: FUCK YOU!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Cole!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No! You deserved that! What, just
dialog: because I’m twelve means I get to
dialog: be treated like shit by you, and
dialog: Jeremy and everyone else? You know
dialog: what you are? You’re... you’re Don
dialog: Draper! How he’s all cool and
dialog: handsome and everyone loves him and
dialog: then he goes home and you find out
dialog: he has a wife the whole time! He’s
dialog: such a piece of shit! How do people
dialog: even like that show?!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Dude, I am so confused-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It’s from MAD MEN!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: «+-Did you just spoil MAD MEN for
dialog: me?!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It’s the first episode! You’1l
dialog: live!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: That’s so douchey!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Really!?!
text: Bee exhales.
dialog: She
dialog: And
dialog: She
dialog: Bee
dialog: And
dialog: She
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I guess, fine, in the grand scheme
dialog: of things tonight, it’s not the
dialog: douchiest.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What happens when you leave here?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: takes a step forward-
text: he swings the fire closer to the journal.
text: backs up obediently.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay! Okay!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’m not the first kid, am I.
text: watches him.
dialog: is honest.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: And you'll leave here and just...
text: find another faucet.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You heard that?
speaker_heading: COLE
text: I HEARD EVERYTHING THIS IS MY
dialog: HOUSE! !
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Okay! Okay! Yes! Probably! But I
dialog: can teach you!
text: stretches her hands out to him.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You're the best, man, and I've
dialog: been... I’ve been bad, to you. But
dialog: what I do, and what I believe, it’s
dialog: powerful shit. It’s holy. I used to
dialog: feel so scared and so small until
dialog: this-
dialog: 80.
text: She points to the sculpture.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: And now I’m strong and I’m
dialog: confident. And when I leave town,
dialog: what if, okay, what if you came
dialog: with me. As my apprentice. And I'1l
dialog: teach you everything I know. I’11l
dialog: teach you how to read that. I’1l be
dialog: Lady Exposition and you’1l become
dialog: so strong. Okay? Yeah? No one could
dialog: ever hurt you again. There would be
dialog: nothing left to be afraid of. Isn't
dialog: that what you want? Plus, dude,
dialog: we'd have fun. And all for a great
dialog: cause!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: So... you have a mission.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: What? Yeah, kinda.
text: He thinks about it.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: What do you say, dude.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I guess...
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess I have a mission too.
text: And he SETS THE BOOK ON FIRE.
text: It goes up like a match.
speaker_heading: BEE
speaker_heading: NooOO!
text: Cole tosses it into the living room-
dialog: Bee runs for it and-
text: Cole runs out the back door.
scene_heading: EXT. COLE’S HOME - NIGHT
scene_heading: SLOW MOTION AGAIN, BITCHES!
dialog: 81.
dialog: Strong, powerful and brave as fuck-
text: Cole Johnson runs around his house-
text: Towards the front yard-
dialog: And when he gets there-
text: He doesn’t go back into his house.
text: He pulls out the keys to Melanie’s Dumb Dad’s Dumb SUV.
text: AND UNLOCKS THAT SHIT.
text: Gets inside.
text: And slams that fucker closed.
scene_heading: INT. MELANIE’S DUMB DAD’S DUMB SUV - NIGHT
text: With the head lights off, Cole slowly reverses out of the
dialog: drive way-
text: Straight back up the street.
text: He does his best to angle the front of the car so it’s
text: directly facing his house.
text: He sees Bee inside.
text: Putting out the blazing book desperately.
text: Cole closes his eyes-
dialog: Takes a deep breath-
text: And does his best to not let on how fucking terrified he is.
text: HIS BEST IS MORE THAN GOOD ENOUGH.
text: He opens his eyes: CLEAR EYES.
text: He exhales: FULL HEARTS.
text: He grips the wheel: CAN’T LOSE.
text: He SLAMS his foot on the gas.
text: SCREAMS as the car surges towards the house as-—
text: Bee looks up.
text: Sees the car flying towards her.
dialog: 82.
text: Sighs.
text: The car SMASHES through the front of the house in a storm of
text: glass and rubble.
text: The airbag HITS Cole full on as-
text: Bee goes flying as the SUV tears through the room-
text: Before coming to a stop.
text: Debris falls from the ceiling as-
text: Cole coughs. His whole body hurts.
text: He pushes the airbag away and tries to look out the window-
dialog: It’s hard to see anything.
text: Gingerly, he opens the door and falls out of the SUV.
scene_heading: INT. THE RUINED ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Cole stumbles with unsure footing through the rubble, looking
dialog: for Bee, until-
speaker_heading: BEE (0.S.)
dialog: What up, Cee.
text: Cole looks down and sees Bee, covered in rubble.
text: He hesitantly walks over to her as she weakly pushes shit off
dialog: of her.
text: She looks like, well, like she got hit by a car.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What up, Bee.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You drove a car into your house. I
dialog: really didn’t see that coming.
text: She coughs disgustingly. Lays back flat.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: I think you broke my ribs.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: It’s okay. It happens.
dialog: 83.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You never told me your
dialog: intergalactic dream team.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You didn’t ask.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I should have. I’m usually pretty
dialog: good about that stuff.
text: Cole leans exhausted against the wall.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Admiral Adama to lead it. Data for
dialog: his intelligence and cool head.
dialog: Predator to fight.
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: Then me and you.
text: Bee smiles.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: You didn’t say we could add
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It’s science fiction. You can do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I guess that’s true. But don’t you
dialog: get it yet?
text: He looks down at her.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You bring me on your trip because
dialog: I'm beautiful, and I listen to you,
dialog: and I make you think you’re a
text: unique snowflake and an adult and
dialog: we get to the big bad’s lair, and
dialog: suddenly you’re confused because no
dialog: one’s there. “Where is he?” you ask
text: me, turning around to see me
dialog: smiling at you. Here I am Cole. The
dialog: big bad that you brought along for
dialog: the ride and that your parents paid
dialog: to be your friend.
dialog: Cole processes this.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I loved you.
text: For a split second, it seems to affect Bee. But then it
text: vanishes.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I don’t care.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah, I think you do.
text: Sirens can be heard coming in the distance.
speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t care about your dumb book
dialog: or your creepy statue or your dead
dialog: languages. I am an adult. Because
dialog: when I realized you were the big
dialog: bad and betrayed me and were just
dialog: going to hurt other nice kids like
dialog: Samuel and Melanie, I drove a
dialog: stolen SUV through you.
text: Bee laughs. Coughs again hard.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: That... that I’1l give you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: See ya, Cee.
text: Cole looks at her sadly.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Goodbye.
text: And does not reply as he has millions of times before.
text: The cops pull up to the house and Cole slowly walks outside.
scene_heading: EXT. COLE’S HOME - NIGHT
text: It’s a strange sight, an SUV smashed through the front of a
text: suburban home, cops and ambulances rushing to the scene-
text: And a twelve year old boy who’s survived a war walking calmly
text: outside to greet them.
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: Cole is sitting on the front yard, facing the destroyed
text: house, an insulation blanket wrapped around his shoulders.
dialog: 85.
text: Melanie’s Dad is losing his unholy shit in the background to
dialog: the cops.
text: Melanie stares at Cole’s house like it’s the most amazing
dialog: painting she’s ever seen.
text: One by one, stretchers carry out the high-schoolers. Max. And
dialog: Allison. And Sonya. And John the Baptist.
text: A fireman approaches him.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: You said there was another young
dialog: woman in the house too?
text: Cole nods.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We didn’t find anyone, kid-
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: My name is Cole.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: Cole. Sorry. Are you sure there was
dialog: someone else in there?
text: Cole stares straight ahead at the place.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: There was when I drove into it.
text: The fireman doesn’t really know how to react to that as-
text: A car comes flying down the street-
scene_heading: COLE’S PARENTS.
text: They park and rush out of the car, astonished at their house,
text: desperate to find Cole.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: COLE! COLE!
text: Dad goes straight to the cops, who point to his son, sitting
text: alone in the front yard.
text: Mom and Dad approach Cole quickly. Mom grabs Dad’s hand,
text: united in this moment.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Coley?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Son?
text: Cole turns around, like it’s no big deal.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don’t need a sitter anymore.
dialog: 86.
text: And with that said, he turns back and faces the house he
text: destroyed and the night he defeated.
text: And he fucking smiles.
speaker_heading: THE END.
text: And now, the opening scene from THE BABYSITTER 2.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. THE CLOSET - NIGHT
text: It is totally dark.
dialog: And totally quiet.
text: Totally, that is, except for the soft breathing.
dialog: As your eyes get used to the darkness, you realize you are
dialog: not alone here.
text: A little girl, TAMMY (10), is hiding here.
text: She does her best not to make a peep.
text: She peeks through the closet doors and-
text: Sees THE SHAPE OF SOMEONE searching the room.
text: Wielding a flashlight.
text: Tammy holds her breath.
text: As the person with the flashlight leaves the room.
text: She exhales just a little-
text: AND THE PERSON CHARGES BACK INTO THE ROOM-
scene_heading: FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES-
scene_heading: THE CLOSET IS PULLED OPEN AS-
scene_heading: TAMMY SCREAMS AND-
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING
text: A teapot whistles as-
text: MR. AND MRS. MORGAN return home from their night away.
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: Tammy-baby! We’re-
speaker_heading: MRS. MORGAN
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: OH MY GOD!!
text: She runs into the kitchen where-
text: Tammy is unconscious on a kitchen chair-
text: Tied up with a LOT of rope.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Uh-uh-uh.
dialog: Mrs. Morgan and her husband freeze and-
text: Slowly turn to see someone pouring themselves some tea.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’d get you some tea, but I’m
dialog: actually pretty pissed off with you
dialog: both. So...
text: She turns around and faces them, revealing, of course:
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: No tea for you.
scene_heading: FIVE MINUTES LATER.
text: Bee sits beside the still sleeping Tammy, while Mr. and Ms.
text: Morgan watch in terror.
text: Bee slowly drinks her tea.
text: Puts it back on her plate.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Naw, I’m just fucking with you, I
dialog: don’t drink tea.
text: They continue staring at her in terror.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I just liked the idea of you guys
text: walking home, a kettle going off,
dialog: your little Regan MacNeil tied to a
text: chair, and me drinking tea calmly.
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: ..-Like... Ronald Regan?
text: Bee nonchalantly THROWS THE TEA CUP ACROSS THE ROOM.
text: Where it shatters.
text: Mr. and Mrs. Morgan jump in their seats.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: But I am not calm, David and
dialog: Mallory, am I.
text: They shake their heads as if they were five years old.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m pretty far from calm. I am
text: light years away from calm. Because
dialog: I am so sick of this shit.
text: She points at them.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You had one job. We agreed to this.
dialog: In fact, what did I say when I
dialog: sought you out?
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Excuse me, David?
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: You said nothing.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Why did I say nothing.
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: Be...because we sought you out and
dialog: asked you to help.
text: Bee sits back in her chair, satisfied.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Ding ding ding! So you can imagine
dialog: how super annoying it is when, the
dialog: kid and I are hanging out, the kid
dialog: goes to bed, I go to do my thing
dialog: and-
text: She slams forward-
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You didn’t tell her to take the
dialog: pills I gave you.
speaker_heading: MRS. MORGAN
dialog: We did tell her!
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Well then you're a terrible parent,
dialog: because now here you are, here I
dialog: am, angry, and here is your
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 90.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Should I wake her up and be like,
dialog: mommy and daddy signed you up for
dialog: this so they could have happier
dialog: lives?
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MRS. MORGAN
dialog: Please!
text: Bee turns Tammy’s head so she’s facing her parents.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Mommy, why don't you love me enough
dialog: to not be completely happy just in
dialog: mothering me? Why did you need to
dialog: call this attractive, smart,
text: dangerous girl and beg her to help
dialog: you in ways I never could, because
dialog: I am a real Regan MacNeil?
text: Mrs. Morgan answers by staring at her lap and crying.
text: Bee sighs.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You'll tell her it was a nightmare.
dialog: You’1l tell her that she woke up
dialog: screaming and, me being the
dialog: concerned lady I am, called you and
dialog: you rushed home. You’1ll have her
dialog: write me a cute apology card, and
dialog: I’ll write her a cute one back.
dialog: I'll put twenty bucks in it for a
dialog: movie and popcorn, and you’1l take
dialog: her to something PG-13 so it’s
dialog: extra special. When she asks why I
dialog: don’t babysit her anymore, you'll
dialog: say I have a boyfriend and am too
dialog: busy getting laid to babysit. That
dialog: last part can be open to your own
dialog: creative license. The rest cannot.
text: Bee stands up.
text: The Morgans stand up.
text: Except for Tammy, because she is tied up and asleep and a
dialog: real Regan MacNeil.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: I think you’1ll agree that our deal
dialog: is off. No harm no foul, and be
dialog: thankful for that.
text: They nod, like rebuked five year olds.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Groovy. You can paypal me the money
dialog: you owe me for babysitting your
dialog: asswipe of a kid.
text: Bee walks up to them. They flinch.
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: She actually threw Beverly Cleary
dialog: books at me. What the shit, guys.
text: Bee stares Mr. and Mrs. Morgan down hard.
dialog: It’s terrifying.
text: And then she smiles like everything is super!
speaker_heading: BEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ciao!
text: And she walks chipper out of the house.
text: When she closes the door, Mrs. Morgan breaks out into a sob.
text: Mr. Morgan looks to the heavens in thanks.
text: And Tammy Morgan stirs awake, realizing she’s tied up.
speaker_heading: TAMMY
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: MR. MORGAN
dialog: YOU'RE HAVING A NIGHTMARE! CLOSE
dialog: YOUR EYES!
speaker_heading: TAMMY
speaker_heading: AHHH!
text: Tammy scrunches her eyes closed, praying for the nightmare to
dialog: end.
scene_heading: IT NEVER WILL.
